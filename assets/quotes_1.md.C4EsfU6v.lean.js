A cachepot (, ) is a French term for what is usually called in modern English a \\"planter\\" or for older examples a jardiniere, namely a decorative container or \\"overpot\\" for a plant and its flowerpot, for indoors use, usually with no drainage hole at the bottom, or sometimes with a matching saucer. It is intended to be more attractive than the terracotta (or today, plastic) flowerpot in which the plant grows, and to keep water off furniture surfaces.Cachepot article Another French term is jardinière; the distinction is that that is usually larger, and may sit on the floor, either indoors or outdoors. They are often rectangular, where a cachepot is typically round. A cachepot is meant to be displayed on a tabletop, mantel, or shelf indoors. In modern English the term is usually found in descriptions of pottery examples.  Origin  The word cachepot is French from the French verb ', meaning \\"to hide\\".Cachepot article Cachepots are vase-like containers to aesthetically hide a growing pot holding the plant itselfCachepot article to provide greenery indoors. Pair of 19th-century cachepots in Meissen porcelain. Design A cachepot is typically made of glass, ceramic, iron, tin or other impervious material, and is chosen based on its appearance. Cachepots can also be made of raw semi-porous materials such as clay or cement; the resultant \\"unfinished\\" look is well-suited for rustic, industrial, and other non- traditional interior decorating schemes. In such cases, it is not uncommon for the pot's surface to be stained or otherwise weatherized to give a more vintage appearance. Critically, however, the pot has no hole at its base for discharging excess water. This protects the underlying surface from developing damage or staining due to exposure to excess water, soil, and drips from the potplant. However, such a design presents a risk for the plant, whose roots can rot if left immersed in water. This means the cachepot should be drained after watering in situ or the potplant watered separately then replaced after being left to drain.

The Clinton gift was a custom-designed Tiffany silver cachepot given to many visiting heads of state.

Unraced as a two-year-old, Chanteur won the Prix Hocquart in 1945 and the Prix Jean Prat in 1946. He reached his peak as a five-year-old when he won six races including the Prix des Sablons in France and the Coronation Cup in Britain. He was also placed in many important races including the Grand Prix de Paris, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Prix Royal Oak, Prix du Cadran and Ascot Gold Cup. At the end of his racing career he was retired to stand as a breeding stallion in Britain, where he had considerable success as a sire of winners. Background Chanteur was a brown horse with a broad white blaze bred by François Dupré at the Haras d'Ouilly stud farm in Pont-d'Ouilly, Calvados. He was the most notable horse sired by Chateau Bouscaut, a French stallion whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club in 1930 and the Prix du Cadran a year later. Chanteur's dam La Diva was a half-sister to the Grand Critérium winner Pantalon. La Diva later produced La Divine, the dam of Tanerko, a colt who won two runnings of the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and sired the Derby winner Relko. Chanteur was trained at Chantilly by the Anglo-French trainer Harry Count. Chanteur was reportedly a horse with a strong character: he was the first horse awake at his stable and would \\"shout\\" loudly until he was fed. At exercise he refused to exert himself for an ordinarily-dressed stable lad, only showing interest when he was mounted by a jockey in racing silks. When racing in Britain, and later when standing there as a stallion the horse was known as \\"Chanteur II\\". Racing career =1945: three-year-old season= The Second World War led to there being little racing in France in the summer and autumn of 1944 and Chanteur did not run as a two-year-old. In the spring of 1945 he established himself as one of the leading French colts of his generation by winning the Prix de Fontainebleau and the Prix Hocquart at Longchamp Racecourse before running second to Mistral in the Prix Lupin. From then on Chanteur was campaigned in the highest class. He finished fourth in the Prix du Jockey Club, fourth to Ardan in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and second to Caracalla in the Grand Prix de Paris. In autumn he won the Prix Henry Delamarre before finishing third in both the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Prix Royal Oak. =1946: four-year-old season= Chanteur's only important win of 1946 came in May when he won the older horses' version of the Prix Jean Prat (the race now known as the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier) over 3,000 metres at Longchamp. In this race he defeated the outstanding six-year-old stayer Marsyas who had won the race for the last two years. He went on to finish second in the Prix des Sablons (Prix Ganay) over 2000 metres and third to Marsyas in the 4000 meter Prix du Cadran. In June 1946, Chanteur was part of an exceptionally strong team of French stayers sent to Royal Ascot. He proved too good for the British opposition in the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup, but finished second, two lengths behind his compatriot Caracalla. =1947: five-year-old season= Chanteur began his final season by showing good form over shorter distances, winning the Prix des Sablons and then moving down to 1500 metres to win the Prix Edmond Blanc. He was then sent to Britain where he won the £5,000 Winston Churchill Stakes at Ascot on 24 May and the £2,000 White Rose Stakes at Hurst Park four days later. At this point he was bought by the bookmaker William Hill, although he remained in training with Count in France. The price was reportedly £70,000, the biggest sum paid for a racehorse in Britain, with Hill explaining that he was buying the horse primarily for his stud potential. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June he recorded his most significant international success when he won the Coronation Cup, beating Marcel Boussac's Coaraze. At Ascot later that month, Chanteur started the 2/11 favourite for the £11,316 Ascot Gold Cup, but was beaten four lengths by the French-trained four-year- old Souverain in the most valuable ever run in Britain up to that time. Shortly after the race, Hill work that the horse would be retired from racing. Assessment The independent Timeform organisation assigned a rating of 135 to Chanteur in 1947 (the first year for which annual ratings were published), making him the equal of Souverain as the highest-rated older horse in Europe. Marsyas, who did not race in Britain that year, was not included in the ratings. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Chanteur the thirty- seventh best French-trained horse of the 20th century and the third-best horse foaled in 1942, behind Caracalla and Dante. Stud record Chanteur was retired from racing to stand at Hill's Sezincote Stud in Gloucestershire, England. He had his greatest success in his second season as a breeding stallion when he sired The Derby winner Pinza whose victories led to Chanteur becoming the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1953. His other notable progeny included the British classic winners Cantelo and Only for Life. Chanteur died at the Highclere Stud at Newmarket, Suffolk in 1962.

Millicode runs on top of the microcoded instructions and uses those instructions to implement more complex instructions visible to the user of the system. Implementation of millicode requires a special processor mode called millimode that provides its own set of registers, and possibly its own special instructions invisible to the user. IBM invented both the concept and the term millicode for the System/390 9672-G4 processor in 1997. The following are cited as advantages of millicode: * More complex instructions can easily be constructed from several millicode instructions. * Construction of a compatible line of computer models with different performance is simplified. * Millicode instructions can bypass CPU cache to improve performance. * Instructions can update multiple storage locations without concern for being interrupted. * Millicode can execute instructions at a higher privilege level without involving the operating system. * Millicode can provide a complex instruction as if it were a subroutine, making user code smaller. The \\"i370\\" code for the \\"Capitol\\" chipset used in some ES/9370 models was similar to millicode, in that it was written as a combination of System/370 instructions and code that had access to special hardware features.

They requested that the City of Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department operate the Historic Garment District Museum at its current Broadway location, which includes establishing new open hours for the public, developing programs and exhibitions, and managing the collection. They donated more than 300 Kansas City-made garments and accessories to the Kansas City Museum, adding to its existing collection of more than 20,000 items of historical clothing, textiles, and costumes. The Garment District Place Park, dedicated in 2010 by Parks and Recreation, is located across Broadway from the museum. The park has a fountain and a 22-foot \\"Needle\\" sculpture as tribute to the Garment District's legacy. Many of the buildings nearby the Historic Garment District Museum were built in the 1870s and are on the National Register of Historic Places.

The shelter's troubled relations with the surrounding community, including its long running legal battles with the City Hall and other organizations, have been covered extensively in local publications such as Atlanta Journal Constitution, Creative Loafing, and Atlanta Business Chronicle. There have also been in depth reports \\"Battle of Atlanta: Fight over a Downtown Homeless Shelter Strains Some Down-Home Ties\\", Terry Carter, \\"American Bar Association Journal\\", May 2011 in national media. History =Establishment= Coca-Cola heiress Ednabelle Wardlaw bought the building, which had been an automotive parts warehouse, in 1997 for $1.3 million and donated it to the Task Force.\\"Peachtree-Pine homeless shelter vows to stay put despite foreclosure\\", Scott Henry, Creative Loafing, May 13, 2010 The Task Force had been only an advocacy and referral agency for the homeless up to that point, but transitioned into providing direct care after acquiring the building.\\"Homeless Task Force chose to take on the community rather than seek common ground\\", Maria Saporta, October 31, 2011 According to the \\"Mission & History\\" section of its website, the Peachtree-Pine is the largest homeless facility in Southeast United States, and no one needing shelter is turned away. =Sources of Financial Support= The shelter's top benefactor and supporter has been William C. Wardlaw III, better known as B Wardlaw, who is the son of Ednabelle Wardlaw.\\"B Wardlaw defends Homeless Task Force; fears foreclosure\\", Maria Saporta, \\"Saporta Report\\", November 2009 A large Coca-Cola share holder and political activist, Wardlaw has chronicled his support of the Task Force in his memoirs \\"Coca-Cola Anarchist\\" and on his website. According to American Bar Association Journal, \\"Even in hard times, Wardlaw has continued subsistence funding of the shelter and pays salaries of $52,000 each to the Beatys (Anita Beaty and her husband Jim Beaty) through a charitable trust. Without his help, the shelter likely would have gone out of business long ago\\". Another major private donor of Peachtree-Pine has been Bob Cramer, a well-known Atlanta entrepreneur and CEO of several tech companies, who was the chairman of the board of the Task Force from 1986 until 2010.\\"Downtown shelter fights for survival\\", Bill Torpy, December 21, 2011 In 2010, Cramer penned a letter to the Atlanta Business Chronicle in defense of the shelter and called on the business community to \\"call off the dogs\\".\\"Task Force chair: ‘Call off the dogs'\\", Bob Cramer, Atlanta Business Chronicle, Mar 4, 2010 Cramer's other public writings on the shelter include an op-ed piece in the Atlanta Journal \\"25 years of poverty vs. power\\", Bob Cramer, Atlanta Journal Constitution, November 25, 2011 and a comment in Creative Loafing.\\"Comment on 'Beatys, Task Force is out of Peachtree-Pine in 10 days' — UPDATE\\", Bob Cramer, Creative Loafing, December 4, 2012 The Task Force also relies on \\"anonymous donors\\" whose identities are kept confidential because according to Beaty \\"business leaders have put pressure against their contributors in the past\\", and \\"public officials have told their donors they wouldn't be able to do business with the city if they gave money to the Task Force.\\" \\"Donors pay for Peachtree-Pine shelter's $580,000 water bill, pledge help with future payments\\", Max Blau and Thomas Wheatley, \\"Creative Loafing\\", September 26, 2014 Up to 2007, the shelter was also a recipient of public funds from the state and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). =Loss of Certification and Public Funds= In 2007, the Tri-Jurisdictional Collaborative on Homelessness, composed of appointees from Atlanta and Fulton and DeKalb counties, gave HUD a prioritized list of local homeless agencies that should receive funding. The Task Force was ranked the lowest of 20 agencies, scoring 56 out of 100 points,\\"City withdraws support for homeless shelter\\", Mara Shalhoup, \\"Creative Loafing\\", June 13, 2007 and has not been a recipient of HUD or other public funds since. Subsequently, the shelter lost a bulk of its private donations as well and its annual budget dropped from a high of $1.8 million to only about $200,000. The decline in private donations have also been in part due to active opposition by neighborhood organizations. In 2008, for instance, the Whole Foods grocery store on Ponce de Leon Avenue cancelled a fund raising for the shelter after the Midtown Ponce Security Alliance had threatened the store with boycott.\\"Midtown neighborhood group urges Whole Foods boycott\\", Thomas Wheatley, \\"Creative Loafing\\", Sep 10, 2008\\"Whole Foods cancels fundraiser for homeless\\", Thomas Wheatley, \\"Creative Loafing\\", Sep 10, 2008 =Water Dispute with City= In late 2008 the City of Atlanta shut off water service to the shelter because of more than $160,000 in unpaid water and sewer bills. The Task Force won an injunction to have water service restored and also sued the City, claiming the City had been using a multi-pronged approach to try to close the shelter.\\"Atlanta's largest homeless shelter sues City Hall\\", Thomas Wheatley, Creative Loafing, September 11, 2009 A federal judge dismissed the suit in September 2011,\\"City of Atlanta wins major case against Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless\\", Saporta Report, September 22, 2011 but the shelter appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which in January 2013 also denied the suit.\\"11th Circuit Court upholds earlier ruling against Homeless Task Force\\", Saporta Report, January 15, 2013 In September 2014, the shelter's debt to the city stood at close to $600,000\\"City rejects shelter's water payment offer, reveals plan to move homeless to other facilities\\", Max Blau, Creative Loafing, September 19, 2014 due to unpaid water bills since 2010.\\"Atlanta refuses $100,000 from homeless shelter; will cut off water\\", Steve Visser, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, September 19, 2014 This amount was eventually paid in full by \\"anonymous donors\\" on September 26, 2014, after the city had declined a partial payment of $100,000 from the Task Force and threatened to cut off water.\\"Task Force for the Homeless pays $600K water bill, avoids shut-off\\", Katie Leslie, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, September 26, 2014. =Foreclosure of Building= In 2007, when the shelter's funding had begun to deteriorate, the building had been estimated to be worth $9 million or more by Alan Wexler, president of real estate research firm Databank Inc.\\"Face-off over homeless shelter\\", Justin Rubner, Atlanta Business Chronicle, Jul 23, 2007 Thus some observers, such as city councilman Kwanza Hall, who represents nearby neighborhoods, had expected the Task Force to sell the property. \\"With the amount of money that they could get for that building, they could invest in a facility that could really help people who need help\\", Hall had said. However, Bob Cramer, who was then the chairman of the board of directors of Peachtree- Pine, stated that there's \\"not enough money at Fort Knox\\" to get the task force to move the shelter. On the other hand, the Task Force had taken out three mortgages on the property, which it did not pay back. With $900,000 outstanding on the mortgages, and Wardlaw not being able to pay off the shelter's debt, two of the lenders foreclosed in May 2010, and the building was bought by Ichthus Community Trust, which was controlled by Norcross-based commercial developer Manny Fialkow\\".\\"Peachtree-Pine homeless shelter bought by developer\\", Scott Henry, Creative Loafing, May 5, 2010 Later, the title was transferred to Premium Funding Solutions, where Fialkow's wife is a silent investor. After acquiring the building, in an op-ed piece \\"Pledge to help homeless men at 477 Peachtree St.\\", Emanuel Fialkow, Atlanta Journal Constitution, May 19, 2010 in Atlanta Journal Constitution, Fialkow stated that he had \\"no intentions to immediately alter the use of the property\\", and pledged that Ichtus Community Trust \\"would take care of the men who are there\\" with the goal of finding \\"appropriate housing with case management for everyone\\". He only required that the Task Force's director, Anita Beaty, to leave so that Ichtus can begin its work. Beaty, however, refused to leave and the Task Force has continued to operate the shelter without paying rent, while filing lawsuits disputing the ownership of the building. In a rally in front of the shelter in 2010, Wardlaw declared that \\"The building of Peachtree-Pine belongs to the Peachtree-Pine community and will remain so.\\" =Eviction Order and Dispute Over Rent= In 2012, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall ordered the Task Force to hand over the control of the shelter to United Way of America. He criticized the Beatys for having made a \\"political statement\\" by allowing the Occupy Atlanta demonstrators to stay at Peachtree-Pine, and questioned their sincerity in maintaining that the homeless were their primary concern. The Beatys' actions were \\"more about power, money, control, revenge and anger than it is about the homeless\\", he declared.Judge orders Midtown homeless shelter handed over to United Way, Steve Visser, Atlanta Journal Constitution, February 4, 2012 \\"The ripple effect: The subtle ways the judge in the Peachtree-Pine case is hurting Atlanta\\", John F. Sugg, Creative Loafing, May 2, 2012 Schwall also declined to consider the evidence that the Task Force had gathered in support of its allegations with regard to the conspiracy leading to its loss of ownership of the building. Shortly afterward, however, the Georgia Court of Appeals blocked the eviction of the Task Force, and sent the case back to Schwall so that the Task Force may present its evidence.\\"Court blocks eviction of Peachtree and Pine homeless shelter\\", Steve Visser, Atlanta Journal Constitution, February 17, 2014 Another issue in the various lawsuits in which the Task Force is party is a failure to pay rent on the property from 2010 to date. In 2014 Schwall ruled that Premium Funding Solutions can begin to take action in court to evict the shelter from which it has not been receiving rent since it bought the property in 2011.\\"Judge: Peachtree-Pine shelter eviction proceedings can begin\\", Max Blau, Creative Loafing, August 11, 2014 In June 2015, various appeals filed by both parties reached the Georgia Supreme Court, which stated that it would issue its rulings in the following September or October.\\"Georgia Supreme Court hears Peachtree-Pine shelter case\\", Amy Wenk, Atlanta Business Chronicle, June 2, 2015\\"High Court Hears Homeless Shelter Arguments\\", Greg Land, Daily Report, June 2, 2015 =Outbreaks of Tuberculoses= Between 2006 and 2014 three separate outbreaks of TB have been reported at the shelter. In August 2015, Mayor Kasim Reed declared that \\"Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation\\" citing communications with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Mayor Reed wants to shutter Peachtree and Pine homeless facility, build new one, Maria Saporta, Atlanta Business Chronicle, August 11, 2015 Further he stated that he would invoke Eminent domain to close the shelter and move its occupants to a new facility constructed by the city, while the Peachtree-Pine building would be converted to Police and Fire stations. =Closure and Sale of Building= In August 2017, after settling the pending lawsuits, the Task Force closed the shelter. The last residents were relocated to apartments or other facilities by December 2017. In January 2019, the building was sold to Emory University. Emory's Midtown hospital is across Peachtree Street from the former shelter.

The marital power included the power of the husband to administer both his wife's separate property and their community property. A wife was not able to leave a will, enter into a contract, or sue or be sued, in her own name or without the permission of her husband. It is very similar to the doctrine of coverture in the English common law, as well as to the Head and Master law property laws. Historical origins The marital power derives from the Germanic, and not the Roman, sources of the Roman-Dutch law. While in the earlier Roman law, a wife came under the manus (guardianship) of her husband, this was abandoned in the later Roman law and wives had legal independence. However, under the Germanic law as described by Johann Gottlieb Heineccius: From the Germanic tribes it became part of the law of the Netherlands. When Dutch colonists settled at the Cape in the 17th century, they brought along the Roman-Dutch law, which managed to survive the British conquest in 1805. The spread of the Roman-Dutch law introduced the marital power doctrine so that it eventually formed part of the law of marriage in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana and Southern Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe was then known). 20th and 21st century restriction and abolition Of the Southern African countries that apply Roman-Dutch law, every one except Swaziland has abolished the marital power. In Southern Rhodesia the marital power was abolished in 1928 by the Married Persons' Property Act, which also abolished community of property. In France, marital power (puissance maritale) was abolished in 1938. However, the legal repeal of the specific doctrine of marital power does not necessarily grant married women the same legal rights as their husbands (or as unmarried women) as has notably been the case in France, where the legal subordination of the wife (primarily coming from the Napoleonic Code) was gradually abolished with women obtaining full equality in marriage only in the 1980s.Although marital power was abolished in France in 1938, married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission only in 1965, and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children). Furthermore, it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. In South Africa, the report of the Women's Legal Disabilities Commission in 1949 led to the enacting of the Matrimonial Affairs Act in 1953, which restricted but did not abolish the marital power. The Matrimonial Property Act of 1984 abolished it prospectively (i.e. for marriages contracted after the act came into force) but not for marriages between black people. An amendment in 1988 abolished it prospectively for marriages of black people under the civil law, but not for marriages contracted under customary law. A further amendment in 1993 repealed the marital power for all civil marriages, whenever they were contracted. The marital power persisted, however, in the Transkei (which was nominally independent from 1976 to 1994) but it was held to be unconstitutional for civil marriages by the Transkei High Court in 1999. In 2000 the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act abolished the marital power for all marriages under customary law throughout South Africa. In the Netherlands marital power was abolished in 1958. In Namibia the marital power was abolished in 1996 by the Married Persons Equality Act; in Botswana it was abolished in 2004 by the Abolition of Marital Power Act; and in Lesotho it was abolished in 2006 by the Married Persons Equality Act. In Swaziland, the marital power has recently been restricted, but not abolished (Sihlongonyane v Sihlongonyane (470/2013) [2013] SZHC 144 (18 July 2013) ).

In 2010 it was merged with Naval Support Facility Anacostia to form Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling. From its beginning, the installation has hosted elements of the Army Air Corps (predecessor to today's Air Force) and Navy aviation and support elements. History Before European colonization, the area where Bolling Air Force Base is located was inhabited by the Nacotchtank, an Algonquian people. The largest village of the Nacotchtank was located just north of the air force base, south of Anacostia Park. Another Nacotchtank village is believed to have existed on the base grounds, where two ossuaries (burial mounds) were discovered in 1936. Other Nacotchtank archaeological sites have been found at Giesboro Point on the Potomac River. The Department of Defense (DOD) has owned the Bolling grounds since 1917, when the tract of land was scouted by William C. Ocker at the direction of General Billy Mitchell. Founded on 2 October 1917 as The Flying Field at Anacostia, it was the first military airfield near the United States Capitol. It was renamed Anacostia Experimental Flying Field in June 1918. Soon, the single installation evolved into two separate, adjoining bases; one Army (later Air Force) and one Navy. Bolling Field was opened 1 July 1918 and was named for Colonel Raynal C. Bolling, the first high-ranking air service officer killed in World War I. Colonel Bolling was the Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and was killed in action near Amiens, France, on 26 March 1918 while defending himself and his driver, Private Paul L. Holder, from German soldiers. Flying activities began on 4 July 1918 with mailplanes landing there, with all equipment removed from the former location at the Polo Grounds, Washington, D.C.Editors, \\"Mailplanes Land at Bolling Field\\", Air Service Journal, Gardner, Moffat Co., Inc., New York, New York, 11 July 1918, Volume III, Number 2, page 53. In the late 1940s, Bolling Field's property became Naval Air Station Anacostia and a new Air Force base, named Bolling Air Force Base, was constructed just to the south on 24 June 1948. Bolling AFB has served as a research and testing ground for new aviation equipment and its first mission provided aerial defense of the capital. It moved to its present location, along the Potomac in the city's southwest quadrant, in the 1930s. Over the years, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and National Guard units, as well as DOD and federal agencies also found the installation to be an ideal place from which to operate. * In 1918, pilots from the installation were dispatched by President Woodrow Wilson to create the first permanent airmail route from Washington, D.C. to New York City. * Navy seaplanes were first tested and Air Force aerial refueling techniques were developed by installation-based personnel and military commands. * Following its successful transatlantic flight in 1927, Charles Lindbergh's \\"Spirit of St. Louis\\" returned to the installation. Soon after, the aircraft was used for Lindbergh's goodwill flight to Mexico and South America. * Air Force Lt. Col. Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold led a bomber flight from Bolling Field on a 4,000-mile journey to Alaska in 1934, to demonstrate the capabilities of long-range strategic bombing missions. * Throughout World War II, the installation served as a training and organizational base for personnel and units going overseas. It also served as the aerial gateway to the nation's capital. * The Air Force's first headquarters was established at the installation, as Army Air Forces Headquarters in 1941 and, with the creation of the United States Air Force, Air Force Headquarters in 1947. * The Sacred Cow, President Harry Truman's initial official aircraft and Franklin Roosevelt's only official aircraft, retired from service on the installation in 1961. This aircraft was the predecessor to Air Force One and was used for both presidential and VIP support missions. President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which created the United States Air Force, at the desk on board this aircraft. * In 1962, fixed-wing aircraft operations at the air force and naval installations ceased, due to congested airspace around Washington National Airport on the opposite shore of the Potomac River. Although fixed-wing aircraft operations ceased, the installations continued to serve the Military Airlift Command (MAC); the headquarters for the Air Force District of Washington; the Air Force 11th Wing; Commander, Naval Installations Command, Naval Media Center (now, Defense Media Activity-Navy) and many other military commands and federal agencies The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) was created and activated at Bolling on 1 October 1985 with the mission of providing administrative support to Air Force members. On 15 July 1994, AFDW was inactivated, but was reactivated 5 January 2005 to \\"provide a single voice for Air Force requirements in the National Capital Region\\" according to the base's website.

She is currently an associate professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Life and education Ginsberg earned her B.ASc. in engineering at the University of Toronto in 2000, and completed her PhD in physics at Harvard. Her initial interest was biomedicine, but she graduated with an electrical engineering focus, and an emphasis on physics and optics. Accepted into Harvard, and whilst in the research group of physics professor Lene Hau, Ginsberg studied Bose–Einstein condensates, ultracold clouds of atoms that exist at temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. After being awarded her PhD for her thesis entitled \\"Manipulations with spatially compressed slow light pulses in Bose–Einstein condensates\\" with Lene Hau as her thesis advisor, Ginsberg chose to change direction and include other interests, moving to Berkeley to begin her postdoctoral research in 2007 with Graham Fleming as her advisor. She held a Glenn T. Seaborg Postdoctoral Fellowship at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, until her appointment as assistant professor in the Chemistry department at UC Berkeley in 2010. Work In a series of experiments the Hau Group at Harvard (which included Ginsberg) halted and stored a light signal in a condensate of sodium atoms, then transferred the signal into a second sodium cloud 160 μm away. The American Institute of Physics listed this feat as #1 in its Top Ten discoveries of 2007. Ginsberg was the lead author on the paper \\"Coherent control of optical information with matter wave dynamics\\", that appeared on the cover of Nature in February of that year. She now leads the Ginsberg Group, whose research objective is \\"to spatially resolve the complex dynamics of nanoscale processes such as photosynthetic light harvesting.\\" Her current work is centered on \\"pushing the limits of spatially resolved spectroscopy and time resolved microscopy in multiple modalities\\", in order to try and answer fundamental and challenging questions that span chemistry, physics, and biology. Ginsberg's group uses multiple approaches, including ultrafast spectroscopy, light microscopy, and cathodoluminescence electron microscopy. Awards In 2011, Ginsberg was awarded the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering. In 2012, Her research attracted support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA in the form of a Young Faculty Award for her work in \\"Predictive Materials Science; \\"Beneath the Bulk: Domain-Specific Efficiency and Degradation in Organic Photovoltaic Thin Films\\"\\" Ginsberg currently holds The Cupola Era Endowed Chair in the College of Chemistry, and is a Faculty Scientist in the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

She is best known for her involvement in the O. J. Simpson murder trial and for her appearance on the reality television series The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Early life Faye Resnick was born July 3, 1957, one of four children born to a Spanish-Corsican mother and a father who abandoned the family when Resnick was very young. (an October 20, 1994 L.A. Times article stated that Faye's mother was Spanish-Italian and her stepfather German, while Resnick claimed \\"Italian, Spanish and English, or—to be more precise—I am Corsican, Castilian, and Anglo-Saxon\\"). Resnick claimed her father regularly beat her for wetting the bed when she was a child (the October 20, 1994 L.A. Times article indicated it was her stepfather who beat her, escalating from spankings when she was a youngster to \\"hideous beatings\\" as she matured). According to Resnick, her mother ignored her husband's rampages. Her mother worked a day job as a nurse and was a budding journalist at night. She ultimately became a successful columnist who wrote about holistic medicine, and later became a Jehovah's Witness, making Faye's childhood \\"even more chaotic\\". Resnick \\"describes her mother as a religious fanatic whose predictions that Armageddon would come in 1975 prompted Ms. Resnick to rush into her first sexual encounter beforehand\\". Resnick—then Faye Hutchison—left home to live with an aunt in the Bay Area, where \\"she was crowned 1975 Maid of Hayward, a moment captured in a newspaper photograph showing her on the verge of tears. No apocalypse, it was a beginning of sorts because it gave what Resnick described as 'both an ego boost and some career ideas.'\\" Resnick claims she attended law courses at a community college and later became the director of a John Robert Powers finishing and modeling school. However, the organization has no record of her employment. She is a former manicurist. Personal life Resnick was married and divorced three times, and gave birth to one daughter, Francesca, as People reported in November 1994: The Resnicks paid $1.3 million for a home formerly owned by Walt Disney Company chairman Michael Eisner, and Faye became active in activities associated with the Beverly Hills School District, where Francesca attended elementary school, such as the Beverly Hills P.T.A. During the 1990–91 academic year, she served on the board of the Beverly Hills Education Foundation; obtaining that position required a minimum donation of $1,000 and recognition as a school activist. At that time, reports David Margolick of the New York Times News Service, \\"She also became addicted to drugs\\". Faye and Paul Resnick, a wealthy hotel refurbisher, divorced amicably in 1991. Faye's settlement netted her a payout of $194,000. His daughter Jackie stated in 1995: Faye \\"was the absolute worst of his [five] nightmare ex-wives. She put a great strain on our relationship.\\" Since then, Jackie has publicly stated that she wrongfully blamed Faye for the strained relationship she had with her father at the time, and that she has great love and respect for Faye. Resnick, an admitted cocaine addict, attended multiple drug rehabilitation programs in the eight years preceding November 1994. Consequently, although she maintained that she was sober at the time her book was published, her past drug use led some to question her credibility and motives and the defense team in O. J. Simpson's murder trial to allege that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were executed by drug dealers to whom Resnick owed money in an attempt to scare her. =Friendship with Nicole Brown Simpson= Resnick and Nicole Brown Simpson first met in 1990. The two socialized with each other in and around Brentwood, Los Angeles and vacationed in Mexico together. Faye's third husband, Paul Resnick, reported that a concerned Nicole called him in early June 1994 to report that \\"Faye was getting out of control\\" and abusing cocaine again. Resnick stayed for several days at Brown's condominium until on June 9, 1994, Nicole and several other friends conducted an intervention and persuaded Faye to check into the Exodus Recovery Center in Marina Del Rey, California. Three days later, Brown and her friend, waiter Ronald Goldman, were murdered. Books Resnick collaborated on two books connected to the O. J. Simpson murder trial: * Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted (1994, with gossip columnist for The National Enquirer, Mike Walker) reveals information unflattering to Nicole Brown Simpson (and Resnick) and has been panned by some detractors as a roman à clef. The L.A. Times termed it \\"the first of the major O.J. Simpson books to hit the shelves\\" and noted it was a best-seller. New York Magazine dubbed it \\"the best-selling apotheosis of trashiness\\". The president of Dove Books, Michael A. Viner, said Resnick received a six-figure advance for her literary effort, which was rushed to stores in an unusually voluminous first press run of about 750,000 hardcover copies. * Shattered: In the Eye of the Storm (1996, with Jeanne V. Bell) describes Resnick's experiences with the O. J. Simpson trial and her views of both opposing legal teams. The L.A. Times termed it \\"a New Age nonfiction work about women who suffer domestic violence and their journey toward recovery\\", and cited as her literary influence New Age author Marianne Williamson. Media appearances Resnick posed nude for Playboy magazine in March 1997, appearing on the cover of the American issue and in interior photos, and she has participated in multiple interviews about the photo spread. She has also appeared in multiple episodes of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as a friend of cast member Kyle Richards. Her most infamous appearance is in series one, when she engages in an argument with Camille Grammer and Alison Dubois at Grammer's dinner party. It was later dubbed, by many cast members, as the dinner party from hell. Faye also appeared in Season 10, Episode 6 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled, \\"Don't Panic\\", as a guest at her friend Kris Jenner's birthday party in Las Vegas. Faye appeared again in Keeping Up with the Kardashians for Season 12, Episode 3 entitled, \\"Significant Others and Significant Brothers\\". In this episode, she uses her skills as an interior designer to help her friend Kris Jenner decorate her son's new house. The decor is in a style that Jenner's daughter Kourtney Kardashian questions as being too feminine. She was portrayed by actress Connie Britton in the television series American Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson which is based on the O. J. Simpson trial.

Plot Louise (Carrie Snodgress), a librarian, devotes her life to caring for her old, controlling, wheelchair- ridden father, Wendel (Ray Milland) after her fiancé, Robert, disappears the night before their wedding. She fantasizes about her father's death, and only finds joy with Emily (Ruth Cox)-a fellow librarian who is being trained as Louise's replacement (Louise is being fired for attempting to burn down the library)-and a pet monkey (who Louise names Dickie) that Emily buys for Louise. While wheeling her father up a hill at a local park one Sunday afternoon, Wendel's wheelchair tips over, and he falls out. Wendel reflexively picks himself up and it is revealed he was never disabled to begin with, and he lied to Louise all this time in order to enslave her to him. In a fit of rage, Louise pushes Wendel down the hill and he is killed when his head hits a rock. Louise then runs home to gather her few belongings, and some of her father's money hoping to run away. While searching her father's belongings, she comes across a key to the attic, which has long been boarded up.

Founded in 1938, Blue KC offers healthcare, dental, life insurance and Medicare coverage. Headquartered in Kansas City, the company serves 30 counties in northwest Missouri as well as Johnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas. History Originally named Blue Cross of Kansas City, the health insurance provider was established in 1938. Kansas City Blue Shield was formed in 1943. In 1982, the Kansas City Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans merged, creating Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City. In 2003, Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger denied a bid from Anthem (the fifth-largest US publicly traded health insurance company at the time) to purchase the company. Both companies sought legal recourse, arguing that the insurance commissioner had over-stepped the authority of the office. The Kansas Supreme Court heard the case and ruled that the state insurance commissioner has the authority to block such mergers and affirmed her ability to do so. Prior to the proposed merger, the company had lost 80,000 policy holders. From 2014 to 2018, Blue KC participated in the Affordable Care Act exchange. The company decided to pull out of the exchange in 2017 after reporting a $100 million loss. In 2015, the company created the Blue KC Exchange, a private insurance exchange marketplace for small businesses. Danette Wilson became the Blue KC's first female CEO in 2015. When she retired in 2019, Erin Stucky, a 25-year veteran of the company, succeeded her in the role. In November 2017, Blue KC launched Spira Care, a plan that combines primary care and health insurance.

History The Buckshaw Estate was originally owned by the Anderton family of Euxton Hall, who in 1652 sold it to Major Edward Robinson Melmoth, who built the present hall in 1654. In the 19th century the estate was sold to John Walmsley and then passed to the Towneley Parkers of Cuerden Hall and the Crosse family of Shaw Hill. Extensive restoration of the southern wing was carried out by Colonel Thomas Richard Crosse in 1885, after which it was sold to Richard Stock, who in 1936 sold the estate and surrounding farmland to the Ministry of Supply to establish a new munitions factory. The munitions complex was known as ROF Chorley and the hall was used for office accommodation. In 2005 the factory was closed and the site transferred back to private ownership. Much of the land is being developed for housing as Buckshaw Village. In 1954 the Ministry of Works planned to demolish the building but this was not done. By 2002 Buckshaw Hall was dilapidated and Chorley Civic Society, campaigned for developers to restore it. It was vandalised in 2012. Having been sold in 2018, the hall is now privately owned. Restorative work including reconstruction of the collapsed east elevation was carried out by Donald Insall Associates. Architecture It is a timber-framed manor house on a high sandstone plinth with infilling partly in wattle and daub and partly in brick, and with a slate roof. It has an H-shaped plan, consisting of a hall with two cross-wings, and is in two storeys. Behind the hall is a projecting stair turret. The upper floors of the wings are jettied, and the gables have wavy bargeboards and apex finials. Inside are inglenooks, bressumers, and timber-framed partitions.

Plant With Purpose uses a transformational development approach that brings together environmental restoration, economic empowerment, and spiritual renewal. Plant With Purpose currently works in more than 430 communities in seven countries across Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. History Plant With Purpose was founded in 1984 under the original name Floresta. Tom Woodard and his colleagues had traveled to the Dominican Republic to volunteer with an agency doing relief work. It became clear to Woodard that food aid alone would not solve long-term problems caused by deforestation and desperate farming practices that depleted the soil. He realized that farmers needed sustainable methods to meet their immediate needs while also working toward long-term restoration of the land. In response, Woodard developed Floresta to meet the environmental, economic, and spiritual needs of rural communities in the Dominican Republic. Today, Plant With Purpose operates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Burundi, Haiti, Mexico, Tanzania, and Thailand. =Timeline= 1984 Floresta Dominican Republic is founded. 1997 Floresta Haiti is founded. 1999 Misión Integral (Floresta Mexico) is founded. 2004 Floresta Tanzania is founded. 2006 Plant With Purpose first uses the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) method. 2008 Floresta and Upland Holistic Development Project (UHDP) form a partnership in the northern hills of Thailand. 2008 Floresta Burundi becomes the sixth international program. 2010 Floresta is renamed Plant With Purpose. 2010 A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti necessitates relief effort. 2010 Tending to Eden: Environmental Stewardship for God’s People by Executive Director Scott Sabin is published. 2011 Plant With Purpose earns a top rating from Charity Navigator. 2012 Plant With Purpose reaches 8 million trees planted worldwide. 2014 Plant With Purpose celebrates its 30-year anniversary. 2015 Plant With Purpose launches program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 2015 Plant With Purpose reaches 16 million trees planted worldwide. Rural Poverty Today more than 70 percent of the world's poorest people, or roughly 1.4 billion people live in rural, isolated areas, limiting their access to basic resources. Most rural communities depend on the land for their livelihood and survival. Members of these rural communities often have limited access to financial services like savings and credit, and struggle to procure adequate resources. This makes them extremely vulnerable to external shocks, such as natural disasters, family emergencies, poor crop yields, and civil unrest. Without an established safety net, external shocks can cause rural families to fall deeper into a cycle of poverty. When left with few options to generate needed income, rural farmers often cut trees to create more farmland or to use or sell as fuelwood. This cycle of deforestation degrades soil, damages habitats and biodiversity, and further exacerbates the problems of rural poverty. Methodology Three- part environmental, economic, and spiritual approach to sustainable development Plant With Purpose employs a three-part approach for transformational community development that addresses environmental restoration, economic empowerment, and spiritual renewal. The overarching strategy is to provide training and tools that equip rural communities to develop and utilize their own talents and resources to reverse the effects of poverty. =Environmental Restoration= Areas suffering from rural poverty often suffer from environmental degradation as well. Partnering communities receive agricultural training and plant trees to establish reforestation and sustainable farming techniques. The small-scale farmers within these communities can then work to restore the environment while simultaneously producing more income and crop yields. =Economic Empowerment= Plant With Purpose uses the Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA) model, created by CARE, to provide a sustainable form of microfinance that allows participants to build capital. This savings-led approach equips self-elected groups to create a financial safety net by saving their own money and making small loans to individuals within the group. The group decides on a fair interest rate, which then go back to the group and increase overall savings. =Spiritual Renewal= Plant With Purpose partners with local churches to develop local leadership and support discipleship efforts. Plant With Purpose also uses a formal program designed to mobilize congregations to be agents of change in their communities by finding solutions to existing needs using local resources. Spiritual programs also tie back into environmental restoration through connection to creation care. While Plant With Purpose is a nondenominationally faith-based organization that works with local churches and Christian leaders as a component of community interactions, participation in its programs is not contingent on religious affiliation, nor does it require participation in Bible studies or church services. Plant With Purpose's Theology of Work curriculum in Burundi is also taught in local mosques and helps facilitate reconciliation in communities. International Impact =Burundi= In 2008, Plant With Purpose began working in Burundi after the end of a long period of violent conflict. Burundi is one of the five poorest countries in the world and has been rated the hungriest country in the world. = Democratic Republic of the Congo = In July 2015, Plant With Purpose launched its seventh country program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The two-year pilot program aims to identify the areas of greatest environmental degradation in the Kakumba Watershed, which is located on the northwest edge of Lake Tanganyika. These rapidly disappearing forests are home to the endangered Eastern Mountain Gorilla. =Dominican Republic= The Dominican Republic is the first country Plant With Purpose partnered with and has been the longest running program to date. Of those living in rural Dominican areas, 57 percent live below the poverty line. =Haiti= Haiti is recognized as the poorest country in the western hemisphere and has one of the world's highest rates of deforestation. The country is still recovering following a magnitude-7.0 earthquake in 2010. Plant With Purpose has been working in rural Haitian communities since 1997. In rural areas, 88 percent of Haitians are considered poor (living on less than $2 a day), and 67 percent are extremely poor (living on less than $1.25 a day). =Mexico= Plant With Purpose has worked in Oaxaca, Mexico with indigenous communities since 1996 and began working in the neighboring state of Chiapas in 2012. Oaxaca and Chiapas are two of the three poorest states in Mexico. In Mexico, 61 percent of rural families live below the poverty line, while 75 percent of the indigenous population live in poverty. Nearly 25 percent of this population group - mainly the men - has migrated to the U.S. and other parts of Mexico, leaving many women to provide for themselves and their children. =Tanzania= Plant With Purpose began working with communities in the Mt. Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania in 2004. The majority of Tanzanian farmers who partner with Plant With Purpose are women. In Tanzania, 98 percent of rural women who are economically active depend on the land for survival through agriculture. =Thailand= In 2008, Plant With Purpose began a partnership with an existing organization called the Upland Holistic Development Project (UHDP). The focus of the program is helping marginalized hill tribe communities in Thailand’s northern hills. The northern hill tribe communities of Thailand consist of hundreds of thousands of refugees. The majority of ethnic hill tribe people came to Thailand to escape civil strife in Myanmar (Burma). Highlights In 2010, Plant With Purpose's Executive Director, Scott Sabin, published Tending to Eden: Environmental Stewardship for God's People. Tending to Eden offers a global perspective on the theological foundation for caring for the earth and its people. In February 2013, an organization called Wings of Kilimanjaro organized a group of almost 100 paragliders to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro and fly from the top. The group raised funds for three nonprofits working in Tanzania, including Plant With Purpose.  References  Further reading # Sabin, S. (2010).

The script was co-written by Dix, co-star Eddie Baroo, and Adam Patrick Foster. A team of elite commandos are sent to a secret military base to extract a scientific team under attack by escaped prisoners. Plot After receiving a distress signal, a team of elite commandos are dispatched to extract a scientific team in a secret military base. The team is instructed to shoot on sight any prisoners that they see. When they arrive, the commandos split into three teams. However, team leader Romeo (Ditch Davey) disobeys orders when he recognises one of the prisoners, Eve (Amber Clayton), as his dead wife. Confused, Romeo asks how this is possible, but Eve claims to be suffering from amnesia and can only remember bits and pieces of her life. The others dispute this and want to kill her, but Romeo is adamant that she must accompany them. After an encounter with a mutant gorilla, Elvis (John Brumpton) is killed and tensions begin to rise; the team begin to wonder what kind of experiments could have been performed at the base. When the commandos find lead scientist Caesar (Nicholas Bell), they angrily demand answers, but he tells them only that Eve is a dangerous and important weapon. Matthews (Samuel Johnson), after being threatened, reveals that the prisoners have been used in brain experiments. Eve is distressed by this, and the team remains hostile to the scientists; however, they agree to allow the scientists to accompany them. A friendly team opens fire on them, and a prisoner nearly forces Romeo to open fire on his own team. Fourpack (Eddie Baroo) saves Romeo by killing the prisoner. Caesar explains that the prisoners have psychic powers, enhanced through experimentation. Disgusted, the team abandons the scientists and decides to escort Eve to the surface. Wiki (Peta Sergeant) hallucinates a dog attack and accidentally kills herself, and the third team opens fire on the remaining soldiers. In the confusion, Eve and the soldiers split up. Using a security console, Caesar guides Eve to Matthews and saves Romeo and Fourpack. Matthews reveals that Eve is composed of two subjects, only one of whom consented. While watching a videotape, Eve realises that Matthews is complicit in her abduction and experiment, and, using her psychic powers, forces Matthews to kill himself. Eve then rejoins Fourpack and Romeo, but she forces Fourpack to kill himself, too. Romeo, Eve, and Caesar confront each other, and Caesar reveals that Eve was never Romeo's wife; instead, Eve has insinuated herself into Romeo's memories. Eve psychically kills Caesar and expresses her envy for the love shared between Romeo and his wife. Romeo feigns an attraction to her and tries to blow them both up, but Eve escapes. Before she escapes the facility, Eve has a flashback of seeing an alien during her operation: it is implied that somehow the scientists removed the brain or the personality of the alien and transferred it into Eve. The film ends with her witnessing the destruction of the base in the distance.

Crawlspace was written to be a contained, paranoid story that uses genre film tropes. Production took place at Docklands Studios Melbourne over twenty-three days, and post-production took six months. Release The film was first released at the Cannes Film Festival on February 2012. IFC Films acquired rights to distribute the film in North America. The North American premiere was at Screamfest Horror Film Festival on 18 October 2012. Reception Matt Donato, of We Got This Covered, rated the film 2/5 stars and called it a \\"sloppy mess\\". Brad McHargue, of Dread Central, rated it 2.5/5 stars and said that Crawlspace \\"wears its influences on its sleeve\\" but is \\"mildly entertaining at times\\". Scott Weinberg, of Fearnet, complimented the filmmakers for trying to make a cerebral film, but dismissed it as \\"a pretty forgettable affair\\". Chris Holt, of Starburst, rated it 5/10 and criticized the film's lack of coherence and character development. However, in a positive review, Mark Adams, of Screen Daily called it \\"so very familiar\\" but solid and exciting. Brian Clark, of Twitch Film, agreed and said that it \\"crosses the line between homage and rip-off several times\\" but is diverting and well- directed.

Leah also performs as a solo artist. Based between Southern Appalachia and New Orleans, the sisters work with an array of international musicians and the band incorporates everything from simple harmonics with banjos and fiddles, to a wide variety of drums, kalimbas, beatbox, djembe, baliphone, congas, didgeridoo, tablas, spoons and washboard creating a full mix of world, folk and soul music. History In 2005, sisters Leah and Chloe Smith, decided one afternoon to record their first album, Leah and Chloe, in the basement studio of a friend in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The album was meant as a gift for family and friends but they received so much support and recognition for it that they decided to officially start a band called Rising Appalachia. Chloe and Leah Smith at FloydFest 2010 In the early days, the sisters busked, in the French Quarter of New Orleans and elsewhere. They began to find their own natural interpretation of Appalachian music which brought together folk, soul, hip-hop, classical, southern gospel and other styles based on their upbringing on traditional Appalachian string band music, as well as on their exposure to urban music like hip-hop and jazz and the influence of roots music of all kinds which they experienced during their worldwide travels. They released their second album, Scale Down in 2007. On June 29, 2008 the group played their last show under the name Rising Appalachia during Concrete Pandemonium III at the Eyedrum Art Gallery in Atlanta before it was changed to R.I.S.E. (sometimes written RISE). However, in February 2010 they announced they would reclaim the original name of the band, Rising Appalachia, but would incorporate RISE in the name of a supporting project, the Rise Collective. Rising Appalachia is independent from the mainstream music industry. The sisters managed, produced and marketed the project themselves from the beginning and only later started to build up a small management team. Their first four albums have been self produced and self funded. For their fifth album, Filthy Dirty South, they raised in 2011 within one month a total of $11,180.00 on the crowd funding web site Kickstarter. Rising Appalachia has performed at many musical festivals throughout the United States but also in Colombia, Costa Rica, Canada, India, Puerto Rico, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Ireland and Scotland.  Rise Collective  The Rise Collective uses both lyrical prowess and diverse artistic collaborations. It consists of a crew of global performers, activists, youth educators, dancers, circus artists, yoginis, acrobatics, fire spinners, poets, aerialists, cultural workers and others who perform at music festivals, rallies and street parties and hold sound education workshops at youth centers, schools, prisons and other locations. The Rise Collective activities include: *Acro-yoga *Aerial performance *Fire spinning *Sound workshops *Yoga and meditation *Youth education Together with the music of Rising Appalachia, the collective is used to support many of the Smith sisters' community-based projects uniting the arts and justice. Having themselves been community activists during their travels, Leah and Chloe Smith want their art to also be a source of activism, as well as of cultural development.

Life  Zsigmondy's parents were Hungarians: Adolf Zsigmondy, born in Pozsony, and Irma von Szakmáry, born in Martonvásár. Zsigmondy was an excellent alpinist, known for the risky nature of many of his climbs. He began mountaineering as a teenager, climbing the Reisseck in Austria in a round trip of 26 hours with his brother, Otto Zsigmondy. By the late 1870s the two brothers were climbing without guides in the Zillertal Alps. In 1881, they climbed the Ortler from the Hochjoch. Emil Zsigmondy was the friend and companion of Ludwig Purtscheller, the great pioneer of guideless Alpine climbing. Emil and Otto climbed with Purtscheller in 1882 and 1884, including an ascent without guides of the Marinelli Couloir on Monte Rosa and the first guideless traverse of the Matterhorn.Mountaineers (Douglas/Smithsonian), p. 115. Zsigmondy's outstanding achievements include the first ascent by the east arête of the high Meije in the Massif des Écrins range, made by Zsigmondy, his brother Otto, and Purtscheller on 26 July 1885. A few days later he died on the same mountain. He was killed in an attempt to climb the south face of the Meije on 6 August 1885, probably as a result of his rope slipping off a rock. The face was only conquered in 1912 by the South Tyrolese climbers Angelo Dibona and Luigi Rizzi with the brothers Guido and Max Mayer. Emil Zsigmondy's grave is a few miles away from the accident site in the small cemetery of Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans in the Dauphiné Alps. He had graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1884, less than a year before his death. American historian and mountaineer W. A. B. Coolidge would later write: Zsigmondy is commemorated by the Zsigmondyspitze in the Zillertal Alps, the Brèche Zsigmondy on the Meije (part of the route followed on the successful July 1885 climb), and the Zsigmondyhütte (Rifugio Zsigmondy Comici) in the Sexten Dolomites.  Family  The brothers Otto (left) and Emil Zsigmondy in 1880 Emil Zsigmondy was the second of the four sons of Dr. Adolf Zsigmondy of Pressburg, a dentist of Hungarian origin, and Irma von Szakmáry, a poet from Martonvásár. His older brother, Otto, a dentist by profession, was also known as a mountaineer. His younger brother, Richard Adolf Zsigmondy, was a chemist and in 1925 received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The youngest of the four brothers, Karl Zsigmondy, was a mathematician; in number theory, Zsigmondy's theorem is named after him.Gos, p. 162.

He served as the party's First Secretary from 1929 to 1930 and again for a month in 1932. As party leader, Eldev-Ochir pushed for rapid implementation of socialist policies (forced collectivization and property confiscation) during the “Leftist” period of the early 1930s, led the persecution of institutional Buddhism in Mongolia, and backed Soviet-sponsored purges of counterrevolutionary elements, particularly Buryat-Mongols, during the Lkhümbe affair in 1934-1935. He died in 1937 after being injured in a car accident. Early life and career Eldev-Ochir was born in 1905 in Zasagt Khan Province where, from 1922 to 1925, he was leader of the local cell of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MYRL). In the mid-1920s, he was recruited by Comintern agents looking for younger, more radical, and preferably “rural” party members to challenge the authority of “old guard” revolutionaries such as Prime Minister Balingiin Tserendorj, Deputy Prime Minister Anandyn Amar, and Party Chairman Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj. Eldev- Ochir officially joined the MPRP in 1925, enrolled in the MPRP Party School in Ulaanbaatar, and then went on to attend the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in the USSR, graduating in 1928. At the 1928 Seventh Party Congress, Comintern agents (including the American William F. Dunne) orchestrated the removal of rightist leaders and ensured the election of leftists such as Eldev-Ochir, Peljidiin Genden, and Ölziin Badrakh as secretaries of the party Central Committee. Eldev-Ochir was also elected to the Presidium of the MPRP, despite opposition from MYRL delegates who accused his wife of being “a true feudal.” Eldev-Ochir rejected demands that he divorce her. =Leftist deviation= From 1929 to 1932, Eldev-Ochir supported policies (advocated by the Soviets) that rapidly transitioned the country from the “democratic” to the “socialist” stage of the revolution. One third of Mongolian livestock was decimated as herders were forced onto collective farms. Private trade was suppressed and property of both the nobility and the Buddhist church was seized. Over 800 properties belonging to the nobility and the Buddhist church were confiscated and over 700 head of mostly noble households were executed. In March 1930, Eldev-Ochir was appointed head of the Internal Security Directorate and ordered to suppress uprisings against the government’s unpopular policies by lamas at Tögsbuyant and Ulaangom monasteries in Uvs Province. He and a Soviet trainer commanded the fourth cavalry out of Khovd that swiftly and brutally defeated the lamas. Eldev-Ochir ordered the on-the-spot execution of 30 leaders of the rebellion. During the fighting however Eldev-Ochir's car was overturned and he suffered a neck injury. =New Turn policy= Eldev-Ochir's swift defeat of the Uvs revolt failed to prevent further violent uprisings from spreading across western Mongolia in 1932. In response, Moscow ordered the curtailment of socialist policies and purged several MPRP leaders (including Badrah, Shijee, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav) as agents of “Leftist Deviation” in May 1932. Although he was party leader, Eldev-Ochir managed to avoid Soviet retribution. He and Khorloogiin Choibalsan were portrayed as being the first to criticize of the policies' excesses. Genden, who was also closely associated with the leftist policies, nevertheless managed to be appointed prime minister in 1932 after securing Josef Stalin’s favor. Eldev-Ochir was reelected party secretary (along with Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav and Khas-Ochiryn Luvsandorj) at the Ninth Party Congress 1934 and again in 1937 (this time with Luvsansharav and Banzarjavyn Baasanjav). =Lkhümbe Affair= In spring 1933 Prime Minister Genden and Eldev-Ochir consented to the arrest of party secretary Jambyn Lkhümbe in the wake of spurious allegations that he was head of a Japanese spy ring plotting the government's overthrow. The subsequent investigation, known as the \\" Lkhümbe Affair,\\" implicated hundreds of Mongolians and resulted in the purge of numerous high ranking politicians and military officers, particularly Buryat-Mongols. =Persecution of the Buddhist Church= In 1935 Eldev-Ochir took charge of an extraordinary commission on religion through which the Central Committee continued its persecution of the Buddhist Church. Laws were adopted and rigorously enforced that broke the authority and independence of the Church: disputes were now settled by public courts, religious administrations were oppressively regulated, and religious services were ordered to be read in Mongolian rather than traditional Tibetan. Monasteries that were found to be non-compliant were severely punished or shut down altogether. Eldev-Ochir often attended Saturday meetings at monasteries where he praised revolutionary principals or threatened monasteries with closure. =Purge of Genden= By 1935 it was clear that Genden had lost the backing of Stalin, who was unhappy with the slow pace of the MPRP's war against the lamas. At a plenary meeting of the MPRP in March 1936, Genden, accused of sabotaging Mongol-Soviet relations, was stripped of his offices of prime minister and foreign minister and sent to the USSR \\"for medical treatment.\\" Under house arrest at the Black Sea resort town of Foros, Genden was desperate to return to Mongolia and at one point reached out to Eldev- Ochir, who was vacationing in nearby Yalta, for assistance. Eldev-Ochir took no action. Genden was executed in November 1937. =Death= Around the same time it is believed that Eldev-Ochir died a premature death. Although details of the last year of his life are scarce, it was originally thought that he was the victim of the large scale Soviet purges that took place in Mongolia between 1932 and 1939. Later information suggested he had died in a Moscow hospital after falling from a moving vehicle during a hunting trip.

Second Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The introductory volume has been singled out as both a useful addition to the flora and a valuable work in its own right. Writing in the Edinburgh Journal of Botany, S. Bridgewater considered the first volume \\"an excellent way of starting a Flora\\" and \\"a highly desirable book for anyone with a love of botany and South America\\".Bridgewater, S. (November 1997). Book reviews: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 1. Introduction. Edinburgh Journal of Botany 54(3): 355–356. He added that the prose \\"is both unpretentious and accessible, whilst being thoroughly researched\\". These views were echoed in the Handbook of Latin American Studies, where the volume is described as \\"authoritative and superbly illustrated\\" and \\"[m]uch broader than [its] title suggests\\".McCan, K.D. (2000). Handbook of Latin American Studies: No. 57. University of Texas Press, Austin. R. Atkinson, who reviewed volume 2 for the Edinburgh Journal of Botany, considered the book's dichotomous keys \\"concise and easy to use\\" and the illustrations \\"clear although sometimes rather diagrammatic\\".Atkinson, R. (July 1998). Book reviews: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 2. Pteridophytes, Spermatophytes; Acanthaceae–Araceae. Edinburgh Journal of Botany 55(2): 317–318. More serious criticism was levelled at the alphabetical arrangement of families, which Atkinson considered the work's \\"biggest drawback\\". He continued: \\"It would be more valuable if a systematic approach had been taken to avoid the absurdity of closely related families being placed (under an evolutionarily arbitrary, alphabetical system) in different volumes.\\" Reviewing volume 7 in Economic Botany, Neil A. Harriman wrote that the entire flora was \\"lavishly produced, with a great many line drawings to aid in identification\\". He added: \\"I think it indicates how carefully these volumes are done, that weedy little Plantago major gets just as much space, and just as fine an illustration, as any of the rare, exotic, endemic orchid species do.\\" Harriman also noted the comprehensive literature citations, which he found \\"most helpful\\". Although rather conservative, Harriman considered the species synonymies adequate. References * Higgins, W. (2003). Book review: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana, Volume 7 Myrtaceae–Plumbaginaceae.

It depicts the river Oise near the market town of Pontoise. Description Painted in the early days of Impressionism, this rural landscape uses gently luminous colors and loose brushwork to capture the atmospheric conditions of a silvery-grey, overcast day. While the surface texture is sensuous, the firm compositional network, Pissarro's hallmark, locks the road, river, field, and sky together tightly. Encroaching on the French landscape are clear signs of industrialization: factory, smokestack, railroad, and barge. Historical information As a politically engaged artist, Pissarro had fled to London during the Franco-Prussian War. He settled in Pontoise in 1872, after it was safe to return. It was his period of purest Impressionism. He painted a series of paintings along the Oise in 1873. Factories along the bank played a prominent role, a blatant intrusion of modernity into a landscape contemporaries were still depicting as unspoiled nature. This particular image downplays the factory compared to others in the sequence, relegating it to the background, but it is still a significant part of this humdrum section of riverbank on a grey, cloudy day. The variety of treatments he afforded the factory seems to say less about his feelings about that structure in particular than about the purpose of modern painting, which had a duty to incorporate contrasting elements that had traditionally been kept separate. =Acquisition= The Banks of the Oise near Pontoise was purchased with the James E. Roberts Fund by the Herron School of Art in 1940, then remained with the IMA during the split. It currently hangs in the Norb & Ruth Schaefer, Sr. and Norb & Carolyn Schaefer Jr. Gallery and has the accession number 40.252.

The name stems from Arthur Dillon (1750-1794) a soldier with Lafayette's troops in the American War of Independence. Serving with Dillon's Regiment, of the Irish Brigade (France), he had been created a colonel at the age of 16.http://www.rhums- dillon.com/ Dillons Rum website On returning to his home from the war, he married a rich widow, named Louise. Then they bought the estate, flourishing with sugar cane, and had a daughter Fanny. Dillon became a deputy, and his daughter was presented by her cousin Josephine to Napoleon. She married General Bertrand, and they both accompanied Napoleon into exile on Elba and St Helena. On returning to the Dillon Plantation, she campaigned against slavery. Process There are ten varieties of sugar cane used by Dillon. The cane is grown for two years and when harvested the sugar is extracted over a period of 2 to 3 days. Speed is essential. The saying goes \\"the cane should have its feet in the earth and its head in the mill\\" The cane is crushed three times to release the juice by a steam engine driven mill. Water is added and the juice is allowed to ferment- it is again milled to crush the sugar, and fermentation starts. The residue cane is used to fire the boilers that provide the steam. The distillation is a slow process, in columns heated to , producing an alcohol of 65%. It rests for five months then is reduced and bottled at 50% to 55%.

It was built on the Mesabi Iron Range near the city of Gilbert in St. Louis County. Elcor was its own unincorporated community before it was abandoned and was never a neighborhood proper of the city of Gilbert. Not rating a figure in the national census, the people of Elcor were only generally considered to be citizens of Gilbert. The area where Elcor was located was annexed by Gilbert when its existing city boundaries were expanded after 1969. In November 1890, the seven Merritt brothers discovered ore near Mountain Iron, triggering an unparalleled iron rush to the Mesabi Range. The Elba mine was opened in 1897, and the town was platted under the direction of Don H. Bacon, president of the Minnesota Iron Company. A second nearby mine, the Corsica, was opened in 1901. The community was first called \\"Elba\\" after the name of the first underground mine (the name \\"Elcor\\" was formed later by combining the first syllables of each mine's name). The Elba and Corsica mines were both leased by Pickands Mather and Company after the formation of the United States Steel Corporation. An influx of people of many ethnicities and many nations followed, and Elcor became a microcosm of U.S. immigration, mirroring the cultural assimilation of the time. At its peak around 1920, Elcor had two churches, a post office, a general store, a primary school, a railroad station, and its own law enforcement, and housed a population of nearly 1,000. Elcor was a mining location, built by the mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the residents to vacate the property so that it could reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies. In 1993, the Inland Steel Company began stockpiling the overburden from what is now the Minorca Mine over Elcor's former location. History =Establishment= Elcor came into existence with the opening of the Elba mine in 1897 and ended with the closing of the Corsica mine in 1954. The town was originally known as Elba, between the present-day cities of McKinley and Gilbert; the name \\"Elcor\\" was chosen later, by combining the first syllable of the name of each mine. As an Iron Range mining location, Elcor originally consisted of a grid of houses the mining company rented to its employees. It was one of nearly 50 mining locations between the present- day cities of Eveleth and Aurora. Some of these, like Sparta and Pineville, exist today; others, such as Franklin and Genoa, have been annexed by adjacent communities; most have disappeared entirely. Development of the Elba mine was carried out by the Minnesota Iron Company, and the first shipment of ore was made in 1898. The Minnesota Iron Company also had a controlling interest in Petit and Robinson, which owned the Corsica mine, where the first ore was shipped in 1901. Don H. Bacon, who joined the Minnesota Iron Company as general manager in 1887 and eventually became its president, was an ardent traveler who named many mines after Mediterranean islands, including Malta, Maiorica, Corsica, and Elba. He had a penchant for names beginning with the letter M. The Minnesota Steamship Company was organized by, and vertically integrated with, the Minnesota Iron Company to carry ore in 1889; its steamers and barges all had names that began with M, and the ships were referred to as the M fleet. Elba's street and avenue names also all began with M: Elcor townsite plat, c. 19211926 Mohawk Street Malta Street Manilla Street (this was also the main street) Manola Street Mariposa Avenue Mauna Loa Avenue Maritana Avenue Minorca Avenue The first street in Elba was Manilla Street. Company houses were constructed on both sides of it. The Elba group of mines was between 1 and 1.5 miles west of McKinley, and was usually classed with the McKinley district mines, which included the Elba and Corsica mines, and the La Belle mine, operated by the Pitt Iron Mining Company. The Minnesota Iron Company operated the Elba mine from 1898 to 1900 under the direction of M. E. McCarthy. Immediately after the formation of the United States Steel Corporation in 1901, Pickands Mather and Company acquired the Elba and Corsica mines, assuming the mineral leases and operating both after that date. Owners James Pickands, Samuel Mather and Jay Morse had been interested in the Corsica iron-ore properties for some time, and the mines remained on the firm's shipping roll for many years. William Philip Chinn was appointed superintendent of the Elba and adjacent Corsica mine under the new management of Pickands Mather and Company, succeeding McCarthy. Chinn was then on his way up in mining circles, ultimately becoming general manager of all Pickands Mather mining properties in the Lake Superior region in 1918; he was succeeded as superintendent of the Elba and Corsica mines by L. C. David. The Oliver Iron Mining Company also owned what they designated the \\"Elba No. 1 and No. 2 Reserve\\" ore bodies, but these were entirely different from the Elba and Corsica mines and remained undeveloped. = Peak years = The community grew at the beginning of the century. In 1902, the Corsica mine began operating in earnest and houses were quickly built. Company houses were built among the tall timbers. The community thrived on iron mining, its population nearing 1,000 after World War I, resulting in a neat and comfortable location comprising more than 100 houses. The townspeople were pioneers and largely immigrants, including Croatians, Slovenians, Finns, Italians, Germans, Scandinavians, and English, particularly from Cornwall. stack is farthest left In the early days, houses were made of wooden boards and surrounded by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most of the streets were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses dragging V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In the center of town was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs, and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office. The community's Finns organized a temperance society and built the Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts, and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district. One of the frame houses was used as the first school in Elcor. It was not long before a new school was constructed. Elcor was included in the middle part of the Gilbert School system, known then as Independent School District No. 18. There were five schoolhouses in the district. The McKinley-Elba school was built in 1900, halfway between McKinley and Elba, complete with its own well and windmill. It had four teachers and housed classes through the eighth grade, accommodating pupils of both communities. Students walked to school over boardwalks. There were also three primary schools in the district, one of them in Elba on Malta Street. Elcor's renters were required to take in boarders. The company rented a \\"cottage\\" for $7.50 per month, which later included electricity. Homes were charged an additional dollar per month when water was piped in from Gilbert. Although people were later allowed to own their homes (even though the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company), rents were never increased. All families had their own gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs, and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the Mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays. In 1920, the Finnish Hall became a general store, the Elcor Mercantile, along with an official U.S. Post Office. When the post office began operation, much confusion resulted, because there was another town named Elba in southeastern Minnesota, just east of Rochester. The name \\"Corsica\\" was attempted with the same result. Finally, the community was named \\"Elcor\\", combining the first syllable of each of the two names. \\"Elcor\\" was emblazoned in large white letters on the water tower. Mail was picked up twice daily at the railroad station, erroneously named \\"Elcore\\", for the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad (later the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad). Later, the Elcor Mercantile diversified into the up-and-coming petroleum business, selling Conoco gasoline, kerosene, fuel oils, motor oils, grease, and even outboard motors. Concrete sidewalks were built to line the shady streets, and bright red fire hydrants were installed. Homes were insulated, and people began to purchase refrigerators. Manilla Street and Maritana Avenue were paved. Greyhound Bus Lines established a stop at the Elcor Mercantile. A baseball team was entered in the old East Mesaba League, and the Elcor Mercantile sponsored the Elcor-Conocos, an ice hockey team that became one of the best on the Iron Range. Chicago Blackhawks ice hockey goaltender Sam LoPresti was born in Elcor. Aerial photo of Elcor in 1948, before its abandonment The Corsica and Elba mines remained the chief source of employment until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted into an open pit, and the future of the town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again. = Abandonment = Aerial photo of Elcor in 1961, after abandonment In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land. Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land. Residents of the company- owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through what was left of the town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community. Corsica mine smokestack before its demolition, c. 1967 For a time, the only landmark that remained at the old mining location was a smokestack near the defunct Corsica mine. The stack, built by Cornish miners in 1901, had a unique design. The Iron Range Historical Society wanted the stack, the last of its kind on the Mesabi Iron Range, to be preserved as an off-premises attraction, since it was structurally sound and historically significant, but its demolition had already been contracted as a part of the Minnesota Mineland Reclamation Act Abandoned Minelands Cleanup Program. Many people feared it might fall and injure someone; others considered it an aerial obstruction. In 1976, the stack was destroyed; it took three blasting attempts and nearly of dynamite to bring the structure down. After the demolition, responsibility for the land on which Elcor stood changed hands on several different occasions. As early as 1978, the property and its management were acquired by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. Property rights were then transferred to LTV Steel after the merger of Jones and Laughlin with Republic Steel in 1984. Property rights were later acquired by the Inland Steel Company in a transfer from LTV. In 1993, Inland Steel began stripping the overburden near the old town site, and the Laurentian mine was born. The mine is now owned by ArcelorMittal and has been redesignated the Laurentian pit of the Minorca mine after the acquisition of Inland Steel by Mittal in 1998. Geology Elcor sat atop a bed of taconite consisting of a uniform mixture of about 30 percent iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore containing 90 to 95 percent iron, a part of the Biwabik iron formation. The formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era on the bottom of the Animikie Sea. This sea occupied the western portion of the Great Lakes area, depositing iron-bearing sediments extending under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges in northern Minnesota, to the Gogebic Iron Range in northern Wisconsin and Michigan's upper peninsula, to the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range in central Minnesota. Michigan's silicious steel-blue high-grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was hydrated soft brown hematite. Geologists disagree about the geologic time period of the region and the mechanism by which the iron-bearing sediment was laid down differently on opposite sides of the lake. There is iron ore in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine. Geologists divide the iron-bearing rocks of the eastern Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. In the stratigraphic column, Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above, followed by four main iron-bearing divisions named the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty, and Lower Cherty. Below these are quartzite and granite. Beneath the shallow topsoil, the slate is from to several hundred feet thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from thick. Geography and climate Elcor lay at an elevation of in St. Louis County, Minnesota, north-northwest of Duluth. The nearest cities to Elcor were Gilbert, approximately to the southwest and McKinley, approximately to the east-northeast. Elcor was along the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135, almost east-southeast of U.S. Route 53 and about northeast of Minnesota State Highway 37. Elcor was in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province in the Arrowhead region of northern Minnesota. The polar air mass dominates this part of the state year-round. Precipitation ranges from about annually along the western border of the forest to about at its eastern edge. Average annual temperatures are about along the northern part of the forest, rising to at its southern extreme. Normal annual snowfall totals about . July is the warmest month, when the average high temperature is and the average low is . January is the coldest, with an average high temperature of and average low of . Elcor was approximately south-southwest of Tower, Minnesota, where the temperature reached a record low of on February 2, 1996.

The leading Italian two-year-old of 1960, he missed the first half of the following season through injury but returned to win his remaining four races, establishing himself as the top racehorse in Europe and one of the best horses ever trained in Italy. The highlight of his career came in France's most prestigious and valuable race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October, in which he defeated a strong international field. He was retired to stud at the end of 1961 and had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Molvedo was a brown horse standing 1.68 metres bred near Varese in Italy by the Razza Ticino. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Ribot, the best horse ever trained in Italy, who was unbeaten in a career of 16 races including two runnings of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the 1956 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Molvedo's dam, Maggiolina, was a descendant of the British broodmare Pearl Maiden and therefore from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 16-b which produced the Prix de l'Ard de Triomphe winner Pearl Cap and The Derby winner Pearl Diver. The colt was owned by Egidio Verga and trained throughout his career by Arturo Maggi near Milan. Molvedo was ridden in all of his major races by Enrico Camici. Racing career =1960: two-year-old season= Molvedo was the leading two-year-old in Italy in 1960. He won three of his four races, sustaining his only defeat when third to Adrasto in the Criterium Nazionale. In October, he won the Gran Criterium over 1600 metres at San Siro racecourse in Milan and the Premio Carlo Porta over 2000 metres at the same venue. =1961: three-year-old season= Molvedo had muscular problems and was lame in the spring of 1961 before reappearing in July, when he won the Premio d'Estate. In August, he was sent to race in France, where he contested the Grand Prix de Deauville over 2600 metres at Deauville Racecourse. He won by four lengths from Prix Ganay winner Misti with Taine in third place. In October, he returned to France for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started at odds of 1.8/1 in a field of nineteen runners. The race was expected to lie between Molvedo and the French four-year-old Right Royal, who had won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in July and who started favourite despite fears that he would be unsuited by the soft ground. Molvedo tracked the British runner High Hat (owned by Winston Churchill) before taking the lead early in the straight. The Italian colt opened a two-length lead and was never seriously challenged, winning from Right Royal with Misti in third ahead of High Hat and Match. On his final appearance, Molvedo returned to his home track at Milan and won the Gran Premio del Jockey Club by four lengths. Assessment The independent Timeform organisation assigned a rating of 137 to Molvedo in 1961, making him the highest-rated horse in Europe. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Molvedo the third-best Italian racehorse of the 20th century behind Ribot and Nearco. They also rated him the best horse foaled in 1958 and the best horse in the world in 1961. Stud record Molvedo made little impact as a sire in international terms, but had some success in his native Italy. His son Red Arrow won the Derby Italiano and the Gran Premio d'Italia in 1976, enabling Molvedo to be that season's champion Italian sire. He was also the damsire of Le Marmot and Orange Bay. Molvedo died in 1987.

The Republic of Ireland had deployed troops as United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) peacekeepers. The notoriety of the attack, and the allegations of mutilation and cannibalism that circulated in the Irish popular press in its aftermath, led to the word \\"baluba\\" (sometimes spelled \\"balooba\\") becoming a synonym for any \\"untrustworthy and barbaric\\" individual in certain parts of Ireland.Fionn Rogan, \\"Niemba – The Birth of an Army\\", University Times, Jan 10, 2014. However, the ambush was largely the result of mistaken identity. The Luba tribesmen seem to have mistaken the Irish UN troops for European mercenaries in the service of the State of Katanga, with whom they had recently been in conflict, the Baluba being opposed to Katangese secession. The Irish were part of a UN contingent that was sent to halt the Katangese secession from the Congo. Background Baluba militiamen in 1962 After the Belgian Congo became independent (as Republic of the Congo) in 1960, a civil war broke out in Katanga, the southern, mineral-rich province of the Congo. A separatist movement was fueled by mining companies who sought to continue their control of the resources in the region, as well as by local and tribal grievances. A local political leader, Moïse Tshombe declared Katanga an independent state. United Nations peacekeeping troops were invited to help restore order and to end the Katanga secession. The Republic of Ireland supplied troops as part of the UN force. Ireland had applied for membership of the United Nations in 1946, but because of Irish neutrality during World War II this had been vetoed by the Soviet Union until the end of 1955. The Irish Army was therefore anxious to become involved in ONUC and thereby validate Ireland's recent membership, but was unprepared in terms of experience, training, uniforms, arms and vehicles, and was generally reliant on interpreters. The Luba people or \\"Baluba\\" ethnic group did not support the Katangese secession. As a result they came under attack from pro-Katangese and allied forces. The area around the railway station at Niemba suffered several raids by both Baluba and local Pygmy tribes. On 4 October, several villages were attacked by Katangese gendarmes and European mercenaries and many Baluba were massacred. This left them suspicious of and hostile to any white European troops.\\"Letters from Niemba: Irish troops in the Congo, 1960\\", History Ireland, Issue 6 (Nov/Dec 2010), Volume 18. Most surrounding villages has been deserted by their inhabitants. Irish troops were sent to the area to secure it and encourage local people to return. A search of the area identified a damaged bridge, which a patrol was sent to, with a mission to effect repairs if possible.  Ambush  On 8 November 1960 an eleven-man section from the Irish Army's 33rd Battalion arrived at the bridge over the Luweyeye River. They were forced to leave their vehicles when they encountered a blockade on the road. While clearing it, they encountered about 100 Luba militiamen armed with bows, poison-tipped arrows, spears and clubs, as well as some guns. While the Irish troops had arrived to protect the Baluba, the militia undoubtedly took them for Katangese mercenaries. Lieutenant Kevin Gleeson, advancing unarmed with his platoon sergeant, Hugh Gaynor, attempted to greet them peacefully, but was hit with a barrage of poison-tipped arrows. The section leader, Lt. Kevin Gleeson, and Sergeant Gaynor were overtaken and beaten and hacked to death. The surprised Irish soldiers, who had not been deployed in a defensive formation after dismounting from their vehicles, retreated behind trees on either side of the road and opened fire on the tribesmen with their Gustav submachine guns, Lee–Enfield rifles and Bren light machine guns. The Baluba however advanced on them, and the Irish were cut off from their vehicles. Despite taking heavy losses, the Baluba overran the Irish soldiers and fierce hand-to-hand fighting broke out, during which most of the Irish troops were killed. The surviving Irish troops regrouped by a ridge but were surrounded by the Baluba, and fought to hold them off, but their position was rapidly overrun, and all but three of them were killed. The three survivors managed to escape. One of them, Anthony Browne, reached a nearby village and gave all the money he had to the village women, hoping they would get him help, but was instead mobbed and beaten to death by the village men. His body was recovered two years later. The two surviving soldiers managed to hide and were found by other UN troops the following day. A total of nine Irish soldiers died: Lt. Kevin Gleeson of Carlow, Sgt. Hugh Gaynor of Blanchardstown, Cpl. Peter Kelly of Templeogue, Cpl. Liam Dougan of Cabra, Pt. Matthew Farrell of Jamestown, Dublin, Tpr. Thomas Fennell of Donnycarney, Tpr. Anthony Browne of Rialto, Pte. Michael McGuinn of Carlow, and Pte. Gerard Killeen of Rathmines. Some 25 Baluba were also killed. Aftermath The bodies of the Irish dead were flown to Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, where they lay in state. Lt. Kevin Gleeson's coffin was placed on a gun carriage, while those of the rest were placed on army trucks. Following a funeral procession through Dublin, they were buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. For his conduct during the ambush, 19-year- old Trooper Browne was posthumously awarded the Military Medal for Gallantry (the MMG), the Republic of Ireland's highest military award. He was the first recipient of the award. The citation read: \\"He endeavoured to create an opportunity to allow an injured comrade to escape by firing his Gustaf thereby drawing attention to his own position which he must have been aware would endanger his life. He had a reasonable opportunity to escape because he was not wounded but chose to remain with an injured comrade.\\"Clark, John, Gallantry Medals & Decorations of the World, Pen and Sword, 200, p.54. At the time it was assumed that Browne had been killed at the scene. It was only later discovered that he had survived for two days before being killed in a separate attack. A stone commemorating Lt. Gleeson can be found in his hometown of Carlow while a plaque commemorating Sgt. Hugh Gaynor can be found in his hometown of Blanchardstown. Thomas Kenny, one of the survivors, believes that the real circumstances of Anthony Browne's death were misrepresented by the army, because they wished to have a hero to offer to the public. The wording of the citation implied that Browne had died trying to protect the wounded Kenny, by moving into the open and drawing fire on himself, letting an opportunity to escape pass. In fact he did escape into the forest.\\"Congo massacre survivor: Army must tell real story\\", Irish Independent, 5, November, 2000. Effects in Ireland Fionn Rogan argues that the massacre had a corrosive effect in the Republic of Ireland, where there had been strong support for the Congo expedition: The Baluba has long been associated with acts of cannibalism.Michael B. Lentakis, Ethiopia: A View from Within, Janus, 2005, p.306. Lurid stories circulated in the Irish popular press that the bodies of the victims had been mutilated and that their hearts had been removed to be eaten by the Baluba.Prendeville, Tom, \\"Congo Hell Cannibals Killed My Comrades ..And Ate Every One; Irish Soldier Who Survived Jungle Horror...And Still Waits For Medal\\", 30 May 2004, The People, London.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on January 15, 2013. The episode is written by Christopher J. Waild, Gary Glasberg and Scott Williams and directed by Arvin Brown, and was seen live by 22.86 million viewers. \\"Shiva\\" follows \\"Shabbat Shalom\\", which aired the previous week and featured the shooting deaths of Mossad Director Eli David, the father of Ziva David, and Jackie Vance, the wife of NCIS Director Leon Vance. In the episode, Ziva and Vance must cope with the deaths of both Eli and Jackie as the rest of the team investigates the tragedy. While searching for answers, the characters also deal with the looming threat of war between Israel and Iran. \\"Shiva\\", together with \\"Shabbat Shalom\\", sets in motion the primary long-term storyline in the second half of the tenth season. The arc is additionally significant in terms of character development — Director Vance, then regarded as the character with the most stable home life, is left a widower with two children while Ziva loses her last remaining family member, her mother and siblings having all been killed prior. \\"Shiva\\" was received with overwhelmingly positive reviews and became the most watched episode of the series, surpassing season 8's \\"Freedom\\", the previous series high in viewers. Etymology Shiva (שבעה), which literally means \\"seven\\" in Hebrew, is the week-long mourning period in Judaism for a \\"first-degree\\" relative: parent, sibling, spouse or child. The ritual is called sitting Shiva and is begun immediately following the funeral of the deceased relative. In this case, it refers to Ziva's mourning the death of her father. Plot The episode opens depicting a young Ziva (Gabi Coccio) praying the Shabbat blessing over candles, with her father (Ben Morrison) standing next to her. Various other family members, now deceased, are shown surrounding her, including her mother, older brother Ari, and younger sister Tali. The memory fades and an adult Ziva appears in a synagogue questioning God, \\"Why should I not be angry, with all that has been taken?\\" She further pleads for a sign that she should not lose hope. Tony then enters the room and attempts to offer support, though she declines any expressions of sympathy, saying that she instead needs \\"revenge\\". SecNav Jarvis orders that the deaths of Eli David and Director Vance's wife, Jackie, be kept quiet to avoid an outcry while the identity of the perpetrator is still unknown. Meanwhile, Ducky determines that the shooter was a Swedish mercenary who was hired to perform the killings. As Ziva and Vance struggle to cope with their losses, both attempt to participate in the investigation despite being prohibited due to their relationships with the deceased. NCIS Deputy Director Jerome Craig (Greg Germann) is brought in to temporarily replace Vance, and Eli's burial is delayed due to the investigation, causing Ziva further pain as Jewish law mandates that a person be buried within twenty-four hours. The team first suspects Arash Kazmi (Nasser Faris), the Iranian Eli had met with days earlier to discuss the possibility of peace between their countries, though Kazmi protests his innocence and offers VEVAK files (intel) to support his claims. McGee contacts Gavriela Adel (Georgia Hatzis), a Mossad agent stationed in Jerusalem, who suggests Duane Gustafson (Forry Smith), an American millionaire who funded an anti-Mossad group, as a potential suspect. Gustafson, however, insists that his association with anti-Israel organizations is \\"strictly business\\". Because Gibbs is concerned that Ziva will be the next target, Tony takes her to his apartment as a precaution. Still trying to console her, he brings her longtime Israeli friend Shmeil (Jack Axelrod) to stay with them and lets her sleep in his bed. Later, he attempts to soothe her after a nightmare, but Ziva again refuses comfort and insists that she is \\"fine\\". Mossad Deputy Director Ilan Bodnar (Oded Fehr), described by Ziva as Eli's protegé, arrives at NCIS demanding answers and exasperated that Kazmi has not yet been charged. Ziva, in turn, is infuriated that the team is sharing information with Ilan, a man who considered himself to be like a son to Eli, that was withheld from her, his blood daughter. Tony responds, \\"Now you are the daughter of a dead man — let yourself act like one.\\" The NCIS team locates a bank account under the name of \\"Virtue\\" that allows them to track the man who hired the hitman while Ziva speaks to Ilan over video chat. Ziva agrees to Ilan's request to meet her at the apartment before Gibbs calls her and asks her about the significance of \\"Virtue\\". She realizes that the Hebrew word for \\"virtue\\" is Ilan's middle name, prompting them to come to the conclusion that he must have been behind the killings. Gibbs and Tony rush to the apartment before Bodnar reaches it, presumably to kill Ziva, but he never shows. Shortly afterwards, Kazmi's vehicle is bombed, killing Kazmi and Bodnar disappears. The Western Wall in Jerusalem, where Ziva was shown praying in the final scenes of the episode. Eli's body is released for burial that evening, and Tony goes to the airport to see Ziva before she leaves for Israel. He urges her not to seek revenge on her own, and, though she does not renounce her desire to do so, she assures him that for now, she is only attending a funeral. They embrace, with Ziva finally accepting comfort for her loss, and Tony reminds her in Hebrew, \\"Aht lo levad\\" (\\"You are not alone\\"). The episode ends with Jackie's funeral and Ziva mourning Eli in Israel, visiting the Western Wall, and planting an olive tree as Patty Griffin's \\"You Are Not Alone\\" plays in the background. Production =Writing= \\"Shiva\\" was written by Christopher J. Waild, Gary Glasberg and Scott Williams and directed by Arvin Brown. As the episode focused on the aftermath of Eli and Jackie's deaths, the writers discussed which response Ziva and Vance would pursue. \\"The natural response to the murders of Eli David and Jackie Vance would be all about revenge\\", but the writers \\"realized that it might be better for [the] characters to take a breath\\". Even though Ilan Bodnar wasn't caught in the episode, \\"Ziva and Vance will get to pursue justice soon enough\\". About the deaths of Eli and Jackie, executive producer Gary Glasberg told TVLine \\"this is something that we’ve been talking about for a long time\\". The death of Jackie was chosen because Glasberg \\"wanted to do something that would open up [Vance's] world a bit\\". The same goes for the death of Eli, \\"It opened a lot of doors\\" for the writers. He also stated that Jackie's death illustrated the impact of collateral damage, saying, \\"One of the things I wanted to touch upon was when people do what our team does for a living as NCIS agents, it is easy to forget that there are civilian casualties that go along with it.\\" On the long-term repercussions, Glasberg added that \\"[Vance] is clearly going to need some time to be there for his family. It's just a matter of balancing work with personal life...There's a real sort of clue trail that unfolds specific to Ziva and her world as to who's responsible. Ziva certainly has to deal with the loss and the tumultuous familial background that she has...Even with the complexity of what existed between Ziva and Eli, at the end of the day, he was her father and she loved him. There are good memories that go with the bad...It absolutely weighs on her. When anyone loses someone, you think about what they meant to you and what part of them you continue to carry. I think those are questions she will continue to seek and look for answers to as she moves forward.\\"Bryant, Adam (January 15, 2013). \\"NCIS Boss on Double-Death Twist: What's Next for Ziva and Vance?\\" TV Guide. Retrieved January 25, 2013. It was also pointed out that the shootings, and the revelation that the perpetrator was someone Ziva had known since childhood, would affect the relationships of certain characters: \\"It certainly raises the point of who [Ziva] can trust and who she holds close. She has her NCIS family and it impacts her relationship with Gibbs [Mark Harmon] and with Tony [Michael Weatherly]. Tony really stepped up in this last episode and that will continue to happen. The complexity and fun of the Ziva/Tony relationship will continue.\\" =Casting= Israeli actor Oded Fehr, who portrayed Mossad Deputy Director Ilan Bodnar. Several recurring characters reappeared in the episode. Matt Craven and Nasser Faris reprised their roles as Clayton Jarvis and Arash Kazmi respectively. Jack Axelrod, first seen in the Season 10 episode \\"Gone\\", portrayed Shmeil Pinkhas. Akinsola Aribo and Kiara Muhammad reprised their roles as Director Vance's children. On November 16, 2012, TV Line announced the casting of Greg Germann as Director Vance's \\"next in charge\\", Deputy Director Jerome Craig. Germann could play a \\"potentially recurring role\\". Glasberg clarified, \\"I don’t want people to think Greg coming in is replacing Vance in any way. That is not the case. This is true in the real world of NCIS as well. This is a very close-knit organization and people really do have their backs. I wanted to touch on that as well.\\" On November 29, 2012, three other roles were confirmed for the episode: \\"a Mossad associate director\\" (Oded Fehr); \\"an American businessman whose oil fortune burdens him with ties to the Middle East\\" (Forry Smith); and \\"Gavriela, a sexy and smart Israeli informant for the CIA, played by Georgia Hatzis\\". Cote de Pablo (who portrays Ziva) added that Gavriela \\"may actually come back, depending on the storyline and how it unfolds\\". In January 2013, Telegram & Gazette reported, \\"Gabi Coccio, 13, formerly of Holden, will appear at 8 p.m. Tuesday night on the CBS crime drama NCIS, which stars Mark Harmon.\\" The article added that, according to Coccio's father, \\"Gabi has done some other things but this is her first national appearance and first on a show like this.\\" Another report stated that she would depict a 13-year-old Ziva for a flashback in the opening scene. Ben Morrison, likewise, acted alongside her as a younger version of Eli. In November 2012, it was reported, \\"NCIS is looking for someone to play a minister to perform at a...wait for it...funeral service.\\" Kim Estes was later cast to perform Jackie Vance's funeral. Reception =Ratings= \\"Shiva\\" was seen by 22.86 million live viewers in the United States following its broadcast on January 15, 2013, with a 3.9/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Shiva\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 17.63 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"Shabbat Shalom\\", \\"Shiva\\" was up in both viewers and adults 18–49. It was later reported that the \\"total rose to 25.36 million viewers in L+3, marking the first NCIS broadcast to deliver more than 25 million viewers in Live + DVR viewing.\\"Andreeva, Nellie (February 1, 2013).

NCIS Season 10 \\"Shiva\\" Review – Best Ziva Episode Ever. TV Equals. Retrieved January 25, 2013. Some reviewers commended the character development, in particular of Tony, in the episode. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 5 (out of 5) and stated that \\"The writers must be applauded: the story flowed exactly as it should have and there was a richness and depth to almost every scene. Gone (for the most part) was Tony the comedian and in his place was Tony the rock, which we saw when he entered the temple where Ziva was praying. He didn't try to manage her, or come up with a solution or a fleeting sentiment...[He] was so tuned into Ziva's torment – he didn't make a wrong move at any time. And every choice he made was dead-on.\\" Bradley Adams of SpoilerTV.com wrote, \\"In 'Shiva' we saw a new personality in many of the characters. Ziva and Vance's hunger for revenge was very clear throughout this episode. Even more obvious, was the way Tony acted. Unlike the usual joking around Tony, we saw a very serious and caring side in him. He became an even more important character than usual...Tony's send-off for Ziva was brilliant of him. Aht lo leh-vahd, 'You are not alone' in English, showed Ziva how much he cared for her.\\" Paulette Cohn of Xfinity called the choice to kill off two characters in one episode \\"bold\\" and speculated about the long-term impact: \\"Jackie’s death gives the 10-year-old series a chance to explore new territory and new storylines now that Vance is a widower...It will, of course, also be a very trying time for Ziva. She had a love/hate relationship with her father, but at the end of the day — as is true with a lot of people and their families — she loved him. Her grief is compounded by the fact that Ziva has a very complex family history, including the loss of her sister and having had to kill her half-brother Ari. And now, her father was betrayed — shot to death — by a man who was like an adopted son to him.\\" Adams called the final minutes of the episode \\"one of the saddest scenes [he had] ever seen\\" and said, \\"Ziva's traditional burial for her father, despite her being alone, was a very melancholy scene, and vastly affected the episode. The same could be said for another grieving family, the Vance family. Vance discovered in this episode what Gibbs felt after his wife and daughter were killed. This scene (Ziva's bit included) almost brought me to tears. The music used could not have been better chosen, and really added that extra bit of sorrow to the scene.\\" Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic called the closing montage set to \\"Not Alone\\" by Patti Griffin \\"moving\\" and said that the entire episode was \\"heartbreaking and surprisingly complex\\". Other critics questioned the possibility of a hidden political message. Edwin Frankel, Columbus Judaism Examiner, wrote, \\"I am amazed more often than not by the respect the show creators usually show for Judaism and for Israel as they depict one of the show's key personalities, Ziva David, an NCIS special agent played by Cote de Pablo.\\" Frankel expressed concern for the plot twist making Eli David's killer another Israeli, seeing Bodnar's overall motivation as the root of the issue. Though Bodnar was later established to have acted alone, when the episode first aired it was \\"unclear if the killing was the act of a deranged individual seeking self promotion, or if it was a matter of Mossad policy, or perhaps worse, the act of the Israeli government\\".

From a sample preparation point of view, it may refer to some of the following as well as other genetic neuron labeling techniques, * Anterograde tracing, for labeling from the cell body to synapse; * Retrograde tracing, for labeling from the synapse to cell body; * Viral neuronal tracing, for a technique which can be used to label in either direction; * Manual tracing of neuronal imagery. In broad sense, neuron tracing is more often related to digital reconstruction of a neuron's morphology from imaging data of above samples.  Digital neuronal reconstruction and neuronal tracing  Digital reconstruction or tracing of neuron morphology is a fundamental task in computational neuroscience. It is also critical for mapping neuronal circuits based on advanced microscope images, usually based on light microscopy (e.g. laser scanning microscopy, bright field imaging) or electron microscopy or other methods. Due to the high complexity of neuron morphology and often seen heavy noise in such images, as well as the typically encountered massive amount of image data, it has been widely viewed as one of the most challenging computational tasks for computational neuroscience. Many image analysis based methods have been proposed to trace neuron morphology, usually in 3D, manually, semi- automatically or completely automatically. There are normally two processing steps: generation and proof editing of a reconstruction. =History= The need to describe or reconstruct a neuron's morphology probably began in early days of neuroscience when neurons were labeled or visualized using Golgi's methods. Many of the known neuron types, such as pyramidal neurons and Chandelier cells, were described based on their morphological characterization. The first computerized microscope for analyzing neuronal morphology created by Dr. Edmund Glaser and Dr. Hendrik Van der Loos in the 1960s The first computer-assisted neuron reconstruction system, now known as Neurolucida, was developed by Dr. Edmund Glaser and Dr. Hendrik Van der Loos in the 1960s. Modern approaches to trace a neuron started when digitized pictures of neurons were acquired using microscopes. Initially this was done in 2D. Quickly after the advanced 3D imaging, especially the fluorescence imaging and electron microscopic imaging, there were a huge demand of tracing neuron morphology from these imaging data. =Methods= Schematic illustration of digital tracing of a neuron's morphology Neurons can be often traced manually either in 2D or 3D. To do so, one may either directly paint the trajectory of neuronal processes in individual 2D sections of a 3D image volume and manage to connect them, or use the 3D Virtual Finger painting which directly converts any 2D painted trajectory in a projection image to real 3D neuron processes. The major limitation of manual tracing of neurons is the huge amount of labor in the work. Automated reconstructions of neurons can be done using model (e.g. spheres or tubes) fitting and marching, pruning of over-reconstruction, minimal cost connection of key points, ray-bursting and many others. Skeletonization is a critical step in automated neuron reconstruction, but in the case of all-path-pruning and its variants it is combined with estimation of model parameters (e.g. tube diameters). The major limitation of automated tracing is the lack of precision especially when the neuron morphology is complicated or the image has substantial amount of noise. Semi-automated neuron tracing often depends on two strategies. One is to run the completely automated neuron tracing followed by manual curation of such reconstructions. The alternative way is to produce some prior knowledge, such as the termini locations of a neuron, with which a neuron can be more easily traced automatically. Semi-automated tracing is often thought to be a balanced solution that has acceptable time cost and reasonably good reconstruction accuracy. The open source software Vaa3D-Neuron, Neurolucida 360, Imaris Filament Tracer and Aivia all provide both categories of methods. Tracing of electron microscopy image is thought to be more challenging than tracing light microscopy images, while the latter is still quite difficult, according to the DIADEM competition. For tracing electron microscopy data, manual tracing is used more often than the alternative automated or semi-automated methods. For tracing light microscopy data, more times the automated or semi-automated methods are used. Since tracing electron microscopy images takes substantial amount time, collaborative manual tracing software is useful. Crowdsourcing is an alternative way to effectively collect collaborative manual reconstruction results for such image data sets. =Tools and software= A number of neuron tracing tools especially software packages are available. One comprehensive Open Source software package that contains implementation of a number of neuron tracing methods developed in different research groups as well as many neuron utilities functions such as quantitative measurement, parsing, comparison, is Vaa3D and its Vaa3D-Neuron modules. Some other free tools such as NeuronStudio also provide tracing function based on specific methods. Neuroscientists also use commercial tools such as Neurolucida, Neurolucida 360, Aivia, Amira, etc. to trace and analyse neurons. Recent studies show that Neurolucida is cited over 7 times more than all other available neuron tracing programs combined, and is also the most widely used and versatile system to produce neuronal reconstruction. The BigNeuron project (http://bigneuron.org) is a recent substantial international collaboration effort to integrate the majority of known neuron tracing tools onto a common platform to facilitate Open Source, easy accessing of various tools at one single place. Powerful new tools such as UltraTracer, that can trace arbitrarily large image volume, have been produced through this effort. =Neuron formats and databases= Reconstructions of single neurons can be stored in various formats. This largely depends on the software that have been used to trace such neurons. The SWC format, which consists of a number of topologically connected structural compartments (e.g. a single tube or sphere), is often used to store digital traced neurons, especially when the morphology lacks or does not need detailed 3D shape models for individual compartments. Other more sophisticated neuron formats have separate geometrical modeling of the neuron cell body and neuron processes using Neurolucida among others. There are a few common single neuron reconstruction databases. A widely used database is http://NeuroMorpho.Org which contains over 86,000 neuron morphology of >40 species contributed worldwide by a number of research labs. Allen Institute for Brain Science, HHMI's Janelia Research Campus, and other institutes are also generating large-scale single neuron databases. Many of related neuron data databases at different scales also exist. =References= Category:Neuroscience Category:Cellular neuroscience ","title":"Neuronal tracing"},{"id":"38330851","title":"Sanremo Music Festival 2013"},{"id":"38330872","text":"Sisu KB-46 is a prototype of a three-axle, six-wheel-driven off-road lorry made by the Finnish heavy vehicle producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) in 1968. Its capacity is three tonnes and it was produced after an assignment of the Finnish Defence Forces to tow heavy cannons.  Technical data  The vehicle is powered by a 13.12-litre V8 Leyland O.801 engine, of which Sisu model code is BY. KB-46 was the first Sisu powered by this engine type. The chassis is built on a rigid tubular frame which also consists the fuel tank. The vehicle is equipped with Sisu Nemo hydraulic transmission system for trailer. The axles are equipped with CTI system and special Goodyear tyres with an extra small air volume. The prototype got a rectangular shaped concept cabin that came later into production in Sisu M-series. An additional cabin for crew was installed in the Defence Forces' Transportation Vehicle Depot. The vehicle kerb weight is 8 000 kg and the payload in terrain is just 3 000 kg. The maximum weight for a normal trailer is 5 000–7 000 kg and for a driven trailer 7 000–10 000 kg.  Characteristics  The prototype vehicle toured with a Tampella 122 K 60 cannon, fitted with hydraulic drive, in agricultural fairs in Finland where it was displayed at the Defence Forces' stand. Neither the vehicle, nor the cannon entered serial production; KB-46 was designed in a short time and there was used many new technical solutions without previous experience. Hence, there appeared several defects. Also the engine type proved technically failed. KB-46 was never homologated but the prototype stayed in use of the Defence Forces. The military personnel got frustrated at repairing the vehicle which was repeatedly broken and deliberately procrastinated its repairing in the 1970s until it was, after standing useless for a few years at the depot, taken to a museum.

It was run by chef Magnus Nilsson between 2008 and 2019. The food served at the restaurant was localised to the estates around the restaurant, with only a handful of exceptions. Fäviken was placed in The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2012, and named as one of the top ten restaurants in the world by the Zagat guide in 2013. The restaurant closed December 14th, 2019, because Nilsson wanted to move on to other projects.Why Fäviken, the restaurant in Sweden made famous by ‘Chef’s Table,’ is closing Description Chef Magnus Nilsson at Fäviken The restaurant is located on the 19th century Fäviken Egendom estate, which consists of 20,000 acres of farmland, and is located around north of Stockholm, and by road from the Åre ski resort. The current owners purchased the property in 2003, and hired chef turned sommelier Magnus Nilsson in 2008 to oversee the wine cellars. He moved into the kitchen after being unable to find someone else to do so and became head chef. Nilsson described its former operation as a \\"moose fondue restaurant\\". The restaurant has 16 seats, that includes a communal table. Breakfast is only served to customers who stay overnight in one of the six rooms. There are three chefs at the restaurant, including Nilsson, and a total of seven staff overall including the gardener who is shared with the estate. Nilson released a cookbook named after the restaurant on 1 October 2012. The foreword was supplied by food writer Mattias Kroon. =Menu= The cuisine served at Fäviken is influenced by Nordic cuisine, and uses local ingredients that come from either the estate or very close nearby. The exceptions to this localisation of the cuisine are sugar, salt, and alcoholic vinegar. Fish are caught by the chef himself in a local pond, with the dishes changing depending on what is caught. Nilsson has explained that he does not believe that New Nordic cuisine exists, but instead the catch-all description allows individual Scandinavian restaurants to create their own styles of food. Diners at Fäviken are typically served fourteen courses in addition to appetisers. The dishes on the menu include warm marrowbone which is extracted from a cow's shinbone using a two-man saw in the middle of the dining room itself. That dish in particular is accompanied by diced cubes of raw beef heart, shaved carrot and green sage salt. Other theatrical dishes include an ice cream maker which Nilsson purposely does not maintain: \\"I deliberately don't take care of my ice cream maker so it will make a lot of eeer-awww, eeeeh-errrkk sounds\\" he explained. Vegetables are sometimes stored for up to eight months in a root store before being used. Reception Adam Sachs of Bon Appétit magazine described Fäviken as \\"the world's most daring restaurant\\". Fäviken was named 34th in The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2012, the first time it had appeared on the list. Chef René Redzepi, of the 1st place restaurant Noma, said \\"if I had a chance to go anywhere in the world right now, I would go to Fäviken.\\" Fäviken was named to the top ten restaurants in the world by the Zagat guide in 2013. In 2016, Fäviken was awarded two stars by Guide Michelin. A reviewer for the British newspaper The Independent wrote that \\"Dinner at Faviken is never anything less than interesting, even if there are elements (potatoes cooked in decomposed autumn leaves) that are more pretentious than flavourful.\\" Another reviewer for the Daily Telegraph wrote \\"Faviken's peerless confluence of improbable setting, unique dishes and the castaway romance of a chef who left the world behind only for it follow him elevated our dinner into \\"most memorable meal ever\\" territory.\\" In 2014, season 3 of PBS's The Mind of a Chef series featured chef Nilsson in episodes 9 through 16. Each episode showed a different aspect of the chef's interest in Nordic cuisine and traditions and his process in creating dishes for Fäviken. Episode 16, titled \\"Fäviken,\\" gave viewers a behind the scene look during a dinner service at the restaurant. Fäviken and chef Magnus Nilsson were also featured in episode six of the first season of Netflix's Chef's Table series in 2015.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4295140/ References External links Category:Restaurants in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Jämtland County Category:Michelin Guide starred restaurants in Sweden ","title":"Fäviken"},{"id":"38331030","text":"Karri Timo Mikael Sirén, professionally known as Karri Koira, is a Finnish rapper, R&B; artist and producer.  Career beginning  Karri Koira rose to fame as a member of the group Vähäiset äänet and gained even wider audience in the summer of 2011 with Ruudolf on the single \\"Mammat riivaa\\", a Finnish remake of \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Lucenzo and Don Omar. He has collaborated with several other Finnish rappers as well, such as Kemmuru and JVG. Karri Koira has stated that he draws inspiration from artists such as Ginuwine and D'Angelo. In addition to his musical career, Karri Koira has been doing radio programs for Radio Helsinki since 2005.  Breakthrough album and critical reception  Karri Koira's first solo album K.O.I.R.A., produced by Ruudolf, was released on 30 November 2012. Heini Strand of Rumba gave the album four out of five stars saying that the album is great material for making out, while also noticing that the lyrics are slightly naive at times. Mikko Meriläinen of Soundi was more reserved, giving the album two out of five stars. Although he had enjoyed Karri Koira's previous singles, he found the musically stylish album to be overshadowed by Karri Koira's somewhat limited vocal abilities and awkward phrasing.  Musical style and commercial reception  While the album leans more towards R&B; than rap, Karri Koira has said that it is all part of natural evolving, not a chosen decision. K.O.I.R.A. peaked at number six on the Official Finnish Albums Chart. Four singles with accompanying music videos have been released from the album; \\"Amerikankotka liitää\\" featuring an appearance by Ruudolf, \\"Kaikki tai ei mitään\\", \\"H-Kaupunki\\" and \\"Lähe mun kaa\\". The fourth single is the first to appear on the Official Finnish Singles Chart, where it debuted at number 14 on 25 January 2013. Discography =Albums= *K.O.I.R.A.

Toronto Star, January 25, 2013. She currently sits as a non- affiliated Senator from Northwestern Ontario. She was removed from the Conservative caucus in 2017. She was suspended from the Senate twice; a first time for posting letters to her website that were considered to be offensive to First Nations peoples, and a second time for failing to comply with mandated anti-racism training. Her latest suspension ended on August 18, 2020 when the session was prorogued. Career A business owner in Dryden, Ontario, Beyak worked in tourism, insurance and real estate. She co-owned a General Motors dealership and Ford dealership with her late husband. Beyak was previously a candidate for the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in the Ontario provincial elections of 1995 and 1999, and has served on the Fort Frances-Rainy River board of education. She was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 2013 by Stephen Harper. She sat as a Conservative until being expelled by the Conservative caucus in 2017. In 2020, she donated $1,000 to the People's Party of Canada, the maximum allowable donation.  Residential schools controversy  Beyak is critical of the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the Canadian Indian residential school system was plagued with systemic physical, mental, and sexual abuse and directly resulted in the death of at least six thousand children from malnutrition and disease. Beyak said that those findings overshadowed the \\"good deeds\\" of \\"well-intentioned\\" residential school workers. Beyak's statement was repudiated by New Democratic Party Indigenous Affairs critic and residential school survivor Romeo Saganash, who called on her to resign for praising a system that amounted to cultural genocide, as defined by the United Nations; Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs and Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, who called for better education on the subject matter; and Conservative Indigenous Affairs critic Cathy McLeod, who said that Beyak's praise did not reflect the views of the party, which under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, had made a formal apology for the residential schools. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde also criticized the statement for defending a system that had deep negative effects on Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Beyak would later attack criticism of her speech as fake news. However, Beyak's thoughts were deemed out of line with the Conservative party's history on the subject matter by the party's interim leader Rona Ambrose, who stated it was untenable for her to keep her position on the Aboriginal people's committee due to the misalignment of Beyak's comments. On April 5, 2017, Beyak was removed from her Aboriginal people's committee Senate post. After the Canadian government reorganized the Indian Affairs department August 28, 2017, forming two departments, for Indigenous and Northern Affairs and separately for Indigenous Services, each under its own minister, Sen. Beyak made another public statement: \\"Let's stop the guilt and blame and find a way to live together and share. Trade your status card for a Canadian citizenship, with a fair and negotiated payout to each Indigenous man, woman and child in Canada, to settle all the outstanding land claims and treaties, and move forward together ... All Canadians are then free to preserve their cultures in their own communities, on their own time, with their own dime. The emphasis should be on individual prosperity and responsibility, with more money in the pockets of the local people, and not just national leaders and bureaucracies.\\" According to Saskatoon StarPhoenix columnist Doug Cuthand, her comments indicated ignorance of history, as the indigenous peoples of Canada were extended Canadian citizenship in 1951. The mayors of Edmonton, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba have called on her to resign. According to Brian Giesbrecht of the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, \\"Sen. Beyak has an abiding belief that the system we have in this country is not working, despite what the flabbergasted mayor and interviewer think of her.\\" \\"When the senator says that status Indians are not true Canadian citizens, she is absolutely correct.\\" \\"The fact is that status Indians living on reserves are legally very different from mainstream Canadians in many important ways.\\" Following the backlash regarding her controversial speech, Ms. Beyak published, on her senate web page, samples of a large number of letters she received from Canadian citizens supporting her belief that what is being done for Canada's Indigenous People is not effective. Towards the end of December 2017, Beyak faced considerable social media backlash regarding these letters. On January 4, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh demanded Senator Beyak's resignation. In a statement to the media, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, explained that while most letters focused on the history of residential schools, some letters had comments regarding indigenous Canadians in general. He pointed out a particularly troubling passage from one of the letters, that stated \\"I'm no anthropologist but it seems every opportunistic culture, subsistence hunter/gatherers seeks to get what they can for no effort. There is always a clash between an industrial/organized farming culture that values effort as opposed to a culture that will sit and wail until the government gives them stuff\\", calling the comment \\"simply racist\\" and her promotion of such comments \\"offensive and unacceptable\\". In a media statement, Scheer said that he removed Beyak from the Conservative caucus after she refused his demand that she remove some of the comments. Scheer's spokesperson said this demand was made in a telephone call, but Beyak denied that Scheer, anyone from his office, or the Senate leadership had asked her to take down a letter. A senior Conservative source confirmed Beyak's account. Following a Senate inquiry, it was determined that Senator Beyak had breached the Ethics and Conflict of Interest Code for Senators by posting letters on her Senate website that contained racist content. She was ordered to remove the racist letters from her Senate website, to make a formal apology for posting the letters in question, and to complete a cultural sensitivity course with an emphasis on Indigenous issues. She subsequently refused to remove the letters, and was suspended from the Senate in April, 2019 for the remainder of the parliamentary session. =Second suspension= In January 2020, the Standing Committee on Ethics and Conflict of Interest for Senators again recommended that Beyak be suspended without pay for the remainder of the parliamentary session, citing her failure to adequately complete anti-racism training. During her anti-racism training sessions, Beyak said that she identified as Métis because her parents adopted an Indigenous child, a statement which prompted the Métis National Council to demand an apology and suggest Beyak resign. Subsequently Senator Beyak issued a Press Release stating \\"Media are reporting I am Metis, and although the Metis are a great nation I am not, have never been and never will be Metis, and have never said I was, at anytime, anywhere to anyone.\\" On February 27, 2020, the Senate imposed a second suspension on Beyak because of her failure to complete the required training. The senators approved a report from the standing committee on ethics and conflicts of interest which recommended that Beyak be suspended without pay for \\"the rest of the current term\\". In addition to her suspension, she was ordered to undertake anti-racism training. Canada's standing senate Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration (CIBA) met February 27, 2020 to formally remove Beyak from the senate payroll. Her suspension ended on August 18, 2020 when the session was prorogued. Personal life She married Tony Beyak on November 28, 1970 and they remained married until his death on April 8, 2002. They have two sons.

The web-based channel was created by hosts Blair Joscelyne (known as MOOG) and Martin \\"Marty\\" Mulholland. Debuting on January 9, 2008 the show runs in mini-seasons where Marty and Moog buy a car, modify that car, and then test the results. Sometimes they will each buy a car and modify them separately so they can then battle them against each other once the modifications have been completed. While typically based in Sydney, Australia, Marty and Moog have travelled extensively and filmed their journeys to create mini-movies from locations such as Japan, Cuba, Germany, the UAE, America, Switzerland, the UK, New Zealand, and more. They also host a news-style show, called The Unicorn Circuit, on their second YouTube channel (MCMtv2) which keeps fans up to date with MCM and wider automotive news, as well as fan-based submissions. All music used in the show and in associated feature films is composed and produced by Moog, with editing and uploading handled by both he and Marty.The mix of technical content with irreverent, sometimes quite random, humour and high production quality has found a fanbase among a wide demographic of people, leading to Mighty Car Mods videos to have been viewed more than 680 million times, making MCM one of the most successful shows of its type on YouTube. History Moog and Marty are long time friends, having met within the music industry. Blair chooses to use his stage name \\"MOOG\\" in the show and he is responsible for composing, performing and produces the music content for the series, playing several instruments himself. Marty is an accomplished musician and sometimes performs some music used in the series as well. MOOG is a composer and music producer, whose music can be heard in commercials, which include Telstra, Arnotts, Optus, Amex, Ford, BMW, Coles Supermarkets, Loveable Lingerie, IBM, L’Oreal, Heinz, OPSM, Subaru, Origin, Lexus, Jetstar, Touchstone Pictures, Visa Inc, Mazda, Cascade Brewery, Discovery Channel, Renault, Wrigley Company and Village Cinemas. He has released a number of solo albums and he has been involved with a variety of different bands, musical projects and sound making activities. Marty works in the music/audio production industry and he is a sound engineer by trade. Mighty Car Mods debuted in January 2008 with a video of working on Moog's 2001 Daihatsu Cuore with typical entry-level modifications of the period. The show was originally going to be called 'Clean & Green Car' and was to be about economical cars with a focus on small Japanese cars and sustainability. Format Each episode commences with a semi-animated introduction created by Gavin Tyrell, followed by Marty and Moog talking briefly about what the episode will entail, sometimes with a showcase of the previous episode's highlights. Episodes vary in duration, from 15-60mins, but most will typically run about 20 minutes. The general format for episodes involves buying a car and modifying it in a particular style or for a particular purpose. Sometimes Marty and Moog will buy a car independent of each other and modify them to then battle head-to- head in a series of specific challenges as with their recent $10,000 rear- engined challenge. Some cars feature in only a handful of episodes due to the simple nature of the modifications involved, while others have run for months due to the complexity and scale of the modifications being undertaken. Typically, cars featured in builds will be given a name to build an identity with viewers (like Yaris Hilton, or Taylor Drift), and it is a great opportunity for the boys to include a pun or 2 as both are highly qualified pun-masters.The show was originally filmed on Marty's mother's driveway and garage, but was moved to a private indoor location in Sydney in 2015, following issues with people posting spoilers or causing traffic issues in the suburban street. The MCM duo have released several feature-length films documenting automotive-focused travel, such as Turbos and Temples, Kei to the City, Chasing Midnight, and Turbos and Temples II, have drawn critical acclaim and positive accolades from around the world. They have also produced automotive mini-series including Lend us a Ride, and The Cars of Cuba, which have been filmed in parallel with their regular series, and several of their films and seasons have played on Discovery Channel, and on in-flight entertainment on Qantas airlines. The terms \\"mad\\" and \\"chopped\\" coined by Marty and Moog, are often attributed to the show in Australian pop-culture. Cast Originally debuting as a \\"phenom\\" with a soldering iron, Marty typically shows more technical expertise and hands-on mechanical skill in videos, while Moog will often handle creative tasks involving design or aesthetics. As both Marty and Moog are amateur mechanics with no formal qualifications in automotive repair or engineering the two will enlist the help of qualified experts for more complex tasks. Special guests include Miles \\"Dose Vader\\" Stinton , Scott \\"Tuning Fork\\" Hilzinger, Benny \\"Mechanical Stig\\" Neal, and Alan \\"Turbo Yoda\\" Butler. Typically these guests are known by their nicknames and have built a following of their own since appearing on the show. Both Turbo Yoda (with his offsider Woody) and Mechanical Stig have both created their own YouTube series. Turbo Yoda now hosts The Skid Factory while Mechanical Stig operates Benny's Custom Works and its matching YouTube channel. Reception Part of Mighty Car Mods success stems from the hosts' relatability as everyman car enthusiast as well as their humourous and laconic nature, and their desire to tackle complex tasks and learn new skills along the way. Their first feature-length film titled Turbos and Temples was well received by critics and motoring fans when it premiered at Hoyts Cinema, Fox Studios, in Sydney Australia.

His work consists of drawing, painting, and photography, as well as constructing three- dimensional dioramas. According to the artist, he considers his work to be \\"visual narratives\\" that can be regarded as linear, or non-linear according to the way the viewer interprets each scene. He often appropriates photographs, and found objects in his work. He is inspired by literature, philosophy, and human nature. Milan has said the works of Tennessee Williams, Alice Walker, and James Baldwin have offered him insight in their story-telling abilities. Early life and career Milan was born in 1977 in Knoxville, Tennessee, and it was here that he began to display his interest in art. His parents, Wardell Sr. and Linda Milan, provided a separate \\"studio space\\" in their home for him to work, while his teachers offered their encouragement throughout his high school education. Even though he is skilled in multiple mediums, as a teenager Milan focused primarily on photography. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Tennessee in 2001. After earning his undergraduate degree, Milan was an artist in residence at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine. He earned his Master of Fine Arts at Yale University in 2004, and soon after moved to New York.  Work  Milan's choice in using a wide range in media also offers insight into Milan's interpretation on the themes of beauty and sexuality in contemporary society. Other themes such as personal identity and the body are seen, as he draws from sports culture, pornography, and fashion. In 2005 after attending graduate school, he exhibited Frequency at The Studio Museum in Harlem, Greater New York. The exhibition showcased Milan skills of using a wide range of mediums in his paintings, drawings and large scale montage-style photographs. In that same year, Milan's first show abroad was La Beaute de l'Enfer at the Galerie Rodolphne Janssen in Brussels. The dioramas are three-dimensional constructions which Milan creates to photograph, and are presented as two- dimensional scenes. He never shows the physical constructions, but chooses to present the scenes at large scales. These dioramas often depict bizarre environments where objects and characters interact. Upon first glance the work appears to be digitally edited, but upon further investigation the viewer can see Milan's use of the camera. These scenes create spaces and \\"moments in time\\" that \\"would never exist\\". His Boxing Series was inspired by the H.G Wells novel, The Invisible Man. Milan was specifically interested in the scene from the book, the Battle Royale. He paid close attention to the character and his placement in that narrative to visualize that specific moment. This series, upon other works, consists of appropriated photographs which he collaged. The photographs were used from the book, The Fights which consist of photography taken by Charles Huff. Milan was interested in using the book, not only for inspiration, but regarded it as his \\"canvas\\". This series paved the way for Milan's larger bodies of work which carries similar characteristics in visualizing narratives. When describing his work in an article from Interview magazine, Wardell states: \\"I like this idea of creating duality of this uncomfortable shift for the viewer when they're looking at the work.\\" In 2012 Wardell Milan has been exhibiting selections from ongoing series of work on paper and photography. He showed A Series of Inspiring Women (2012) at the Louis B. James Gallery (10) in New York, Kingdom or Exile: Parisian Landscapes (2013) at Savannah College of Art and Design, and (Show Untitled) Parisian Landscapes (2014), curated by Isolde Brielmaier, at Osmos Address in New York. For his work he received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2014).

Life The son of an Orthodox priest, Mihai Șora studied philosophy at the University of Bucharest from 1934 to 1938, where he was a student of Mircea Eliade. From 1939 to 1948 he studied in Paris and Grenoble on a fellowship granted by the French government. He joined the French Communist Party during this period. After travelling back to Romania in 1948, Șora became a member of Romanian Communist Party and was employed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the time led by communist leader Ana Pauker. In interviews published after the fall of Communist Party rule, Șora claimed that he was unofficially \\"arrested\\". He was allegedly barred from holding a teaching appointment in communist Romania, but nevertheless became an influential editor for one of the main Romanian publishers, ESPLA. Șora's family emigrated to the West in the 1970s, and he was allowed to visit them in the 1980s. According to Aurelia Craiutu, he was allegedly forced to publish under pseudonyms rather than use his own name. However, Șora was still able to publish his third book in 1985. In March 1989 he joined intellectuals protesting the treatment of dissident poet Mircea Dinescu. After the fall of Nicolae Ceaușescu in December 1989, he briefly served as minister of education in Petre Roman's postrevolutionary coalition. He was one of only two cabinet members to endorse the March 1990 Timișoara Proclamation, which unsuccessfully proposed a law to prevent former Securitate members from occupying leading political positions. He was a member of the Group for Social Dialogue, writing for its weekly publication Revista 22, and the Civic Alliance Foundation, which later became the Civic Alliance Party.

Journalism  =Tom Wolfe= In 1963, Tom Wolfe approached Dobell at Esquire to propose an article on the hot rod and custom car culture of Southern California. Wolfe struggled with the article, developing writer's block, and was unable to complete it. Dobell suggested that Wolfe send him his notes so they could piece the story together. Wolfe procrastinated until, on the evening before the article was due, he worked all night typing a letter to Dobell explaining what he wanted to say on the subject, ignoring all journalistic conventions.

Intended to provide communication theorists with a valid model of small groups on which to conduct research, this perspective focuses on the principles of communication that take place within naturally formed social groups. This represented a shift in traditional research practices which had primarily consisted of studies on zero-history laboratory groups.  Definition  Bona Fide groups are naturally occurring groups which exhibit two primary elements: (1) they exists with relatively stable yet permeable boundaries and (2) they are marked by interdependence with the immediate context of individual group members, and links between boundaries and context. These characteristics allow for important elements of small groups, such as fluctuation in group member commitment level and a shared sense of boundaries. The nexus of Bona Fide group perspective is marked by \\"the point of contact or overlap between two or more groups\\"  Application  In their call for research to move its focus toward bona fide groups, Putnam and Stohl argued that this model is more ecologically valid than alternative case studies, and as such, it gives a more accurate reading of how small groups behave on a day- to-day basis. Furthermore, since it had already helped develop current research settings, methods, and variables, it most certainly will continue to shape small group communication studies. In the time since this initial argument was proposed, social scientists have generally agreed with Putnam and Stohl, and have redirected much of their research to emphasize bona fide groups as a model of small group communication. Bona Fide group leaders can display a number of characteristics to show an understanding of both a group's interdependence with its context and its permeable boundaries. Those in positions of oversight can do much to contribute to a group's success, regardless of whether the team is in a voluntary or secular setting, or has come together for a long or short period of time. Leaders must work towards creating a positive group culture, along with an emotional climate that is relaxed and warm. They must stay attuned to the individual needs of group members, always showing respect and dignifying them by preparing to lead the group. Leaders must also keep in mind that conflicts among group members may arise, and must be prepared to mediate those conflicts when necessary. In viewing group members as a team rather than an audience, leaders will encourage all members to participate in discussions and decision-making, \\"promote diversity of opinion, and actively foster critical thinking...\\" Through the Bona Fide Group perspective, working teams are seen as multi- faceted, emotional, and interconnected constructs that often operate towards achieving, not only their own goals, but also those of the organization within which the group finds itself in.

She was one of the most iconic singers of the Western-influenced popular music in Vietnam, known as 'New music of Vietnam ()'.Stewart Lone Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping ... 2007- Page 235 \\"As in many societies in the 1960s–1970s, recorded music came to play an increasing role in the daily lives of civilians with the ... One of the most famous singers in the more traditional style was Thái Thanh, a woman in her twenties who sang songs of longing and loss.\\"  Early and family life  Thái Thanh started her career before the First Indochina War when she was 14 years old, without any formal music education. She learned singing from her informal knowledge of northern Vietnamese folk singing and French music books, which she later fused in her performances. She was a member of her family-based band, Thăng Long, one of the first widely known music bands in Vietnam during the 20th century. She began her solo career and adopted her stage name Thái Thanh in 1950. Her older sister Phạm Thị Quang Thái was a famous singer under the stage name Thái Hằng, and her older brother Phạm Đình Chương was a prominent musical figure and singer under the stage name Hoài Bắc. Her brother-in-law was the leading songwriter Phạm Duy, who was married to Thái Hằng. In 1956, Thái Thanh married Lê Quỳnh, and they had three daughters and two sons together: Ý Lan (1957), Lê Việt (1958), Quỳnh Dao (1960), Thanh Loan (1962) và Lê Đại (1964). Career Thái Thanh later gained her prestige in the record industry and pop culture in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. She was famous for her performances of works by musicians including Đặng Thế Phong, Lê Thương, Văn Cao, Dương Thiệu Tước, Phạm Đình Chương, and especially Phạm Duy, her brother-in-law, with whom she had a long- lasting collaboration. Some of her most well-known songs, written by Phạm Duy, were Dòng sông xanh, Cho nhau, Nương chiều, Bà mẹ Gio Linh and Kỷ niệm. After 1975, Thái Thanh was banned from performing publicly due to her refusal to cooperate with the communist government of Vietnam. In 1985, she emigrated and became part of the Vietnamese musical diaspora in Orange County, California.Adelaida Reyes Songs of the Caged, Songs of the Free: Music and the Vietnamese Refugee Experience. 1999 Page 124 \\"The local in this case has global implications. Many of Vietnam's most famous musicians now reside in Orange County. The presence of Pham Duy, Thai Thanh, Hoang Oanh, Hoang Thi Tho, Viet Hung, Duy Khanh, Khanh Ly, and Kim Tuyen, among others — luminaries in the Vietnamese musical firmament by the time they left Vietnam — has led overseas..\\" Thái Thanh continued her music career amongst the Vietnamese community in the United States and Canada. In 2000, she suffered a brain haemorrhage, and announced her retirement in 2002, after 55 years of contribution to the music industry and pop culture of Vietnam throughout the 20th century. However, she did continue to appear on the music scene sporadically. Thái Thanh's unique style of singing combined Tonkinese folk music, French popular music, and Western opera. This pioneering singing style, had a significant impact on many younger singers and artists even after the Fall of Saigon. Death She died on March 17, 2020, in Orange County, California. In 2017, according to her eldest daughter Ý Lan, she had been in very poor health. According to the government-run newspaper Tuoi Tre, her voice was the most archetypal of Tân nhạc, and that she was 'a voice that spanned generations'. It described her death as a 'great loss' for Vietnamese music.

It was the standard British/Commonwealth sidearm in the Second World War, alongside the Webley Mk IV and Smith & Wesson Victory Model revolvers chambered in the same calibre. History After the First World War, it was decided by the British Government that a smaller and lighter .38 calibre (9.2 mm) sidearm firing a long, heavy 200 grain (13 g) soft lead bullet would be preferable to the large Webley service revolvers using the .455 (11.6 mm) round.Stamps, Mark, and Ian Skennerton, .380 Enfield Revolver No. 2, page 9.Smith, W.H.B, 1943 Basic Manual of Military Small Arms (facsimile), page 11. While the .455 had proven to be an effective weapon for stopping enemy soldiers, the recoil of the .455 cartridge complicated marksmanship training.Shore, C. (Capt), With British Snipers to the Reich, Paladin Press (1988), pp. 200-201 The authorities began a search for a double- action revolver with less weight and recoil that could be quickly mastered by a minimally trained soldier,Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, London: Orbis Publishing Ltd. (1979), p. 76: \\"the standard pistol training ammunition allocation per soldier was only 12 rounds per year\\" with a good probability of hitting an enemy with the first shot at extremely close ranges.Shore, C. (Capt), With British Snipers to the Reich, Paladin Press (1988), p. 201 By using a long, heavy, round-nosed lead bullet in a .38 calibre cartridge, it was found that the bullet, being minimally stabilised for its weight and calibre, tended to 'keyhole' or tumble longitudinally when striking an object, theoretically increasing wounding and stopping ability of human targets at short ranges.Shore, (1988) p. 202Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, 6th ed. DBI Books (1989), p. 239 At the time, the .38 calibre Smith & Wesson cartridge with lead bullet, known as the .38/200, was also a popular cartridge in civilian and police use (in the USA, the .38/200 or 380/200 was known as the .38 Super Police load). Consequently, the British firm of Webley & Scott tendered their Webley Mk IV revolver in .38/200 calibre.Maze, Robert J., Howdah to High Power, page 103. Rather than adopting it, the British authorities took the design to the Government-run Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield, and the Enfield factory came up with a revolver that was very similar to the Webley Mk IV .38, but internally slightly different. The Enfield- designed pistol was quickly accepted under the designation Revolver, No 2 Mk I, and was adopted in 1931,§ A6862, LoC followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double-action only),§ B2289, LoC and finally the Mk I (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.§ B6712, LoC Webley sued the British Government for £2,250, being \\"costs involved in the research and design\\" of the revolver. Their action was contested by Enfield, who stated that the Enfield No 2 Mk I was actually designed by Captain Boys (the Assistant Superintendent of Design, famous for the Boys Rifle) with assistance from Webley & Scott, and not the other way around—accordingly, their claim was denied. By way of compensation, however, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded Webley & Scott £1,250.Stamps, Mark, and Ian Skennerton, .380 Enfield Revolver No. 2, page 12. RSAF Enfield was unable to manufacture enough No. 2 revolvers to meet the military's wartime demands, and as a result Webley's Mk IV was issued as a substitute standard for the British Army. Variants An Enfield No. 2 Mk1 in fine condition. From bench rest at 25 yards. One hand rapid fire group with Enfield 38/200 There were two main variants of the Enfield No 2 Mk I revolver. The first was the Mk I*, which had a spurless hammer and was double-action only, meaning that the hammer could not be thumb-cocked by the shooter for each shot. Additionally, in keeping with the revolver's purpose as a close-range weapon, the handgrips, now made of plastic, were redesigned to improve grip when used in rapid double-action fire; the new handgrip design was given the designation Mk II.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 141 The majority of Enfields produced were either Mk I* or modified to that standard.Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, London: Orbis Publishing Ltd. (1979), p. 76 The second variant was the Mk I, which was a 1942 variant of the Mk I* simplified in order to increase production, but was discontinued shortly thereafter as a result of safety concerns over some of the introduced modifications. The vast majority of Enfield No 2 Mk I revolvers were modified to Mk I* during World War II, generally as they came in for repair or general maintenance; It is believed that the reason was that the Mk I* version was cheaper and faster to manufacture and allowed for far quicker training.Wilson, Royce, \\"A Tale of Two Collectables\\", Australian Shooter magazine, March 2006. When used in the manner in which British forces trained (rapid double-action fire at very close ranges), the No 2 Mk I* is at least as accurate as any other service pistol of its time, because of the relatively light double-action trigger pull. It is not, however, the best choice for deliberately aimed, long-distance shooting — the double-action pull will throw the most competent shooter's aim off enough to noticeably affect accuracy at ranges of more than or so. Some unit Armourers are known to have retrofitted the Enfield No 2 Mk I* back to the Mk I variant, but this was never an official policy and appears to have been done on an individual basis. Despite officially being declared obsolete at the end of World War II, the Enfield (and Webley revolvers) were not completely phased out in favour of the Browning Hi-Power until April 1969.Stamps, Mark, and Ian Skennerton, .380 Enfield Revolver No. 2, page 118 The Enfield No 2 is very fast to reload—as are all British top-break revolvers—because of its automatic ejector, which simultaneously removes all six cases from the cylinder. British combat experience during World War II with the .38/200 Enfield revolvers during World War II seemed to confirm that, \\"for the average soldier\\", the Enfield No. 2 Mk I could be used far more effectively than the bulkier and heavier .455 calibre Webley revolvers that had been issued during World War I. Perhaps because of the relatively long double-action trigger pull compared to other pistols capable of single-action fire, the double-action-only Mk I* revolvers were not popular with troops, many of whom took the first available opportunity to exchange them in favour of Smith & Wesson, Colt, or Webley revolvers.Stamps, Mark, and Ian Skennerton, .380 Enfield Revolver No. 2, page 79 Ammunition The Enfield No.2 Mk I was designed for use with the Cartridge S.A. Ball Revolver .380 inch Mk. I and Mk. Iz, a deviation of the .38 Smith & Wesson cartridge, also known as the .38/200. It had a . unjacketed round-nose, lead bullet of .359 inch diameter that developed a muzzle velocity of . Just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, British authorities became concerned that the soft unjacketed lead bullet used in the 380/200 might be considered as violating the Hague Convention of 1899 governing deforming or 'explosive bullets'. A new .38 loading was introduced for use in combat utilizing a , gilding-metal-jacketed lead bullet; new foresights were issued to compensate for the new cartridge's ballistics and change to the point of aim. The new cartridge was accepted into Commonwealth Service as \\"Cartridge, Pistol, .380 Mk IIz\\", firing a 178 - 180 grain (11.7 g) full metal jacket round-nose bullet. The 380/200 Mk I lead bullet cartridge was continued in service, originally restricted to training and marksmanship practice. However, after the outbreak of war, supply exigencies forced British authorities to use both the 380/200 Mk I and the .380 Mk IIz loadings interchangeably in combat. U.S. ammunition manufacturers such as Winchester- Western supplied 380/200 Mk I cartridges to British forces throughout the war.Shore, C. (Capt.), With British Snipers to the Reich, Paladin Press (1989), p. 201 Other manufacturers The vast majority of Enfield No 2 revolvers were made by RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) Enfield, but wartime necessities meant that numbers were produced elsewhere. Albion Motors in Scotland made the Enfield No 2 Mk I* from 1941 to 1943, whereupon the contract for production was passed onto Coventry Gauge & Tool Co. By 1945, 24,000Hogg, Ian V., and John Walter.Pistols of the World, 4th Ed. Enfield No 2 Mk I* and Mk I revolvers had been produced by Albion/CG&T.; The Singer Sewing Machine Company of Clydebank made components but they were assembled at Enfield under their proofmarks; Singer-made parts are marked \\"SSM\\". The Howard Auto Cultivator Company (HAC) in New South Wales, Australia tooled up and began manufacturing the Enfield No 2 Mk I* and I revolvers in 1941, but the production run was very limited (estimated at around 350 or so revolvers in total), and the revolvers produced were criticised for being non- interchangeable, even with other HAC-produced revolvers. Very few HAC revolvers are known to exist, and it is thought by many collectors that most of the HAC revolvers may have been destroyed in the various Australian Gun Amnesties and \\"Buy-Backs\\".

Aini Helena Kara (originally Aini Helena Dahl, 16 August 1916 – 26 February 2002) was a Finnish film actress. Like Lea Joutseno and Regina Linnanheimo, she was one of the few Finnish film actors without a theatrical background. Kara is best remembered for her role in a 1943 melodrama Valkoiset ruusut. Childhood and early life  Helena Kara was born in Salo into a family of four children. Until 1927, her family name was Dahl. While working as a ticket vendor in a Turku cinema in 1937, she met the head of Suomi-Filmi production company, Risto Orko, who invited her for a screen test. She soon appeared in her first film, Miehen kylkiluu (1937), directed by Orvo Saarikivi.  Marriage and later life  Kara married director Hannu Leminen (1910–1997) on 10 February 1940, and their marriage lasted until Leminen's death. They had three children together. Kara and Leminen also made 12 films together. After getting married, Kara only appeared three times in films that were not directed by her husband. Valkoiset ruusut (1943) is generally considered to be the highlight of their work together. Helena Kara has stated that an accident was the main reason for her giving up the film business after the 1952 film Hän tuli ikkunasta. A dog bit her in the face so that a visible scar was left. She did not want to be in films anymore. For decades, she shied away from all publicity. In the 1990s, she appeared in a television document capturing her life, and in 2002 she died at the age of 85. In his retirement years, Kara and her husband lived winters in the Algarve of Portugal and summers in Klaukkala near the Lake Valkjärvi.

He was a member of the North Carolina Provincial Congress and North Carolina House of Commons for several terms simultaneously with his military service. Eaton was a member of the North Carolina Council of State under Governor Richard Caswell. Eaton commanded soldiers in the battles of Brier Creek and Guilford Courthouse. At the time of the 1790 census, Eaton was one of the largest slaveholders in North Carolina. Early life and War of the Regulation Eaton was born to William Eaton and Mary Rives, who had moved to North Carolina from Prince George County, Virginia. Eaton was married three times, marrying his first wife, Anna Bland, in 1761. That marriage bore one daughter, Anna, in 1763. After purchasing land in Bute County, North Carolina, Eaton represented that county in the colonial North Carolina Assembly from 1769 to 1771. In 1771, Governor William Tryon named Eaton a colonel in the Bute County militia during the War of the Regulation. The militia organization supported the governor against the agrarian uprising in the piedmont region of North Carolina. Eaton served as Bute County's representative in the Provincial Council, which became the Council of Safety, between 1775 and 1776. That body exercised executive powers in the state prior to the election of the state's first governor after the start of the American Revolution. Eaton served as President pro tempore of the Council of Safety. Also beginning in 1775, Eaton was a delegate to the Second, Third, and Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congresses. The Fourth Provincial Congress, of which Eaton was not a delegate, appointed him a colonel in the state's militia. American Revolutionary War Service record: *Halifax District Brigade of militia: 1779 to 1781 *Colonel over the Bute County Regiment of militia and the Warren County Regiment of militia *Appointed 11/4/1779 as Brigadier Pro Tempore, to replace Allen Jones, away on business. *Re-appointed as Brigadier Pro Tempore in early 1781. *Returned to being Colonel over the Warren County Regiment of Militia. *Engaged at the Battle of Guilford Court House After his appointment as a colonel in 1776, Eaton was elected to the North Carolina Council of State, an executive body elected by the North Carolina General Assembly which assisted the governor in managing the state's affairs. Eaton served under Richard Caswell in that governor's terms as first and fifth governor of the post-Revolution state, and was re- elected to the Council in 1779 and 1784. In between his terms as a councillor, Eaton served with the militia in the southern theater against the British Army and its local Loyalist tributaries, but was primarily a politician, and had less military experience than many of his colleagues. On March 3, 1779, Eaton was in command of a regiment of militia at the Patriot defeat at the Battle of Brier Creek in Georgia. At Brier Creek, the Patriot forces were forced to retreat, and Eaton lost a pair of distinctive riding boots, which were retrieved by Loyalist Colonel John Hamilton, who had commanded the Royal North Carolina Regiment. During a dinner party after the revolution, Hamilton reportedly attempted to return the boots to their owner, only to be rebuffed violently. In November 1779, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general by the North Carolina Assembly. On March 15, 1781, Eaton commanded the Halifax District Brigade of the North Carolina militia at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, where he was positioned beside the Hillsborough District Brigade of militia under Brigadier General John Butler. Commanding General Nathanael Greene considered the 1,000 North Carolina militiamen under Butler and Eaton's command to be his least-reliable troops. Eaton, as well as Butler, attempted to stop the men under their command from fleeing the field early during that battle, but could not prevent a large number of North Carolina militia from routing. Later life and death After the death of Anna in 1781, Eaton married his second wife, Anne Stith, with whom he had two sons. Eaton would find occasion to remarry for a final time with Elizabeth Jones, a cousin of Continental Congress delegates Willie and Allen Jones.

Early life Patrick Francis Robertson was born on 24 August 1807 in Meigle, Perthshire, Scotland, the oldest son of the Rev. Daniel Robertson (1755 - 1817), DD and Isabella Small (1774 - 1811). His father was a Professor of Oriental Languages at St. Mary's College, St. Andrews, Scotland from 1809 - 1817. His maternal grandfather was the Rev. Alexander Small, Minister of Newtyle and Kilconquhar, Scotland. The family was a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean. Robertson's mother died when he was four. Robertson and his two younger siblings were primarily raised by a maternal aunt, Cecilia Small, after his mother's death. Business career Robertson obtained his formal education at the University of St. Andrews. After graduating, Robertson joined other members of his extended family in the East India and China trade, becoming a wealthy man. He lived for a time in Canton, China. Positions as a sub-governor for the London Assurance Corporation, department-chairman of the Bank of Egypt, and director of the Oriental Bank and the Ceylon Co, eventually followed for Robertson. Around Hastings, Robertson was known for his real estate development projects. Political career Robertson was a Deputy- Lieutenant of Sussex and a Justice of the Peace for the borough of Hastings. In 1847 Robertson was an unsuccessful candidate for Parliament. He ran again and won election as a Liberal Conservative for Hastings in July 1852, serving until April 1859. He chose to run again in October 1864, but was not re- elected until July 1865. He declared himself retired in 1868, but unsuccessfully ran yet again in 1869 and 1874. Death and legacy A lifelong bachelor, Patrick Francis Robertson died on 20 January 1885 in Hampstead, Middlesex, England. Robertson's estate in Hastings, on Old London Road, was named Halton House. The mansion house no longer exists but the hill where it stood is called Robertson Hill.

He played one season in Spain with Real Madrid Baloncesto when they won the 1963–64 FIBA European Champions Cup. Hanson played college basketball with the Washington Huskies from 1960–1962, when the center was a three-time all- conference selection in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU). Hanson started playing high school basketball in Washington at Blaine High School before moving to Mercer Island High School for his senior year. He was nationally recruited by universities to play basketball, a rarity at the time for a player in the Northwest. He decided to attend University of Washington, whose basketball coach, Tippy Dye, had helped make center Bob Houbregs an All-American. In 1962, Hanson became the first Husky to lead the conference in rebounding. On January 12, 1962, he scored 37 points and led the team to an 85-67 upset of No. 4 USC; he became just the third player in school history to reach 30 points in a game. He averaged 20.8 points per game during his college career, and left Washington second in scoring in school history behind Houbregs (25.6). Hanson was selected by the Chicago Zephyrs, a National Basketball Association (NBA) expansion team, in the sixth round of the 1962 NBA draft, the 46th player taken. He declined to sign with Chicago, as his wife was still in school and the Zephyrs offered just a $6,000 contract. He played one season in Spain before attending business school and working in New York City and California. Hanson is twice divorced, and has four daughters including twins, (3) grandchildren and (1) great-grandchild.

However, the New York Times of January 3, 1904 lists the program as consisting of the Overture from Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila, a baritone aria from Borodin's Prince Igor, an intermezzo from Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, a Russian dance by Eduard Nápravník and the symphonic suite Scheherazade by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov;\\"Of Music and Musicians: …Russian Symphony Concerts…\\", New York Times, 3 January 1904, p. 17.

Rachmaninoff was engaged as a guest conductor and piano soloist for concerts of his music performed on April 7-8, 1906, and Safonov's former pupil, pianist Joseph Lhévinne, was brought over to make his American debut; both were in their early thirties at the time, as was composer Vasily Zolotarev, whose Rhapsodie Hébraïque was also performed that season at Safonov's suggestion. Rhapsodie hébraïque, presented on the last two days of 1905, was based on secular Jewish melodies that the Times characterized as \\"the musical equivalent of Yiddish.\\"\\"Musical Notes: Concerts, Recitals and Church Choir News\\", New York Times , 17 December 1905, p.

The chaos of the Revolution of 1905 prevented sending scores from Russia for the orchestra to accompany Campanari on arias from Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Queen of Spades (Pique Dame), and the performances were almost canceled. The only known copy of even the texts of the arias that could readily be found in New York was a German translation.

In all, the New York Times counted six New York premieres by the Russian Symphony Orchestra as such in 1906, and three more by the New Music Society.\\"Music and Music Makers\\", New York Times, 22 April 1906. p.

Looking forward to the 1906-1907 musical season, the Times counted them among the city's major orchestras, along with the New York Philharmonic, New York Symphony Orchestra, Peoples' Symphony Concerts, and Sam Franko's American Symphony.Richard Aldrich, \\"In the World of Music: Prospects of the Season\\", New York Times, 28 October 1906. p. X6. The 1906-7 season saw an appearance by pianist and composer Alexander Scriabin under the direction of his (and Altschuler's) conservatory teacher Vasily Safonov. An anonymous New York Times review praised Scriabin's playing, while finding him immature as a composer. The same reviewer panned Alexander Glazunov's Third Symphony, which had its American premiere on this occasion: \\"[W]hat Russian music the conductor's of the more cosmopolitan orchestras have left for the Russians to put down on their programmes as given 'for the first time' may have been rejected rather than overlooked.\\"\\"The Russian Symphony: A Programme of New Works  Alexander Scriabine Plays His Own Concerto\\", New York Times, 21 December 1906, p.9. Apparently undaunted by that criticism, the orchestra announced two days later that its concert of January 17 would feature American premieres of Rachmaninoff's Spring cantata and Jean Sibelius's Karelia overture,\\"Musical notes\\", New York Times, 23 December 1906, p.X5. though apparently Rimsky-Korsakov's Antar was substituted for the Rachmininoff.\\"New Russian Music\\", New York Times, 18 January 1907, p.7. The Times doubled down in its criticism: \\"[M]any of the things by the Russian composers that we do not know seem upon presentation hardly worth knowing. … Antar … is no symphony by any recognized definition of the term… This would be nothing against the music if it could win acceptance for itself as music, which it did not last evening.\\" While continuing its skepticism toward recent Russian music, the Times had high praise for soloist Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler's February 7, 1907 performance of Anton Rubenstein's already well-known D Minor Concerto (No. 4), though suggesting that the orchestra \\"show[ed] a lack of rehearsal with the pianist.\\"\\"Mrs. Zeisler Wins Audience\\", New York Times, 8 February 1907, p.9. The fifth of six concerts that season on February 28, featuring a return by pianist Josef Lhévinne, consisted entirely of Russian pieces performed for the first time in America, although they were not recent works. The orchestral introduction of Mussorgsky's The Fair at Sorochyntsi and Rubinstein's Caprice Russe were both by composers who had died before the turn of the century. Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov's Iveria Suite (1896) and Alexander Scriabin's First Symphony (completed 1900), while also not particularly recent, were at least by then-living composers, and Scriabin was present for the occasion.\\"A Russian Concert: Music for Orchestra and Piano Heard for the First Time\\", New York Times, 1 March 1907, p.9. That summer, Altschuler traveled to Europe to engage soloists for the 1907-1908 season,\\"Engages Russian Soloists: Modest Altschuler Tells His Plans For Next Season's Concerts\\", New York Times, 19 July 1907, p.7. which began with a special concert November 10 at their largest venue to date: accompanying violinist Jan Kubelik at the New York Hippodrome.\\"Vast Audience at Kubelik Recital\\", New York Times, 11 November 1907, p.7. (A similar performance was given the following year, March 15, 1908.\\"Kubelik at the Hippodrome\\", 16 March 1908, p.7.) Four days later they began their regular season at Carnegie Hall with Russian ambassador Baron Rosen in attendance, and with a program consisting largely of American premieres of Russian pieces: Alexander Glazunov's Symphony No. 8, composed roughly two years earlier; arrangements of Russian folk songs by Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov, and Rimsky- Korsakov; and Mussorgsky's \\"Great Gate of Kiev\\". The program also featured the American debut of young Russian violinist Lea Luboshutz (listed at the time as Laya Luboshiz),\\"The Russian Orchestra: A Concert of New Compositions in Carnegie Hall\\", New York Times, 1 November 1907, p.9. who received eight curtain calls for her solo on Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.\\"Of Musical Interest\\", Brooklyn Life, 23 November 1907, p.15. She was not the only notable female soloist to play with the orchestra that season: on February 13, 1908, cellist May Muklé performed Karl Davydov's Cello Concerto No. 2 in A minor.\\"Russian Symphony Concert\\", New York Times, 14 February 1908, p.14. =Broader recognition and touring= 1908 also brought unprecedented recognition from Russia itself. The tsar granted the Order of Saint Stanislaus to orchestra president Frank Seymour Hastings in recognition of his promotion of Russian music in America.\\"Czar to Honor Musician\\", New York Times, 5 June 1908, p.7. For 1908-1909, the orchestra reduced its Carnegie Hall season from six performances to four,\\"Russian Symphony's Plans\\", New York Times, 17 September 1908, p.7. and began taking on other performance opportunities. At Carnegie Hall, they continued to present notable soloists: the debut of Mischa Elman (19 years old at the time\\"Mischa Elman Appears\\", New York Times, 11 December 1908, p.8. The Times described him as \\"an artist already of remarkable powers of whom much that is interesting is to be expected.\\"), a return by Josef Lhévinne, and also an appearance by Alexander Petschnikoff. After a November 16, 1908 tryout in New Haven, Connecticut,\\"Russian Music With Acting\\", New York Times, 17 November 1908, p.9. on February 11, 1909, they collaborated with the Ben Greet Players on a Carnegie Hall performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream incorporating Mendelssohn's incidental music,\\"Orchestra Aids Greet Players\\", New York Times, 12 Feb 1909, p.13. a performance that was repeated at Lake George on August 30\\"Lake George: Sylvan Players Begin Dramatic Festival in Natural Amphitheatre\\", New York Times, 29 August 1909, p.X3. and at Carnegie Hall on New Year's Day 1910.\\"Calendar of Concerts\\", New York Times, 26 Dec 1909, p.SM13. These performances constituted the first time Mendelssohn's music was performed in conjunction with the play in the United States. The two groups collaborated further, including a 1910 production of Shakespeare's The Tempest\\"Russian Orchestra and Greet Players\\", New York Times, 11 February 1910, p. 11. and a series of performances in the 1910-1911 season which repeated these pieces and added As You Like It, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Macbeth, and Sakuntala.\\"Greet Players with Russian Orchestra\\", New York Times, 27 November 1910, p. 9. The Times article doesn't elaborate on Sakuntala: presumably one of numerous plays about Shakuntala, a figure in the Mahabharata. Besides a broader variety of New York performances, the orchestra toured extensively. Although they had already toured in December 1907, when the New York Times mentions them traveling to \\"Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Madison, Wis. and other cities,\\" bringing along pianists Ernest Hutcheson and Ernest Schelling,\\"Music Notes, New York Times, 8 December 1907, p. X2. their 1908 touring plans extended as far as the West Coast. Their tours could involve large numbers of performances. For example, a newspaper from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shows the orchestra performing four separate concerts (at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.) on a single Wednesday in September 1911. The programs were each entirely different, and the music ranged from Beethoven through Richard Wagner, Verdi and Puccini to Sibelius and Scriabin.Symphony Programs Cause Enthusiasm, The Gazette Times (Pittsburgh), 6 September 1911, p. 16. =The 1910s= Maud Allan as Salomé; in the New York performance, \\"the head itself was left to the imagination, but none of the caressing was.\\" The orchestra began the 1910s with a premiere of a different sort. After a January 1 Carnegie Hall reprise of their Midsummer Night collaboration with Ben Greet, on January 20 their second performance of the new decade introduced dancer Maud Allan to the New York audience. Although American-born, Allan had begun her dancing career in England and Europe, and this was her first American appearance. Like Isadora Duncan and Loie Fuller, Allan choreographed for herself, using existing classical pieces. On this occasion she danced a piece on Ancient Greek themes, using music from Anton Rubenstein, Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Grieg. The performance alternated Allan's dances with straight orchestral performances.\\"Maud Allan in Greek Dances\\", New York Times, 21 January 1910, p.11. A concert a week later featured Rachmaninoff as a guest conductor for the American premiere of his Isle of the Dead and as a soloist on his Piano Concerto No. 2.\\"Rachmaninoff as Conductor\\", New York Times, 28 January 1910, p.9. Further performances with Allan followed, with the dancer performing her signature Visions of Salomé, among other pieces.\\"Maud Allan as Salome\\", New York Times, 30 January 1910, p.11.\\"Miss Allan to Repeat Salome Dance\\", New York Times, 1 February 1910, p.9.Display ad, New York Times, 9 February 1910, p.16.\\"News of the Musical World\\", New York Times, 27 February 1910, p.

On April 4, the orchestra played a benefit for Russian immigrants at the Waldorf-Astoria, featuring several musical soloists as well as ballet dancers Anna Pavlova and Mikhail Mordkin.\\"Music Notes\\", New York Times, 1 April 1910, p.11.\\"Pavlowa Dances for Charity\\", New York Times, 5 April 1910, p.11. The 1910-1911 season featured five Carnegie Hall concerts interspersed with numerous out-of-town shows and followed by a 20-week national tour.\\"Plans for Russian Symphony Orchestra Season\\", New York Times, 12 September 1910, p.9.\\"Musical notes\\", New York Times, 18 September 1910, p.13. Their New York season began November 17 with a concert that included a very different interpretation of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2, which they had premiered in 1901 and which had meanwhile become a \\"celebrated\\" and much-played work. After discussions with the composer, Altschuler had sped up the tempi and his reading of the piece had \\"radically changed\\". The concert also featured two American premieres of pieces by Anatoly Lyadov—Kikimora and Volshebnoye ozero (The Enchanted Lake), both written in 1909—Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, and several songs sung by German baritone Alexander Heinemann.\\"News of the Music World\\", New York Times, 13 November 1910, p.X7.\\"Rachmininoff Again\\", New York Times, 18 November 1910, p.9. This is the source for the word \\"celebrated\\". The December 1 concert featured the U.S. debut of Canadian-born violinist Kathleen Parlow; the New York Times reviewer described her performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto as a \\"remarkable achievement\\" and praised her \\"unexpected authority\\",\\"The Russian Symphony\\", New York Times, 27 November 1910, p.X7.\\"Russian Symphony Concert\\", New York Times, 2 December 1910, p.9. This article, the one that refers to her \\"remarkable achievement\\", erroneously refers to Katherine Parlow. and would have equally high praise for her \\"consummate technical accuracy…beauty of tone…spirit…[and]fire\\" when she returned to play Henryk Wieniawski's Violin Concerto No. 2 the following February 2.\\"Miss Parlow Applauded\\", The New York Times, 3 February 1911, p. 9. With reference to the Kajanus, the cited source simply says Finnish Rhapsody. Kajanus wrote two Finnish Rhapsodies, No. 1 in D minor, Op. 5 (1881) and No. 2 in F major (1886); there is no indication of which was performed on this occasion. Also, the Times refers again to the Rachmaninoff piece as The Cliff rather than The Rock. The concert was also the American premier of Stravinsky's Feu d'artifice (Fireworks). who had grown up largely in San Francisco and had become a professional musician in Europe. Starting four days later, they provided accompaniment for two-week run of Maeterlinck's tragedy Mary Magdalene at The New Theatre.\\"'Mary Magdalene' for New Theatre\\", New York Times, 25 November 1910, p.11.Display ad, New York Times, 5 December 1910, p.18. This was the world premiere of that play, and the first U.S. performance of any Maeterlinck play.\\"Busy Nights for Playgoers\\", New York Times, 4 December 1910, p.X1. A January 19, 1911 concert featured German-Polish pianist and composer Xaver Scharwenka as the soloist on his own Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, as well as the American premiere of the Introduction and Wedding Procession from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Golden Cockerel; the concert also featured Rimsky- Korsakov's Christmas Eve Suite and the American premiere of a waltz that Tchaikovsky had written for The Nutcracker but omitted from the final version, and closed with Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave.\\"Music Here and There\\", The New York Times, 1 Jan 1911, p.

MEMA represents more than 1,000 companies that manufacture motor vehicle components and systems for the original equipment and aftermarket segments of the light vehicle and heavy-duty motor vehicle manufacturing industry in the United States. MEMA works at state, federal, and international levels to ensure that the marketplace and public policies support the development of advanced, transformative technologies that enable safer, smarter, and more efficient vehicles. Motor vehicle parts manufacturers are the nation’s largest manufacturing sector, directly employing more than 871,000 U.S. workers. Motor vehicle component manufacturers are the largest employer of manufacturing jobs in the U.S., contributing nearly 3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Motor vehicle parts suppliers generate a total direct and indirect employment impact of 4.26 million jobs, up nearly 18 percent since 2012. MEMA is the parent organization of four affiliate associations: AASA, HDMA, MERA, and OESA.http://www.asaecenter.org/aboutus/content.cfm?itemnumber=137636 The motor vehicle component manufacturing industry in the U.S. has experienced robust growth due to increased demand and vehicle sales. The stability and highly integrated North American supply chain has also been particularly beneficial to suppliers, contributing to growth in both jobs and investments in the United States. Many suppliers located in the U.S. import and export vehicle parts and components within the North American market. Depending on supply chain logistics, parts are often exported to be combined with other parts, then imported back to the U.S. for final vehicle assembly. History 1904- Leading industry companies joined together to form MEMA 1933- MEMA co-sponsors the first Automotive Service Industries Show, forerunner of AAIW and AAPEX 1960- MEMA opens an office in Washington, D.C. 1970s- MEMA establishes the first of its many councils, serving as valuable forums for active industry executives 1983- MEMA forms the Heavy Duty Manufacturers Association (HDMA) 1987- MEMA establishes the Japan Automotive Advisory Group (JAAG), supporting suppliers doing business in Japan 1992- MEMA helps form the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week 1998- MEMA's Original Equipment Suppliers Association (OESA) forms 2002- MEMA forms Trilateral Agreement on behalf of our members with the European association of automotive suppliers (CLEPA) and the Japan Auto Parts Industry Association (JAPIA) 2002- MEMA establishes the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA), exclusively serving aftermarket product manufacturers 2010- MEMA establishes its Political Action Committee (MEMA PAC) 2011- MEMA establishes the Association for Sustainable Manufacturing (MERA) 2015- MEMA celebrates 110 years serving its more than 1,000 members Divisions =Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association= right The Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) is the light vehicle aftermarket division of MEMA. AASA exclusively serves manufacturers of aftermarket components, tools and equipment, and related products, an important part of the automotive parts manufacturing industry which supports 871,000 American jobs. AASA is a recognized industry change agent – promoting a collaborative industry environment, providing a forum to address issues and serving as a valued resource for members. The U.S. aftermarket includes the manufacturing, distribution, retailing and installation of all vehicle parts, chemicals, tools, equipment, technologies, and accessories. Most aftermarket repair work takes place in a vehicle manufacturer’s dealership service facility or an independent repair shop, which includes national service chains. Essentially, once a new vehicle is sold, it becomes part of the aftermarket. There also is a strong “do-it-yourself” market – individuals who perform their own vehicle maintenance. AASA manages several councils and committees that oversee policy issues affecting the many different sects of the aftermarket industry, including brake manufacturing, intellectual property and mobility technology. AASA supports aftermarket suppliers and their drive to move business forward by providing industry analysis and strategic insights for business planning, engaging in meaningful government advocacy initiatives, organizing international and domestic professional conferences and peer councils, and conducting global outreach in growing markets. The division also manages several events throughout the year, the largest being the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo (AAPEX) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Co-owned by AASA and the Auto Care Association, AAPEX is the largest annual trade show for automotive aftermarket industry professionals. The expo features more than 2,500 exhibiting companies who offer the latest products, services and automotive technologies. Paul McCarthy serves as AASA’s president and COO. =Heavy Duty Manufacturers Association= right Founded in 1983, The Heavy Duty Manufacturers Association (HDMA) is the commercial vehicle division of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA). HDMA's mission is to advance the commercial vehicle supplier industry and the business interests of its members. HDMA serves its 220+ commercial vehicle component-supplier members through government and industry advocacy, timely news and information, market research and analysis, promotion of the North American manufacturer/supplier industry, and facilitating industry networking through a range of events, peer councils, and services. Membership includes North American suppliers in the global on- and off-highway equipment OEM and aftermarket sectors. HDMA's member services have a global perspective in a global industry; over 60% of HDMA member companies are global in scope. Suppliers in the on- and off-highway commercial vehicle equipment industry provide the original equipment parts used to manufacture commercial vehicles and aftermarket replacement parts needed to maintain them. Commercial vehicle suppliers are also responsible for developing most of the technologies that keep commercial vehicles safe and efficient. HDMA launched a variety of councils since its initiation to address policy issues impacting the commercial vehicle industry. These include the Heavy Duty Business Forum (HDBF), Heavy Duty Business Forum Europe (HDBF Europe), Heavy Duty Business Forum India (HDBF India), and Heavy Duty Business Forum Asia (HDBF Asia); the Heavy Duty Marketing and Sales Forum (HDMSF); the Off-Highway Business Forum (OHBF); the Heavy Duty Advanced Technology Council (HDATC); and the Heavy Duty Manufacturers Representatives Council (HDMRC). HDMA also holds several conferences throughout the year to educate and empower their members. These include: * Heavy Duty Aftermarket Dialogue (HDAD) HDAD is an outlook conference, specifically directed toward the heavy duty aftermarket supplier industry. It is intended to provide an in-depth view of the prospects for the global, heavy duty aftermarket component for the next five years. This event delivers critical information by identifying the toughest emerging problems in the heavy duty aftermarket industry, as well as sharing the most successful strategies being implemented to counter them. * Heavy Duty Aftermarket Week (HDAW) HDAW is a partnership of three leading supplier and distributor organizations – CVSN, HDDA, and HDMA. The annual executive conference is designed to bring together all stakeholders in the heavy duty aftermarket independent distributor channel. Program content is developed by the HDAW Joint Operating Committee, consisting of 14 leading industry associations. * The HDMA/MEMA Supplier Advocacy Network Day MEMA’s Supplier Advocacy Network Day provides HDMA members access to high-ranking government officials, key elected officials and staff, and federal agencies through a two-day program including policy briefings, networking opportunities, and congressional visits. Each year, this program aims to address challenges and opportunities facing HDMA members. * HDMA’s Annual Luncheon & Briefing HDMA’s annual Luncheon & Briefing is presented at the North American Commercial Vehicle (NACV) Show in Atlanta during odd-numbered years and at the International Automobile Exhibition (IAA) Show in Hanover, Germany during even numbered years. It is the premier must-attend program, which includes a highly informative program featuring industry leaders and allows attendees to network with industry peers. Tim Kraus is the president and chief operating officer of HDMA. =The Association for Sustainable Manufacturing= right MERA is the remanufacturing and sustainability division of MEMA. With roots in the transportation industry, MERA represents the interests of the broader remanufacturing community across multiple industry sectors. The organization is a network of manufacturers, suppliers, universities, and professional services firms that promotes the economic, environmental, and product performance benefits of remanufacturing and similar forms of sustainable manufacturing. Sustainable manufacturing can be simply defined as “manufacturing with reuse.” It is a manufacturing process that restores original products in a factory setting, yielding goods that are like new, but better than the originals. The finished goods have like-new quality, they offer better value, and they are better for the environment. As an eco- friendly process, sustainable manufacturing conserves materials and embodied energy, and it reduces landfill waste. Different industry sectors use different terms to identify the remanufacturing process. For instance, in the automotive and commercial vehicle sectors, the term is remanufacturing; in aviation and aerospace, the reference is maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO); and for medical devices, consumer goods and electronics, the term is refurbishing. (All of the above italicized terms are forms of sustainable manufacturing.) Examples of goods that can go through the sustainable manufacturing process include vehicle parts, aircraft engines, MRI machines, electronic modules, and mobile phones. “Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.” has been in the public lexicon for years, yet it does not fully capture one very viable solution to today’s environmental challenges. In response, MERA introduced a new symbol for sustainable manufacturing. It looks familiar because it is the recycling symbol with an extra arrow. Sustainable manufacturing is destined to play a more vital role in advancing a global circular economy, and the remanufacturing of existing products should occur before traditional recycling. “Reduce. Reuse. Reman. Recycle.” Learn more at SustainableManufacturing.com. center MERA is the home of Manufactured Again Certification, where new manufacturing and sustainable manufacturing are held to the same international quality standards. The program – based on ISO 9001 and IATF 16949 – also promotes corporate social responsibility, particularly environmental stewardship. center John Chalifoux serves as MERA’s president and COO. =Original Equipment Suppliers Association= right The mission of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association (OESA) is to champion the business interests of automotive original equipment (OE) suppliers. OE suppliers provide approximately 70 percent of vehicle value through components and new technology (i.e. V2V connectivity, ADAS, and electrification). Since 1998, the Association has been addressing issues of common concern and advocating on behalf of the supplier community throughout the supply chain and in Washington, D.C. OESA strives to foster collaboration throughout the automotive supply chain and help members make critical business decisions. Through industry events, peer group councils, research and analysis, OESA provides relevant, timely and unique information and resources to and for the automotive supplier industry. OESA Industry Events OESA industry events play a key role in addressing the unique interests of the automotive supplier industry. Cornerstone OESA events provide OEM engagement opportunities, advance international and government relations and address member-relevant and industry-relevant issues. OESA hosts regular OEM Town Hall meetings with FCA, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen as well as new OEMs such as Rivian and Karma to assist suppliers in understanding OEM planning and make business connections. OESA Peer Councils OESA maintains several Peer Group Councils, designed for supplier executives with similar job functions. Supplier executives attend to network, address issues of common concern and learn best practices. These councils bring together nearly 700 top member company executives. Quarterly meeting agendas are member-driven, and content is developed to assist members with strategies to maximize and diversify top- line revenue, optimize operating costs and share best practices. Meetings include roundtable discussions and open forums on current topics of importance to members. OESA Councils include the following functional areas: Advanced Technology, Automotive Public Relations, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officers, Chief Purchasing Officers, Communication Executives, Enterprise Leadership, Environment, Health, Safety & Sustainability, Human Resources, Legal Issues, Sales Executive, Tooling Council, Warranty Management and Young Leadership. OESA also generates council-requested surveys to identify best practices and address the concerns that directly impact functional roles at supplier organizations. Research and Analysis OESA is the automotive industry’s key resource for supplier industry trends and research. Through the administration and analysis of various industry surveys, OESA captures and provides supplier sentiments and industry trends. The OESA Automotive Supplier Barometer captures the quarterly pulse and analyzes the twelve-month business sentiments of top executives in the supplier industry. It is a snapshot of their concerns on commercial issues, the business environment and strategies that influence the supplier industry. Results are distributed to vehicle manufacturers, financial institutions, governmental officials and the media to provide an on-going profile of the trends in the supplier industry. The OESA/HRI Automotive Tooling Barometer survey series was created by the OESA Tooling Council with the partnership of Harbour Results, Inc. to provide an indicator of the current state of the automotive tooling industry, and the perception of the near-term prospects for the industry. The OESA Automotive Tooling Barometer captures the sentiment of the major companies in this market. Julie A. Fream serves as OESA’s president and CEO.

She earned a commercial driver license (with passenger, school bus, and air brake endorsements) and has a motorcycle endorsement. In 1992, she earned Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and International Studies from Virginia Tech. In 2000, she earned an M.S. in Conflict Analysis and Resolution from George Mason University. Hersman is married to her high school sweetheart and former Virginia Tech classmate, Niel Plummer. They have three sons. Career She began her government career on the staff of West Virginia Congressman Bob Wise as an unpaid intern during the summer of her sophomore year at Virginia Tech. She rose from intern to office manager and then to senior legislative aide. While working for Wise, Hersman dealt with a series of coal train derailments near Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Wise said, \\"She has a backbone. Don't ever think that you are ever going to push her over.\\" In 1999, she left Wise's office to join the staff of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Her efforts contributed to the passage of milestone bills such as the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century and Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act. In 2004, Hersman was appointed as a board member of the NTSB by President George W. Bush. In 2009, President Barack Obama reappointed her to a second five-year term and appointed her to a two-year term as chairman, making her, at age 39, one of the youngest to ever to fill that position. President Obama reappointed Hersman as chairman in 2011, and in August 2013, he nominated her for a third term as chairman and for a third term as a board member. Pending Senate confirmation, the President designated Hersman to serve as vice chairman, making her acting chairman of the NTSB. Her nomination was confirmed by voice vote on October 16, 2013. As a board member, Hersman traveled with NTSB teams investigating major accidents ranging from the collision of two Washington Metro trains to the mid-air collision of a sightseeing helicopter and single-engine airplane over the Hudson River in New York City.

The Doddahundi nishidhi and inscription is a hero stone from Doddahundi, 18 km from Tirumakudalu Narasipura in the Mysore district, Karnataka state, India. It has an undated old Kannada language inscription which historians J. F. Fleet, I. K. Sarma and E.P. Rice have dated by context to 840 or 869 C.E.Rice, E.P. (1921), p.13 The hero stone has a unique depiction in frieze of the ritual death (sallekhana and samadhi) of the Western Ganga Dynasty king Ereganga Nitimarga I (r. 853-869). The memorial was raised by the king's son Satyavakya. Such nishidhi's (memorial spot) were raised in medieval India in honor of important Jain personalities who ended their life voluntarily after following severe ritual vow.Sarma (1992), p.17Sarma (1992), p.204 The Western Ganga period produced not only imposing and well sculptured pillars (stambha) but also noteworthy hero stones (virgal) with exceptional relief.Kamath (1980), p.52 According to historian and epigraphist J. F. Fleet who edited the inscription, the names in the record are titles and not personal names. He dated the inscription to 840 C.E. with the opinion that the Nitimarga in the inscription is actually Ranavikrama, son of King Sripurusha (r. 726-788).Fleet (1905), p. 53 Background An example of a Nishidhi inscription from the 14th century with Kannada language inscription In Jainism, the term nishidhi (with variants called nisidhia, nisadhi or nistige) is the spot where the person, such as an ascetic, king or queen died voluntarily, or was cremated or bone relic buried. Such places were held in high regard, a pedestal (vedika) created and prayers (puja and pratishtha) offered regularly.Sarma (1992), p.202 Often, the nishidhigal (lit, nishidhi stone) was nothing more than a natural rock surface or a boulder. Inscribed on the nishidhigal were epitaphs that immortalized and described the scholarly and saintly achievements of the deceased one, man or woman. Nishidhi's dated to as early as the 7th century exist in the Shravanabelagola hills. One memorial raised by King Sripurusha for Mahaprabhu Gopayya dates from the 8th century. The Doddahundi nishidhi is one of the most noteworthy examples found from the Western Ganga period. Depiction According to the historian Sarma, the Doddahundi nishidhi stone has its frieze set inside a square panel whose borders are etched to create the impression of flames that further accentuate the grave event. The dying king, who exudes a calm countanence, is lying on a couch with his head on a double pillow and is attended to by his personal guard Agarayya. An agitated Prince Satyavakya stands behind the king with a dagger and sword. The inscription below the frieze reads \\"bee at the pair of lotus feet of Arhat Bhattaraka\\" (referring to Jinasena, the kings guru and author of the Jain text Adipurana).Sarma (1992), p. 204 See also * Jainism in Karnataka * Jainism in north Karnataka * Jainism in Tulu Nadu Notes References  * Category:Kannada literature Category:Literature of Karnataka Category:Earliest known manuscripts by language Category:Western Ganga dynasty Category:Kannada inscriptions Category:Jain temples in Karnataka ","title":"Doddahundi nishidhi inscription"},{"id":"38332388","text":"MEMA or mema or variation, may refer to: Places * Méma, Mali, Africa People * Ali Mema (born 1943) Albanian soccer player * Ardian Mema (born 1971) Albanian soccer player * Devis Mema (born 1985) Albanian soccer player * Marin Mema, Albanian journalist * Sulejman Mema (born 1955) Albanian soccer player * Mema, an Albanian soccer family, see List of professional sports families =Fictional characters= * Me'ma, a character from the 2012 novel Me’ma and the Great Mountain * Mema Chaid, a character from the Colombian telenovela La luz de mis ojos Organizations * Maryland Emergency Management Agency * Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency * Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association Other uses * Mary E.

Circulation figures are not published, but the 2013 Census showed 1,143 dwellings in Raglan and 681 in Te Uku area units, in addition to which copies are available in Raglan shops and cafes, so that total circulation must amount to about 2,000 copies a week. In addition copies can be downloaded from the website. This is how the history of the Chronicle was presented in the 1940 Centennial Souvenir Booklet1940 Centennial Souvenir Booklet \\\\- \\"In 1903 an event took place which did much for the progress of our district. This was no less than the formation of the Raglan Printing and Publishing Coy., which had for its object the inauguration of a weekly local paper. The first editor was Mr. F. W. Green under whose able management a wide and flourishing circulation was achieved and the venture paid a good dividend to its shareholders. In those days when the only telephones were those in the post offices local news travelled very slowly and often came to residents through the medium only of the Auckland Weekly News, Waikato Times, Waikato Argus or notices at post office or public notice boards, one of which was situated at the Kauroa-Okete cross-roads. Now all this was changed and a paper devoted solely to Raglan news and interests was a great boon and was eagerly looked forward to each week. In every home there was a rush for the Chronicle or \\"The Buster\\" as it was affectionately called by many.\\" 1903-13 A Te Mata farmer, Frank W. Green was the first editor and ran the Raglan County Chronicle for over 10 years. He was also on the Raglan Town Board when it was formed in 1906, resigning in 1907, to become its first Town Clerk. In 1913 Frank left the district and passed the Chronicle to Roy Donaldson for the rest of the year. 1913-19 The Rev. Greenwell Carr then became proprietor and editor. He was Congregational Church minister from 1898 to 1917, came from Denniston and spoke with a broad North Country accent. Increasing deafness caused him to resign from the ministry, though he continued to take services when other ministers were not available. From 1913 until 1938 he too was Town Clerk and from 1915-20 he was secretary of the Raglan Dairy Co. Gerald Griffiths who was farming at Kauroa took over the Chronicle after returning from the war, about 1919. 1920-35 Dr W.M. Sanders and his wife ran the Chronicle for about 15 years and lived in a house behind the Bow St office. He had been a schoolteacher in Taranaki, before training as a doctor and became Raglan's first doctor. On 15 February 1906, Raglan ratepayers, with Dr. W. M. Sanders in the chair, decided set up a committee to map out a township area get a petition to form Raglan Town Board. Dr Sanders was one of 5 elected unopposed. The Board met at the Chronicle office until the Town Hall was built. Dr Sanders was master of the Masonic lodge in 1912. In 1913 Dr Stewart Moore took over the practice, whilst Dr Sanders moved to FranktonWaikato Argus 26 June 1913 and then to Tonga. In 1916 Dr Sanders returned to Raglan, but sold the practice to Dr. Cashmore in the early 20s. Dr Sanders‚ last home was on the hill, surrounded by a garden and orchard, fronting James and Bow Streets. St Peters church is built on land donated by Dr Sanders in 1922. Then Jack Eggelston and later Mr. Keay and his son Winton managed the business. In 1927 the original office, next to the Town Hall, was burnt down, together with the hall and a draper's shop.Evening Post, Volume CXIII, Issue 65, 18 March 1927, Page 5 http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/ It was rebuilt across the road. For the years 1936-38 Ron Pearce managed it for the Sanders Estate. 1938-44 The Chronicle was then sold to C.H. Marcroft. The Centennial Booklet said, \\"Mr. C. H. Marcroft, came to the rescue and has succeeded in again making the paper the medium of interest and progress it was meant to be when it was started so enthusiastically 37 years ago.\\" He moved to Tauranga in 1944. 1944-59 Ron Pearce, who had managed the Chronicle in the mid 30s, bought the business in 1944. He sold it to Ian Thomson in 1950, but in 1952 Ian had a serious car accident and Ron took over and ran it again until 1959. Ron was master of the Masonic lodge in 1956.Chapter 23 Raglan by R T Vernon 1975 1959-63 Bill Racke was the last editor, ceasing publication on 24 April 1963. In 1963 a few copies of the Raglan Rally came out. In 1967 the disused Chronicle Office building was purchased for a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting place. The casements were removed and a brick front built. It has since seen several uses and became Raglan Gym in 2011. 1988-1997 In the late 1980s, under the influence of Eva Rickard, Whaingaroa Kite Whenua Trust, as part of its training for unemployed youth, ran an Office Skills training module. Mike Bell was their literacy and numeracy tutor and assisted students to develop and conduct a survey asking Raglan residents about community needs. Most clearly identified was the need for a local newspaper. Mike initiated the creation and publication of the first edition of the Raglan New Chronicle in August 1988 and continued to edit and grow the publication over the following eight years. Delivery was by volunteers. Publication and editing was passed on to the Brownlees in 1996. In 1997 Stephen and Tracy Frew took over and, in April 2004, the Chronicle once again got an office on Bow St in the former petrol station shop and dropped the 'New' title.http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=878846 Another new development was the web site, so that the paper was regularly read in UK, US and Australia.http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=932789 April 2006 saw further change, as David and Jacqui Smith became editors and the Chronicle appeared for the first time in colour and reverted to tabloid format (see photo above). In September 2007 the Chronicle office moved to 2 Wainui Rd (see street scene on https://maps.google.com/). The paper moved upstairs, next door, in October 2016.

Educated at West Point and commissioned as an officer in the 1st Infantry Regiment in 1811, he was assigned to duty at Fort Dearborn, a frontier post at the mouth of the Chicago River. Just over one year later Ronan was killed in combat in the Battle of Fort Dearborn. He was the first member of the West Point Corps of Cadets to perish in battle. First West Point graduate killed in action was George Ronan, killed fighting against Native American allies of the British in the War of 1812. On August 15, 1812, he was mortally wounded during Captain Nathan Heald’s desperate battle near Fort Chicago, IL, against a vastly superior force of Native Americans. Military service George Ronan attended the United States Military Academy for almost three years, from June 1808 to March 1811. At the time Ronan matriculated, the fledgling institute of military education was six years old, and he accepted his commission in the academy's ninth year. A trickle of shako-clad cadets graduated from the then-tiny institution of higher military training to take up duty stations in sensitive security points up and down the young United States. One of the most threatened positions was a small stockaded fort and associated fur trading post near the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Although the Chicago River and its hinterland was officially part of the United States, the Fort Dearborn soldiers and fur traders were sharply outnumbered by adjacent bands of Native Americans. The predominant Chicago River tribe was the Potawatomi nation, a group of clans who retained their loyalty to the British even though their land had been nominally ceded to the U.S.A. by the 1783 Treaty of Paris. On the North American Great Lakes, the years immediately prior to the breakout of the War of 1812 were characterized by increasingly embittered competition between British-Canadian fur traders and American merchants, including traders aligned with the interest of the powerful John Jacob Astor of the American Fur Company. Native Americans who were embedded in British-aligned fur trading and kinship networks were aware of the advance of the American frontiersmen into southern Indiana and Illinois Territory. Although Ronan did not know it, his 1811-1812 assignment to Fort Dearborn was a duty posting to a spark point. Ronan is described by survivors as a high-spirited young ensign who did not get along well with his commanding officer, fort commander Captain Nathan Heald. Heald, possibly in retaliation, ordered Ronan to undertake a series of increasingly dangerous operations outside the fort walls in ultimately futile efforts to knit together the tiny band of French-speaking, English-speaking, and Native American-speaking farmers and traders who lived in cabins scattered up and down the Chicago River. When war broke out, Heald received orders to evacuate his post and remove his garrison to Fort Wayne, Indiana. The news of the fort's evacuation, scheduled for August 15, 1812, emboldened the Chicago \\"British band\\" of Potawatomi, who took a position two miles south of the doomed stockade along the shore of Lake Michigan. On the morning of August 15, Ronan's attempt to help lead a knot of civilian refugees part of the overall 93-person column of evacuees ran into an ambush. Witnesses saw Ronan continuing to struggle even after suffering a mortal wound, and he allegedly accounted for two hostile warriors before his death. Legacy Survivors believed that the spot where Ensign George Ronan was struck down was at or close to what later became the intersection of 21st Street and Indiana Avenue, located in the Prairie Avenue neighborhood of Chicago's Near South Side. Ronan is repeatedly described as the first West Point officer to die in the War of 1812.Fredriksen, p. 193 As an \\"ensign\\", the lowest rank of commissioned officer in 1811-1812, Ronan held a rank equivalent to that of the subsequent rank of second lieutenant, and is sometimes referred to as such. Sculptor Henry Hering, in his 1928 \\"Defense\\" mounted on the Michigan Avenue Bridge adjacent to the site of Fort Dearborn, centered the bas-relief on an unnamed junior officer who was depicted performing the role protection of civilians that Ronan tried to carry out in reality. Ronan Park, a 3-acre (0.01 km²) unit of the Chicago Park District located at 3000 West Argyle Street on the Chicago River, is named in Ronan's honor.

The album's production comes from 7L, Spada4 and DJ Premier.  Critical reception  Czarface was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 7 reviews, which indicates \\"generally positive reviews\\". Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave the album four out of five stars, saying \\"CZARFACE has no major flaws. It’s obviously not for everyone, yet even when incorporating current critical favorites like Action Bronson and Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire, no compromises are made. Inspectah Deck, 7L & Esoteric use '90s East Coast Hip Hop as a blueprint to innovate, and ultimately, that’s what made that era so special in the first place.\\" Bryan Hahn of The Source gave the album a positive review, saying \\"Czarface doesn't fall short of what it wanted to accomplish-knocking the chumps out the ring. It doesn't pretend to deliver positive messages for the kids or even tell heart wrenching stories about the hood. Plain and simple, 7L masterminded sinister beats while Esoteric and Inspectah Deck recruited some fellow emcees to show the potential of the often-mislead art of lyricism can sound like. Long live, Czarface.\\" Mark Bozzer of Exclaim! gave the album a seven out of ten, saying \\"Minus all of the corny sound bites, this album undoubtedly keeps the underground renaissance sizzling.\\" Bogar Alonso of XXL gave the album an XL, saying \\"Mention of the ‘90s, hip-hop’s supposed last golden era, might make some queeze, and for good reason. Hip-hop purists have long sucked on the decade like a warm thumb, afraid of the cold, mean world that lay ahead. But CZARFACE, also the name for Deck and co.’s group, keeps matters as fresh. The album’s marquee—with names like Roc Marciano, Action Bronson, and Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire—assures just that. “Cement 3’s,” “It’s Raw,” and “Poisonous Thoughts”―listed in the order of appearance of the guests mentioned―come off as love letters rather than industry rub-offs.

From 1578 to 1588 he printed numerous, mainly religious works in London, and from 1590 to 1603, more than 100 books in Scotland. In 1603, following King James I of England's accession to the English throne, he returned to England, but died later the same year. Waldegrave is chiefly known for printing the first four of the Marprelate tracts on a secret press, and for printing the works of King James I of Scotland in Scotland. Family Little is known of Waldegrave's parents. According to the Stationers' Register, his father was Richard Waldegrave, a yeoman from Blockley three miles northwest of Moreton in Marsh, then in Worcestershire, now in Gloucestershire. He died before 1568. Further information may be gleaned from the will of Thomas Freman, of Blockley, yeoman, which was proved 27 May 1546 by Richard Sambage and Richard Walgrave, two of the four named executors. The text of the will, dated 16 March 1545 (37 Henry VIII) includes the testator's mother-in-law, Margery Walgrave, who receives 20/- (twenty shillings). John Walgrave and Martyn Walgrave are also beneficiaries. In addition Richard Walgrave is assigned the task of oversight of husbandry.Will of Thomas Freman, yeoman of Blockley, Worcestershire, proved 27 May 1546, PROB 11/31/160, National Archives. Waldegrave is thought to have married about 1580. His wife's Christian name was Mary, but her surname is unknown. They had six children before Waldegrave arrived in Scotland. A seventh child, Robert, was born in September 1596 in Edinburgh. Early career On 24 June 1568 Waldegrave began an eight-year apprenticeship with the London stationer, William Griffith: > Robert Walgrave the sonne of Rychard walgrave late of blacklay in the > Countye of Worcestre yeoman Deceassed hath put hym self apprentes to Wylliam > greffeth Cetizen and stacioner of London from the feaste of the nativite of > saynte John bapteste anno 1568 viij yeres. Having completed his apprenticeship, Waldegrave should have gained the freedom of the Stationers' Company by 1576; however, as the Company records for that year are lost, there is no record of his having done so. His name first appears in the company's records as a publisher on 17 June 1578, when he became licensed to publish The Castle for the Soule, the first of many religious texts he printed or published during his career. Waldegrave's principal place of business was \\"Without Temple Bar in the Strand\\", near Somerset House, although in 1583 he was located for a short time in Foster Lane. In that year he was recorded as having two presses. In the late 1580s his imprints indicate that he occasionally published from shops at the sign of the Crane in Paul's Churchyard and the sign of the White Horse in Cannon Lane. He soon became known for printing the works of English clergymen and others who dissented from the established religion, including Dudley Fenner, Laurence Chaderton and John Field. He also published editions of works by continental and Scottish religious reformers, among them Martin Luther, John Calvin and John Knox. During the 1580s he was twice imprisoned in the White Lion prison in Southwark, spending 20 weeks there in 1586–7. In February the following year, a Star Chamber decree restricted his publishing activities. That April, he anonymously printed and published John Udall's The State of the Churche of England Laid Open, or Diotrephes, but on 16 April officers of the Stationers' Company confiscated his press and almost all his type, together with copies of Udall's book. Although he escaped from his house carrying a box of type hidden beneath his cloak, the copies of Udall's book were burned, and his seized press and type destroyed.  Marprelate tracts  The Whitefriars, Coventry, home of John Hales, where Waldegrave printed the Schoolpoints and Hay Any Work For Cooper on the secret press Waldegrave hid the salvaged type at the house of Mistress Crane in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury. Born Elizabeth Hussey, Mistress Crane was the widow of Queen Elizabeth's Cofferer of the HouseholdOfficers of the Green Cloth: Cofferer and Master of the Household,Officers of the Green Cloth: Masters Anthony Crane (d.1583), had reformist sympathies, and in the late spring of 1588 she allowed Waldegrave and John Penry to set up a secret press at her country home at East Molesey, Surrey, across the Thames from Hampton Court Palace. The first tract to be printed there was another of Udall's works, the Demonstration of Discipline. In late 1588 and early 1589, Waldegrave embarked on an even more controversial enterprise, printing the first four tracts written against the ecclesiastical authorities by an unknown satirist using the pseudonym Martin Marprelate. The first of the Marprelate tracts, Martin's Epistle was printed on the secret press in October 1588. The tract enjoyed immense popularity, and the ecclesiastical authorities instigated a hue and cry after Martin. In November the press was moved from East Molesey to Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley in Northamptonshire, where Martin's second tract, The Epitome, was printed. Shortly thereafter the secret press was moved to the Whitefriars, Coventry, the home of Knightley's great-nephew, John Hales, where Certaine Minerall and Metaphysicall Schoolpoints and Hay Any Worke for Cooper were printed, the former in early January and the latter in late March 1589. Waldegrave then refused to print any further tracts, citing the Puritan ministers' disapproval of Martin Marprelate's course of action. Waldegrave had a patron and protector in James VI of Scotland who asked his diplomat Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairny to intercede with Elizabeth for him.William Fraser, The Melvilles: Melville & Leven Correspondence, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 10-11. Scotland Waldegrave's movements in the months immediately after he left the secret press are uncertain; John Penry claimed that he was printing in La Rochelle in May 1589. However, by early 1590 he was in Edinburgh, where by March that year he was granted a licence to print. On 9 October he was appointed King's Printer by James VI. In December the English ambassador Robert Bowes noted that James VI had \\"planted Waldegrave to be his printer\\", and he was a near and unwelcome neighbour of Bowes, who was usually lodged with Janet Fockart.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 435. From that point until his death in 1603–4, Waldegrave printed over 100 works, \\"making him the most prolific Scottish printer of the sixteenth century\\". His output consisted principally of religious works, but also included William Welwood's The Sea-Law of Scotland, a pirated edition of Sir Philip Sidney's The Arcadia, and three works by King James: the Poetical Exercises (1591), the Daemonologie, The Trew Law, and Basilikon Doron. In September 1594 Bowes was asked to remonstrate with him for printing a tract Principis Scoti-Britannorum Natalia written by Andrew Melville. Waldegrave claimed not to understand enough Latin to known that work referred to the succession to the crown of England, and called James VI, \\"King of all Britain\\". James VI told Bowes that he not read them either. Waldegrave told Bowes that he had declined to print the speech or oration made by David Cunningham, Bishop of Aberdeen, at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle, which also referred to the succession.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1995, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 430-1. In February 1597 he suffered a temporary setback when he was convicted of \\"treasonably printing\\" an Act of the Scottish Parliament. However, the conviction was later set aside. When King James acceded to the English crown, following the death of Queen Elizabeth in March 1603, Waldegrave returned to England, leaving his Edinburgh printing business in his wife's care. He obtained a licence to print from the Stationers' Company in June 1603, but died later the same year during an outbreak of the plague and was buried at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, on 22 October. If he left a will, it has not survived.

In addition to a solo career, he has played keyboards with Van Morrison, Jerry Garcia. and Craig Chaquico Early life Ozzie Ahlers was born June 3, 1946 in Summit, New Jersey. During high school he participated in numerous bands including The Wizards and Oz, winning local talent contests and playing in east coast colleges. Before he graduated from Summit High School, he spent a summer on the road touring as a back up musician with The Shirelles singing group. After graduation, he attended Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, where he formed a popular band in the 60's, The Oz and Ends, touring colleges for 6 years. Career In 1970 Ahlers formed the group Glory River and was signed by Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Productions to a recording contract in New York City. The band toured and played numerous venues regularly including The Electric Circus and Fillmore East. In 1972, Ahlers moved to California, where he toured with Van Morrison and recorded three albums with Jesse Colin Young on Warner Bros. Records. He played the keyboard in Peter Rowan's band Free Mexican Airforce 1977–1978. During these years he also recorded with Gene Clark of The Byrds and rocker Greg Kihn. In 1978, he was involved with Rob Nilsson's Cine Manifest and wrote the music for the film Northern Lights, which won the Camera d’Or at The Cannes Film Festival. In 1979, Ahlers joined the Jerry Garcia Band, both touring and recording with Garcia for the next two years. He played keyboards on the albums Live at the Capitol Theater, After Midnight: Kean College, Garcia Live Volume One, and Garcia Plays Dylan. In 1981, he became a founding member, songwriter and keyboard player in the rock- reggae band The Edge with bandmates Lorin Rowan and Jimmy Dillon. In 1990, Ahlers was hired by Gumby creator Art Clokey to create the music for the cult classic Gumby: The Movie, and hired Craig Chaquico from Jefferson Starship to play lead guitar. Owing to the time that it takes to complete a feature-length stop-motion film, the movie wouldn't be released until 1995. In 1992, Ahlers and Chaquico collaborated and signed with Higher Octave Records. They recorded their first album in 1993, Acoustic Highway, which rose on the Billboard Magazine charts and Radio & Records Magazine. For their next album, Acoustic Planet, they were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1995 as well as charting a No. 1 position in Billboard. For 2 years in a row, Ahlers and Chaquico won a Bay Area Music Award for Best Independent Album. Ahlers continued playing keyboards, songwriting, and producing ten Chaquico albums for another 16 years, as well as being the musical director for his own worldwide touring band. He became a solo artist on the Higher Octave Music label with his album Fingerpainting. During the 1990s, Ahlers co-wrote, produced, and played keyboards for four albums by blues artist Jimmy Dillon: Bad and Blue, The Next Frame, Rituals and Everything. He is the musical director for the Blue Star Music Camps for Kids in the Bay Area, founded by guitarist Jimmy Dillon. In 2011, Ahlers created the DVD piano lesson series Killer Keyboards Made Simple.

It tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city's gods. The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works: the slapstick comedy, Clouds, written by Aristophanes and first performed in 423 BCE; the dramatic monologue, Apology, written by Plato to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial; and Plato's Crito and Phaedo, two dialogues describing the events leading to Socrates’ execution in 399 BCE. The play was written by Andrew David Irvine of the University of British Columbia and premiered by director Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company in 2007 at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver.Irvine, Andrew D. “Production Notes,” Socrates on Trial, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, 23 In the judgment of one reviewer, the play succeeds in presenting Socrates both as Plato's wise mentor and as the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” teacher presented by Aristophanes,Anon., “Socrates on Trial,” Riveting Riffs Magazine, 2008, http://www.rivetingriffs.com/Socrates%20On%20Trial.html giving modern audiences a greater appreciation of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death. In the judgment of another reviewer, the play is “a worthy analogue of an ancient masterpiece.”Byron Kaldis, “Philosophy and/of the Theatre,” in Anna Lazou and Georgios Patios, Art, Philosophy, Therapy, vol. 2, Athens: Arnaoutis Books, 2017, 14 Plot The play takes place in three acts spread over a quarter century. Act One, like Aristophanes’ Clouds on which the act is based, is satirical. The act opens with Strepsiades, an Athenian businessman, worried about his lazy son Pheidippides. To educate him, Strepsiades enrolls him in Socrates’ School of Thinkology. While at the school, the young man is encouraged to consider both sides of every argument. Unfortunately, rather than being impressed by the Stronger Argument, which advocates virtue, excellence and moderation, Pheidippides is influenced more by the Weaker Argument, which advocates immorality, debauchery and dissoluteness. The result is a “mind blowing, portrayal of debauchery and irreverence”Anon., “Socrates on Trial,” Riveting Riffs Magazine, 2008, http://www.rivetingriffs.com/Socrates%20On%20Trial.html in which, rather than being educated, Pheidippides ends up being further corrupted by Socrates and his school. Act Two takes place twenty-four years later. Socrates has been charged with corrupting the young and failing to recognize the city's traditional gods. The three men making the charges are Meletus, Anytus and Lykon. All three have given their speeches and Socrates is now required to defend himself in front of the jury. The speech Socrates gives is at times humorous and at times moving. However, far from apologizing for the influence he has had over the city's youth, Socrates remains defiant. Repeatedly he tells the jury that he has never run a school or worked as a teacher. Even so, the Athenians have been lucky to have had him raising questions about what they think they know, and about the nature of justice. The act ends with Socrates reminding the jury that he is innocent of all charges and that they have a duty, not to reward the speaker who has delivered the most polished speech, but to see that justice is done. Act Three takes place a month later on the eve of Socrates’ execution. In Socrates’ jail cell, Socrates’ best friend, Crito, and Socrates’ wife, Xanthippe, take turns trying to convince the condemned man that he should escape, something that might easily be arranged. Socrates refuses, saying that to do so would further corrupt the young, something he swore to the jury he would never do. To fulfill the order of execution, Socrates is required to drink a cup of hemlock, a type of poison. His last words, after the hemlock has begun to do its work, is that he and his friends owe a debt to Asclepius, the god of medicine. Some commentators have understood these words to mean that Socrates’ last concern, as he was preparing to enter the afterlife, was with the health of his soul. A much more likely explanation is that the offering was simply part of an annual religious festival that recognized the debt all Athenians owed to Asclepius for having recently delivered them from the plague.McPherran, Mark L. “Socrates, Crito, and Their Debt to Asclepius,” Ancient Philosophy 23 (2003): 71–92 Having just told all of Athens that he respected the gods of the city and that he was not a corruptor of the young, Socrates would have been especially concerned to observe the city's rituals. The play ends with Socrates’ friends mourning their loss.

Audience participation  Steve Baumber and Daryl Hutchings in the roles of the Weaker and Stronger Arguments, in the Vital Spark Theatre production (2008) Socrates on Trial strongly encourages audience participation.Alapin, Maya. Review of Socrates on Trial. Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2008.08.08 During Socrates’ day, juries were much larger than they are today. Juries of several hundred, or even several thousand, were not uncommon.MacDowell, Douglas M. The Law in Classical Athens, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978, 36-40 Large juries were thought to make it more difficult for jurors to be bribed. Athenian juries were also not quiet. If people thought a speaker was stretching or misrepresenting the truth, they’d often yell out, much to the delight of onlookers.Plato, Laws 876b; Plato, Apology 21a In the play, audience members are asked to serve as members of the jury. In Act Two they are encouraged join the actors in heckling Socrates. At the end of the act they are also given the job of voting to determine Socrates’ guilt or innocence. One effective way of holding the vote is to have audience members walk to the front of the theatre to choose either a black or white stone and place it in a bronze container. Voting by a public show of hands – which was common in Athenian assemblies, but rare in Athenian trialsMacDowell, Douglas M. The Law in Classical Athens, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978, 252 – is not recommended, since a persuasive performance on the part of the actor playing the role of Socrates might encourage more audience members to vote in favour of Socrates’ acquittal than history allows. In large theatres, directors may choose to restrict the size of the jury. However, given the large size of Athenian juries, it is more realistic to use larger rather than smaller portions of the audience for this purpose. Past directors have reported that participating as jurors is something audience members enjoy.Irvine, Andrew D. “Production Notes,” Socrates on Trial, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, 22 Historical background 2015 playbill Because Socrates’ trial took place not long after the end of the Peloponnesian War, Athens’ humiliating loss to Sparta was still on many people's minds. During wartime, it was understood by the Greeks that victory came from two sources: the protection of the gods, and the unwavering loyalty of a city's young soldiers.Nails, Debra The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett, 2002, 17-20 So the charge of corrupting the young and failing to recognize the city's gods was serious, and much like the charge of treason.Xenophon, Memorabilia 1.2 Also on people's minds could have been the relationships Socrates had to several of Athens' most famous wartime traitors, including Critias and Alcibiades. Critias was reportedly related to Plato's mother, Perictione. Following the war, he became a leading member of the ruthless oligarchic regime the Spartans installed in Athens for eight months in 404-403, the Thirty Tyrants. Although some modern authors see this connection as a possible indication of Socrates' sympathy for the anti- democratic Spartans, this claim is hard to reconcile with the fact that it was the Thirty Tyrants who passed a law forbidding Socrates from speaking to any man under thirty, fearing his influence over the young.Xenophon, Memorabilia, 1.2.31-7 Socrates' connection to Alcibiades is similarly controversial, even though many of the details of Alcibiades's flamboyant life are well known. Alcibiades and Socrates fought together during the siege of Potidaea and again at the Battle of Delium, prior to Alcibiades' election to the post of Strategos (or General) and his eventual defection to Sparta. According to both Plato and Plutarch, as a young man Alcibiades admired and respected Socrates.Plato, Symposium, 215a-222b; Plutarch, Alcibiades, 6 Even so, the degree to which Socrates may have influenced his actions remains unclear.For example, see Isocrates, Busiris, 5 One point of historical departure in the play is that the script gives the jury only a single opportunity to vote.Irvine, Andrew D. Socrates on Trial, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, 96, 100 Originally two votes were taken: the first to determine Socrates’ guilt or innocence, the second to choose between proposed penalties after he was found guilty.Plato, Apology 35d, 38b In contexts requiring greater historical authenticity, this second vote can easily be reintroduced although, depending on the size of the jury, doing so may add to the act's running time. Productions and adaptations 2008 playbill The first workshop production of the play was mounted in Vancouver in 2006 by Vital Spark Theatre with Stephen Wexler playing the role of Socrates. The full play was premiered on March 14, 2007, at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver. A 2008 production, also at the Chan Centre, included Paul Toolan in the title role. All three productions were directed by Joan Bryans. The American premier of the play was held at College Theatre within the State University of New York at Potsdam. It took place on April 29, 2009, and was directed by Mandy Keister. In 2012, the play was adapted into the opera The Trial of Socrates, with libretto and score by Andrew Hopper of the Birmingham Conservatoire. The opera was premiered in Birmingham on May 8, 2012. On September 25, 2015, the play had its European premiere in Athens at the Alkmini Theatre under the direction of Anna Lazou. The translation into Greek was done by Giannis Spyridis. The title role was played by Demophilus-Vias Mpillinis and Thanassis Nakos. Music was provided by Christos Pantas. Costumes and masks were by Katerina Mpillinis. The play was originally published in 2008 by the University of Toronto Press. Permission from the publisher has been granted royalty free for educational and other not-for-profit performances and readings, provided appropriate acknowledgement is given to both the playwright and the publisher.Irvine, Andrew D. Socrates on Trial, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, iv In the words of reviewer Maya Alapin, “The play is refreshingly illuminating on the relationship between Socrates’ execution and the lasting influence of Aristophanes’ negative depiction of him on the evolution of the Athenian psyche. This connection, often underemphasized in modern analysis, is especially poignant given the unity of the three Acts ... The play succeeds in recreating an atmosphere of direct democracy and of depicting Socrates as deeply convinced of his own innocence. His commitment to obeying the laws is also emphasized, as is his persistent questioning of the general Athenian standard of moral education. Profound ethical questions surrounding the justness or unjustness of executing democratic dissenters are unambiguously raised. ... There is no doubt that the play is engaging, funny, insightful, and true to central Socratic positions and that it will appeal to a modern audience, particularly to students.\\"Alapin, Maya.

Ithaka created the story-telling lyrical content of its songs sporadically in the couple of years leading up to the actual studio recordings. They are often based upon his own personal adventures in Western Europe, North Africa and his native Los Angeles. They cover diverse subjects such as astrology, street violence and surf travel (such as depicted in the song \\"Somewhere South of Gibraltar\\"). Recording The album was recorded in early 1995 during a one-month period at Namouche Studios in Lisbon, Portugal (the city where Ithaka lived and worked from 1992 to 1998). The approximate budget was $8,000 USD. The record (produced by Joe Fossard and Grizzly) consists of thirteen tracks, with Ithaka assuming lead vocals. It features many Portuguese and African guest performers, including singers Marta Dias (São Tomé, West Africa) and Ninicha (Portugal); rappers General D (Mozambique) and Lince (São Tomé); and Portuguese musicians Tiago Santos (guitar), João Gomes (keyboards), Francisco Rebelo (bass), Nuno Reis (trumpet), and Paulo Muiños (saxophone). The latter four were members of the project Cool Hipnoise. Artist and musician João Paulo Feliciano also appeared as a guitarist on the song \\"Somewhere South of Gibraltar\\". Single In June of 1995, a few weeks before the actual album release, a free CD single of the mythical, urban-story song \\"Fishdaddy\\" (track #3 on the album) was included in the youth culture magazine Super Jovem published by Editora Abril. Ithaka appeared on the cover of that issue, in an image created by João Barbosa. Reception Although Ithaka is an American citizen of Greek ancestry and the album's vocals are almost entirely in English, because Flowers and the Color of Paint was entirely recorded in Portugal and utilized many Portuguese- language guest performers, the record (and also Ithaka's following album Stellafly) is often included in the genre of music known as Primeira Geração hip hop tuga (or first generation rap Portuguese) along with artists such as Black Company, Boss AC, Da Weasel, General D, Mind Da Gap, and Zona Dread. The album overall was considered a critical success at the time of release by most of the media outlets in its main territory of distribution, Portugal. It was considered by some as the record that showed the true potential of hip hop in Portugal.https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/68688/2/26174.pdf Songs from Flowers and the Color of Paint received a fair amount of radio play on mainstream Portuguese stations such as RFM and Antena 3. Ithaka appeared on the covers of Pop Rock, Blitz, and Super Jovem magazines during the summer of the album's release. Flowers and the Color of Paint was nominated in three categories at Channel SIC's televised 1995 Premios Blitz (considered the Grammy Awards of Portugal) for Best New Artist, Best Male Vocalist and Best Album.https://surftotal.com/videos/internacional/item/15317-i-ride-because- darin-pappas-um-multi-talentoso-homem-do-mar A 1999 article written by Luis Maio titled \\"Os Maiores Talentos Portugueses Dos anos 90\\" (The Biggest Portuguese Talents Of The 1990s) published in the national newspaper Público, listed Flowers and the Color of Paint as one of the most influential Portuguese albums of the 1990s. In 2001, writer Rui Portulez described the album in another Público article as \\"um dos discos mais interessantes do hip- hop português\\" (\\"one of the most interesting Portuguese hip hop records\\"). In the 2004 book Belong: A TV Journalist's Search for Urban Culture (published by Insomniac Press), Canadian author Jennifer Morton says about the album, \\"The sound is smooth vocals with a nice background groove and a little Portuguese rap dropped in. It's good. Ithaka was so out there, doing his own thing. People liked him. He speaks his lyrics and has some great lines such as, My loyalty don't lie in street commotion, I give my praise to the motion of the ocean, she kept me out of trouble, she kept me alive, she kept me off the street, away from guns and knives.\\" A 2016 article in the Portuguese music magazine Blitz cited Flowers and the Color of Paint as one of \\"Os 40 Melhores Álbuns Dos Anos 90 Em Portugal\\" (\\"One Of The Best 40 Portuguese Records of the 1990s\\"). In 2017, the journalist Hugo Jorge included the album in his article \\"Os álbuns Mais Caros Do Hip Hop Português\\" (\\"The Most Expensive Portuguese Hip Hop Albums\\") for his column on the music website Rimas E Batidas, stating it to be among the priciest of Portuguese urban music releases. He discovered rare used copies of the original CD pressing selling on the international marketplace Discogs for upwards of 59€.https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Color- Paint-Ithaka/dp/B00118YQAA Songs in film and television In 1995, two songs from the album, \\"The Pigeon Lady\\" and the record's title track, \\"Flowers and the Color of Paint\\", were featured in a musical surf film called G-Land Pro. The project was an experimental non-dialogue documentary depicting a World Surf League \\"Dream Tour\\" event called the 1995 Quiksilver Pro (in Grajagan, Java, Indonesia) directed/edited by professional surfers Seth Elmer and Doug Silva. It aired on some sports channels, but was primarily for sale as a DVD in surf shops that carried Quiksilver products. In the segments featuring the two Color of Paint songs, top professional surfers including eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater, two-time world champion Tom Carroll, Rob Machado, Jeff Booth, Pat O'Connel and John Shimooka are pictured riding some of the best waves that had ever been seen for an international competition. In 1998, three years after the album's release, the song \\"Escape From The City Of Angels\\" (featuring Marta Dias) was used in the soundtrack of director Antoine Fuqua's feature film debut Replacement Killers. Other musical artists on the soundtrack included The Crystal Method, Talvin Singh, Tricky, Death In Vegas, Hed PE, and Brad.

Initial reports gave at least 50 people killed and over 120 people injured, and by 27 January a death toll of 61 was reported. Officials on the first day of the riot faulted media for breaking news in advance that the prison would be searched by the military. As the riot continued into a second day, human rights groups faulted overcrowding and conditions in the gang-dominated prison. Outbreak The riot was reportedly triggered by an announcement that, in an anti-gang measure, Venezuelan National Guard troops would be searching for weapons. The inmates were reportedly waiting for the National Guard when they arrived. Most injuries were from gunshot wounds. Bodies have been described as unidentifiable due to their mutilation. Due to the mutilation, officials were charged for a violation of human rights. Response In a press statement on the first day of the riot, minister of penitentiary services Iris Varela laid blame on the local media for reporting the prison search ahead of time, stating that many of the deaths were a \\"settling of scores\\" among rival prison gangs. Human rights groups blamed overcrowding and inhumane conditions, as well as poor execution and unnecessary force. Unnamed critics of the government noted that the Inter- American Court of Human Rights had called on president Hugo Chávez in 2007 to relieve conditions there that put visitors, inmates, and guards at risk. The inmates were temporarily removed as a result of two days of rioting.

Dunn was English and had worked for architect Alexander Lauder in Barnstaple, Devon, where he worked with Arts and Crafts movement theorist and practitioner W.R. Lethaby. Through Dunn's English connections, when Ussher completed his architecture articles in Melbourne, he visited England and was introduced to architect Walter Butler. Later Ussher and Butler formed a partnership in Melbourne.Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture: p.726 'Ussher and Kemp' Ussher's first architectural partner, Walter Richmond Butler (1864–1949), was an English architect who worked in London as chief assistant to ecclesiastical architect J. D. Sedding.Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture: p.128 'Walter Butler' Butler was accepted into the Arts and Crafts and Domestic Revival circles centred on William Morris and Richard Norman Shaw, among whom his closest friend was Ernest Gimson (1864–1919). In June 1888 Butler left Sedding's office and sailed for Australia, perhaps at the prompting of young architect Beverley Ussher then visiting London. Three of Butler's brothers and one of his sisters also settled in Australia. From 1889 until 1893 Butler was in partnership with Ussher. In 1896 they were joined by George C. Inskip but they parted in 1905 after a dispute with the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects over the conduct of a competition. Beverley Ussher and Henry (Hardie) Kemp (born Broughton, Lancashire, UK, 10 March 1859; died Melbourne, 22 April 1946) then formed a partnership in Melbourne in 1899, which lasted until Ussher's death (1908). This \\"brilliant partnership\\" pioneered the Australian Federation style of domestic architecture. Both Ussher and Kemp had strong Arts and Crafts commitments, and both had been in partnerships before forming their own. The practice specialised in domestic work and their houses epitomise the Marseilles-tiled Queen Anne (or Federation style) houses characteristic of Melbourne, and considered now to be a truly distinctive Australian genre. At the time of their creation they were a break with the use of cement render, applied stucco ornament, cast iron, slates, and double hung windows. Their designs use red bricks, terracotta tiles and casement windows, avoid applied ornamentation and develop substantial timber details. The picturesque character of the houses results from a conscious attempt to express externally with gables, dormers, bays, roof axes, and chimneys, the functional variety of rooms within. The iconic Federation style houses by Beverley Ussher and Henry Kemp did not appear until 1892-4. Then, several of those appeared in Boroondara. Dalswraith for William Gibson, 99 Studley Park Road, Kew (1906) and a house for A. Norman, 7 Adeney Avenue, Kew (1908) are superb examples of his designs. \\"George Tibbits has discussed this firm at great length in his article \\"The so-called Melbourne Domestic Queen Anne\\".'The so-called 'Melbourne domestic Queen Anne', by George Tibbits in Historic Environment, Vol.2, no. 2, 1982 It was undoubtably one of the most accomplished and prolific of the Melbourne practices of the early twentieth century. It drew on a distinguished line of work by the individual partners from the nineteenth century.\\"City of Malvern Heritage Study, Appendix One, architects of Malvern  Ussher & Butler  Butler and Ussher worked together on a series of designs between 1890 and 1893, many of which are considered to be outstanding examples of the Picturesque Aesthetic. George Tibbits, in an article titled 'The So- Called Melbourne Domestic Queen Anne' describes Blackwood Homestead as being 'one of the finest 19th century examples' of this type.  Ussher in solo practice  Beverley Ussher designed the house 'Milliara' (John Whiting house) in Wallace Avenue. Toorak, in about 1895. It seemed very anglophile in that it had a drawing room ceiling which exactly reproduced the dining hall ceiling at Bolsover Castle, which Ussher had himself measured and drawn. However the architraves of the arches were decorated with local flora, and the panelling used Australian timbers. Two years later the emphasis on local timber was even greater in Ussher's house for J C Foden in Canterbury: \\"The whole of the woodwork of the drawing room, dining room, hall, stairs and landing, including the sliding doors, was carried out in Australian and New Zealand woods, such as silky oak, blackwood, fiddleback and kauri, and then French polished.\\"  Ussher & Kemp Houses Ussher & Kemp are said to have been responsible for nearly every impressive Federation Queen Anne style house in the eastern suburbs of Kew, Hawthorn and Camberwell. Ussher's work falls into two categories: Gabled designs, usually large two-storey houses where gables project from an overall hipped roof. In general, Ussher's largest houses (such as Dalwraith in Kew of 1906), adopt the gabled form. Single storey designs, the large, spreading multi-gabled form that developed into the distinctive Queen Anne style the dominant house style in the first decade of the twentieth century. Seminal examples by Assher & Kemp include the Hedges House in Canterbury and the Clarke house in Toorak, both of 1897. Together Ussher & Kemp developed this style with, characteristically featuring tall Marseilles tiled hipped roofs, timber verandah decorations, and a strongly three- dimensional form with emphasis. The Queen Anne style combined with some of the principles of Australian homestead planning and design around the turn of the century, to produce a new suburban style continuing to the end of World War One and is sometimes loosely referred to as Edwardian or Federation. Queen Anne style had an ongoing influence on vernacular design which can be seen up to the 1960s. The domestic Queen Anne style buildings which survive from the turn of the century had a vital role in the development of the urban form of metropolis.\\" * Arden 1045 Burke Rd Hawthorn East, VIC, (1906) Architecturally significant for: its adaptation of Queen Anne style to a tight site; the complexity of its elevation and planning; the use of the unusual splayed corner on a Queen Anne style design; and for the outstanding fence, rare on Queen Anne-style houses throughout Metropolitan Melbourne. Arden was demolished in 2017 after a long battle through VCAT and the Supreme Court, replaced by a visually disjointed, ordinary block of apartments which were judged by VCAT to be a better public outcome than Arden. * Avondale 22 Berkeley St Hawthorn, VIC, Australia. Built during Hawthorn's period of Edwardian prosperity for grocer, Benjamin Ratcliffe, this substantial brick residence was rated first in 1903–04 as a brick house of eleven rooms, unfinished, Net Annual Value 90 pounds. The previous year, the site had been vacant land. The valuation went up to 100 pounds in 1907, when the property of eleven rooms was known as Avondale and occupied still by the Ratcliffe family. * Carramah, 31 Canterbury Road, Camberwell, Vic 3124 \\"A magnificent landmark residence\\" Built Circa 1909 for Herbert Parsons a spice trader and set on a magnificent allotment (2,089sqm) with superbly landscaped and maintained gardens, this landmark residence showcases the elegance and graciousness of classic Ussher & Kemp architecture, whilst providing unparalleled family living and entertaining areas both inside and outside. * Coorinyah House 150 Mont Albert Road Canterbury (1899) Architects Ussher & Kemp acted for Mellor when the house was connected to the MMBW sewer, in 1907, and it appears that they were also the designers. At Coorinyah, the broad hipped roof is the dominant backdrop for a number of gabled roof forms, chimneys and the unusual shingle-spired look-out, with its attached chimney. Below the eaves line giant arched timber supports spring between gabled verandah or room bays, almost removing the visual support for the large roof expanses above it. * Cottage by the Sea orphanage at Queenscliff (1892) Beverly Ussher's seminal Cottage by the Sea orphanage at Queenscliff (now demolished), set out the mature Federation villa form: see The Building and Engineering Journal, 8, 184, 9 January 1892, p. 14,The Building and Engineering Journal, 8.184, 9 January 1892,p. 14 (Ussher’s Cottage by the Sea). * Cupples house, now Travancore, at 104 (now 608) 608 Riversdale Road CAMBERWELL (1899) A perfect example of a gracious residence standing on a cul-de-sac corner showcasing lavish architectural allure. * Dalswraith 99 Studley Park Road, Kew, (1906) (A-graded) RAIA 20th CENTURY BUILDINGS REGISTER (later Campion Hall) * Dalvui Homestead Terang (1908) Dalvui at 4310 Mackinnons Bridge Road.

A large indented gateway was at a comer splay in the allotment and an asphalt tennis court on the west of the house. Architects, Ussher & Kemp, designed this nine- room Queen Anne styled house for importer, William Halsey in 1900. G. Garrett was the builder. Later owners included J.R Wood and P.R Kershaw; the latter converting, Wee Nestie to Karinyah private hospital in 1959.Camberwell Conservation Study 1991 p 40 * House, 27 Balwyn Road Camberwell * Hedges house at 20 Knutsford Street, Balwyn c.1895 * House, 98 Riversdale Road HAWTHORN (1889) Architecturally significant at the State level as one of Ussher and Kemps' best and most sophisticated designs, integrating unusual brick detailing and an atypical symmetrical arrangement. The architects Ussher and Kemp designed the imposing Edwardian villa at 98 Riversdale Road in 1899 for George and Mary Ann Thyssen. * House and Surgery, 169 Canterbury Road, Canterbury 169 Canterbury Road is one of the more prominent designs by the renowned residential partnership of Ussher and Kemp at a time when the practice was at its peak. It compares directly – and favourably – with other leading designs of theirs, particularly among their two-storey houses, and is a direct predecessor to Kemp's renowned Dalswraith in Kew. * Kurue 114 Bellair St Kensington, VIC, Australia external image 114%2520Bellair%2520St%2520Kensington%252C%2520VIC.jpg Architecturally, a near original prominent and early example of a common suburban style, designed by the Queen Anne Villa specialists Ussher and Kemp: of metropolitan importance.

Historically, for a long period one of the few sources of medical attention in the local community: of local importance. * Marlborough House 8–10 Back Beach Rd Portsea, VIC, Australia An essentially intact well-designed and detailed example of the Federation style, Marlborough House was constructed in local materials. It exhibits the regional motif of tuck-pointed red brick quoins to a limestone building. Important architectural features such as the timber verandah with original posts, balustrade fretwork, brackets and floor, twin gable ends with infill strapwork, limestone brackets and intact joinery remain. It is of interest that the symmetry of the composition relied on the construction of the ballroom wing. This implies an optimism regarding the success of the project when it first started. * Residence 1093 Burke Rd Hawthorn East, VIC, Australia Amongst the best examples of Queen Anne style villas in Hawthorn, substantially intact and illustrating particularly well, the strong garden orientation of the style. Illustrative of the high quality for houses constructed on Hawthorn's major boulevards. * Residence 178 Barkers Rd Hawthorn, VIC, Australia A typical example of the smaller scale bungalow adaptation of the Queen Anne style which became synonymous with the garden suburb ideal in the Edwardian period. A smaller work by Ussher and Kemp but illustrating the transfer of stone arcading to timber verandah form, which was influential in the popular market. * Seward House 2 Studley Avenue KEW 3101 \\"Grand in stature and glorious in detail, standing amidst elevated grounds (21,500 sqft) in prestigious Studley Park, 'Seward House' c1899 is one of celebrated architects' Ussher & Kemp's first commissions that set a magnificent precedent for a distinguished partnership. A rare offering on an expansive 1,998sqm allotment. * Travancore, 608 Riversdale Rd Camberwell (1899) This magnificent Federation Queen Anne residence is Ussher & Kemp at their glorious best masterfully merging with stunning contemporary enhancement. Other works The Professional Chambers building in Collins Street was designed for the Trustees of the Independent Church by Beverley Ussher of the firm Ussher and Kemp. The building was finished in 1908, the year Ussher died. The three-storey red brick structure with attic is styled in a mode eclectically derived from Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Elizabethan Revival and Queen Anne Revival architecture. The construction is of tuck-pointed face red brick decorated with rendered cement dressings and a terra cotta tile roof. The Picturesque roof line with steep gable ends and tall clustered chimneys, the oriel windows and central round arch Romanesque entry with foliated decoration together produces a bold facade to Collins Street. The design reflects Ussher's preoccupation with the Picturesque domestic revival in Victoria and has links with the so-called Queen Anne Revival style in England.

It was built in 1305 by Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster. Northburgh Castle was sited to control Lough Foyle, and was captured by Edward Bruce in 1316. Walter Liath de Burgh was imprisoned in 1328 at the castle by his cousin William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and died of starvation in February 1332. William's sister was found dead beneath the battlements. After William's death, the castle became a stronghold of the O'Doherty family. Northburgh Castle suffered considerable damage by cannon fire and eventually was left in ruins after the 17th century. Archaeologist D.M.

History Locomotive 60 originally operated on the Great Western Railroad (GW) in Colorado where it pulled sugar beet and molasses trains. During World War II, a smokebox extension was added to allow the use of poor quality coal because of war-time restrictions. In 1965, #60 was purchased by the newly formed short line Black River & Western for tourist excursions. Although it was used on off line excursions previously, the locomotive hauled its first train with BR&W; on May 17, 1965. BRRHT completed an intense 12-year overhaul project in August 2012 in time for the engine's 75th anniversary. In 2013, locomotive 60 was painted into a late 1950s Great Western livery for a photo charter. The new paint scheme included the addition of white trim on the driving wheels and running board, and aluminum paint on the smokebox. Magnetic \\"Great Western\\" lettering was added to the tender and white diamonds with the number 60 were added to the sides of the cab. To commemorate Black River and Western's 50th Anniversary in 2015, the number plate was painted black and gold representing the \\"Golden Anniversary\\". During the 50th anniversary festivities, a bottle of champagne was opened on one of the driving wheels of locomotive 60 by the New Jersey Assistant Secretary of State, Carol Cronheim. In September 2017, the railroad celebrated the locomotive's 80th anniversary with a special event passenger excursion. For the 2018 season, the locomotive was painted with a graphite smokebox.

He graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in psychology. His literary début was in 1996 with the novel A Man Who Barely Exists. Jung is also an accomplished translator who has translated more than forty books from English into Korean.University of Iowa International Writers Program,http://iwp.uiowa.edu/writers/jung-young- moon In 1999 he won the 12th Dongseo Literary Award with his collection of short stories, A Chain of Dark Tales.A Man Who Barely Exists. Back Cover In 2003, the Korean National Theater produced his play The Donkeys. In 2005 Jung was invited to participate in the University of Iowa’s International Writing Program, and in 2010 the University of California at Berkeley’s Center for Korea Study invited him to participate in a three-month-long residency program.A Man Who Barely Exists p. ix Work Jung’s debut, the novel A Man who Barely Exists was published in Jakga Segye (Writer’s World) in 1996, and as a novel two years later. The novel portrays a man mired in ennui, in which state he contemplates the meaning of life. Following this he released collections and novels including Black Chain Stories (1998), Pale Soliloquy (2000), Yawn (2006) and, most recently, A Contrived World (2012). Black Chain Stories (A Chain of Dark Tales, in English publication) is a collection of Kafkaesque short stories (some extremely short), which delve into the question of what being means, and what the loss of being means. The Korea Literature Translation Institute summarizes Jung's work: :Jung’s stories shared the common denominator of either addressing the grotesque or speaking to the problem of cruel devilishness. Also, in his novels, many of the characters are unable to endure the ennui of life. Their weary hearts are expressed in dark and disturbing ways. One critic even stated that the characters in Jung’s stories are like zombies. Nevertheless, he does not fail to include humor. But the laughter that escapes as one reads his stories is rooted in a despondent scorn towards the world, as well as a sense of emptiness that is felt after realizing the absurdity of society. In his novels, the ludicrousness of forlorn and pitiful beings pops up here and there, just as they do in the “theater of the absurd.” This is because, rather than conveying the dignity of human existence, people are made the objects of derision.Source- attribution\\"Jung Young Moon\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# :In contrast to his earlier works, which focused on demons and death, his recent works frequently feature animals or recurring images of forests. Hs most recent publication, Afternoon With a Faun, contains three linked stories, titled “Animals’ Songs of Boredom or Anger.” In the stories, owls, cats, rabbits, fish, and other animals appear, along with the forest in which they live. In “Something With a Chicken,” even a contemptuous myna bird makes an appearance. The denial of human values spurs an interest in “beings that are not human.” His works, which disrupt the distinctions between reality and fantasy, human and inhuman, meaning and non-meaning, can be understood as scorn towards an absurd social reality. In that sense, his works are frequently compared to Kafka’s. In his role as translator, Jung has translated a wide range of work including John Fowles’ Ebony Tower, Raymond Carver’s What We Talk about When We Talk about Love, and Germaine Greer’s The Boy.Korea Times https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2012/10/262_97721.html Awards *1999 Dongseo Literary Award *2012 Han Moo-sook Literary Award *2012 Dong-in Literary Award제43회 동인문학상… 정영문 '어떤 작위의 세계,http://books.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/10/17/2012101700848.html) *2012 Daesan Literary Award Works in English *A Chain of Dark Tales (Stallion Press, 2011) Korean Literature in Translation, LTI Korea, http://eng.klti.or.kr/ke_04_02_011.do?method=book_detail&DB;_NUM=559&user;_system=keuser *A Most Ambiguous Sunday and Other Stories (Dalkey Archive Press, 2013)Dalkey Archive Press, http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/product/a-most-ambiguous-sunday- and-other-stories/ *Mrs. Brown (Asia Publishers, 2013) *Vaseline Buddha (Deep Vellum Publishing, 2016) Deep Vellum Publishing, http://deepvellum.org/product/vaseline-buddha/ *Seven Samurai Swept Away in a River (Deep Vellum Publishing, 2019) Deep Vellum Publishing, https://deepvellum.org/product/seven-samurai-swept-away-in-a-river/ Works in Korean (Partial) *A Man who Barely Exists (1996) *Black Chain Stories (1998) *Pale Soliloquy (2000) *Yawn (2006) *A Contrived World (2012)  References  Category:1965 births Category:South Korean writers Category:South Korean novelists Category:Living people Category:Seoul National University alumni Category:People from South Gyeongsang Province Category:International Writing Program alumni ","title":"Jung Young-moon"},{"id":"38332892","text":"Nugget Creek is fed by the Nugget Glacier, a tributary glacier on the mountainside east of Auke Bay in the borough of Juneau, Alaska, US.

The Lemon name is said to come from traveling miner John Lemon, who reportedly had a placer mine on the creek in 1879. Course Its course takes it past Lemon Creek Correctional Center and passes under a bridge built along Juneau's arterial Glacier Highway before emptying on the tidal flat at the head of Gastineau Channel, northwest of the borough of Juneau. Description Its drainage area is about , and its valley penetrates the Coast Range for a distance of about . From the south, there are several good-sized tributaries, and the uppermost of these side valleys contains a large glacier, which merges with the ice from the head of the main valley and extends to a point only from the mouth of the creek. The valley is a deep one, the surrounding Blackerby and Heintzleman Ridges rising to , with peaks above in the headwater region. The stream bed lies north of the central line of the valley, and on this side the tributaries are closely spaced and their channels only slightly incised in the mountain flank. The grade of the main stream is somewhat irregularly distributed. The mouth of the valley is filled by a delta deposit raised only a few feet above high tide and extending upstream for something over a mile. Above this there is a short rock-cut canyon with a low waterfall or cascade at its head. Next comes a narrow stretch of gravelly bottom land expending upstream for nearly a mile and a half, with a grade of perhaps 200 feet per mile.

During the 1990s, questions arose about the use of corporal punishment at the youth home, leading to an investigation by Allegheny County, Pennsylvania officials. After 2014, the home was no longer used for long-term residence. Currently it hosts weekend and day camp programs.

The Sanpits (Sahoeech) are generally considered to be part of the Timpanogos or Utah Indians He was the brother of famed Chief Walkara and the father of Black Hawk, for whom the Black Hawk War in Utah (1865–72) is named. In 1850, after measles from newly arrived Mormon settlers decimated their tribes, Walkara and Chief Sanpitch asked the Mormons to come to the Sanpete Valley to teach the band to farm, though this was met with little enthusiasm. In March 1866, as a ploy suggested by Brigham Young to bring Black Hawk to the bargaining table, the elderly Chief Sanpitch was taken into custody and incarcerated in the jail in Manti. A month later, while he and other jailed Indians were escaping, Sanpitch was shot and wounded. On April 18, 1866, he was found and killed in Birch Creek Canyon (in San Pitch Mountains, between Fountain Green and Moroni). The two Mormon men responsible for the chief's death buried his body under a rock slide by shooting at the canyon wall overhead. Sanpitch's interactions with early Mormon settlers are chronicled in Gottfredson's History of Indian depredations in Utah. Sanpitch is almost certainly not the same person as the Shoshone chief of the same name who was alive in 1870. The Shoshone and Utes were enemies. Some sources indicate that he, or his grandfather of the same name, is the namesake of Sanpete County, the Sanpete Valley, the San Pitch Mountains, and the Sanpitch River. However, all of them share the origin of their names: the Sanpits people. According to William Bright, their name comes from the Ute word saimpitsi, meaning \\"people of the tules\\".

Released for Windows personal computers in March 2013, it was ported to the PlayStation 4 in November 2013, the Xbox One in September 2014, and the Nintendo Switch in November 2018. The game is planned to be ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2020. In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of suspended animation far into Earth's future to find themselves at war in the planetary system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a variety of weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level design. The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear. The game includes both player versus environment and player versus player elements. It is supported by microtransactions, which lets players purchase in-game items using real money, but also offers the option to earn them at no cost through grinding. The concept for Warframe originated in 2000, when Digital Extremes began work on a new game titled Dark Sector. At the time, the company had been successful in supporting other developers and publishers, and wanted to develop their own game in-house. The game suffered several delays and was eventually released in 2008, having used some of the initial framework but far different from the original plan. By 2012, in the wake of the success of free-to-play games, the developers took their earlier Dark Sector ideas and art assets and incorporated them into a new project, their self-published Warframe. Initially, the growth of Warframe was slow, hindered by moderate critical reviews and low player counts. Since its release, the game has experienced positive growth. The game is one of Digital Extremes' most successful titles, seeing nearly 50 million players in 2019. Setting Set in the future, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from a century-long cryosleep as they return from a stellar system known as the Tau system after being driven back centuries ago in an ancient war. In the Solar system, they find themselves at war with the Grineer, a matriarchal race of militarized and deteriorated human clones built upon metal, blood, and war; the Corpus, a mega-corporation with advanced robotics and laser technology built upon profit; the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus; and the Sentients, a race of self-replicating machines made by a long-dead transhuman race known as the Orokin. The Lotus guides the Tenno through difficult situations, as well as gives hints which help the player defeat enemies. To fight back, the Tenno use bio-mechanical suits, the eponymous Warframes, to channel their unique abilities. All of the factions encountered in the game, including the Tenno, were created by or are splinter groups of the old Orokin Empire, which the Tenno learns was an ancient fallen civilization and former reigning power in the Solar system. Although most of them are long dead by the time of the Tenno's awakening, their lingering presence can be still be felt throughout the Solar system. Before their fall, the Orokin had attempted to conquest the galaxy and sent out colony ships through the Void, a trans-dimensional space that enabled fast travel between stellar systems. None of these residental ships returned, and those they had loaded with Sentients returns with the Sentients now programmed to wipe out the Orokin, leading to the fall of the Empire. In the game's \\"The Second Dream\\" quest which was introduced in December 2015, the player discovers that the Lotus is a Sentient, rebelling against the others to protect the Tenno knowing of their importance. The Lotus' father, Hunhow, sends a vengeful assassin called the Stalker to Lua (the remains of Earth's moon), which the Lotus had hidden from normal space, to find its secret. The Lotus dispatches the Tenno there to stop the Stalker, arriving too late as the Stalker unveils the entity that the Lotus had protected: a human child known as the Operator, who is the real Tenno controlling the warframes through the course of the game. The Operator is one of several Orokin children that survived the passage of the Zariman Ten-Zero residential ship through the Void, the adults having all gone mad from its travel. When the ship returned to the Orokin Empire, the children had all been put to sleep for thousands of years, outlasting the fall of the Empire, to be found by the Lotus and becoming the Tenno (Tenno short for the \\"Ten-zero\\" of the ship's name). The power of the Void gave these children the power of Transference to be able to control the Warframes from afar, making them the powerful weapons in battling the ongoing forces in the Solar system. From this point forward, the player can then engage in quests both as the Warframe and the Operator. Gameplay Warframe is an online action game that includes elements of shooters, RPG, and stealth games. The player creates their Tenno character, which includes a basic armor unit called a \\"Warframe\\" which provides the player with special abilities, basic weapons such as a primary, secondary, a melee weapon and a ship. Through the ship's console, the player can select any of the available missions to them. A main storyline set of missions requires players to complete certain missions across planets and moons in the solar system, to be able to access junctions that they can progress to other planets or locations. Other missions rotate over time as part of the game's living universe; these can include missions with special rewards and community challenges to allow all players to reap benefits if they are successfully met. Aboard the ship, the player can also manage all other functions for their Tenno, including managing their arsenal of equipment, customizing their Warframe and weapons, crafting new equipment, and access the in-game store. Missions can be played alone or with up to four players in a player versus environment cooperative manner. Each mission is given a ranking that indicates how difficult the mission is. Missions are generally played on randomly generated maps composed of \\"tiles\\" of map sections. Missions have various objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies (Exterminate), collecting data from terminals without activating alarms (Spy/stealth), rescuing prisoners (Rescue), or defending points on the map for set periods of time (defend). Newer updates have added space-bound combat using Archwings, space equipment which come with a new set of abilities and weapons, and a large open-field environment where numerous bounties can be completed. Players can use their weapons, special abilities, and a number of parkour style moves to navigate through and overpower forces within these missions. Downed players may choose to revive themselves up to a maximum of four times, or can be revived by other players an infinite number of times. Once complete, players are rewarded with in-game items, as well as in-game currency and items picked up while exploring the map; failure to complete a mission causes these rewards to be lost. In addition to cooperative missions, the game includes player versus player (PvP) content through the multiplayer \\"Conclave\\", which also rewards the player for placing high in such matches. Players and their equipment also gain experience and level up from missions; equipment with higher levels can do more damage and support more \\"mods\\", special cards that can be slotted into the equipment to change its attributes or provide passive bonuses and abilities. Mods are dropped by enemies during missions and may be part of the rewards, and are generally given out following a rarity distribution, with more powerful mods being more elusive to acquire. Alongside mods, players have other means of improving their equipment, including conditional upgrades called Arcane Enhancements and Riven Mods, weapon-exclusive mods whose weapon, buffs and stats are determined upon unlocking. Another type of reward is equipment blueprints, which can be used to construct new Warframe parts or weapons; blueprints and their resulting equipment may also be purchased directly using in-game money called Platinum. Players need to have specific quantities of construction materials (found from missions and their rewards) to build these items. Warframe is designed to be free-to-play, and has avoided using any pay to win elements; all Warframes, weapons, and other equipment is possible to acquire in-game over time through grinding, though monetization can simplify the process. New weapons, Warframes, equipment, blueprints to construct such equipment and cosmetics like skins and capes (called Syandanas) can be purchased in the market, using either Credits, which are earned in-game, or Platinum, a premium currency that can be traded for with other players for rare items in-game or be purchased via microtransactions. Platinum is also required to purchase additional enhancements, such as arsenal slots for Warframes and weapons, as well as items that enhance the mod capacity of gear. Though, there are some cosmetic items that can only be obtained through in-game payments. Late in 2019, an update named Empyrean was introduced to the game letting players pilot and manage a space ship called a Railjack. This was designed as a co-op experience with up to four people working together, doing different jobs to keep the ship operational while destroying enemy ships. In early 2020 a new Intrinsic is going to be released called Command which will make solo play more accessible. Development =Dark Sector= The origins of Warframe came out of Canadian studio Digital Extremes' original vision for their previous game Dark Sector. Prior to that point, Digital Extremes was known as a work-for-hire studio, working alongside other studios to help complete development; this included working with Epic Games for Unreal Tournament (1999) and its sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal Tournament 2004. Epic had looked to bring Digital Extremes into their studio, but found there would be issues with the Canadian government that interfered with the merger, and the studios agreed to go their separate ways. Wanting to establish themselves as a lead studio, Digital Extremes came up with the idea of Dark Sector, which they first announced in February 2000, describing the game as combining \\"the intense action elements of Unreal Tournament with the scope and character evolution of a persistent online universe\\". In early interviews, Digital Extremes said that the gameplay for Dark Sector would have had players as bounty hunters and assassins in a dark science fiction setting, with each character having a bounty on their head, making them targets for other players. The studio used their vision of Dark Sector to try to secure a publisher, but this only led to more offers for work-for-hire. The company remained quiet on Dark Sector for about four years, re-announcing in early 2004 a revised Dark Sector, now to be a stylish, science-fiction single player experience with stealth elements inspired by the Metal Gear Solid series, and a story they considered a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Dark Crystal set in space, within a larger setting like that of Frank Herbert's Dune universe. Much of the game's art style was informed by the French artist Jean Giraud, aka Moebius. The player-character, belonging to a race called the Tenno, and enemies would wear high-tech suits that would give them unique abilities. This re-announcement included a scripted demo to show their vision of the game's gameplay and graphics. The game was announced just as both the first consoles of the seventh generation, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, had been teased, and Digital Extremes started to look for a publisher to release the games on these platforms. The game received a good deal of attention from its video, including coverage by CNN on the upcoming console generation. Digital Extremes' creative director Steve Sinclair spent about a year on the road following the re-announcement of Dark Sector to find a publisher, but most rejected the idea; Sinclair said most publishers were not impressed with the science fiction setting, and instead encouraged them to change the setting to modern-day, within World War II (which was popular at the time due to the Call of Duty series), and even the American Civil War. When Sinclair returned to the studio, they tried to rework the setting, even trying a superhero genre, without luck. Matters were complicated as they were also attempting to develop their own engine, the Evolution engine, to support the game and the new consoles, switching away from the familiar Unreal Engine. Ultimately, Digital Extremes dropped most of the science fiction elements, and moved the gameplay towards a more Resident Evil survivor-horror approach. Digital Extremes did keep one element of the original concept for the released game, that being the protagonist named \\"Tenno\\". The Dark Sector released in 2008 was far different from their original vision. Dark Sector received average reviews, and was not a major financial windfall for the studio, leading them back to doing work for hire over the next four years, including BioShock, BioShock 2, Homefront, and The Darkness 2. Around 2011, Digital Extremes were finding themselves struggling for work-for-hire contracts. While the studio had been forced to issue some layoffs, they were still at about 250 people at this time. Looking again to develop their own IP and to try to take advantage of the growth in free-to-play games, Digital Extremes looked back to the original Dark Sector concept from 2004 and looked to develop it as a free- to-play game. This decision was made in early 2012 and required the team to create a prototype within one to two months, as Sinclair and Digital Extremes' CEO James Schmalz were going to shop the game around to publishers at that year's Game Developers Conference in March 2012. They took several assets from the abandoned 2004 concept, and developed this as Warframe. At GDC, Sinclair and Schmalz found publishers still cold on the idea: Western publishers were not keen on the science fiction setting, while a large unnamed Korean publisher warned him that they would \\"fail\\" as Western developers did not know how to properly support free-to-play games with quality content. Another concern raised by these publishers was that Warframe was based on player- versus-environmental gameplay, which differed significantly with other free- to-play titles at the time that were mostly player-versus-player. Disheartened, they returned to the studio and decided that they would publish Warframe on their own. They built out a playable version of the game, at the time known as Lotus in about nine months. Alongside this, the studio developed the necessary server architecture to support the game and the microtransaction system they had envisioned for it. =Release as Warframe= Warframe was publicly announced in June 2012 with its closed beta launched in October 2012. Player feedback helped to refine the game's structure. An early change in the beta in early 2013 was their monetization scheme to avoid pay to win scenarios. For example, initially, each Warframe had a skill tree that the player could unlock completely through missions and gaining experience. An extended version of the tree was available if the player augmented the Warframe with an in-game item, then only purchasable through microtransactions. When players complained about this feature, they stripped the pay to win elements and adopted the mantra of keeping the game as free to play, requiring that players did not have to spend any money to get an item within the game. To support the game, they borrowed the idea of offering for sale \\"Founder's Packs\\" that would grant in-game items and currency, an idea that had been successfully used on Kickstarter projects. Digital Extremes found it difficult to get attention from the press as around 2012-2013, free to play games were typically shunned by game journalists. Unfavorable comparisons had been made to Destiny, a highly anticipated title due out in 2014, that also tarnished Warframes presence. Coupled with low player counts, Digital Extremes were not sure how long they could continue supporting the game. However, Digital Extremes found they had a small but dedicated group of players that latched onto the title, buying into the game through Founder's Packs, telling their friends about the game, and interacting with the developers to provide feedback which was integrated into the game's design. Further, they discovered that when popular streamers like TotalBiscuit covered the beta, they drew more players to the game. The open beta for Warframe launched in March 2013 for the Windows platform, with the game available from their own server systems. Warframe was released at the same time that the studio was also completing development for the April 2013 Star Trek game to tie into the release of the film Star Trek Into Darkness. The Star Trek game was critically panned, leading to financial hardships at the studio and forcing them to layoff developers. Warframe itself was not a critical hit with gaming publications, receiving average reviews; as IGN reviewed in 2013, the game was \\"fun, but a little bland\\". Digital Extr'emes was planning to release Warframe for the PlayStation 4 as well, but that console was not available until November 2013, so to try to get more players, they decided to offer the game on Steam, which further grew the player base. Some days after the Steam launch, Digital Extremes had been able to start drawing in enough funding to maintain the viability of the studio. Once the game turned profitable, Digital Extremes found themselves in the position of needing to generate content for the game to maintain its audience. Because they retained their 250-person staff throughout this process, they were able to expand upon content quickly, and soon hired in another 250 developers for Warframe. Community input was critical for Digital Extremes for new content and improvements. One major change after release was an update to the game's movement system, titled \\"Parkour 2.0\\", that was released in 2015. They had found before this, players discover ways to rapidly traverse levels by a trick known as \\"coptering\\" using specific weapons, Warframes, and upgrades. Though Digital Extremes had considered these movements to be game-breaking and considered removing the abilities altogether, they realized players liked to have exotic moves like this available to them, and thus created the Parkour 2.0 system that, while reining in how extensive these moves could be, fully supported the type of ninja-like movements that players wanted. Another example was a short-lived feature that allowed players to spend a small amount of the premium in-game currency Platinum to get a random color that they could use for customization. Players reacted negatively to this, as some found it would take a large amount of Platinum to get the color they wanted. Digital Extremes removed this random factor and instead added means to purchase such customization options directly. The company has also avoided the use of loot boxes that other free- to-play games are often criticized for. The studio had found it important to release new content regularly to keep a stream of income from the game. They were also faced with the problem that to understand all of Warframes systems required some commitment by the player, and players that felt it was too much would wash out after a few hours. This led to them investing more into the player community to keep them up to speed while helping players understand what the game's systems offered. This included starting a weekly video games development \\"Devstream\\" on YouTube hosted by community manager Rebecca Ford (who also voices the in-game character Lotus), starting a fan convention called TennoCon, and working with Twitch as a partner to promote certain streamers and offer Warframe rewards within the game. In 2016, Digital Extremes was acquired by the Chinese investment company Leyou. Leyou since provides necessary funding for Digital Extremes to grow, but has little influence on the direction that the developers take Warframe. Digital Extremes announced that they will bring Warframe to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S upon their release in 2020. Release Digital Extremes started the Warframe closed beta for Microsoft Windows on October 24, 2012. Since then it has had several versions and hotfix releases, and open beta was launched on March 25, 2013. A PlayStation 4 version was also developed, and was released at the console's launch in November 2013, while the Xbox One version of the game launched on September 2, 2014. The PS4 version was ported to Japan on February 22, 2014, followed by the Xbox One version on September 2, 2014. A Nintendo Switch version was announced in July 2018 and was ported by Panic Button, and was released on November 20, 2018. The various versions of Warframe do not support cross-platform play, as Digital Extremes said they currently lacked the capability to keep all platforms updated simultaneously. However, with each console release, Digital Extremes provides a temporary window to allow players on Windows to copy and transfer their accounts to the console version; these become separate accounts that progress separately on Windows and on the console. =Expansions= Since release, Digital Extremes has supported Warframe with patches and expanded the game through major updates. These updates have included major gameplay overhauls, such as its \\"Melee 2.0\\" combat system to give players a wider array of combat moves, additional planets and missions, story elements, limited-time and seasonal events, and new gameplay modes, alongside regular addition of new Warframes, weapons, and other equipment to procure. \\"The Second Dream\\" expansion In December 2015, Digital Extremes released Warframes first cinematic story quest, \\"The Second Dream\\". This quest features prominent characters from the game and introduces a new faction, the dreaded Sentients. Also, and most importantly, The Second Dream serves as an \\"Awakening\\" to the Tenno's true nature, as more than a mere Warframe, \\"more than human, but once a child, like any other\\". Completion of this quest grants access to a new game mechanic named Focus and allows the player to enter the battlefield as themselves, temporarily, through Transference. During Transference, the Warframe is temporarily deactivated (Provided the player isn't using Excalibur Umbra), and a spectral form of the Tenno themselves enters the battlefield, channeling one of five Focus Abilities, depending on which of the five Focus Schools the player chose during the quest's events. \\"The War Within\\" expansion In November 2016, Warframes second cinematic quest was released, titled \\"The War Within\\". This quest sends the player on the chase for Teshin, the master and overseer of the Conclave, as he is seen suspiciously searching the pods of the newly awakened Tenno. Tracking Teshin across the solar system leads to the discovery of the Kuva Fortress, a massive asteroid under Grineer control where the (so far only known as a legend) Twin Grineer Queens reside. The Queens are shown to have their origins as far back as the Old Empire, and Teshin is revealed to be a Dax Soldier, meaning he was under their command due to them being of Orokin origin thus gaining the ability to wield the Kuva Scepter. The Queens cause an overload on the connection between Tenno and Warframe, forcing the Tenno to seek them out themselves, slowly discovering their Void powers. On the mission's climax, the Tenno unlocks Transference (which replaces Transcendence), an ability which allows them to roam independently of their Warframe at will, weakens the Elder Grineer Queen and has the option to kill her or \\"Let her rot\\", since all Grineer bodies decay over time due to excessive cloning. This quest also introduces an Alignment system to the game, with possible options being Sun, Neutral and Moon. This alignment has so far not had any consequence in gameplay, leaving its purpose unknown. \\"Plains of Eidolon\\" expansion An update to the game in November 2017, titled \\"Plains of Eidolon\\", added an open-world area to the game. The Plains are a semi-open world, initially accessible through a \\"hub\\" named Cetus, a settlement on Earth where a people named the Ostrons reside, then directly through the player's ship. As the game describes them, the Ostrons are \\"A tight-knit band of hucksters and merchants.\\" This expansion added Warframes first open-world experience to the game, the ability for the player to gain reputation with the Ostrons, side-activities of fishing and mining, a Bounty system, consisting of five missions of ascending difficulty, where the player can choose to play any mission they would like regardless of whether the previous ones have been completed, a new quest named Saya's Vigil which rewarded the blueprint for the Warframe Gara, more customization options for the Tenno's combat pets, Kubrows (dogs) and Kavats (cats/ocelots), and the ability for the Tenno themselves to wield their own modular weapon, called an Amplifier (or Amp, for short) as well as another modular blade called a \\"Zaw\\". Finally, the \\"Plains of Eidolon\\" offer a new series of boss fights to the game: the titular Eidolons. These Sentient-origin titans require extreme gear and in most cases teamwork to take down for unique rewards. \\"The Sacrifice\\" expansion An update to the game in June 2018, titled \\"The Sacrifice\\", added the third cinematic story to the game. Following on the events of Warframes previous cinematic story quests, The Second Dream and The War Within, The Sacrifice sends the Tenno on a hunt across the solar system for a rogue Warframe known as Umbra. This quest provides insight on Umbra's past, the ability to gain Umbra into arsenal after the quest's climactic point, and information on the origins of the Warframes themselves, answering multiple questions, but creating even more. The Sacrifice also features the Alignment system introduced in \\"The War Within\\".  \\"Fortuna\\" expansion  The expansion \\"Fortuna\\", was released on PC on November 8, 2018. The update focuses on the titular Fortuna Solaris Debt Internment Colony, which serves as a hub for the game's second open-world map, Orb Vallis. The people of Fortuna (known as the Solaris) were enslaved by a Corpus known as Nef Anyo which uses ancient Orokin devices that made gallons of coolant for the Workstation and trade center on Venus. The area expands upon concepts introduced in Plains of Eidolon, along with new activities, and the ability to obtain a hoverboard- styled vehicle known as a K-Drive. This update also adds more modular items such as a plasma pistol called a \\"Kitgun\\", and a robotic companion called a \\"MOA\\".  \\"Empyrean\\" expansion  The \\"Empyrean\\" update was revealed during TennoCon 2018 in July of that year and released on December 12, 2019. The update allowed players to construct a Railjack, an upgradeable spacecraft inspired by FTL: Faster Than Light. Players will be able to gain non-playable characters to populate the ship, customize the ship, and add upgrades. The Railjack can then be used in larger space-based missions, including space battles with enemy forces. Additionally, the game will gain a system similar to the Nemesis system in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and feature boss characters that the player will fight multiple times, with the boss changing its armaments and tactics based on the past fights with the player. Empyrean update will be released in 3 phases, with the first phase released on the PC on December 12, 2019.  \\"Heart of Deimos\\" expansion  Warframes third open-world update was announced via the game's official YouTube channel on July 20, 2020 and was released on August 25, 2020 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, and on August 27, 2020 for Nintendo Switch. It is the game's first expansion to receive a simultaneous release across multiple platforms. The update adds Deimos, one of the two moons of Mars, as a new playable location within the game's solar system. Deimos includes the Cambion Drift, an Infested open-world area that is smaller on the surface than the other two open-world areas but features procedurally generated underground tunnels. Much like the \\"Fortuna\\" and \\"Plains of Eidolon\\" updates, Deimos also contains a social hub called the Necralisk that houses the Entrati, an Orokin-era family known for creating the first technologies that could harness the power of the Void. Alongside Deimos came the introduction of the Helminth system, which adds the functionality for players to \\"infuse\\" new abilities on Warframes, including abilities from other Warframes. Additionally, the Heart of Deimos introduced Necramechs to the game, which are mech suits built and controlled by the player that feature their own unique abilities. Lastly, this expansion brought some improvements to the game's new player experience, mainly consisting of a reworked tutorial that includes a new cinematic intro film directed by Dan Trachtenberg, which first premiered at TennoCon 2019. The film was produced by Digic Pictures using a combination of motion capture and CGI. = Other content = Lotus, a guide to the player, appears as a spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate that can be enhanced into Natah. Reception Warframe received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameZone's Mike Splechta said of the PlayStation 4 version, \\"If you already enjoy games like Monster Hunter which require you to farm for items in order to craft better ones, Warframe follows that very same formula, except with much more satisfying and faster-paced combat.\\" However, as of 2018 PC Gamer said that \\"Warframe's growth doesn't resemble a well-tended plant—it's more like a mutant science experiment. Game systems are haphazardly stitched onto one other in ways that are sometimes incoherent, but oddly charming all the same.\\" The game is one of the most-played games available on Steam. Digital Extremes attributes the success of the title to the frequent updates they are developing for the game and the game's fanbase. Digital Extremes describes the game as a \\"rogue success\\", as the game is able to secure and sustain a large number of players without gaining significant attention from other people. More than 26 million players had played the game since launch by April 2016, and by March 2018, five years from its open beta, had reached 38 million players. The game had nearly 50 million players by the time of its sixth anniversary. In July 2016, Digital Extremes launched its first Warframe-dedicated convention, \\"TennoCon\\", in London, Ontario, drawing 1000 players, where they announced news of upcoming features and updates to the game. Digital Extremes have been running the event annually ever since. The game was nominated for \\"Best Ongoing Game\\" at The Game Awards 2017, and won the People's Voice Award for \\"Action\\" at the 2018 Webby Awards. It was also nominated for the \\"Still Playing Award\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for \\"Fan Favorite Shooter Game\\" and \\"Fan Favorite Fall Release\\" with Fortuna at the Gamers' Choice Awards. At the 2019 Webby Awards, the game again won the Peoples Voice Awards for \\"Action Game\\" and \\"Best Sound Design\\". It was nominated for \\"Best Game Expansion\\" with Empyrean and for the \\"Still Playing\\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards. Community manager Rebecca Ford, who has become known as \\"Space Mom\\" for her presence, was named onto Forbes 2020 30 Under 30 category for Games for her efforts to keep the community engaged with Warframe and leading the establishment of TennoCon.

It is commonly part of the widely-performed Surya Namaskar (Salute to the Sun) sequence, though the similar Bhujangasana (cobra pose) may be used there instead. Etymology and origins The name of the pose is from the Sanskrit ऊर्ध्व Urdhva, \\"upwards\\"; मुख Mukha, \\"face\\"; and श्वान Shvana, \\"dog\\". The pose is one of those (along with Downward Dog) introduced by Krishnamacharya in the mid-20th century from Surya Namaskar, not then considered to be yoga, and later taught by his pupils Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar. Description The pose is entered with an inhalation from a prone position (or from a pose such as Chaturanga Dandasana or Ashtanga Namaskara in a Surya Namaskar cycle), taking the feet a little apart. The legs are stretched out straight, the toes out (not tucked under), and the weight of the body is supported on the hands with outstretched arms so the hips are off the ground. The gaze is directed straight upwards, so the neck and back are arched. Claims Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that this pose \\"rejuvenates the spine\\", recommending it for stiff backs, lumbago, sciatica and slipped discs. He claimed that it strengthened the spine and gave \\"elasticity\\" to the lungs, and that it made the blood circulate \\"properly in the pelvic region\\", keeping it healthy.

He was born in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. He owned and operated the Treadwell gold mine through the Treadwell Mining Company. He was responsible for initiating low- grade gold mining in Alaska adopting most advanced operations on a big scale, which boosted the economy of the wilderness areas. His four mines formed the largest complex in the world at that time. Treadwell's mine complex \\"put Juneau on the map\\".Warren (2007), xxiii Personal life Treadwell was born in St. Andrews. He had a brother, James. He married Frederika Josephine Graner in 1889. Treadwell mine, 1800s. Career Treadwell worked as a miner in California and Nevada. In 1881, he worked as a carpenter on a house in California for John Fry, a well known banker. When Fry heard about the rich gold exploring possibility around the Gastineau Channel on Douglas Island, near Alaska's current capital of Juneau, he proposed Treadwell to inspect the area and find out the scope of prospecting there as Treadwell had a mining background. Initially, Treadwell met a French miner, Pierre Joseph Erussard, who gave very encouraging reports of the gold deposits in his claim. As Erussard was short of funds to carry out further work, he decided to return to his country, and Treadwell gave Erussard $400 for the Paris lode claim. On Treadwell's return to California, he, Fry, and another friend established a mining company to work on Alaskan mine claims. The Alaska Mill and Mining Company was established in May 1882. Explorations on an experimental basis included a five-stamp mill. The results proved profitable and the company expanded with a bigger sized 120-stamp mill in 1883 and another in 1887. In the initial years, the Treadwell Complex had four mines (Treadwell, Ready Bullion, the Mexican and the Seven-Hundred-Foot)) and five mills. The gold yield was worth about US$70 million. In 1889, Treadwell sold his mining operations to the Alaska Gold Mining Company for a reported $1.5 million. By 1914, Treadwell Complex mining operations attained a world record with 960 stamps crushing 5,000 tons of rock per day. Treadwell ventured into coal mining which turned out be a failure; he owned and operated the Tesla Coal Mine, now situated in the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area. Consequently, he was associated with banking in New York with his brother James, which resulted in a bankruptcy claim of US$3 million without any supporting collateral. He died in New York on December 6, 1927 where he is buried.

Biography She was born in Østre Gausdal as a daughter of district physician Wilhelm Jacobi Müller (1830–1909) and Hansine Pauline Ross (1830–1907). The family moved three times before she was ten, but she finished middle school at Nissen School in 1882. In March 1886 in Dovre she married her first cousin Andreas Wessel (1858–1940), a newly educated physician. The couple moved to Kirkenes, where Wessel had been hired as district physician of Sør-Varanger. They had seven children, but all died young. She started a documentary effort, especially as a photographer of the scenery and human life. Her documentation of the Sami culture, among others in the 1902 book Fra vor grændse mod Rusland, has been deemed \\"invaluable\\". When travelling around she also became more aware of the widespread poverty in the region, and became a political activist. Having voted Liberal in her early adulthood, she aligned with the Labour Party from 1904. Her political activism, together with her husband who was elected mayor, was widespread. They invited public speakers (\\"agitators\\") and housed Russian refugees after the failed 1905 revolution. She translated revolutionary literature from Russian and German, and in 1906 she was a driving force in founding the local trade union, Nordens Klippe where she became both secretary and treasurer. She contributed to the labour movement's newspapers and periodicals, but was controversial. She is mentioned in most books on the Norwegian Worker's Movement as well as many books on Northern Norwegian history. As a result, she ran her own periodical Klasse mot Klasse in 1914 and 1915. In 1914 she also issued the socialist children's book, Den lille socialist. She was also a published poet, with Vinter og Vaar (1903), Nye smaavers (1904) and Det kalder. Digte (1930), the first two on Aschehoug. She gradually aligned more and more with the syndicalists, contributing to the publications Revolt, Direkte Aktion, Solidaritet and Alarm. After the Russian Revolution she and her husband supported the Soviet Union, but never joined the Communist Party. She died in 1949 at Kirkenes, and was buried in the town, where her grave is visited by a parade on May Day. References Related reading *Enger, Cecilie (2008) Himmelstormeren.

Chemically, it is the glucoside of (R)-mandelonitrile.  Natural occurrences  Prunasin is found in species in the genus Prunus such as Prunus japonica or P. maximowiczii and in bitter almonds. It is also found in leaves and stems of Olinia ventosa, O. radiata, O. emarginata and O. rochetiana and in Acacia greggii. It is a biosynthetic precursor of and intermediate in the biosynthesis of amygdalin, the chemical compound responsible for the taste of bitter almond. It is also found in dandelion coffee, a coffee substitute. = Sambunigrin = Sambunigrin, a diastereomer of prunasin derived from (S)-mandelonitrile instead of it the (R)-isomer, has been isolated from leaves of the elder tree (Sambucus nigra). Sambunigrin is present in the leaves and stems of elder at a 1:3 ratio of sambunigrin to prunasin, and 2:5 in the immature seed. It is not found in the root.  Biosynthesis  = Overview = (R)-prunasin begins with the common amino acid phenylalanine, which in plants is produced via the Shikimate pathway in primary metabolism. The pathway is catalyzed mainly by two cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and a UDP- glucosyltransferase (UGT). After (R)-prunasin is formed, it is either converted into amygdalin by an additional UDP-glucosyltransferase or degraded into benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. Researchers have shown that the accumulation (or lack of) of prunasin and amygdalin in the almond kernel is responsible for sweet and bitter genotypes. Because amygdalin is responsible for the bitter almond taste, almond growers have selected genotypes which minimize the biosynthesis of amydgalin. The CYP enzymes responsible for generation of prunasin are conserved across Prunus species. There is a correlation between high concentration of prunasin in the vegetative regions of the plant and the sweetness of the almond, which is relevant to the almond agricultural industry. In almonds, the amygdalin biosynthetic genes are expressed at different levels in the tegument (mother tissue, or outer section) and cotyledon (kernel, or father tissue), and vary significantly during almond ontogeny. The biosynthesis of prunasin occurs in the tegument, then transported to other tissues for conversion to amygdalin or degraded. = Biosynthesis of (R)-prunasin = Biosynthetic pathway for the production of (R)-prunasin in Prunus species (top) and Eucalyptus cladocalyx (bottom)  Biosynthesis of (R)-prunasin in Prunus dulcis  L-phenylalanine is first hydroxylated by CYP79D16, followed by a decarboxylation and dehydration, forming the E-oxime phenylacetaldoxime. Next, CYP71AN24 catalyzes the rearrangement of the E-oxime to the Z-oxime followed by a dehydration and a hydroxylation to form mandelonitrile. Finally, UGT85A19 or UGT94AF3 utilize UDP-glucose to glycosylate mandelonitrile, forming (R)-prunasin. After generating (R)-prunasin, the product is further glycosylated into amydgalin by either isoform UGT94AF1 or UGT94AF2. Expression of UGTAF1/2 and prunasin hydrolases results in a low overall concentration of (R)-prunasin in almond tissues. It is important to note that an alpha-glucosidase or prunasin hydrolase can convert (R)-prunasin to mandelonitrile, its precursor, which can then be spontaneously or enzymatically hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.  Biosynthesis of (R)-prunasin in Eucalyptus cladocalyx  The biosynthesis of (R)-prunasin in E. cladocalyx, the sugar gum tree, has been shown to synthesize (R)-prunasin using an additional intermediate, phenylacetonitrile, using CYP706C55. The pathway proceeds similarly to the pathway in Prunus species, where the multifunctional CYP79A125 catalyzes the conversion of L-phenylalanine to phenylacetaldoxime. Then, CYP706C55 catalyzyes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime to phenylacetonitrile. Phenylacetonitrile is then hydroxylated by CYP71B103 to mandelonitrile. After generating mandelonitrile, UGT85A59 transfers glucose to yield (R)-prunasin.  Metabolic Pathway Interactions  As (R)-prunasin is a product of secondary metabolism, its generation and degradation affect multiple metabolic pathways by consuming L-phenylalanine or increasing quantities of benzaldehyde and toxic hydrogen cyanide through prunasin degradation. Metabolic profiling in almond, cassava, and sorghum identified a potential recycling mechanism where (R)-prunasin and other cyanogen glycosides may be utilized for nitrogen storage and nitrogen recycling without generating HCN. In 2017, researchers used stable isotope labeling to demonstrate that 13C-labeled L-phenylalanine incorporated in (R)-prunasin could be converted to benzaldehyde and to salicylic acid using mandelonitrile as an intermediate.  Toxicity  The toxicity of prunasin is based in its degradation products: (R)-prunasin is hydrolyzed to form benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, which causes toxicity. Plants containing prunasin may therefore be toxic to animals, particularly ruminants. To degrade amygdalin to prunasin, amygdalin beta-glucosidase hydrolyzes the disaccharide to produce (R)-prunasin and D-glucose. Then, prunasin beta-glucosidase uses (R)-prunasin and water to produce D-glucose and mandelonitrile. After generating the aglycone mandelonitrile, then a mandelonitrile lyase can degrade the compound into benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.

Sergeant McNiece was a member of the Filthy Thirteen, an elite demolition unit whose exploits inspired the 1965 novel and 1967 film The Dirty Dozen. Early life James McNiece was born on May 24, 1919 in Maysville, Oklahoma, the ninth of ten children born to Eli Hugh and Rebecca (née Ring) McNiece, and of partial Choctaw descent. During the Depression, the family moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma in 1931. In 1939, he graduated from Ponca City High School and went to work in road construction, and then at the Pine Bluff Arsenal, where he gained experience in the use of explosives. Military career McNiece enlisted for military service on September 1, 1942. He was assigned to the demolition saboteur section of what was then the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. This section would become the Filthy Thirteen, first led by Lieutenant Charles Mellen, who was killed in action on June 6, 1944 during the Invasion of Normandy. Following Mellen's death, Sergeant McNiece led the unit. McNiece's demolitions experience with the fire department before the war made him the section sergeant and his mission focus kept him in that rank in spite of his deliberate disobedience and disrespect during training. His first sergeant and company commanders knew he was the man the regiment could count on during combat.Richard E. Killblane and Brian Miller, War Paint; The Filthy Thirteen Jump Into Normandy, Victory Press, 2013 His escapades are documented in his words in The Filthy Thirteen, Fighting With the Filthy Thirteen, and War Paint; The Filthy Thirteen Jump Into Normandy. McNiece went on to make a total of four wartime combat jumps, the first as part of the Invasion of Normandy in 1944. In the same year he jumped as part of Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, which was featured in the book (and subsequent film), A Bridge Too Far, and at the Siege of Bastogne, part of the larger Battle of the Bulge. During fighting in the Netherlands, he was promoted to demolition platoon sergeant. He volunteered for pathfinder training, anticipating he would sit out the rest of the war training in England,Jerome Preisler, First to Jump; How the Band of Brothers was Aided by the Brave Paratroopers of the Pathfinder Company, Berkley, 2014 but his pathfinder stick was called upon to jump into Bastogne to guide in resupply drops. His last jump was in 1945, near Prüm in Germany. In recognition of his natural leadership abilities, he ended the war as the acting first sergeant for Headquarters Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. He was discharged from the military in February 1946. After World War II In 1949, McNiece returned to live in Ponca City. He began a 28-year career with the United States Postal Service. His first wife Rosita died in 1952 and, a year later, he married Martha Beam Wonders. They had two sons and a daughter and remained married until his death. Last years In 1997, historian Richard E. Killblane, also from Ponca City, began recording Jake's oral history of his escapades during the war and wrote The Filthy Thirteen, which Casemate Publishers published in 2003. This made Jake an instant celebrity among World War II airborne fans and he toured the United States and Europe educating and entertaining younger generations with his accounts of the war. In 2012, McNiece was awarded the French Legion of Honour Chevalier class. He died on January 21, 2013 at the age of 93.

A Cree from the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation in Saskatchewan, she was the first First Nations woman to enlist in the Canadian Armed Forces. After joining the Canadian Women’s Army Corps (CWAC) in 1942, she became the subject of an internationally famous army publicity photograph, and was sent overseas to serve in London, England, where she was introduced to public figures such as George VI and his daughter Elizabeth. Greyeyes remained in London until being discharged in 1946, after which she returned to Canada. Early life Mary Greyeyes was born November 14, 1920, in the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation reserve in Marcelin, Saskatchewan. She had ten siblings: six sisters and four brothers. She was raised by her widowed grandmother, Sarah Greyeyes. When she was five years old, Greyeyes was sent to the St. Michael's residential school in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan. The school only taught students up to grade 8, but Greyeyes managed to obtain additional tutoring in later years from a nun at the school, attending evening lessons while helping with cooking and cleaning during the day. She was known for her eagerness for knowledge. Canadian forces = Enlistment = Indian Affairs.162x162px The Muskeg Lake Cree Nation reserve had been heavily impacted by the Great Depression, and by the early 1940s there was little work for youth on the reserve. Greyeyes' favourite brother, David Greyeyes, left the reserve in search of work to help support the family, and in 1940, David enlisted in the Canadian Army. Greyeyes subsequently decided to do the same, seeing enlistment as a valuable chance to expand her own knowledge and experience. In June 1942, Greyeyes travelled to Regina in order to take the test for enlistment. The Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service and the women's division of the Royal Canadian Air Force both required that new recruits be \\"a British subject, of white race\\", but recruitment for the Canadian Women's Army Corps (CWAC) was open to citizens of \\"any of the United Nations\\" and all races. Although Greyeyes worried that her grade 8 certification from the residential school would be inadequate, she passed the CWAC test and was accepted. Upon completing the test, Greyeyes became the first First Nations woman to join the Canadian Armed Forces. Mary Greyeyes (left) appeared in a famous army publicity photograph, taken in 1942. =Photograph= Shortly after enlisting, Greyeyes became the subject of an army publicity photograph that showed her kneeling in her army uniform to receive a \\"blessing\\" from a man dressed in Plains Cree Chief regalia. During the war, Canadian MLA and public relations officer Louis LeBourdais often visited the training bases with photographers to take pictures of new CWAC recruits for newspaper publication. In June 1942, not long after she had enlisted, Greyeyes was approached and asked to participate in a photo-shoot to encourage more women to join the army. Harry Ball, a Cree man and World War I veteran from the Piapot First Nation, was convinced to pose for the photo in Plains Chief regalia. He was not an actual Chief himself at the time, though he would become one later, and had never met Greyeyes before. Ball had to cobble together a costume from borrowed items. In return for the photo-shoot, which was staged on Piapot land, Ball was paid $20, while Greyeyes received a free lunch and a new uniform. The photograph appeared in the Winnipeg Tribune and the Regina Leader-Post, and soon spread overseas to England, appearing in multiple British newspapers. For decades, the photo would be identified only by a caption reading \\"Unidentified Indian princess getting blessing from her chief and father to go fight in the war\\". It was only around 1995 that the record was finally corrected, when Greyeyes's daughter-in-law, Melanie Fahlman Reid, learned that the photo hung in the Canadian War Museum with the incorrect caption. Reid, who had discussed the photo personally with Greyeyes, provided a more accurate explanation of the photograph from her mother-in- law's recollection. = Service and overseas work = Mary Greyeyes (second from left) with fellow CWAC members newly arrived in Britain, c. 1943 Although officially integrated as part of the Canadian Army, CWAC did not train its members for combat roles, instead training women to support the war efforts through cooking, laundering, and clerical work. Greyeyes was sent overseas to Aldershot, England, to work at the Aldershot Base Laundry. She disliked her position there, and requested a transfer. Her superior tried to sabotage her transfer by writing the false statement \\"Does not speak English\\" on Greyeyes' papers, but she was granted her transfer anyway and went to work as a cook in the war centre at London. The Canadian Military Headquarters, in London was at 2–4 Cockspur Street next to Canada House. As a result of the \\"Indian princess\\" photo, Greyeyes became famous in London as \\"the Indian\\" who had joined the army in support of the Empire and its colonies, receiving letters from strangers offering to marry her. She was even introduced to King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Elizabeth. Greyeyes was photographed with a number of public figures. Although Greyeyes sometimes encountered racism while in service – once resulting in her boarding outside the barracks – she found her overall army experience a positive one, later commenting that her wartime years had been \\"the best days of her life\\". She enjoyed the publicity she gained from being in the famous photo. Her love of learning was often noticed by others. One of her fellow corps members later recalled that Greyeyes was \\"a lovely young woman ... who spent much of her spare time reading and studying literature.\\" = Second photo-shoot = According to an interview with her daughter-in-law, Mary Greyeyes was approached by government officials for a second publicity photo towards the end of the war. It was an election year, and Indigenous people did not have the right to vote in Canadian elections at the time, but Indigenous veterans from World War II were being offered the choice to give up their treaty rights and Indian status in return for voting rights. Greyeyes was urged to visit a polling station and have her picture taken while voting. Instead of agreeing to the photo-shoot this time, she pointed out the unfairness of the voting laws: > So Mary says to them, she says, \\"Can my mom vote?\\" And they said, \\"No, she > didn't fight in the war.\\" She said, \\"Well, what about my cousins over there, > can they vote?\\" And they said no. They said, \\"C'mon Mary, you gotta come, > we've got the photographer.\\" And she said, \\"All those years, I said nothing. > Now I'm saying no.\\" It was only in 1960 that all First Nations people were granted the right to vote in Canadian federal elections. Post-war life When the war ended, Greyeyes continued working in London until she was discharged in 1946. Afterwards, she returned to Canada and went back to the Muskeg Lake reserve to spend time with family. She met her future husband, Alexander Reid, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. They moved to Victoria and had two children. Greyeyes worked as a restaurant cook in Victoria, later finding employment as an industrial seamstress when the family moved to Vancouver in the 1960s. In August 1994, Greyeyes attended a reunion of over 400 CWAC members in Vermilion, Alberta. She received a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs for her wartime service. In 2003, in recognition that post-war benefits had been poorly managed and delivered to Indigenous servicemen and women, the Canadian government paid compensation packages to Greyeyes and other surviving Indigenous veterans. Death Greyeyes died on March 31, 2011, in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was 90 years old. Greyeyes was buried on the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation reserve.

The current iteration was founded in 2012 and made its debut in 2013. It is a revival of (and a return to the events original name) of the previously running Northwest Asian American Film Festival, which was directed by Wes Kim from 2003 to 2007 and which had experienced a five-year hiatus.Seattle Asian American Film Festival, About, http://seattleaaff.org/about The festival is currently run and directed by co-directors Kevin Bang and Vanessa Au.Angry Asian Man, Seattle Asian American Film Festival, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2013/01/seattle-asian- american-film-festival.html The inaugural film festival was also held at the Wing Luke Asian Museum from January 25 to 27, 2013. History =Origins= The Seattle Asian American Film Festival was founded in 1985 by KingStreet Media, a community-based Asian American media production and advocacy group based in Seattle's International District. Kingstreet Media was an offshoot of the International Examiner newspaper as almost all its members were either photographers, writers or graphic artists for the paper. The festival came about after the group helped complete \\"Beacon Hill Boys\\" - the first ever dramatic film about Asian American youth. The film had caused a sensation locally when it premiered a few months earlier, had been nominated for a student Academy Award, and was beginning to make the festival rounds nationally and internationally. Capitalizing on the film's success and looking to expand their commitment to raising the profile of Asian American cinema the group put together the city's first all Asian American film festival. To emphasize recent breakthroughs in Asian American filmmaking, which up until that time had been almost completely dominated by documentary work, the festival featured programs made up entirely of narrative films (dramas, comedies, etc.). In addition to \\"Beacon Hill Boys,\\" the line-up included Wayne Wang's acclaimed sleeper hit \\"Chan Is Missing,\\" Visual Communications' historical epic \\"Hito Hata: Raise The Banner,\\" Stephen Ning's coming-of-age tale \\"Freckled Rice,\\" Robert Nakamura's multi-ethnic comedy \\"Fool's Dance,\\" and Steven Okazaki's mother/daughter profile \\"The Only Language She Knows\\" among others. The festival was held at Seattle's historic Nippon Kan Theater with the International Examiner acting as media sponsor. The festival's founders and staff included Dean Wong, William Satake Blauvelt, Sumi Hayashi, Dean Hayasaka, Ken Mochizuki, Jeff Hanada, Greg Tuai, and Jesse Reyes. The second edition of the festival was held in 1987 with the International Examiner taking over as producer. The paper hired Nellie Fujii-Anderson as festival director and William Satake Blauvelt returned as Programming Director. Also, several other KingStreet Media members who also worked for the paper helped again. This time the festival was held at the University of Washington's Kane Hall and featured an expanded line-up of narrative, documentary, experimental and animation films, as well as independent films from around Asia. The Examiner had taken on the festival, in part, as a way to raise funds for the newspaper. Although the festival was successful on different levels they soon found out that film festivals in general were not money making propositions and so declined to act as producer for any further editions. The International Examiner did continue its role as a media sponsor of the festival to the present day. The festival then went on hiatus for several years until it was revived in 1994 by Emily Wong, then Assistant Editor of the International Examiner, and William Satake Blauvelt who had been working as a filmmaker/curator/critic. This time the Seattle Asian American Film Festival was set up as an independent organization that put together a large coalition of volunteers, as well as community and media sponsors from within and outside of the Asian American community. Screenings were held at the Seattle Art Museum with side-bar events happening around the city. From 1994 through 1998 SAAFF, as the festival was affectionately dubbed, became nationally known as one of the premiere Asian American film festivals in the country which supported many filmmakers who went on to greater fame including Ang Lee (\\"Broke Back Mountain\\"), Kayo Hata (\\"Picture Bride\\"), Frieda Lee Mock (\\"Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision\\"), Kip Fulbeck (\\"The Hapa Project\\"), and Justin Lin (\\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\"). Aside from the festival itself the SAAFF organization co-sponsored year-round premiere screenings of Asian American films that found mainstream distribution like \\"The Joy Luck Club.\\" The festival also published quarterly newsletters and a comprehensive annual booklet. Prizes - the Gold, Silver and Bronze Carp Awards for the best films as voted on by the audience were introduced. Programming was further expanded by doing retrospective tributes to selected directors and actors; archival screenings; commissioned live scores for silent films; as well as panels and Q&A;'s with visiting filmmakers. SAAFF also expanded their efforts to be more international in scope and featured work from around the Pacific Rim that featured under represented groups like Australian aboriginal and Pacific Islander filmmakers. SAAFF also made a commitment to showing work that up to that time had been ignored by the Asian American community including trangressive, experimental work on taboo subjects and films dealing with the Gay and Lesbian experience. Work was screened in all formats including 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, and video. In addition to Emily Wong (Director) and William Satake Blauvelt (Programing Director) the festival staff included John Pai, Albert Shen, Mari Murao, Shannon Gee, Soyon Im, and Vuong Vu among many others. =1999 instance= Starting in 1999 the history of the Seattle Asian American Film Festival took a strange and convoluted turn. The SAAFF organization, due to staff attrition in several key areas, decided to take a hiatus to regroup. However, during the break and unbeknownst to the festival organization, another group began using Seattle Asian American Film Festival's name and record of accomplishment to apply for grants and raise funds to stage another edition of the festival. Ironically, this turned out to be a new version of KingStreet Media. Local filmmaker Jay Koh, who SAAFF had supported earlier, had taken over the Kingstreet Media group after the last of the original members left. Looking to expand the profile and reach of his version of Kingstreet Media, Koh approached SAAFF about taking over the festival but his offer was declined. Koh and company quietly pressed on anyway while SAAFF was on hiatus and when ready announced their version of the Seattle Asian American Film Festival. B this time the steering committee of the original SAAFF organization, already flirting with burn-out and not wanting to put energy into a legal battle, became disillusioned by the turn of events and individually went on to other pursuits. After a splashy beginning the Koh/new Kingstreet Media version of the Seattle Asian American Film Festival faded away after two editions. The new Kingstreet Media morphed into a for-profit, commercial entity but also faded away after several years. =2003 Revival= The festival was revived once again in 2003 and re-branded as the Northwest Asian American Film Festival and was led by Director Wes Kim for four years, until 2007. Kim is also a filmmaker, writer, director, and producer of the award-winning short films Profiles in Science, Vision Test, and Cookies for Sale, and Kim's films have appeared in over 40 U.S. and international film festivals and have screened in 17 countries, as well as being broadcast nationally on public and cable television and featured in programs at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Wing Luke Asian Museum in Seattle.Seattle Asian American Film Festival, About, http://seattleaaff.org/about =2012–2013 revival= After the festival concluded in 2007 and took a five-year hiatus, the festival was revived under its original name of the \\"Seattle Asian American Film Festival\\" in 2012–2013. Former director Wes Kim still serves as an Advisor on the Festival.Id. 2013 inaugural festival The inaugural 2013 film festival featured Eliachi Kimaro's documentary A Lot Like You as Opening Night film (the film also won Best Documentary at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and was a Top 10 Audience Choice Award at the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF)). The festival also featured a short film program entitled Cinematropolis curated by Seattle-based hip hop group Blue Scholars, and named after their album of the same name. Other films included a film written and produced by Yuji Okumoto and directed by Blaine Ludy entitled Out, and Andrew Ahn's Dol (First Birthday) (Official Selection of the 2012 Sundance Film Festival).Seattle Asian American Film Festival, Program, http://seattleaaff.org/program Other films include the documentary Manilatown Is In the Heart, short films such as Scott Eriksson's How War Ends, Jocelyn Saddi-Lenhardt's Mother and Child (a Visual Communications \\"Armed With a Camera\\" fellowship film), Steve Nguyen and Choz Belen's Hibakusha, Valerie Soe's short film The Chinese Gardens, Akira Boch's The Crumbles (winner of an Audience Award at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival), Iris Shim's multiple-award winning documentary, The House of Suh, Yumiko Gamo Romer's Mrs. Judo: Be Strong, Be Gentle, Be Beautiful, several short documentaries that were also Visual Communications \\"Armed With A Camera\\" fellowship films such as Basketball, Meri Jaan by Veena Hampapur, That Particular Time by Jeff Man, and Magellan Doesn't Live Here by Micki Davis.

Life and career Trevor John Barnard was born in London in 1938. He entered the Royal Academy of Music at a young age, followed by private study with Herbert Fryer, a student of Tobias MatthayGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed (1954), Vol. III, p. 510. and Ferruccio Busoni. He later won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music and then studied intensively with Harold Craxton. Barnard appeared as soloist with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and various BBC orchestras. In 1962, Barnard made the first stereo recording of Sir Arthur Bliss's Piano Concerto in B-flat, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent. He also performed the work in concert under the composer's baton in 1963 and 1966. He had earlier played it under Arthur Dennington in 1958. After moving to the United States, Barnard was pianist-in-residence to the FM station Boston University Radio between 1967 and 1971, and was on the faculty of the New England Conservatory in Boston between 1968 and 1972. He then moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia where he was appointed piano tutor at Monash University. He taught full-time and consecutively at the Melbourne State College and the Melbourne College of Advanced Education from 1974 to 1988, and at the University of Melbourne from 1989 until his retirement in 2003. In Australia he toured and broadcast frequently for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Among the composers who have written works for him are Felix Werder, Richard St. Clair, Geoffrey Allen and Michael Bertram. Barnard was an examiner for the Australian Music Examinations Board (1988-2018), and, as well as many other competitions, served as adjudicator in the ABC Symphony Australia Young Performers Awards on a number of occasions. Barnard married Elizabeth Helen Richmond in Melbourne on 28 August 1974. Professionally known as Helen Richmond, she was a significant pioneer in the development and appreciation of early music in Australia during the 1960s and 1970s. In recognition of her achievement she was appointed a life governor of the UK-based Dolmetsch Foundation. Writings Barnard has written: * A Practical Guide to Solo Piano Music (2006) * Neglected Areas of Piano Teaching (2008) * Several pedagogical papers for the former US refereed keyboard journal Clavier and its successor Clavier Companion. Recordings Barnard's discography is not large but it includes some significant diversions from the standard repertoire and some important premieres. He made the first stereo recording of Sir Arthur Bliss's Piano Concerto in B-flat, in 1962, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent. This is still attracting comment as one of the best recordings of the work. In 1999, Barnard fulfilled a long-held ambition to also record Bliss's Piano Sonata, written in 1952 for the Australian pianist Noel Mewton-Wood, who had impressed Bliss greatly with his playing and recording of the Piano Concerto. There is also the first commercial recording (1999) of Ferruccio Busoni's 24 Preludes in all the major and minor keys, Op. 37. Barnard's other recordings present varied programs by Australian and other composers from Bach to the present. These include Dorian Le Gallienne's Sonata and Margaret Sutherland's 2 Suites, and contain a number of world premiere recordings. Barnard also contributed to an album displaying the artistry of the saxophonist Peter Clinch.

It was first described by Georges Cuvier in 1829. Taxonomy There are two subspecies, Furcifer v. verrucosus and Furcifer v. semicristatus, the latter being found mainly in the southernmost part of the island. This chameleon is closely related to Oustalet's chameleon Furcifer oustaleti (Malagasy giant chameleon), the pair forming a species complex, but each member of the group may be a cryptic species (two species indistinguishable in the field and currently believed to be a single species) and the exact taxonomical relationship between members of the group is unclear. Description The warty chameleon is a large species with males growing to a total length of and females reaching . On its head it has a casque, a helmet-like crest formed from scales. A small crest runs along a raised ridge from its eyes to its snout. There are further low crests running along the flanks, down the throat and along the belly. A distinctive crest of up to forty spines runs along the back in males but this is cut short in females, continuing along the spine as tubercles. Both sexes have a row of large scales forming a lateral line. The long tail is prehensile. The general colour of this chameleon is grey or brown variously blotched or indistinctly banded, with a white intermittent streak along each side. Females are usually paler in colour and males are often tinged with green on the belly, tail and limbs. Distribution and habitat The warty chameleon is found only on the island of Madagascar including Manderano in the Tulear region. It occurs over much of the west part of the island and in drier parts of the south. It is seldom found in primary rainforest but favours arid disturbed land, including near the sea. It is a terrestrial species and also climbs around in low bushes. In hot weather it sometimes retreats into a sandy burrow to keep cool. Biology The warty chameleon feeds largely on insects which it catches with its long sticky tongue. The female lays one clutch of 30 to 60 eggs a year and these are incubated for about 200 days. They hatch into juvenile chameleons which may take six months to a year to become mature.

He became a teacher in the Chicago public schools high school system as a radio instructor. Soon after he got into technical publishing as Supreme Publications. As publisher his goal was to support the radio and television servicing industry with easy to understand reference materials. He was married to Rose Rissman. Early years Morris Beitman received his BS in Mathematics at Illinois Institute of Technology and later served in the military as an engineer with the US Army Signal Corps. He later became an associate member with the Institute of Radio Engineers (now called Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or IEEE). His known pre- and post-military career was a teacher in the Chicago public high schools as radio instructor. The founding of Supreme Publications By the mid-1930s the growth in ownership of radio receivers in the United States spun off other business opportunities. One of them was the repair of radio and radio- phonograph sets and eventually, television. Hugo Gernsback was an early publisher of repair manuals. Soon others were publishing. John F. Rider in the early 1930s began to compile complete volumes of radio servicing diagrams of many radio manufacturers called the Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual. In time these servicing manuals became quite large and contained information on radios that were not common or were produced in small quantities. Although Rider's Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual became a standard reference during the 1930s, the size and bulk of these yearly volumes could become a hindrance. Rider manuals contained information on common and rare models. Service businesses were paying extra for brands they rarely or never encountered. This \\"opened the door\\" for an alternative path and Morris Beitman was able to exploit this business opportunity. In 1940-1941 Morris N. Beitman under the name Supreme Publications (located at 328 S. Jefferson St. in Chicago) produced a series of books called, \\"Most-Often-Needed Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information\\" and later \\"Most-Often-Needed Television Servicing Information\\" for successive years. These books offered radio and television repair businesses a condensed version of Rider's \\"Perpetual Troubleshooter's Manual\\", by only providing models that were common or made in large quantities. The radio series started with 1926-1938 models in one volume. Each year after that represented a new volume until 1969 when the last volume was published. The television series started in 1946 and continued into the early 1970s. Their last known location was 1760 Balsam Road, Highland Park, Illinois. From 1940-1960 Supreme published other volume sets for record players, tape recorders, wire recorders and other specialized consumer electronics using the \\"most often needed\\" title. These references like radios and televisions were in yearly bound sets but were not consistent year-to-year sets. These volumes never reached the quantity, consistency or longevity of the radio or television titles. Other publications Beitman under the Supreme Publication name was author to a number of other publications devoted to radio and television. Dates given are the earliest known date of first publication. # Practical Radio Mathematics (1941) # Radio Servicing Course in Twenty-two Lessons (1941) # Simplified Radio Servicing by Comparison Method (1945) # Advanced Radio Servicing - Methods and Ideas # How to Use Radio Diagrams in Radio Servicing (1947) # Practical Radio for War Training (1943) # Manual of Radio Servicing - Ideas that Clicked # How to Modernize Radios for Profit (1950) # Most Often Needed Service Notes for Record Players, Automatic Chargers, and Wireless Recorders (various years after 1945) # Cyclopedia of Television Facts (1941) # The Inside Story of Stethoscope Servicing # Television Servicing Course (1966) # Refrigeration Text Book for Home Study (1944) # Practical Radio Electronics Course (1946) Later years and the end of Supreme Publications Little can be found on Morris N. Beitman's career activities and Supreme Publications. It is also possible that Supreme Publications was a side business for Morris Beitman since he was also a radio instructor in the Chicago high schools. In the 1950s, like John F. Rider, Beitman had to revise many of his publications due to rapid changes in technology used in consumer electronics. In the 1960s his son Hartford assisted him in Supreme Publications by continuing the yearly service volumes for radio and television. Many of Morris Beitman's publications either had no copyright or they had expired. Hartford spent time to straighten these matters and compiled the \\"1967-1969 Most Often Needed Radio Diagram and Servicing Information\\" book. Supreme would stop publishing by the early 1970s. One reason was the declining need for repairing consumer electronics due to the increased reliability and the low cost of electronics (cost less to buy one than repair it). He died on February 1980, in Highland Park, Illinois. The rise in interest of Supreme's \\"Most Often Needed Series\\" Radio and television servicing is no longer a significant business segment in small or independent business. The rise in interest is in preserving old consumer technology. Interest in Morris Beitman's \\"Most Often Needed Radio Diagrams\\" resurfaced in the early 1980s with the rise of restoring antique and collectible radios made before the 1940s. Vintage Radio, founded by Morgan E. McMahon, was a publishing company specializing in preserving early radio and television technology. They reprinted \\"Most Often Needed 1926-1938 Radio Diagrams and Servicing Information\\" and sold it to radio collectors. From 1986-1989, Hartford Beitman and Kristina Hund Beitman made an effort to resurrect the \\"Most Often Needed\\" series by compiling past servicing information from 1926 to 1950 based on brand name. This series of books was published by A R S Enterprises. No more new copies are available and A R S Enterprises publishing current status has not been found. Hartford Beitman's other books are Recorded Sound (1981), Seattle Seating (1984), Aggressive Investment Marketing (1985), Radio Hobbyist Handbook (1988) and Financial Services Marketing (1990). Supreme's \\"Most Often Needed\\" series have become public domain. There are groups interested in technology preservation. These groups, through scanning or digitizing the thousands of pages of the series, have made them available online for non-commercial use. Radio collecting and restoration books suggest using Supreme's \\"Most-Often-Needed\\" volumes as a starting source to find information. Preserving old technology is often called \\"dead technology\\", in other words technology that is no longer advancing or used in mass production. The American Radio History website offers the complete set of Supreme Publications \\"Most Often Need Radio Servicing Information\\" and \\"Most Often Needed Television Servicing Information\\" to be viewed online.

The terminal is the largest in Australia and is the only passenger terminal in Australia capable of berthing two cruise liners simultaneously. Significance In 2000 the building was permanently listed on the State Register of Heritage Places, was classified by the National Trust in 2001, and was also registered on the former Register of the National Estate. Its 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2010. History Since its construction, Fremantle Harbour has been the major port of call for vessels of all types, including ocean liners bringing migrants and tourists to Western Australia. In the 1950s the Fremantle Port Authority recognised the need to improve the facilities for processing arrivals as the post World War II immigration policy was seeing large number of migrants arriving in Fremantle. The arrivals were being processed in sheds and offices on Victoria Quay, so it was decided to build dedicated facilities. The planning, which commenced in 1957, considered the future needs of the port, so designed a facility capable of processing two ocean liners simultaneously. Hobbs, Winning and Leighton was the architectural firm that designed the building in the post war international style, with AT Brine & Sons and the Fremantle Harbour Trust commencing construction in 1958. The first stage F shed was opened by Premier David Brand in December 1960. The SS Oriana on its maiden voyage was the first vessel to berth at the new terminal. Between the opening of the first stage and the opening of the second stage G shed in May 1962 over 250,000 passengers passed through the terminal. In the 2000s, as ocean pleasure cruises became more popular it was briefly designated as the Fremantle Cruise Terminal. After receiving criticism from Carnival Cruise Line at the outdated state of the terminal in early 2017, the building received an upgrade and refurbishment which was completed in January 2019. Events At various stages the terminal has been utilised for events.

Bundesliga club FSV Frankfurt, the second most important club in Frankfurt. There he stayed two years and became a regular for the second team during his second season. In an interview Dabanlı revealed that he got in fact an offer by Eintracht Frankfurt, the leading club in Frankfurt, but his parents did not admit a move to such a big club since they wanted him to focus on school and to finally attain Abitur. In 2010, he attracted the attention of Bayer Leverkusen, an UEFA Champions League regular for Germany. But also there he did not get beyond the second team. Subsequently, although having had offers by 2. Bundesliga clubs, he made a move to Turkey, the homeland of his ancestors, and played from July 2011 to December 2012 for Kayserispor in the Süper Lig. For them he also made his Süper Lig debut on 24 February 2012. In January 2013 he signed a half year contract at Bundesliga club 1. FC Nürnberg, which was later extended until June 2015.

Norman Pares (16 June 1857 – 23 June 1936) was an English canon and amateur footballer who was on the winning side in the 1879 FA Cup Final. Family Pares was born at the family home at 12 Devonshire Gardens, Portland Place, London, the eldest son of John Pares (1833–1915) and Katharine (née Back). His father was the son of Thomas Pares (1790–1866), who was M.P. for Leicester from 1818 to 1826. His mother was the sister of Admiral Sir George Back FRS (1796–1878), the explorer and naturalist. Pares was one of ten children of the marriage between John Pares and Katharine; he had four brothers (George (Lancelot), Bernard, Basil and Howard) and five sisters (Alice, Ethel, Margaret, Constance and May). His brother, Bernard (1867–1949), was a historian and academic known for his work on Russia. On 22 August 1888, he married Beatrice Emma, daughter of William Ireland Blackburne. Career Pares was educated at Eton College before attending Trinity College, Cambridge in 1876, where he read Classics, graduating with a Third Class Honours degree in 1880, before gaining his M.A. in 1883. He was ordained deacon in 1885, becoming a priest in 1886. From 1881 to 1897, he was a teacher at Portsmouth Grammar School, becoming second master in 1892. He was curate at St. Jude's, Southsea from 1885 to 1887, and then at Portsmouth Parish Church from 1894 to 1897. In 1897, he left Portsmouth and became vicar at St Mary the Virgin, Horsell, near Woking, Surrey where he remained until shortly before he died. From 1913 to 1928, he was Rural Dean for Woking and was a canon at Winchester from 1925 to 1927 and at Guildford from 1928 until his death on 23 June 1936. While vicar at Horsell, he helped the village acquire the land on which the village hall was built in 1906–07 and served for many years on the board of trustees. He was also president of the village cricket team. Pares Close, near the church, was named after him. Football career Whilst at Eton, he represented the school at football and continued to play football while at Cambridge University. While at University, he played for Old Etonians and was a member of the old boys' team that defeated Clapham Rovers in the 1879 FA Cup Final, playing at inside-left in a 1–0 victory. While living in Portsmouth, he founded the Portsmouth Sunflowers Football Club. In 1886, they entered the South Hants & Dorset Senior Cup, where they were defeated 6–1 by Woolston Works on 9 October 1886. The Sunflowers included two of his brothers and at least one cousin at various times, as well as colleagues from Portsmouth Grammar School and former colleagues at Eton and Cambridge. Other sports At Eton, he also played the Eton Field Game. He was also a cricketer, and a member of the M.C.C. and a keen golfer and cyclist.

By virtue of this family of enzymes, a variety of brominated natural products have been isolated from marine sources. Related chloroperoxidase enzymes effect chlorination. In the nomenclature of haloperoxidase, bromoperoxidases classically are unable to oxidize chloride at all. For example, eosinophil peroxidase appears to prefer bromide over chloride, yet is not considered a bromoperoxidase because it is able to use chloride. Muricidae (was Murex) spp. snails have a bromoperoxidase used to produce Tyrian purple dye. The enzyme is very specific to bromide and physically stable, but has not been characterized as to its active site metal. , no specific gene has been assigned to such an enzyme in the snail genome. Such an activity is probably provided by symbiotic Bacillus bacteria instead. Genbank {AKQ77155.1. The identified enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily; a structure for a similar bromoperoxidase is available as . It runs on a catalytic triad of Ser 99, Asp 229 and His 258 and does not require metal cofactors.

Formed in mid-1941, the army spent much of World War II as part of the Transbaikal Military District guarding the Manchurian and Mongolian-Soviet borders. During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, the army advanced over the Greater Khingan mountains and overran the Japanese Hailar fortified region in fierce fighting. It was disbanded after the end of the war in mid-1948. The army was reformed in 1976 from the 86th Army Corps, which had been itself established in 1968 as a result of rising Sino-Soviet tensions. It garrisoned the Transbaikal until being reduced to the 55th Army Corps in 1989 as the Cold War ended.  First formation  = Garrison duty in the Transbaikal = The army was formed in July 1941 in the Transbaikal Military District from the 12th Rifle Corps, under the command of Major General Sergey Fomenko, promoted to lieutenant general on 16 October 1943. It initially included the 65th, 93rd, 94th, and 114th Rifle Divisions as well as the 31st and 32nd Fortified Regions, supported by a number of artillery units, among others. The army became part of the Transbaikal Front in September when the latter was created from the district, and for the rest of World War II guarded the Manchurian-Soviet and Mongolian-Soviet borders in the Transbaikal. = Soviet invasion of Manchuria = Advance of the 36th Army between 8 and 12 August 1945 For the August 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the army included the 2nd and 86th Rifle Corps, the 293rd and 298th Rifle Divisions, the 31st and 32nd Fortified Regions, and tank, artillery, and other units. As part of the Khingan–Mukden Offensive Operation, the army was tasked with an advance from the Dauriya area and positions northeast of Duroy to Hailar in order to secure the attack of the main force of the Transbaikal Front against a Japanese counterattack from the north. To expedite the advance of the army a mobile group consisting of the 205th Tank Brigade, rifle regiments aboard vehicles, artillery and anti-aircraft artillery regiments, self-propelled artillery and missile launcher battalions as well as sapper companies was formed. Beginning their attack on the night of 9 August without artillery or aerial bombardment, the forces of the army swiftly overran Japanese covering units, captured the Jalainur-Manchuria fortified region on the right flank, and crossed the Argun River on the left flank to advance on Hailar. An advance of 40 kilometers was reached by the end of the day. Advance of the 36th Army between 12 and 18 August 1945 Continuing the rapid offensive, the forces of the army surrounded the Hailar fortified region on the second day of the invasion and its main forces advanced deep into Manchuria. After crossing the Greater Khingan, on 17 August they captured Boketu, Yalu, and Zalantun. As the vanguard of the 205th Tank Brigade moved towards Qiqihar, which was reached on 19 August, elements of the army continued the reduction of the Hailar fortified region, which fell on 18 August. Following the surrender of the Kwantung Army, the troops of the army helped disarm Japanese troops. = Postwar = The army became part of the Transbaikal-Amur Military District when the front headquarters became a military district on 10 September. By 1 October, it included the 2nd Rifle Corps with the 103rd, 275th, and 292nd Rifle Divisions, the 86th Rifle Corps with the 94th, 210th, and the 298th Rifle Divisions, and the 293rd Rifle Division and 31st and 32nd Fortified Regions directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The headquarters of the 2nd Rifle Corps, and the 103rd and 275th Divisions were quickly disbanded as part of the postwar demobilization. The demobilization continued in early to mid-1946, during which the 210th, 292nd, 293rd, and the 298th Divisions were disbanded. As a result, the army was reduced to the 86th Rifle Corps with the 36th and 94th Rifle Divisions and the 57th Rifle Division, 61st Tank Division, and the 3rd and 8th Machine Gun Artillery Brigades by August of that year. Headquartered at Chita by May 1947, the army headquarters was used to reform the Transbaikal Military District headquarters there on 10 July. Simultaneously, the 86th Rifle Corps headquarters became a new army headquarters at Tsugol. The existence of this formation was brief, and in accordance with an order of 24 March 1948 the army headquarters was disbanded by July and used to help form the 14th Assault Army in the Chukotka Peninsula. The 86th Rifle Corps and 61st Tank Division were directly subordinated to the district. = Commanders = The following officers commanded the army: *Major General Sergey Fomenko (promoted to lieutenant general 16 October 1943; 27 July 1941 – June 1945) *Lieutenant General Alexander Luchinsky (promoted to colonel general 8 September 1945; June–September 1945) * Lieutenant General Sergey Fomenko (September 1945 – 1948)  Second formation  The second formation of the 36th Army was originally formed as the 86th Army Corps of the Transbaikal Military District at Borzya on 19 April 1968, as a result of the Sino-Soviet split. The numbering of the corps was a reference to the 86th Rifle Corps, in an attempt to continue traditions. The corps included the 122nd Guards Motor Rifle Division at Dauriya whose predecessors had been stationed in the region since 1945, and two other Guards Motor Rifle Divisions transferred from the Moscow Military District: the 11th (Bezrechnaya), 32nd, and the 38th (Sretensk). However, the 32nd Guards returned to the Moscow Military District in 1970. The 86th Corps was redesignated as the second formation of the 36th Army on 1 June 1976, covering the southeast border of Transbaikal. In addition to its divisions, the army included other units transferred from European Russia, such as the 240th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade at Borzya, transferred in early 1975 from the 7th Tank Army of the Belorussian Military District. By the end of the 1980s, the 11th, 14th, 16th, and 18th, and 19th Fortified Regions were part of the army. Abandoned barracks of the 18th Fortified Region, Krasnokamensk On 1 June 1989, the army was downsized into the 55th Army Corps. Later that year, as Soviet military expenditure declined with the winding down of the Cold War, the 38th Guards and 122nd Guards became the 131st Guards and 122nd Guards Machine Gun Artillery Divisions, respectively. The five fortified regions were merged to form regiments in the latter, while the 11th Guards Division was reduced to a weapons and equipment storage base in 1990. The corps was transferred to the Russian Ground Forces when the Soviet Union dissolved, and was redesignated as the 36th Army again in 1997. = Commanders = The following officers are known to have commanded the 86th Army Corps and the army: * Major General Yakov Gugnyak (23 May 1968 – 30 December 1969) * Major General Alexander Borodayev (31 January 1970 – 9 November 1972) * Major General Vladimir Krayev (promoted to Lieutenant General 31 October 1980; August 1980 – 1985) * Major General Leonty Kuznetsov (1985–November 1987) * Major General Georgy Kondratiev (December 1987 – March 1989)  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =  *  Further reading  * 036 Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1989 ","title":"36th Army (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"38333974","text":"Bukidnon Paglaum Party (BPP) (English: Hope for Bukidnon) is a local political party in Bukidnon.

Background  Although practical studies of interstellar travel date back as far as the JBIS red cover editions in the early 1950s and the BIS Daedalus Project in the 1970s, there was a resurgence of interest in the 2010s and a number of initiatives and institutions have paid attention to the subject. These include the 100 Year Starship project of NASA and DARPA, the Tau Zero Foundation, the Global Starship Alliance, Star Voyager, and Icarus Interstellar. The first of a planned annual series of symposia inspired by the i4is took place on 29 May 2013 at the British Interplanetary Society(BIS).

The first book in the series, Hush, Hush, was released on October 13, 2009 through Simon & Schuster, with the final novel in the series, Finale, releasing on October 23, 2012. The series was initially promoted as a trilogy, with later announcements stating that the series would comprise four books. Film rights to the series have been purchased by LD Entertainment and book rights have been sold in 13 countries. Synopsis =Hush, Hush= Nora Grey meets Patch Cipriano in her biology class. She finds herself drawn to him despite him initially trying to assassinate her and her friends preferring that she date their friend Elliot, who is later revealed to be a pawn of the Nephilim Jules. Patch saves Nora from death multiple times because he realizes he has fallen in love with her. Even though Nora believes he is stalking her, she eventually gives in to her feelings for Patch after he reveals he is a fallen angel who is protecting her. Jules, also known by the name Chauncey Langeais, attempts to use Nora as a way to target Patch, but fails and is killed when Nora jumps off of a gym ceiling rafter and dies, severing the blood-related tie between Nora and him. She is brought back by Patch, who then becomes her guardian angel. =Crescendo= In Crescendo, Nora finds that her relationship with Patch has hit a rough spot when he stops returning her calls and refuses to tell her that he loves her in his car when she admits her love for him. She is hurt when she discovers that Patch has been standing outside of rival girl named Marcie's window. Patch explains he can't tell Nora he loves her because it would potentially send him to Hell. This prompts her to begin talking to Scott Parnell, an old friend and possible Nephilim, and use him to make Patch jealous. Nora becomes involved in a fight in the process and ends up firing Patch as her guardian angel. Through Scott she finds that a person called the Black Hand killed her father. Nora becomes more depressed as she sees Patch start a relationship with Marcie and believes he has sent her a drugged apology letter. It's eventually revealed that Nora's mother had an affair with Marcie's father Hank, prompting Marcie's vendetta against her. She also comes to think that Patch is the Black Hand and that he's now Marcie's guardian angel. The true identity of the Black Hand is later revealed to be Hank Millar, Marcie's father. However, Rixon, a fallen angel and Patch's best friend, is revealed to be behind most of the book's events. His Nephil vassal is Marcie's father, Hank, who is revealed to have impregnated Nora's mother years ago, making him her real father. Due to her true heritage, Rixon attempts to sacrifice her to kill his vassal and obtain a human body. In the process of sacrificing Nora, Scott interferes and is shot multiple times. Rixon shoots Nora in the arm and is about to kill her, but Patch appears and he is unsuccessful. The book ends with Rixon getting sent to Hell, Patch and Nora making up, and her real father, Hank, appearing and cornering them, capturing Nora and asking her if she was responsible for the death of Chauncey Langeais. =Silence= The book starts with Nora and her fallen angel boyfriend Patch have had a pretty rocky relationship, and now they finally get to be together. But, Nora has to deal with the fact that she is now the leader of the Nephilim army, she has to deal with the raging war between them and the fallen angels. Nora and Patch are determined to do what it takes to finally just have a normal life together, but as time goes on, Nora has to figure out where her loyalties lie. =Finale= Cover for the final book, Finale Nora and Patch devise a plan to bring the two sides to peace, but as time is ticking it's getting harder for Nora to decide if peace or war is best. Nora has many Nephil friends, including Scott and her new, sexy lieutenant Dante, who are determined to help her become the leader she needs to be, but as Nora goes deeper into the world of her new race she finds things that could destroy her, including a dark addiction that Nora might not be able to shake. In the end all plans of peace are lost and the Nephilim and the fallen angels must go to war. Dante is revealed to be the antagonist. At the end, Vee reveals that she was also Nephilim. Adaptations =Film adaptation= In December 2012 Entertainment Weekly announced that Lionsgate and LD Entertainment had optioned the rights to the series with the intention of turning it into a film series. Patrick Sean Smith has been confirmed to be writing the screenplay for the first film. On July 8, 2014, Becca announced on her website that she has decided that now is not the right time to move forward with the Hush, Hush movie and did not renew the movie option with LD Entertainment. On July 20, 2018, Becca posted an update stating that a Hush Hush movie would be headed to production 'very soon'. BCDF Pictures, along with Kalahari Film & Media, announced that Kellie Cyrus would be directing the film – who is best known for directing The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, as well as an episode of the upcoming drama You from Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble. =Graphic Novel= In 2011 Sea Lion Books published a graphic novel adaptation of Hush, Hush. Fitzpatrick stated that the graphic novel would consist of three volumes and that Jennyson Rosero would be drawing the series. During the book's development Fitzpatrick solicited reader reactions by posting preliminary images on her website, with Sea Lion Books altering some of the designs based on how they were received. Reception Critical reception for the series has been mostly positive, with Crescendo spending ten weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list and being named one of YALSA's Teens’ Top Ten for 2011. Kirkus Reviews praised the first entry but gave a mixed review of Crescendo, remarking that the plot was \\"drawn out\\" and shared many similarities to the first novel.

Magen David is the second operating synagogue in Kolkata, the other is the Beth El Synagogue at Pollock Street. History and architecture The synagogue was built in 1884 by Elias David Ezra in memory of his father David Joseph Ezra, who made his fortune in the real estate trade of Kolkata. Elias David Joseph Ezra is associated with some of the well known buildings of Kolkata including Esplanade Mansion, Ezra Mansion and Chowringhee Mansion. Ezra Street is also named after him. The complex also houses the Neveh Shalome Synagogue, Calcutta's oldest existing synagogue. File:Magen David 2.jpgMagen David interiors File:Magen David Synagogue Interiors after restoration.jpgInteriors after restoration The synagogue is built in the Italian Renaissance style with a brick red finish. The entrance to the synagogue compound is hidden behind makeshift stalls selling hairclips and other trinkets. The Magen David Synagogue is approached through an arched door, containing the hexagonal \\"Star of David\\" and Hebrew inscription. The two side walls contains memorial plaques dedicated to the well known Jews of Calcutta (Kolkata). Although the services of the Magen David Synagogue have long stopped, the interior is astonishingly well maintained. The chequered marble floor, gleaming chandeliers, stained glass windows and ornate floral pillars shipped from Paris enhance its Continental look. The ark of the Magen David Synagogue is set into the walls of an apse. The star-studded half dome of the apse represents the heavens. The large plaque above the middle section of the ark contains the Ten Commandments. It also contains several other Hebrew inscription along with several other items of Jewish Iconography, including the seven branched lamp stand of the menorah. High above the wall opposite the ark is a beautiful stained glass rose window. At the centre of the hall is the bimah, the raised platform from which the rabbi preached. Two sets of stairs from either side of the hall lead to the upper balconies, reserved for women. Jewish community of Kolkata Magen David Apse Magen David memorial plaques Kolkata's Jews are mostly Baghdadi Jews who came to Kolkata to trade. At one point as strong as 6,000, the community dwindled to about 60 after the formation of Israel. Today there are only about 30 Jews left in Kolkata. The first recorded Jewish immigrant to Kolkata was Shalom Cohen in 1798 from Aleppo in present-day Syria. The most influential Jewish family in Kolkata was perhaps the father- son real estate magnates David Joseph Ezra and Elias David Ezra. The family founded the Jewish Girls School. The community had five independent synagogues in Kolkata, out of which the Magen David, Neveh Shalome, and Beth El operate to this day. Magen David and the neighbouring Neveh Shalome are accessible to the public as they are under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India.

It will be produced in Turkey by TAI at its newly established Satellite Assembly Integration and Test Facility () (UMET) in Ankara with 20% indigenously developed technology. Türksat 5A will be the first geostationary communications satellite to be built in Turkey. Launching of the spacecraft is planned for the end of 2020. Türksat 5A will be placed in a geosynchronous orbit at 31°E to provide telecommunication and direct TV broadcasting services over a broad geographic region between west of China and east of England stretching over Turkey, as well as Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It was reported in early 2013 that Mitsubishi Electric (MELCO) of Japan, which is constructing the satellite platforms of Türksat 4A and Türksat 4B, might join the project to provide a MELCO DS2000 satellite bus for the satellite. But on 9 November 2017, Airbus Defence and Space was selected to construct the satellite platforms for Türksat 5A using Eurostar E3000EOR, an all-electric variant of Eurostar E3000. It will have a launch mass of approximately carrying Ku band transponders. The expected on-orbit life time will be 15 years.

He was a leading actor in the influential theatre company Dardanella and, after entering the film industry with 1940s Kartinah, acted in 43 films. Biography Astaman was born in 1903 in Sidoarjo, East Java, Dutch East Indies, the son of an actor named Wagimin, and his wife, an actress. He attended elementary school there, only to drop out in his third year. At age ten Astaman joined his father's troupe Wagimin & Keluarga, which consisted of his father, mother, and two cousins. Astaman first sold tickets, later taking up acting and touring rural areas in East Java with the troupe. He left the troupe sometime in 1915, first to join the Theater se Souvenir, then the Constantinople Opera . By the following year Astaman had abandoned Constantinople to join the troupe Dardanella, which was run by the Penang-born actor of Russian descent Willy A. Piedro and his native wife Dewi Dja'. The troupe, which was highly successful and travelled throughout Southeast Asia, helped Astaman rise to prominence. He played various roles with them, and starred in several of their performances, including Andjar Asmara's Dr Samsi and a stage adaptation of Kwee Tek Hoay's Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang. In a 1964 interview with the variety magazine Varia, he recalled that every time he played a king the European viewers would laugh loudly; Astaman later learned that his costume was that of a matador. Astaman had a son, Lilik Sudjio, in 1930; Lilik would later become a film director. In 1936, he joined Dardanella in a trip to India, hoping to produce a film version of Dr Samsi. This plan collapsed, and Dardanella disbanded: Piedro and Dja' went to America, while Andjar and Ali Joego formed their own troupes and returned to the Indies. Astaman returned separately, going to Kediri. After refusing a position with Njoo Cheong Seng's troupe Fifi Young's Pagoda, Astaman joined the group Tuan Mannuk. Following the success of Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Moonlight) in 1937, many theatre actors began migrating to film – including Astaman, who made his feature film debut in 1940. He co-starred along former Dardanella actress Ratna Asmara in Andjar's Kartinah, which saw him take the role of a doctor who falls in love with his nurse despite being married. The following year Astaman acted in three films for The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film. When the studio closed following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in 1942, Astaman returned to the theatre. During the occupation he acted in a single film, the short propaganda piece Djatoeh Berkait. In 1949, towards the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, Astaman joined Fred Young's studio Bintang Surabaya and began acting in its films, making his debut with Saputangan in 1949. He was taken by Djamaluddin Malik's Persari in 1951, staying with the company until 1958. Afterwards he focused mainly on the theatre, although he took acting jobs at several different companies until the late 1970s. In his later years he did some television acting. He died in 1980. Filmography Astaman acted in 43 films over a period of 34 years. During this time he wrote the stories to two films. =Cast= *Kartinah (1940) *Noesa Penida (1941) *Elang Darat (Hawk on Land; 1941) *Ratna Moetoe Manikam (1941) *Djatoeh Berkait (Fall Together; 1944; short film) *Saputangan (Handkerchief; 1949) *Bintang Surabaja 1951 (Star of Surabaya 1951; 1950) *Damarwulan (1950) *Djembatan Merah (The Red Bridge; 1950) *Harumanis (1950) *Ratapan Ibu (Mother's Wailing; 1950) *Terang Bulan (Moonlight; 1950) *Bakti Bahagia (Happy Duty; 1951) *Djiwa Pemuda (Spirit of the Youth; 1951) *Pahlawan (Hero; 1951) *Rumah Hantu (Ghost House; 1951) *Pengorbanan (Sacrifice; 1952) *Rodrigo de Villa (1952) *Solo Di Waktu Malam (Solo at Night; 1952) *Ajah Kikir (Father the Miser; 1953) *Asam Digunung Garam Dilaut (Acid in the Mountains, Salt at Sea; 1953) *Bagdad (1953) *Leilani (1953) *Bintang Baru (New Star; 1954) *Air Pasang (Rising Tides; 1954) *Kasih Sajang (Love and Tenderness; 1954) *Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew; 1954) *Siapa Ajahku (Who is My Father; 1954) *Tarmina (1954) *Berdjumpa Kembali (Meet Again; 1955) *Rindu Damai (Longing for Peace; 1955) *Buruh Bengkel (Mechanic; 1956) *Djandjiku (My Promise; 1956) *Harta Angker (Haunted Treasure; 1956) *Saodah (1956) *Ibu Mertua (Mother in Law; 1960) *Menudju Bintang (Towards the Stars; 1960) *Asmara dan Wanita (Passion and Women; 1961) *Melati Dibalik Terali (Jasmine Behind the Trellis; 1961) *Petir Sepandjang Malam (Thunder Throughout the Night; 1967) *Lorong Hitam (Black Hole; 1971) *Putri Solo (Daughter of Solo; 1974) *Paul Sontoloyo (1974) =Crew= *Hidup Baru (New Life; 1951) *Tarmina (1954) References Works cited     External links * Category:Date of birth missing Category:Male actors of the Dutch East Indies Category:People from Sidoarjo Regency Category:1903 births Category:1980 deaths Category:20th-century Indonesian male actors Category:Indonesian male film actors Category:Indonesian male stage actors ","title":"Astaman"},{"id":"38334714","text":"Jesús Sánchez González (born March 23, 1976 in Mexico City) is a Mexican race walker.

Built in 1810-11, it is a fine example of a Federal-style duplex, built for a local craftsman, and one of a modest number of such houses to survive a devastating fire in 1813. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 1972. Description and history The Simeon P. Smith House is located on The Hill, a cluster of historic properties south of Deer and High streets which was created as part of a road widening project. It is located facing High Street on the cluster's northeastern edge. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame building, with a gabled roof and interior chimneys. Its central doorway is framed by pilasters and has a triangular pediment above a four-light transom window. Windows are framed by delicate Federal period moulding. Brick chimneys are set on either side of the roof. The interior includes Federal-style cornices, and a fine carved arch in the central hall. Although many rooms retain original Federal period styling, some were altered by subsequent owners to have simpler Greek Revival elements. A secondary entrance has also been added to one of the sides. The Federal- style house was built between 1810 and 1811 for Simeon P. Smith, a Portsmouth cooper. As one of the few middle-class dwellings to survive the Portsmouth fire of 1813, the house serves as an example of a tradesman's home in Portsmouth in the early 1800s.

Whilst she was a lady-in-waiting she had the honour of painting the first official portrait of the Queen for the National Portrait Gallery. The gallery had requested paintings in 1867 of the Queen and her consort, Prince Albert. A portrait of Albert was sent almost immediately but it was not until 1883 that Abercromby's portrait of the Queen was sent. The picture was created in watercolour and was actually based on an original work by Heinrich von Angeli. The Queen's preference for this portrait is said to be because it does not emphasise the Queen's regalia but the woman behind the power. She exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1898.

Life Newcourt was the son of a topographical draughtsman, also called Richard Newcourt, who owned an estate at Somerton, Somerset. He attended Wadham College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 9 December 1653, but did not graduate. After university he became a notary public, and a clerk at the Court of Arches in London, the main consistory court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming a Proctor-General of the court in (according to his own account) 1668.The court was held at the church of St Mary-le-bow until its destruction by the Great Fire in 1666, was transferred temporarily to Exeter House in the Strand, and then to Doctors' Commons. In 1669 he became principal registrar of the diocese of London, a post he held until 1696. Using the records in his custody and other documents, Newcourt compiled a history of the diocese of London, which was published in two volumes in 1708 and 1710, under the title Repertorium Ecclesiasticum Parochiale Londinense: An Ecclesiastical Parochial History of the Diocese of London. The work recounts the history of St Paul's Cathedral, of the bishops and deans of London, and of the parishes in the diocese. His sources of information included the London Registers, which were begun in 1306, and registers kept by individual bishops. The incomes of the parishes were taken from a return made in 1636, the manuscript of which was then at Sion College. He also wrote a history of the bishops of England, which was not published. He spent the last years of his life at Greenwich, and was buried at the parish church in February 1716. His wife had been interred there the previous month.

The Ahoms pushed back Mughal control to the west of the Manas river for good.\\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river. The Manas then became the Ahom-Mughal boundary until the British occupation.\\" The main battle was fought at a garrison island on the Brahmaputra, in which the Mughal fauzdar, Mansur Khan, was defeated and the remnant of the Mughal forces pursued to the Manas river. With this win, the Ahoms recovered Sarkar Kamrup from the Mughals. Ahom preparations After Gadadhar Singha became the Ahom king in 1681, preparations began in March 1682 for a war to expel the Mughals from Guwahati. An army was organized under the Dihingiya Alun Barbarua. A three-pronged advance was made in June and July 1682: under the commands of Holou Deka-Phukan and the Namdangiya Phukan along the north bank of the Brahmaputra river; under Garhgayan Sanikoi Neog Phukan and Khamrak Charingiya Phukan along the south bank; and the navy under Bandar Barphukan and Champa Paniphukan. Mughal defences and battles The Mughals were at a disadvantage, with the faujdar Mansur Khan ill, and widespread discontent among the soldiers. The Imperial attention was focused elsewhere: Aurangzeb, the Mughal emperor, was drawn toward the Deccan due to the Mughal–Maratha Wars (1680-1707), and the Subah of Bengal was busy with its dispute with the East India Company. As the Ahom forces advanced, the Mughals retreated from the advance outpostsBahbari and Kurua in the north bank and Kajali and Panikhaiti in the south bankto the fort of Itakhuli. The Ahoms now cast their focus on Shah Buruz on the north bank (Salal Borgohain, Bandar Borphukan, the Sadiyakhowa Gohain, the Marangikhowa Gohain and others) and on Itakhuli on the south bank (Dihingiya Borbarua, Saring Phukan and others posted at the Sarania fort). The Pani Phukan kept his fleet at the mouth of the Barnadi river. The only contested battle was fought when Ali Akbar, the commander of Itakhuli, attacked the Ahom forces at the Sarania fort, but he had to retreat after heavy losses. This prompted the faujdar Mansur Khan to desert the fort (17 July 1682). At this, the Ahoms advanced to Itakhuli and besieged it. A naval battle was fought at Paniduar on 15 August 1682 between the Dihingia Rajkhowa (Ahom) and Jayanta Singha (Mughal), with the defeat and surrender of Jayanta, leaving the garrison at Itakhuli without any naval support. Unable to sustain his position, Ali Akbar abandoned Itakhuli with his forces the next day at dawn, met with Masur Khan at Guwahati and retreated to Rangamati secretly by boat. The cavalier—under Indradaman, Dalan Singh and Kabir Khan—retreated by land, pursued by the Borbarua by land and water up to the Manas river. The evacuated fort of Itakhuli was then occupied by the Chetia Borphukan. Spoils of the war The war spoils were enormouspearls, gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, weapons and animals of war. Among the prisoners, the cousins of Raja Ramsingh were released, but the Bhatdhara Phukan, brother of the late Laluksola Borphukan who had abandoned Guwahati, was ghoulishly killed.Bhatdhara Phukan was made to eat the flesh of his sons and then killed. With the fall of Itakhuli, the Ahom kingdom quickly occupied the region up to Manas river, and set up administration under the Borphukan, with his headquarters at Guwahati.

He served his brother as a general and governor, and continued his policies after his accession. His reign was troubled by rebellions and wars, most notably by the invasion of Rafi' ibn Harthama in 889–892, which occupied most of his domains. After Rafi' fell out of favour with the Abbasids, Muhammad recovered his position and secured the allegiance of Rafi', but did not particularly support him against the Saffarids. In 900, following the Saffarids' defeat by the Samanids, he tried to invade Khurasan, but was defeated and died of his wounds, whereupon Tabaristan fell to the Samanids.  Early life and career under Hasan  Muhammad was the younger brother of Hasan ibn Zayd, an Alid who founded Zaydid rule over Tabaristan in 864.Madelung (1975), p. 206 Nothing is known of his early life. Iranologist Wilferd Madelung speculates that the family lived in Iraq before coming to Tabaristan after Hasan's takeover of the province; Muhammad appears to have come to Tabaristan in 867.Madelung (1993), pp. 595–597 During Hasan's rule, Muhammad is mentioned as being captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar during the latter's 874 invasion, but released at Gurgan when Ya'qub withdrew in 876. After a brief visit to Tabaristan to see his mother, he returned to Gurgan as an assistant to Hasan's brother-in-law, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim. The Zaydids were expelled from Gurgan by the Tahirid general Ishaq al-Sari in spring 877, but soon recovered it. In 880, Muhammad also suppressed the rebellion of Rustam I, a member of the native Bavandid dynasty which ruled the mountains of eastern Tabaristan and opposed the Zaydids.Madelung (1975), p. 207 He then suppressed a rebellion in Gurgan headed by another Alid, Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Aqiqi, and probably continued to govern the province in his brother's name until the latter's death on 6 January 884. Due to Muhammad's absence in Gurgan, upon Hasan's death power in Tabaristan was usurped by his brother-in- law, Abu'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Muhammad, who proclaimed himself as the legitimate emir. Muhammad was prevented from returning to Tabaristan straight away by a mutiny by his Daylamite troops, and was able to regain control of Gurgan itself only through the aid of the former Tahirid general and now ruler of Khurasan, Rafi' ibn Harthama. Finally, in October 884 Muhammad was able to return to Tabaristan, seize the capital Amul, and behead the usurper.  Reign  Muhammad assumed the same regnal name as his brother, al-Da‘ī ila‘l-Ḥaqq (\\"He who summons to the Truth\\"), and was known as al-Da‘ī al-ṣaghīr (\\"the Younger Missionary\\") in contrast to Hasan (al-Da‘ī al-kabīr, \\"the Elder Missionary\\"). He is also found in some sources as al-Qa’im bi al-Ḥaqq (\\"Upholder of the Truth\\"). Muhammad now attacked Rustam, who had supported the usurper Ahmad, and drove him from his domains to seek refuge at the Saffarid court. With Saffarid mediation, Rustam was allowed to return. Like his brother, Muhammad tried to expand his domain by military means, and campaigns occupied a large part of his reign. In August 885 he tried to capture Rayy from its Turkish ruler Asategin, but was driven back. Rafi' ibn Harthama used the opportunity to occupy Gurgan, but Muhammad recovered control of the province as soon as Rafi' departed it. In 888 or 889, Muhammad again attacked Rustam, who now fled to Rafi' and sought his aid. Rafi' launched a major invasion of the Zaydid domains and conquered most of them, forcing Muhammad, like his brother before him, to seek shelter in the mountain fortresses of the western districts. Muhammad also gained the support of Jastan ibn Wahsudan, lord of Daylam. With his aid, Muhammad engaged in constant fighting with Rafi', but was unable to recover his realm. Eventually, Rafi' struck a peace with Jastan, and the Daylamites too withdrew. At this point, Muhammad's fortunes changed, with the accession of a new Caliph, al-Mu'tadid, on the Abbasid throne in 892. Fearful of Ibn Harthama's power, the Caliph stripped him of the governorship of Khurasan and gave it to his rival, the Saffarid Amr ibn al-Layth. In response, Rafi' concluded a peace with Muhammad, returned Tabaristan (but not Gurgan) to him and even pledged allegiance to the Zaydid cause. Muhammad re-entered Amul on 24 June 893. Despite their alliance, Muhammad refrained from aiding Rafi' in his wars with the Saffarids, and the two fell out and clashed again briefly when Muhammad tried to recover Sari as well. After their reconciliation, Rafi' even tortured and killed Muhammad's old adversary Rustam in 895, and in 896, when his forces briefly conquered Nishapur, the Friday prayer was read in Muhammad's name. Rafi' was killed shortly after by his rivals the Saffarids, whereupon Muhammad recovered Gurgan as well. In 897, Muhammad provided refuge to Bakr ibn Abd al-Aziz, a scion of the deposed Dulafid dynasty of Isfahan. Initially, Muhammad received him with honours and even gave him the governorship of the towns of Chalus and Ruyan, but in 898 he had Bakr poisoned. In 900, the balance of power in the region changed abruptly with the defeat and death of the Saffarid Amr ibn al-Layth by the Samanids in April of that year. The Samanids now demanded the cession of Gurgan, while Muhammad was planning to exploit the turmoil and invade Khurasan himself. Muhammad and his army met with Samanid army under Muhammad ibn Harun al-Sarakhsi at Gurgan, and in the ensuing battle, the Samanids prevailed, and the severely wounded Muhammad was captured. He died on the next day, 3 October 900 (or in August, according to Abu'l-Faraj). His corpse was decapitated, and while his head was sent to the Samanid court at Bukhara, his body was buried at the gate of Gurgan. Within a short time, as al-Mas'udi reports, his tomb became a centre of pilgrimage. As Muhammad's son and designated heir Zayd was also captured and sent to Bukhara, the Zaydid leaders agreed to name Zayd's infant son al-Mahdi as their ruler, but dissension broke out among their ranks: one of them proclaimed himself for the Abbasids instead, and his troops attacked and massacred the Zaydid supporters. Instead, the Samanids took over the province. The Samanid conquest brought along a restoration of Sunni Islam in the province, but the Shi'a cause was upheld and spread among the Daylamites and Gilanites by another Alid, Hasan al-Utrush, who in 914 managed to conquer Tabaristan and restore Zaydid rule.Madelung (1975), pp. 208–209  Religious policies and character  Like his brother, Muhammad espoused and promoted Zaydi Shi'ism and Mu'tazilism, while repressing Sunni opposition. This religious oppression, combined with their reliance on the Daylamite mountaineers, whose lack of discipline and barbarous behaviour were much resented by the populace, resulted in an estrangement of the mass of the people from Zaydid rule. Muhammad achieved some prominence among the Shi'ites by sponsoring the rebuilding of the shrine to Ali and his son Husayn after its destruction by the Abbasids, as well as by his liberal donations to other members of the Alid family across the Muslim world. Nevertheless, the later Zaydis do not consider either him or Hasan as legitimate imams. Despite his religious fervour, he does not seem to have been a resolute enemy of the Abbasids; according to a story, the Caliph al-Mu'tadid was saddened by Muhammad's death. Muhammad was also a cultured man, who appreciated good poetry and even composed poems of his own, of which only a few lines survive, recorded by al-Suli.

The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the Angelus, that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work. Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector Thomas Gold Appleton, who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the Barbizon school up to record amounts in the late 19th century. History Millet said: \\"The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed\\".L'Angelus, Musée d'Orsay Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, Prayer for the Potato Crop, to The Angelus. It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in Barbizon, with a view of the church tower of Chailly-en-Bière. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as \\"a young peasant and his companion\\". Millet sold The Angelus after his The Gleaners was sold at the Salon in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount he sold The Gleaners for. The Angelus was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in Brussels in 1874, where it was greatly admired by Léon Gambetta.Foley, Susan. \\"A Great and Noble Painting\\": Léon Gambetta and the Visual Arts in the French Third Republic (PDF format). Much later, Salvador Dalí saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket.Schneider, Nathan. \\"The Angelus at Work\\", America, March 24, 2015 It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial – perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting A Burial at Ornans (1850) – but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower. Commentary At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers. While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, \\"There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in.\\"Huguenaud, Karine. The Angelus, April 2010, Napoleon.org In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Praët exchanged it for Millet’s Bergère avec son troupeau (Shepherd and her flock) and commented dryly, “What can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome”. Provenance The painting triggered a rush of patriotic fervour when the Louvre tried to buy it in 1889, and was vandalized by a madman in 1932. With reference to the Musée d'Orsay, the provenance of the work is as follows; although some events are missing, such as the Brussels show in 1874:record for nr. RF 1877 of the Musée d'Orsay website. *1860 owned by Belgian landscape painter Victor de Papeleu who bought it for 1,000 francs;France Embraces Millet on Mutual art; *1860 owned by Alfred Stevens, who paid 2,500 fr.; *1860 owned by Jules Van Praët, Brussels; *1864 Paul Tesse obtained it by exchanging it for La Grande bergère (Shepherdess and flock) by Millet;The Shepherdess and flock is also in the Musée d'Orsay's collection, nr.

Sutton drives the sale price to 553,000 francs; *1889–1890, collection American Art Association, New York; sale 1890 to the Paris collector and philanthropist, Hippolyte François Alfred Chauchard (1821–1909), for 750,000 fr.; *1890–1909, collection Alfred Chauchard; *1909: Chauchard bequest of 1906 to the French State; formally accepted 15 January 1910 into the permanent collection of the musée du Louvre, Paris; *1986 transferred to the permanent collection of musée d'Orsay, Paris. Legacy A month after the Secretan sale, The Gleaners was sold for 300,000 francs, and the contrast between the auction prices of Millet's paintings on the art market and the value of Millet's estate for his surviving family led to the droit de suite (French for \\"right to follow\\"), a French law that compensates artists or their heirs when artworks are resold. The imagery of The Angelus with peasants praying was a popular sentimental 19th-century religious subject. Generations later, Salvador Dalí had seen a reproduction of it on the wall of his childhood school and claimed to have been spooked by the painting. He felt the basket looked like the coffin of a child and the woman looked like a praying mantis. He was inspired to create his paranoiac-critical paintings The Architectural Angelus of Millet and Gala and the Angelus of Millet Preceding the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses in 1933. These were followed two years later by a similar pair of paintings which included a partial reproduction of Millet's The Angelus, called The Angelus of Gala and Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus. In 1938, he published a book Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet.Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet, by Jean-Jacques Pauvert with plates by Salvador Dalí, 1963, . In 2018, Gil Baillie \\"Bells and Whistles: The Technology of Forgetfulness\\", Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Quarterly, Vol. 41, No. 3 Fall 2018 (PDF format). wrote that The Angelus incorporates a sensibility of the sacramental that made reproductions of the painting especially popular in Western Europe throughout much of the remainder of the 19th century. He incorporates a story that illustrates the role of imagination in the appeal of the image: \\"When his lifelong friend and agent Alfred Sensier first saw the painting on Millet’s easel, the artist asked: 'Well, what do you think of it?' 'It’s the Angelus,' acknowledged Sensier. To which Millet replied: 'Can you hear the bells?'\\" Baillie, acknowledging the effect of The Angelus on Dali's art, suggests that the latter artist's reaction is a manifestation of the sacramental meaning of the piece.

Cavendish was born in London, but raised in Switzerland and grew up speaking English, German, Swiss-German and French. He volunteered for the British Army in 1944 and served in Secret Intelligence Middle East (SIME) where he struck up a lifelong friendship with Maurice Oldfield, a future Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. Following his demobilisation in 1948, he was recruited as the Secret Intelligence Service's youngest officer, aged 21, and worked in R5, the counterespionage section.Cavendish, Anthony (1997), Inside Intelligence, HarperCollins, London. Cavendish left SIS in 1953 and turned to journalism, covering Eastern Europe and the Middle East for United Press International and filing acclaimed eyewitness dispatches from Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He subsequently pursued a career as a businessman and merchant banker, but remained friendly with former colleagues in the intelligence world. When Oldfield fell victim to a smear campaign in 1980, following his appointment as British Prime minister Margaret Thatcher's security supremo for Northern Ireland, Cavendish began writing a slim volume of memoirs intended to clear his friend's name. He started writing it shortly after Oldfield’s death, abandoned it when SIS made their displeasure clear, and then completed it after further smears against Oldfield appeared in 1987. SIS again told Cavendish that it could not be published, whereupon he had 500 copies of Inside Intelligence printed and circulated to the Establishment as 'Christmas cards’ in December 1987.Gill, Peter (2012), “Policing Politics”, Routledge, London.

Low scores in this scale would suggest the need to make changes to information architecture or page layout. * Satisfaction: measuring the perceived utility of the website. Low scores in this scale may indicate that the website does not meet users' needs either because the users are not those expected by who created the website or because contents / services are not those expected by the users. * Attractiveness: measuring the interaction with the aesthetic features of the website. Low scores in this scale would suggest the need for a re-styling. Us.E. 2.0 allows fast assessment of web site usability identifying critical issues that could be eventually addressed by re-design. Users are required to answer to all items along a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \\"strongly agree\\" to \\"strongly disagree\\").

Blacklisting may be done by states (denying employment in state entities) as well as by private companies. The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and company towns, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike. Examples =United States= The 1901 Report of the Industrial Commission stated \\"There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it.\\" It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: \\"Wherever he went the blacklist was ahead of him\\". The National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 gave employees the right to organize and bargain collectively. and numerous strikes occurred until the Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935, and organized labor sought relief from employers who had able to blacklist union members. Though the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported trade unions or criticised their employers, the practice remained common. A U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics report published in 1938 noted that \\"Closely related to discrimination and the employer's right to discharge is the blacklist.\\" Employees who had been fired had no recourse to legal action against the employer, but \\"most States have statutes which make criminal the establishment of a blacklist.\\" The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti- union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist. Hollywood blacklist In American history, one of the most famous examples of blacklisting stemmed from an investigation launched in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) into Communist influence on the motion picture industry. The first in the industry to be blacklisted, as a result of their refusal to provide evidence to HUAC, were a group known as the Hollywood Ten, most of them screenwriters, who had at one time or another been members of the American Communist Party. Today, the best known of the Hollywood Ten are the writers Ring Lardner, Jr. and Dalton Trumbo, who was barred from openly working in Hollywood for over a dozen years as a result of his defiance of HUAC. Trumbo continued to work under pseudonyms and \\"fronts\\" until the revelation in 1960 that he had written the script for Spartacus. Actor John Garfield was one of the more famous Hollywood performers to have been blacklisted by major American film studios as a direct result of HUAC investigations and hearings. Blacklisting sometimes consisted of guilt by association, as in the case of radio actress Madeline Lee. Both Lee and her husband, actor Jack Gilford, were blacklisted after it was revealed that Lee had given a party in her house to raise funds for a group later labeled as a Communist front. Though there was no suspicion that she had ever been involved in any putatively \\"subversive\\" political causes (and though her real name was spelled differently), Lee became the target of thousands of protest phone calls to her network. Another actress, Camila Ashland, who appeared on the television show Danger, physically resembled Madeline Lee; though she had no political past, her network too became the target of protest phone calls. Madeline Pierce, a 20-year veteran of radio, who again had no political past, was also ultimately blacklisted. US real estate appraisers On October 16, 2008, Capitol West Appraisers filed a class action lawsuit against Countrywide Financial Corp. (now owned by Bank of America) alleging Countrywide blacklisted appraisers who refused to appraise real estate at inflated prices. In Capitol West v. Countrywide Financial Corp., Capitol West Appraisals alleges Countrywide pressured appraisers to set the value of a property at the selling price rather than setting the value based on an inspection of the property and comparable market prices in the area as required by appraisal standards. Misrepresenting the value of a property allowed Countrywide to lend more money to more buyers at higher risks with less collateral. Countrywide could then make more money off the loans by selling them on secondary markets as mortgage backed securities. Appraisers who refused to misrepresent property values were put in a \\"do not use\\" or \\"Field Review List\\" data base, in essence a blacklist. When an appraisal was submitted by an appraiser on the \\"do not use\\" database it was flagged for \\"field review\\". A field review is a review of the original appraisal. All field reviews were conducted by Landsafe, a subsidiary of Countrywide, who would consistently shoot holes in any appraisal from a blacklisted appraiser. Mortgage Brokers were then required to get a second appraisal from another appraiser. Since independent mortgage brokers did not want to pay for two appraisals and did not know which lender they would ultimately use, and since Countrywide was the biggest home mortgage lender in the U.S., brokers simply would not use anyone on the Field Review List. As of Aug. 28, 2008, more than 2,000 names were on the Field Review List, Countrywide's blacklist, which it sends to mortgage brokers who hire appraisers across the United States. =European union= UK Blacklisting of trade union members Blacklisting in relation to trade union activity is illegal in the UK under the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010. Trade union members, and workers who raised health and safety and other concerns in the United Kingdom have been blacklisted by employers. They used the services of the Economic League, which operated between 1919 and 1993, and The Consulting Association, which, until it was closed down in February 2009, took over this role within the UK construction industry. However the Information Commissioner's Office was subsequently criticised for failing to take further punitive action against the employers using the blacklist, or carrying out any further investigation.Damning ICO Misses the Point on Blacklisting from https://www.constructionnews.co.uk accessed 24 March 2013 However, the Scottish Affairs Select Committee subsequently began calling for evidence in relation to blacklisting,Builders face blacklist damages claims from Financial Times accessed 24 March 2013 producing an interim report in March 2013 and a final report in 2015. While acknowledging that some positive steps had been taken, it said \\"many questions in relation to the practice of blacklisting remain unanswered\\", and recommended a full public inquiry as a matter of priority. Norway Blacklisting was used in Norway before the Second World War. Well-known blacklisted trade unionists include Thorolf Bugge. =Eastern Bloc= In the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, individuals could be blacklisted for political reasons, particularly to deny them employment in their chosen profession.

Plot  Late one night, secretary Paula Young (Ann Harding) leaves the office of her boss, Stanley Whittaker (Douglas Dumbrille, locking the door and taking the stairs to avoid being seen by the elevator operator (Frank Jenks). The next morning, the cleaning lady finds Whittaker's dead body, an apparent suicide. Police Lieutenant Poole (Moroni Olsen) finds a letter signed by Whittaker in which the deceased states he embezzled $75,000. Soon, however, he suspects otherwise and, after investigating, arrests widower James \\"Jim\\" Trent (Walter Abel), the vice president of Whittaker Textile Corporation. The gun that fired the fatal shot belongs to Trent, and the typewritten suicide note, though signed by Whittaker, specifically states that Trent is not involved in the embezzlement. The trial goes badly for the defendant. The elevator operator recalls seeing only Whittaker and Trent in the office building that night, and Martin (Paul Harvey), the prosecuting attorney, produces a possible strong motive: Trent's daughter Connie intended to run away with Whittaker that night. However, Paula interrupts the proceedings to claim responsibility for the crime. She had guessed that Whittaker intended to flee the country with Connie (she being unaware of his embezzlement) when two ship tickets were delivered to the office. With strong, concealed feelings for Trent, Paula forced Whittaker at gunpoint to sign the confession she had typed. However, Whittaker then tried to grab the gun, only to be fatally shot in the struggle. Trent asks Paula to marry him.

History The park was created by Regulation 245/67, Schedule 59 of the Provincial Parks Act in 1967. The province acquired two parcels of land along Highway 26 as well as lands along former railway line. Only lands north of Highway 26 became an active park.http://files.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/parks-and-protected- areas/mnr_bpp0248.pdf Facilities =Park Office= The Park Office is located on Ontario Highway 26 near Blue Mountain ski resort.

There is a comfort station and shower building including laundry facilities and flush toilets. Potable water taps are also found at various locations outside the Day Use area. All the campsites in the camping area are within easy walking distance of the beach. A children's adventure playground is located next to the shower building. Firewood is available for purchase at the gatehouse next to the Park Store. Day Use The park is opened to day use and closed after 10pm daily after which only registered campers can remain overnight. Ecology The rock Fractured oil shale plates on the shore contain invertebrate fossils 455 million years old. From 1859 to 1863 the Craigleith Shale Oil Works plant was opened by William Darley Pollard to the east of the park extracted bituminous oil shale.

It lived during the Lower and Middle Ordovician (Floian to Darriwillian).  Distribution  * G. galba has been found in the Middle Ordovician (Darriwillian) of Newfoundland, Canada (Histiodella kristinae conodont-zone, Table Cove Formation, Table Head Group, Chazyan) and Ireland (Lough Shee Mudrocks Formation, Llanvirn). * G. sp. was collected from the Horn Valley Siltstone and basal Stairway Sandstone, Amadeus Basin, Northern Territory. * G. nericiensis is reported from the late Lower Ordovician (Floian) of Sweden (Billingen stage).  Description  Like all Agnostida, G. galba is diminutive and the headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are of approximately the same size (or isopygous) and outline. As in all Agnostina, G. galba has two thorax segments. When Agnostina are rolled up, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the Eodiscina. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the Condylopygoidea. In G. galba the glabella is short and broad. The furrow that usually separates the anterior and posterior glabella (F3) is effaced. The lateral furrows of the posterior glabella (F2) are weakly impressed. The node on the glabella is located near its anterior margin. The pygidial axis is very short, and tapers to the back. The posterior lobe is transverse trapeziform, and carries an indistinct median ridge, and behind which the axial furrow deepens.Whittington, H. B. et al.

It was based on a novel by Olive Wadsley. Plot As summarized in a film publication, Toni (Boucher) and her brother Fane (Thatcher) were adopted after the death of their father by their Uncle Charles (Cullin), and brought from the slums to the uncle's beautiful home, much to the disgust of the uncle's wife Lady Henrietta (De Winton). Fane is placed in a boys academy while Toni is sent to a convent. Fane turns out to be a haughty young Englishman while Toni cannot understand the changes in her brother. Lady Henrietta has had him raised to suit herself. Toni is then placed in a finishing school and, after she is expelled for going outside the walls, Lady Henrietta threatens to place her in a Dutch school where she would be punished for such a misdemeanor. Toni tells her troubles to Lord Robert Wyke, Lady Henrietta's brother who is kindly and devoted to Toni. He is secretly in love with Toni, but is not free to tell her because of a hastily and unfortunate marriage to an adventuress. After Robert is compelled to leave for business and Toni hears that she will be sent to the Dutch school, the girl follows Robert to Florence where she remains with the housekeeper of Count de Soulnes. Word arrives that Robert has been murdered, but later he arrives and it turns that his wife was killed in an automobile accident, leaving him free to marry Toni.

Officially, it was established to structure the free time of young people interested in sports and technology in group activities, provide the required technical equipment (for example, motorcycles, aircraft, radios), cultivate and support technical sport disciplines, and arrange for events like motor and shooting competitions. The association also contributed to the militarization of East German society by organizing together with the National People’s Army the country’s mandatory pre-military training (VA, vormilitärische Ausbildung) in schools, universities and workplaces. It was established on 7 August 1952 and disbanded in early 1990. The association published a monthly, 32-page periodical, S+T (Sport und Technik). Mission The Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik (GST) was originally established to structure through group activities the free time of people of all ages who were interested in sports and technology. This included adolescents, who were to be given an opportunity to engage in meaningful leisure activities. Older, more experienced members were expected to take beginners under their wing and give them support. Most of the required equipment (such as motorcycles, boats, automobiles, trucks, airplanes, radios, rifles, workshops and even animals) was provided, and maintained and serviced by both the members themselves and permanent employees. But the mission soon changed; military sports became increasingly predominant, and the organization evolved into a “school for tomorrow’s soldiers”. It operated training bases, shooting ranges and military training camps, and held competitions. Even if they were not members, almost all young men and women came into contact with the GST because it organized the pre- military training exercises mandated by East Germany's Military Service Law. Without participating in this training, access to university and career training was usually blocked. Some secondary school students were GST members, which was also the case for trainees in large concerns. They paid only a token membership fee. How much emphasis was placed on military matters depended to a great extent on the trainers at the schools. In addition to general pre- military training there were also military camps (taking place for boys over two weeks at the end of the 9th grade), a so-called “Qualification March” (Marsch der Bewährung) for about five days each year either in the course of vocational training or once at the end of the 11th grade in secondary schools, and competitions. But the organization also united in its ranks young people and adults of both sexes with the goal of improving their physical fitness, equipping them with technical knowledge, and in general cultivating expertise and abilities useful for military and international sports competitions. It frequently offered the only possibility to legally engage in certain sports, like gliding, flying motorized aircraft, shooting, and diving. The range of leisure activities was reduced more and more starting in the 1970s, for example, sport gliding in locations near the West German border after a number of GDR citizens successfully escaped to West Germany using various types of flying machines. GST members had an opportunity to obtain a driver's license for trucks, cars, motorcycles or mopeds. For many young people this was a primary reason for joining the GST. About one percent of the expenses were covered in the country’s defense budget; the rest had to be financed by other state institutions, as the income from membership fees was insignificant. Members received uniforms, ranks, performance badges and medals. The governing board was dominated by full-time personnel with military background, usually former career soldiers. In 1979 the GST had about 530,000 members in over 9,000 local divisions, a number that had risen to 600,000 by 1988.Dirk Jurich, Staatssozialismus und gesellschaftliche Differenzierung: eine empirische Studie, p.32. LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, In addition to these divisions, which usually had their own areas of specialization, GST as an East German mass organization was organized according to the rules of what was called “democratic centralism” as to its basic organizations, county and district boards, and central governing board. The basic organizations existed in factories and workplaces, vocational schools, secondary schools, universities and colleges, administrative bodies and producers’ cooperatives. The highest organ of the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik was according to its statutes a congress which usually met every five years and had the task of electing the central governing board. One goal of the organization was to obtain voluntary, well-qualified and dedicated recruits for career service in the National People’s Army. This became increasingly difficult to achieve starting in the 1980s as most members were uninterested in volunteering for extended military service. Sport disciplines Various sport disciplines were organized into official East German groupings under the aegis of the GST: *East German Alliance of German Marksmen *East German Aerial and Parachute Sports Association *East German Multiple Military Sports Association *Model Sports Association *Motor Sports Association *East German Amateur Radio Association *East German Marine Sports Association *East German Sport Divers Association *Military Combat Sports Association For some disciplines, subsections of the main organizations were established, for example for: *Equestrian Sports *Guard Dogs *Hunting *Pigeon Racing Symbols The association’s emblem was a red oval with an anchor, propeller blade and rifle, surrounded by golden ears of grain and a cogwheel. The GST flag was red, with the symbol at the center. Equipment In 1986/87 the association had at its disposal: *3 500 motor vehicles of various types, including 1 334 driver training trucks *17 384 motorcycles, heavyweight and lightweight *33 schooling ships and training motorboats *529 motorboats and cutters *167 aircraft *472 gliders *10 026 telecommunications devices *48 000 small-bore machine guns (including 40 000 unused model KK-Mpi stored) *50 000 small-bore rifle *106 000 air guns *1 154 armories *8 741 shooting lanes (as distinguished from shooting ranges) *12 central training centers and schools *35 airfields References Further reading  Licensed edition of:  * Category:Sports governing bodies in East Germany Category:Mass organisations of East Germany Category:Military of East Germany Category:History of East Germany Category:Sports organizations established in 1952 Category:Sports organizations disestablished in 1990 Category:1952 establishments in East Germany Category:1990 disestablishments in East Germany ","title":"Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik"},{"id":"38335543","text":"Lagorrachi () is a village and a community of the Katerini municipality.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Before the 2011 local government reform it was part of the municipality of Elafina, of which it was a municipal district.

Recorded by Hendrix that same year with American rock and funk musician Buddy Miles on drums and Grammy Award-winner Duane Hitchings on organ, the song was released a little more than thirty years later on the box set The Jimi Hendrix Experience. History American musician, singer and songwriter Jimi Hendrix In 1969, Jimi Hendrix's half-brother Leon Hendrix was suffering from a drug addiction and other problems. After Leon approached his successful half-brother Jimi and asked him for money, Hendrix wrote \\"It's Too Bad\\". On Tuesday, February 11, 1969, Hendrix was at Record Plant Studios in New York City producing the song \\"I Can See\\" for his friends in the Buddy Miles Express band at a recording session that went from 12:00 am to 4:00 am. With musician Buddy Miles on drums and Duane Hitchings on organ, the Buddy Miles Express band recorded \\"I Can See\\" (later retitled \\"Destructive Love\\") as Hendrix operated the mixing console. After the song was recorded, Hendrix came from behind the control room console to play guitar for two impromptu originals, \\"World Traveler\\", a guitar-and-organ duel between Hendrix and Hitchings, and \\"It's Too Bad\\". Both songs were recorded in one take. Hitchings remarked about his experience in recording with Hendrix, noting in 2010: \\"Jamming with him was an amazing experience. I was scared to death!\\". Interpretation In the 1969 song track, Hendrix plays the role of both himself and his brother Leon. Backed by modern day blues, the song begins with \\"It's too bad, Lord, my brother can't be here today\\", to explore Hendrix's uneasy relationship with Leon, a theme that Hendrix also explored in his 1969 song, \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\". In \\"It's Too Bad\\", the song notes how Hendrix sent Leon \\"a-crying away\\", and goes on to addresses Hendrix's uneasy relationship with other African-Americans, noting: \\"So I'll go way across the tracks... And man they treat me the same way as you do... [They] say man until you come back, completely black, go back where you came from too\\". Music reviews attributed the uneasy community connection expressed in the song to 1960s-1970s African- Americans' objection to Hendrix's \\"colorblind vision\\" by accusing Hendrix of \\"achieving stardom by pandering to rock's largely white audience\\". The song also makes reference to Hendrix's 1968 song \\"Room Full of Mirrors\\", which refers to a cracked mirror metaphor Hendrix used to convey the many sides of his emotions. Hendrix Estate After Hendrix died without a will in 1970, his father Al received the rights to Hendrix's estate, including \\"It's Too Bad\\". A little more than thirty years after the song was recorded, it was one of four Hendrix songs newly discovered and added to The Jimi Hendrix Experience, a four disc box set. In reviewing the song on The Jimi Hendrix Experience (2000), producer and audio engineer Eddie Kramer noted about the tune: \\"I think it's very clever, and very, very emotionally charged. It has a tremendous wallop\\". Two years later, Hendrix's father died and Leon sued their father's estate and Hendrix's stepsister Janie to gain control over about one quarter of US$80 million. After Washington Superior Court judge Jeffrey M. Ramsdell limited Leon's claim to a single gold record left to him when his father died in 2002, Janie remarked in 2004 about the lawsuit: \\"Jimi wrote a song about Leon and it was called, 'It's Too Bad'. The lyrics to that song are what this is all about\\".

She was prime minister of Slovenia from March 2013 until May 2014, the first woman in Slovenia to hold this position. She was president pro tempore of the Positive Slovenia party from January 2013 until April 2014.Positive Slovenia is led by Alenka Bratušek (In Slovene: Pozitivno Slovenijo vodi mag.

Life Bratušek was born in Celje. She studied at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology at the University of Ljubljana. Continuing her studies at the University of Ljubljana, she went on to obtain a master's degree in management at the Faculty of Social Sciences. Before entering politics, she served for six years as head of the Directorate for the State Budget at the Ministry of Finance. In March 2013, an anonymous person criticized Bratušek because she had not cited a source on one page of her master's thesis.[http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/s-pinceto-nad-magisterij- alenke-bratusek.html S pinceto nad magisterij Bratovškove (With Tweezers over the Master's Thesis by Alenka Bratušek), Delo, 26 February 2013 Her work has 88 pages with 34 listed sources, but journalists only counted 11 that had been cited; among them were also internal documents of the company Javni gospodarski zavod Brdo, where she was member and later chair of the management board. Slovenske novice journalists also went through her work and wrote that Bratušek plagiarized one page from the work of another author (regarding Gøsta Esping-Andersen's classification of welfare) without proper citation. Her alma mater, the Faculty of Social Sciences, started an investigation regarding alleged plagiarism. The investigating commission concluded that \\"Bratušek in her master's thesis had used works of other authors contrary to current citation methods, but based on critically evaluation of collected material and sources it can not be expertly and scientifically established that the thesis is not a result of her work.\\" Political career In 2006 she ran in local elections on the list of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) and was elected to the Kranj city council . In 2008, Bratušek unsuccessfully ran for Parliament on the list of the Social Liberal party Zares. At the next local elections, in 2010, she switched allegiance, this time to Hermina Krt's List (Lista Hermine Krt) and was once again elected to the Kranj city council. In the 2011 early parliamentary elections, she was elected on the list of the Positive Slovenia party. During her parliamentary tenure she was the chairperson of the parliamentary Committee for Budget Control. On 17 January 2013, Bratušek was elected as president of the Positive Slovenia party after its leader and founder Zoran Janković temporarily renounced all functions in the party following allegations raised by the official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption report. Also following the report, center-right leader Janez Janša's government received a vote of no confidence. On 10 September 2014 Bratušek was nominated to be one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission under the Junker Presidency, but her nomination was rejected on 8 October 2014, mostly due to her lack of experience. =Prime minister= Alenka Bratušek meeting with Pope Francis On 27 February, Bratušek was elected prime minister-designate to form a new government of Slovenia. The center-right Slovenian Democratic Party responded by tweeting about \\"her government lasting no longer than her skirt's length\\".Politics and mini- skirts, Delo, 24 February 2013 (In the event, Alenka Bratušek served as prime minister from March 2013 until April 2014.) Gregor Virant welcomed the outcome of the vote, stating that it would enable Slovenia to move forward. Foreign media thought that it would be difficult for Bratušek to form a new government and questioned whether she would continue with the reforms initiated by Janša's government. A new parliamentary majority, formed by PS and the Social Democrats, was formed. On 20 March, Bratušek formed a government. During her tenure, she presided over the construction of the first mosque in the country. In seeking to avoid a financial bailout her government won a vote of confidence by 50 to 31 on 15 November. On 29 April 2014 she resigned from Positive Slovenia, after losing the party leadership to Zoran Janković on 26 April. Following this development, Bratušek announced her resignation as prime minister, to take effect on 5 May 2014. On 5 May, she officially submitted her resignation letter, triggering discussions about a snap election later in 2014. She became the first Slovenian prime minister to resign from office; her resignation took effect on 8 May. On 31 May 2014 she formed her own party Alliance of Alenka Bratušek (Zavezništvo Alenke Bratušek; ZaAB). At the following election in July, ZaAB won four seats in the National Assembly, including one for Bratušek. =European Commission= In her final days as prime minister, Bratušek nominated herself for the position of Vice-President of the European Commission under the Junker Presidency, but on 8 October 2014, following a difficult confirmation hearing before the European Parliament, her nomination was rejected, with 122 out of 135 votes against her nomination. Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar nominated another applicant, Slovenian entrepreneur Violeta Bulc. Family life Bratušek lives with her partner in Kranj. She has a son and a daughter.Interview with Alenka Bratušek, Siol.net, 11 March 2012, accessed 28 January 2013, archived by WebCite at www.webcitation.org/6E0Kb7AZv Her son, Oskar Cvjetičanin, is a footballer and plays for Southampton academy.

Controversies In 2012 she shot a music video for her second song titled \\"Klink revolution\\" in which she blatantly criticizes the reigning political class of Lebanon. The video featured Klink in tight, revealing leather clothes holding a machine gun in a cemetery. Both a priest and a sheikh have filed two legal cases against Klink for filming in a cemetery, saying that she has defiled the sanctity of the dead. The religious figures forced Lebanese OTV channel's variety show \\"Sorry Bas\\" to cut Klink's video after airing it. In December 2012 Klink announced that she will run for the Lebanese parliamentary elections of June 2013. During a January 2013 interview she discussed a number of her positions including her support for the amendment of the current nationality law that forbids foreign husbands of Lebanese wives and their children from obtaining Lebanese citizenship. She also supports civil marriage as an option and the setting up of temporary camps for Syrian refugees, and eventually doing away with sectarian quotas in the government. Klink justified Hizbollah's attachment to its arms but condemned the party for using its military strength against other Lebanese factions and citizens. In 2013, Myriam participated in Al Jadeed TV's reality show al-za'im (الزعيم) where young candidates to the Lebanese parliamentary elections showcase their agendas. Klink was visiting the Beirut suburb of hay-al-sellom where a firecracker was thrown to her face resulting in respiratory injury and the transportation of Klink to a medical facility. In August 2013, Myriam claimed through her Facebook profile that she caught a couple having sex in her garden. She alleged that she threatened the couple at gunpoint, shooting a hunting gun in the air to startle them from their intimate position. The incident was also heavily mediatized. Shortly after the trespassing incident, Klink faced criticism again when she announced that she named her donkey \\"Fairuz\\", after the famous Lebanese singer. In October 2013, Klink strongly criticized the Arabs' Got Talent jury members for admitting a participant whose talent was eating live snakes to the next round. Myriam, who's an animal welfare activist, called the talent show participant a beast and wished he ate the jury members instead. The already strained relationship between Klink and fellow model Joelle Hatem intensified when Klink criticized the acts of the Lebanese Forces militia during the Lebanese Civil War causing the two models to engage in mutual public swearing and defamation. The debate rose again to public attention in December 2013 when Klink threatened to release a sex tape of Hatem with her unnamed ex-boyfriend. Hatem denied Klink's claims stating that such footage does not exist. The two models have filed lawsuits against one another. In the aftermath of the Alexa winter storm of December 2013, Myriam announced that she will pose for a nude photoshoot in the snow as a statement of solidarity with the refugees of the Syrian conflict living in makeshift camps in Lebanon. Further to her announcement, Myriam was quoted in a message to her Facebook followers expressing her wish to spend a night in a Syrian refugee tent during the storm to relieve the displaced Syrians pain. During the long-delayed Lebanese presidential election held on October 31, 2016, one member of Parliament anonymously voted for Myriam Klink, drawing laughter. Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri ruled her vote invalid because \\"She's Orthodox\\", alluding to Lebanese political tradition of selecting a Maronite Catholic for President. (Michel Aoun was ultimately elected.) In February 2017 Klink along with another Lebanese singer Jad Khalife released a controversial music video titled \\"Goal\\", the video then was banned by the country's justice ministry due to the appearance of a little girl dancing with Klink on the bed, the presence of the little girl amounted to child “exploitation.” as the lyrics of the song include several sexual innuendos. Personal life Klink was born to a Lebanese father and Serbian mother.

Antill owned a 370-acre plantation with meadows, an orchard, and a vineyard of 800 vines for which he received an award from London's Royal Society of Arts in 1767. On June 10, 1739, Edward Antill married Anne Morris (1706-1781), the daughter of Lewis Morris (1671-1746), the Royal Governor of New Jersey. There would be six children from this marriage, of which two sons who would serve as officers in Continental Army during the American Revolution. Their children included: * Edward Antill (1742–1789), who married Charlotte Riverin in 1767. * John Antill (1744–1816), who married Margaret Colden (–1789), daughter of Alexander Colden. After Margaret's death, he married her younger sister, Jane Colden. Edward Antill died on August 15, 1770 and buried the following day near the southeast corner of the churchyard at Christ Church in New Brunswick.Church records of Christ Church, New Brunswick record the event: \\"The Honble Edward Antill Esqr was interred in X Ch. Yard in N. B. Aug 16, 70.\\" =Residence= On his 370-acre plantation at Raritan Landing, he constructed a large home in the Georgian and Dutch Colonial style in 1739. This house, also known later as Ross Hall, was destroyed in 1954. The plantation consisted of an estimated 40 acres of meadow, 100 acres in timber, and a large orchard of 500 apple trees. He grew apples trees for a distillery on the site, and built a large brewhouse, 60-feet by 38 feet, with copper boiler pot holding 22 barrels.Nelson, William. \\"Edward Antill and Some of his Descendants\\" in Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical SocietyAntill offered the property for sale in The New-York Gazette, Revived in the Weekly Post-Boy (December 11, 1752).Weiss, Harry B. and Weiss, Grace M. \\"The Early Breweries of New Jersey\\" in Proceedings of the New Jersey Agricultural Society (1963).

The Vice President's Room is a room in the United States Capitol. Added during the 1850s expansion of the Capitol, it serves as an office for the Vice President when they are in the Capitol. History The United States Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States to serve as president of the Senate and to cast the tie- breaking vote in the case of a deadlock. To carry out these duties, the vice president has long had an office in the Capitol Building, just outside the Senate chamber. Due to lack of space in the Capitol's old Senate wing, early vice presidents often shared their room with the president. Following the 1850s extension of the building, the Senate formally set aside a room for the vice president's exclusive use. John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky was the first to occupy the new Vice President's Room (S–214), after he gavelled the Senate into session in its new chamber in 1859. Over the years, S–214 has provided a convenient place for the vice president to conduct business while at the Capitol. Until the Russell Senate Office Building opened in 1909, this room was the only space in the city officially assigned to the vice president, and it served as the sole working office for many vice presidents including Hannibal Hamlin, Chester Arthur, and Theodore Roosevelt. Several notable events have occurred in the Vice President's Room over the years. In 1875 Henry Wilson, Ulysses S. Grant's vice president, died in the room after suffering a stroke. Six years later, following President James Garfield's assassination, Vice President Chester Arthur took the presidential oath of office here with two former presidents, Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, among those attending the ceremony. In 1919, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall signed the constitutional amendment bill that would grant nationwide suffrage to women once ratified by the states. On April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry S. Truman was on the House side of the Capitol when he received a telephone call informing him to come immediately to the White House. David McCullough wrote in Truman that the vice president \\"ran through the echoing old Crypt, past the Senate barber shop, then up a flight of stairs with brass banisters to his office—to get his hat.\\" This marked Truman's last action as vice president. When he arrived at the White House he learned that Franklin Roosevelt had died. The proximity of the Vice President's Room to the Senate chamber allows the vice president easy access to the members when the Senate is in session. For over 125 years, the room has provided an elegant and convenient setting for ceremonial functions, informal party caucuses, press briefings, and private meetings. Decorative arts The Vice President's Room was initially furnished in a modest style. Few of those original pieces exist today, but the marble mantel and colorful Minton floor tiles manufactured in England are both part of the room's first decoration. Many of the room's present furnishings, such as the ornate gilded mirror and the matching Victorian window cornices, date to the late 19th century. Of all the 19th century vice presidents who occupied this room, none affected its style and decoration as significantly as Garret Augustus Hobart, who won election with William McKinley in 1896. Senate vouchers detail his purchases of imported silk mohair carpeting, Neapolitan silk curtains, numerous Persian throw rugs, and “a silk velour slumber robe” made to order to match the velour cushions on his office sofa. The double-pedestal, mahogany desk in the room is sometimes referred to as the “Wilson desk,” due to erroneous associations with President Woodrow Wilson and with Vice President Henry Wilson. Every vice president from Hobart to Lyndon Johnson used the desk. In 1969 it was loaned to the White House and served as the Oval Office desk for Presidents Nixon and Ford. It was returned to the Senate in 1977. The Senate purchased the floor clock in 1898 from Washington jeweler Harris and Schafer for $600. Vice President John Nance Garner used the clock to time his entrance into the Senate chamber. As the chimes began to ring fifteen seconds before the clock struck twelve, Garner would stop whatever he was doing and walk to the chamber, reaching his seat precisely at noon. The small gilded mirror has been displayed in the room since the completion of the Senate extension in 1859. It was most likely transferred from the old Senate wing. Although various legends attribute the mirror's original ownership to Dolley Madison or John Adams, no documentation exists, and the mirror's origin remains a mystery. The ornately carved rosewood cabinet dates from the late 19th century. Some call it the “John Nance Garner Liquor Cabinet,” because of its association with Franklin D. Roosevelt's first vice president, who invited visitors to “strike a blow for liberty” with its contents. Among the objects currently displayed on its shelves is a sterling silver desk set that was presented by the Senate to Vice President Adlai Stevenson in 1897, and recently donated to the Senate by former Illinois Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III. Fine arts In 1885, the Senate voted to place a marble bust of Henry Wilson in the Vice President's Room, to honor one of the Senate's most popular presiding officers. Before being elected vice president, Wilson had served as a senator from Massachusetts from 1855 to 1873. He played an important role during the Civil War, as chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, and throughout his career championed legislation to aid the working class. The Wilson bust served as the genesis for the Senate's Vice Presidential Bust Collection, displayed in the Senate chamber gallery and on the second floor of the Capitol's Senate wing.

Background  The content of The Round Table was mostly taken from Hunt and Hazlitt's contributions to The Examiner, a newspaper which Hunt edited. The material for the first volume was sent to the printer as a collection of newspaper cuttings.Wu 2008, p. 184. The process of publishing the collection had begun in late 1815, but much of the following year was lost to delays caused by its Edinburgh-based publisher, Archibald Constable, who doubted that a collection of newspaper articles would have much success.Wu 2008, p. 185. The two volumes were finally published on 14 February 1817, and were sold at the price of fourteen shillings.Wu 2008, p. 209. Sales were slow, and the text was not reprinted during Hazlitt's lifetime.Wu 2008, p. 210. The essays covered subjects such as art, literature and theatre, and Hunt contributed several essays about ordinary subjects such as washerwomen and the joys of spending time by the fireside.  Reception  The Round Table was received favourably by the poet John Keats. As with many of Hazlitt's works, it received a very negative assessment from the Quarterly Review.Wu 2008, p. 211. In appraising the work, the reviewers deliberately confused the lighthearted essays written by Hunt with those by Hazlitt. Hunt's essays—particularly the chapter on washerwomen—would be derided by the Quarterly Review and Blackwood's Magazine for years after The Round Table's publication.Jones 1991, p. 209.

History Two years after the completion of the construction of the Neu-Ulm–Kempten railway in 1863, the citizens of Wangen campaigned for a cross-border line connecting the Bavarian Allgäu railway with the new line in Memmingen. Since this proposal lacked political support, the plans came to nothing and the Württemberg Allgäu Railway was opened through the Württemberg Allgäu in various stages until 1880. Nevertheless, there continued to be support for a connection to Bavarian Swabia and Upper Bavaria. In 1876 and 1886 there were further proposals from Memmingen for building a direct connection to Lindau through Württemberg. The second proposal resulted in negotiations between the two countries, although this was initially unsuccessful because Bavaria insisted on responsibility for the management of the entire line to Lindau. However, starting in 1870, the German military increasingly urged the closure of the last gaps in the railway between the garrisons in southern Bavaria and Württemberg and southern Alsace, finally leading to the signing of a treaty in 1887. After nearly three years of construction, the line from Leutkirch im Allgäu to Memmingen was opened on 2 October 1889. Leutkirch was connected to the existing Württemberg Allgäu Railway from Aulendorf via Kißlegg to Wangen and Isny. A new “wedge” station (Keilbahnhof) was built at Leutkirch. The military was involved in the implementation: the tracks in the Württemberg area were commissioned for the Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergischen Staats- Eisenbahnen) by members of the Berlin railway regiment; its exercises sometimes involved participation in civil construction projects.Mayer: 125 Jahre Bahnhof Leutkirch. 1998, p. 101. The closure of the second gap at a border between Wangen and Hergatz on 15 July 1890 finally created an alternative connection to the Bavarian Allgäu Railway from Munich and Augsburg to Lindau via Buchloe, with the newer route through Württemberg shorter than the older Bavarian Allgäu Railway via Kempten. Route \\"Bird's eye view of Leutkirch–Memmingen railway“, postcard by Eugen Felle, 1909 The railway line connecting the two endpoints of Leutkirch im Allgäu and Memmingen are not direct, but instead have two long curves. At the start of the line at Leutkirch station it turns northwest to the now disused Unterzeil station and then swings back sharply to the northeast towards Memmingen, passing through the stations of Altmannshofen and Aichstetten. This curve came about due to the interest of the Earl of Waldburg-Zeil in having a rail link to Unterzeil, which lies below Zeil Castle.Mayer: 125 Jahre Bahnhof Leutkirch. 1998, p. 86. Aichstetten Shell siding is served daily by tankers hauled by private locomotives. Shortly after Aichstetten, the line turns north again and runs directly line to the stations of Marstetten-Aitrach, Mooshausen, which has been disused since the 1970s, and Tannheim. At Tannheim the track takes another sharp turn to the east and crosses the Iller on a large viaduct; at this point the border runs along the river. On the Bavarian side the line passes through Buxheim station, which is now also closed, before making a wide curve to the south of Memmingen, the end of the line. Even this so-called Tannheim Arc (Tannheimer Bogen) has political origins: the route was originally selected at the wishes of the Earl of Waldbott von Bassenheim of Buxheim and the Earl of Schaesberg in Tannheim, who also wanted connections to the railway.Breubeck: Die Eisenbahn in Mittelschwaben. 1999, p. 152. Operations Between Memmingen and Mooshausen Railway bridge over the Iller canal near Tannheim Buxheim railway bridge The line is operated by Regionalbahn trains of the Aulendorf–Kißlegg–Memmingen–Ulm route every two hours. It is also served by EuroCity trains on the Zürich–Bregenz–Lindau–Memmingen–Buchloe–Munich route (EC 190/191, EC 192/193, EC 194/195 and EC 196/197). =Freight= From 1958 to 1995, 200 tons of oil from the oil field of Mönchsrot was loaded daily at Tannheim station on tanker cars and carried to Memmingen. In the summer season gravel trains run and trains also serve the large Shell tank farm in Aichstetten-Altmann, which forms part of the German strategic oil reserve. Future On 15 February 2008, the German Minister of Transport, Wolfgang Tiefensee and his Swiss counterpart, Moritz Leuenberger signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Memmingen agreeing to upgrade the Munich–Lindau railway and electrify it between the current ends of electrification at Geltendorf and Lindau-Aeschach. The Leutkirch–Memmingen line is part of the upgraded line. The MoU was followed on 18 December 2008 by a statement on its financing. This project is related to the construction of the Gotthard Base Tunnel. In particular, Switzerland wants the Munich–Buchloe–Memmingen–Lindau–Bregenz route to be a feeder line for the new route. The upgrade will allow a reduction in times for passenger trains between Munich and Zurich from four hours to only three hours. Work was originally expected to begin in 2010 and it was expected to be completed in 2015. The electrification of the line and its upgrade for tilting trains was originally estimated to cost the federal government about €210 million. Bavaria would provide finance of €55 million and Switzerland would have granted an interest-free loan of €50 million. The Swiss loan in expected to be granted in spite of the delay as the deadline for all access routes of the Gotthard Base Tunnel has been extended by five years. On 18 October 2012, Deutsche Bahn announced that the start of construction would be delayed indefinitely because of unexpected increases in costs of €88 million, raising total costs to €298 million. As a result, there would have to be new funding negotiations. Moreover, Deutsche Bahn does not currently have a long-distance train that is equipped with tilting technology and is approved to run on this route. So rolling stock using Swiss technology would be allowed to operate on the route. =The controversial Tannheim Arc= Plans for a possible relocation of the route cutting off the Tannheim Arc came up for discussion in 2009. According to the proposal, which was not approved, a new route would have roughly followed the route of the disused branch line to Legau from Memmingen to directly connect with Aichstetten, running south of Dickenreishausen and crossing the Iller near Illerbeuren. The Bavarian Ecological Democratic Party, citizens of Buxheim and Memmingen’s Mayor Ivo Holzinger, in particular, were in favour of the proposed bypass of part of Württemberg. The municipality of Buxheim sees itself as most affected by the intensification of traffic and the associated noise levels because the town itself—now a suburb of Memmingen—has now spread close to the line. The municipalities of Tannheim and Aitrach fought successfully against this proposal since its implementation would have meant that the railway would have cut through them.

Biography Born in Vienna, Matthias Fletzberger was accepted at the age of 5 as a student of the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.
