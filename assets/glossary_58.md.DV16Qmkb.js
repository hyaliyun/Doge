Born in New Zealand of Fijian descent, he represented the Fiji national team, winning one cap in 2003. He was a utility back who played for the Blues in the Super Rugby competition and Auckland in the Air New Zealand Cup. He moved to Leinster in 2008, and over two spells won four European Cups, and captained the team to European Champions Cup and Pro14 titles in his final season. He retired from playing at the end of the 2017-2018 season. He took a two-year break from playing from 2013 to 2015, when he returned to New Zealand and had a coaching role with the Blues. Career New Zealand Nacewa was one of the stand-out players for Auckland in their 2005 NPC-winning season, Nacewa is a speedy and versatile player who can play as an outside back or centre. He also proved that he can play as a first five-eighth when he covered successfully for the injured Luke McAlister during the 2006 Super 14 season. In the 2007 Super 14 coach David Nucifora trialled him in their first match against the Crusaders at Fly-half in place of first-choice Luke McAlister who was out because of an injury. Nacewa played so well that Nucifora decided to play him at number 10 and when McAlister returned he was placed in his favourite position at inside centre to cater for Nacewa. The Blues defeated the defending champions and Nacewa scored 19 points. In the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup, Nacewa was voted the player of the tournament after guiding his Auckland team to another thrilling victory and thus winning the coveted Air New Zealand Cup in another thriller defeating finalist Wellington. He has won the Air New Zealand Cup 3 times with Auckland in 2003, 2005, and 2007. International career Born and raised in New Zealand, Nacewa qualified to play for Fiji through his ancestral links. He was included in Fiji's squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and came on as a substitute against Scotland for less than 3 minutes, not touching the ball. In 2006, he quit the Fiji national team as he wanted his eligibility changed from Fiji to New Zealand. But due to IRB law, his appearance for Fiji in the World Cup made him ineligible for the All Blacks, Nacewa considered legal advice to persuade the IRB to annul his Fiji cap, however the IRB has since ruled that Nacewa is a Fijian citizen and has played for Fiji during the 2003 Rugby World Cup, making him only eligible to play for Fiji. According to media reports in October 2009, Nacewa was sounded out about the possibility of again playing for Fiji on their tour to Europe, but he rebuffed these approaches to retain his focus on club rugby with Leinster. Nacewa could have qualified for Ireland (under residency), had he not already played for Fiji.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/isa-nacewa-will-go-down-in-history-as- the-best-irish-rugby-import-pshcmkm2d Leinster In 2008 he moved to Ireland to represent Leinster Rugby, scoring a try in his opening game for the province. However, he suffered a setback when he sustained a broken arm in the win over the Ospreys on 19 September, a game in which he scored two drop goals. He returned for the later stages of the Heineken Cup pool stages and played on the right wing in the quarter-final victory over Harlequins but moved to full-back for the semi-final against Munster with great success. The Irish Times said of his performance \\"Nacewa's selection at fullback was vindicated for his stunning line and pass for D‚ÄôArcy's opening try. But there was so much more than that as well: his security and strength at the back, his counter-attacking runs, his passing and kicking\\". He retained his place at full-back for the Heineken Cup final on 23/5/09, keeping Ireland first-choice and Lions tourist Rob Kearney on the bench, and contributed well to Leinster's 19‚Äì16 victory. In the 2009/2010 season, Nacewa alternated between full-back and wing but was almost ever-present in the starting Leinster XV. Rumours circulated that Nacewa was contemplating a return to the Fijian national team when they toured Ireland and Britain in November 2009; however Nacewa himself rejected this. In the 2010/2011 season, Nacewa established himself as one of the finest full-backs in Europe with eye-catching displays for Leinster in their Heineken Cup run, scoring two tries in the pool stages as well as a brilliant solo effort in the quarter-final against Leicester. Following that game, his Leinster colleague, Gordon D'Arcy said of Nacewa; ‚ÄúIt gets kind of boring when he's that good. He's probably one of the best players I‚Äôve played with in any shape, way or form.\\" Nacewa picked up his second Heineken Cup winners medal after playing a key role in Leinster's second-half comeback against Northampton at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. On an individual level, Nacewa was named both the Irish Rugby Union Players' Association (IRUPA) and the Leinster Rugby Player of the Year, as well as being chosen as full-back on the 'Magners League Dream Team' for 2011 and was shortlisted for the ERC European Player of the Year, losing out to his Leinster colleague, Se√°n O'Brien. He was included for the Barbarians' match against Wales starting at fullback. He scored 2 tries, one of which came in the final minute to give the Barbarians a win. Following that game, speculation arose that Nacewa would play for Fiji at the 2011 World Cup, however it was later confirmed by the Fiji rugby union that he would not make himself available, citing family commitments . Doubts were raised about his future at Leinster after the IRFU announced a new policy restricting non-Irish players in December 2011. However, in April 2012, it was announced that Nacewa had signed an extension to his contract which will see him remain with Leinster until the end of the 2013/14 season. Nacewa ended the 2011/12 season with his third Heineken Cup winners medal after featuring on the wing for most of the campaign. He gained the distinction of not only playing every match but also every minute of the campaign. The season ended on a disppointing note as Leinster lost out in the RaboDirect Pro12 Grand Final to the Ospreys on 27 May, despite two tries by Nacewa. Nacewa goes into a tackle in the 2012 Heineken Cup Final Retirement On 20 March 2013, it was reported in the Irish Times that Nacewa would finish his career and return to New Zealand at the end of the 2012‚Äì2013 season, despite having a year left on his contract. Family reasons were cited as being behind his decision. This was confirmed on the Leinster Rugby website later that day. Nacewa played his last game on 25 May 2013 at full-back in the 24‚Äì18 win over Ulster in the RaboDirect Pro12 final against Ulster at the RDS, collecting the fifth trophy of his Leinster career in the process. After retirement, he joined the NZ ITM Cup commentating team for Sky NZ. Coaching In November 2013, it was announced that Nacewa would be returning to the Auckland Blues as mental skills coach for the 2014 Super Rugby season. Nacewa said at the time ‚ÄúMy role involves getting the players‚Äô mental space right going into trainings and games and upskilling them on the discipline and attributes needed to be winners, not just talented players,‚Äù Return to Leinster Rugby In April 2015, he signed a one-year contract to play for Leinster. He made his return for Leinster against Edinburgh Rugby in the 2015-16 Pro 12 season kicking 9 points. The following week, he was the stand-in captain and he kicked 13 points to help Leinster beat Cardiff Blues. He played at fullback in both games. Nacewa extended his contract and was installed as the Leinster Captain for the 2015/16 season. Nacewa was named captain of the Pro 12 team of the season as he led Leinster to the top of Pro 12 table and the final at Murrayfield where they were defeated by Connacht Rugby 20-10. In September 2017, Nacewa and teammate Jamison Gibson-Park were denied entry to South Africa due to newly created restrictions that required citizens of New Zealand to obtain a visa. The pair had been due to play two matches for Leinster in the Pro14 against the Southern Kings and the Cheetahs. On 24 April 2018, it was announced that Nacewa would be retiring at the end of the 2017/2018 season and would be returning to New Zealand. On 12 May 2018, Nacewa kicked the match-winning penalty in Leinster's 15-12 defeat of Racing 92, in the European Rugby Champions Cup final, gaining a record-equalling fourth win as a player in the competition.

Brown in his final film appearance. It is a blend of comedy and horror which features several cast members from Tales of Terror, made by AIP the year before. Plot In the New England town of New Gilead during the late 19th century, an unscrupulous drunkard named Waldo Trumbull (Vincent Price) runs the funeral parlor he acquired from his former business partner Amos Hinchley (Boris Karloff) after marrying his daughter Amaryllis (Joyce Jameson). Trumbull enlists the assistance of a fugitive picklock named Felix Gillie (Peter Lorre) in conducting his business cheaply by reusing the firm's only coffin to unceremoniously dump the deceased while arranging the occasional murder of wealthy clients. Trumbull, being emotionally abusive to Amaryllis while attempting to poison the now-senile Hinchley under the guise of giving him medicine, ultimately wastes his money on alcohol as clientele is dwindling. Trumbull decides to profit from gentleman shipping merchant Mr. Phipps after being threatened with eviction by his landlord John F. Black (Rathbone) if he does not produce the long-overdue rent. Trumbull forces Gillie to get him into the Phipps estate, smothering the old man in his sleep and then making a fortuitous return the following morning to get the job of burying him. But Trumbull is livid to learn on the day of the funeral that Phipps's attractive young wife had left town with her husband's fortune without even paying for the funerary expenses. Trumbull decides to murder Black after receiving a final warning for rent, having Gillie enter through the upstairs window of Black's estate. Gillie ends up in Black's bedroom as the man was reading from Shakespeare's Macbeth and forced to run out when spotted, causing Black to suffer a heart attack with the physician pronouncing him dead. But Trumbull and Gillie, after taking him to the funeral parlor, are unaware that Black suffers from catalepsy as he awakens in the cellar due to his cat allergy and recognizes Gillie. After attempting to keep Black from running off as he collapses from another heart attack, Trumbull and Gillie place him in the coffin with the former knocking out Black when he came to and struggles to get out of it. Following a successive funeral, the supposedly deceased Black is placed in his family crypt with Trumbull celebrating his ill gotten fortune. At that time, having feelings for Amaryllis and tired of being bossed around, Gillie convinces her that they should leave Trumbull so she can live her dream of becoming an opera singer. But Black regains consciousness at that time and returns to the funeral parlor while quoting random Macbeth lines, grabbing an axe and causing Amaryllis to faint. Black then chases Trumbull and Gillie around the house with the latter knocked unconscious after falling down a flight of stairs before Black is seemingly killed by Trumbull, Black giving a lengthy monologue before finally dying. Amaryllis comes down and assumes Trumbull to have murdered Gillie before being strangled by him when she threatens of reporting him to the authorities. Gillie awakens soon after and vengefully attacks Trumbull in a comical swordfight before being knocked out again with a poker. Mr. Black's servant arrives to report Black's sighting in the town before seeing the dead bodies and runs off for the police. A depressed Trumbull collapses in a semi-conscious heap on the floor by the stairs, failing to realize Amaryllis is still alive as she wakes Gillie and the two proceed to elope. Hinchley, who had slept through everything, comes down stairs and gives Trumbull the vial of \\"medicine\\" to sober him up. Trumbull sobers up once realizing he drank his own poison, dramatically dropping dead as an oblivious Hinchley returns to bed while regretting not getting a sip of his own \\"medicine\\". It would be after Trumbull's death that the family cat Cleopatra walks over to Black, confirming him to still be alive when his allergy acts up. Main cast * Vincent Price as Waldo Trumbull * Peter Lorre as Felix Gillie * Boris Karloff as Amos Hinchley * Basil Rathbone as John F. Black, Esq. * Joyce Jameson as Amaryllis Trumbull * Joe E. Brown as the Cemetery Keeper * Beverly Powers (credited as Beverly Hills) as Mrs. Phipps * Alan DeWitt as Riggs * Buddy Mason as Mr. Phipps * Douglas Williams as the Doctor * Linda Rogers as Phipps' Maid * Luree Holmes as Black's Servant * Rhubarb the cat as Cleopatra Production The film was a follow-up to The Raven, meant to reunite Vincent Price, Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff. The producers' original intention was for Karloff to play the part of the ceaselessly spry old landlord, Mr. Black, but, by the time production was set to begin, they realized that it would have been difficult (if not impossible) for Karloff to perform the physical requirements of the role, due to persistent back and leg problems which had worsened with age. So, Karloff traded roles with Basil Rathbone, and instead played Amaryllis' elderly father, Mr. Hinchley. Richard Matheson later said he was \\"proud of that picture and of the fact that I got AIP [American International Pictures] to hire Tourner [sic]. Earlier on, I had asked for Tourner [sic] on one of my Twilight Zones... They said, 'Well, he's a movie director. I don't think he can handle this time schedule' . . . As I recall, he did the shortest shooting schedule of anyone‚Äîtwenty-eight hours. He had this book with every shot in it and detailed notes. He knew exactly what he was doing every inch of the way. He was so organized.\\" Release The movie was not a big success at the box office. Matheson: > It didn't lose any money. They [AIP] told me that the title itself cost them > a lot. It's such a contradiction in terms, though. Terror sells and comedy > makes them go away, so it's like they're walking in two directions at once. > But I thought it was very clever to do a take off of Shakespeare's, Comedy > of Errors.... I think they were probably sorry they didn't use a Poe title, > because Poe had a certain marketability. I guess they couldn't figure out > how to market it. But it was the last one because I was getting tired of > writing about people being buried alive, so I decided to make a joke about > it. Reception Initial reception The Comedy of Terrors received mixed to negative reviews upon its initial release. Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote a scathing review, calling it \\"A musty, rusty bag of tricks rigged as a horror farce\\". Variety wrote that the film \\"leaves much to be desired. The raw material for a jovial spoof of chillers was there, but the comic restraint and perception necessary to capitalize on those natural resources is conspicuously missing.\\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times panned the film as \\"a series of predictable gags repeated ad infinitum, ad nauseum...I felt ashamed to watch once reputable actors hamming it up all over the place, making a mockery of whatever is left of their poor images.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. (January 23, 1964). \\"'Comedy of Terrors' Film Monstrosity\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 9. The Monthly Film Bulletin was somewhat positive, calling Price and Lorre \\"both splendid\\" and writing that Matheson's script \\"avoids the laxness which slowed down passages of The Raven, and constructs a soundly worked-out mechanism based on a minimum of running gags.\\" TV Guide awarded the film 2/5 stars, stating the \\"film is neither funny nor terrifying, and shows the fact that it was shot in 20 days on a 12-hour-a-day shooting schedule.\\" Later reception Later reviews of the film have been more positive. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, commending the film's cast. Paul Chambers from Movie Chambers.com gave the film a score B+, writing \\"An all-out horror comedy set in 19th century New England with some of the best names in the business. Besides Price, there's Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone and in a small, but funny, segment, Joe E. Brown.\\" Time Out London felt that the film came dangerously close to failing, and criticized the script. However, it commended the film's cast. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.28/10. Proposed sequel Richard Matheson wanted to write a sequel film for AIP called Sweethearts and Horrors, which was intended to star Price as a ventriloquist, Karloff as a children's TV host, Rathbone as a musical comedy star, Lorre as a magician and Tallulah Bankhead. However Comedy of Terrors was not a big hit so plans to make the followup were shelved. Novelisation A novelization of The Comedy of Terrors was written in 1964 by Elsie Lee, adapted from Richard Matheson's screenplay. It was published by Lancer Books in paperback (making certain changes in the story's ending).

Halvad sits on the banks of the Samatsar Pond. alt= Halvad was a former capital of the Dhrangadhra State and was ruled by the Jhala Rajputs. It is an ancient fortified town at the southern edge of the Little Rann of Kutch. The yellow earth of this semi-arid area and the buildings of local yellow sandstone make the whole town glow vibrant golden yellow during sunrise.http://www.morbionline.in/city-guide/halvad-near-morbi Halvad is close to the Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary at the Little Rann of Kutch. The Asiatic wild ass is a member of the horse family with striking white underparts and a deep mane. It is a strong and powerful runner. Other animals spotted here are nilgai and chinkara and the birds seen are the Indian sandgrouse, houbara bustard, lark, desert warbler, desert wheatear, Indian courser and vultures. Culture and Points of interest Halvad is protected by a temple of Shiva in all the directions. Halvad is also, called the Chota (small) Kashi of India. Names of temples around Halvad: * Sharaneshwer - Shiva temple located near Samantsit talab, http://www.sharneshwar.org/ * Bhavanibhuteshwar * Gaulokeshwar * Shabaleshwar * Kashivishwanath * Dholeshwar * Vaijnath * Jageshwar * world famous Naklank Guru Dham, shaktinagarhttp://www.naklankgurudham.com/ Chatris (15th-century structures) resemble the architecture of the smaller temple structures of Gujarat, with carved columns, high plinths and cobbled roofs in pyramidal shape. The vast arid landscape, dotted with chatris, makes a picturesque setting. At the edge of town, on the banks of the Samatsar lake, stands the finest example of the wooden architecture of the Royal Palaces of Gujarat. Other similar examples of palaces on the lake-shore in India are the palaces of Udaipur, Alwar, Datia and Mandu. The Halvad Palace Campus has all the elements of Rajput palaces - a zenana, a hall for public audience, a temple to the family goddess, a pleasure garden and administrative offices. The entry to the Halvad Palace is from the town. A beautifully carved entrance gate leads one to a huge courtyard. The formal square plan of two storied palace structure, adorned with exquisitely carved wooden columns, brackets, friezes and jalis with geometric patterns defines the courtyard. Four raised pathways, from the center of each side, meet in the middle of the courtyard at the base of the seven storied, octagonal tower, with jharokhas overlooking all eight directions. From the top of this tower, on a clear day, one can see the surrounding villages; therefore, it is popularly known as Jhalawad Darshan or EK-Dandia Mahal. The long facade, with carved stone jharokhas, brings in the cool breeze as it overlooks the lake. The jharokhas were the favorite sit-outs of the royal ladies, while on full moon nights the terrace was used for private royal gatherings. Even today, one can see beautiful carved sit-outs of sandstone on the terrace. In short, the architecture of the palace is a perfect synthesis of two natural materials, stone and wood. Halvad has four old step-wells and six Shiva temples encircling the town. The Bhavani Temple and the Bhuteshwar Mahadev at the cremation ground are at least 500 years old and are protected monuments. On the west bank of the Samatsar Lake, a famous pilgrim place of the Dawoodi Bohra community, the dargah of Maula Qazi, is located.Dargah of Maula Qazi Halvad is a village of Brahmins. Halvad is famous for gourmet Brahmins and heroic warriors, who fought against past invaders to protect their hometown. Today, one can see several cenotaphs and hero-stones built of sandstone at the edge of town. Paliyas (memorial stones) remind visitors of the bloody battles fought at the gates of Halvad. They evoke memories of women who committed sati to protect their honor and men who died fighting against enemies. Newly weds come here to perform the ritual of the untying of nuptial knots and pay homage to their ancestors. Even today, once a year, an unusual competition of Laddu eating is organised by the Brahmins of Halvad. Modern day development of Halvad is because of the brahmin community. They brought a lot of changes in local farming methods. Demographics India census, Halvad had a population of 26,026. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Halvad has an average literacy rate of 60%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy is 68% and female literacy is 51%. In Halvad, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.

The French title Histoires extraordinaires (translated to English as Extraordinary Stories) is from the first collection of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories translated by French poet Charles Baudelaire; the English title Spirits of the Dead is from an 1827 poem by Poe. American International Pictures distributed this horror anthology film featuring three Poe stories directed by European directors Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini. Jane Fonda, Alain Delon, Peter Fonda, Brigitte Bardot, and Terence Stamp are among the stars. The English-language version features narration by Vincent Price.Hughes, p.92f Plot summary \\"Metzengerstein\\" segment At the age of 22, Countess Frederique (Jane Fonda) inherits the Metzengerstein estate and lives a life of promiscuity and debauchery. While in the forest, her leg is caught in a trap and she is freed by her cousin and neighbor Baron Wilhelm (Peter Fonda), whom she has never met because of a long-standing family feud. She becomes enamored with Wilhelm, but he rejects her for her wicked ways. His rejection infuriates Frederique and she sets his stables on fire. Wilhelm is killed attempting to save his prized horses. One black horse somehow escapes and makes its way to the Metzengerstein castle. The horse is very wild and Frederique takes it upon herself to tame it. She notices at one point that a damaged tapestry depicts a horse eerily similar to the one that she has just taken in. Becoming obsessed with it, she orders its repair. During a thunderstorm, Frederique is carried off by the spooked horse into a fire caused by lightning that has struck. \\"William Wilson\\" segment In the early 19th century when Northern Italy is under Austrian rule, an army officer named William Wilson (Alain Delon) rushes to confess to a priest (in a church of the \\"Citt√† alta\\" of Bergamo) that he has committed murder. Wilson then relates the story of his cruel ways throughout his life. After playing cards all night against the courtesan Giuseppina (Brigitte Bardot), his doppelg√§nger, also named William Wilson, convinces people that Wilson has cheated. In a rage, the protagonist Wilson stabs the other to death with a dagger. After making his confession, Wilson commits suicide by jumping from the tower of \\"Palazzo della Ragione\\", but when seen his corpse is transfixed by the same dagger. \\"Toby Dammit\\" segment Former Shakespearean actor Toby Dammit (Terence Stamp) is losing his acting career to alcoholism. He agrees to work on a film, to be shot in Rome, for which he will be given a brand new Ferrari as a bonus incentive. Dammit begins to have unexpected visions of macabre girl with a white ball. While at a film award ceremony, he gets drunk and appears to be slowly losing his mind. A stunning woman (Antonia Pietrosi) comforts him, saying she will always be at his side if he chooses. Dammit is forced to make a speech, then leaves and takes delivery of his promised Ferrari. He races around the city, where he sees what appear to be fake people in the streets. Lost outside of Rome, Dammit eventually crashes into a work zone and comes to a stop before the site of a collapsed bridge. Across the ravine, he sees a vision of the little girl with a ball (whom he has earlier identified, in a TV interview, as his idea of the Devil). He gets into his car and speeds toward the void. The Ferrari disappears, and we then see a view of roadway with a thick wire across it, dripping with blood, suggesting Dammit has been decapitated. The girl from his vision picks up his severed head and the sun rises. Features music of Nino Rota and \\"Ruby\\" by Ray Charles, and is 37 minutes long.

Development Omnibus films were popular in Europe in the 1960s so producers Alberto Grimaldi and Raymond Eger developed the idea of film anthology influenced by the work of Edgar Allan Poe. Initial directors announced to work on the film included Luchino Visconti, Claude Chabrol, Joseph Losey and Orson Welles. Orson Welles would direct one segment based on both \\"Masque of the Red Death\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". Welles withdrew in September 1967 and was replaced by Fellini. The script, written in English by Welles and Oja Kodar, is in the Filmmuseum M√ºnchen collection.Cinefantastique (August 30, 2009) The final directors involved eventually became Federico Fellini, Roger Vadim and Louis Malle. Production Roger Vadim's segment \\"Metzengerstein\\" was filmed just after Vadim had completed shooting on his previous movie Barbarella, which also starred Jane Fonda. Scriptwriter and novelist Terry Southern, who had worked on the screenplay for Barbarella, travelled to Rome with Vadim and according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, it was during the making of this segment that Peter Fonda told Southern of his idea to make a 'modern Western' movie. Southern was enthusiastic about the idea and agreed to work on the project, which eventually became the renowned independent film Easy Rider.Lee Hill ‚Äì A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern (Bloomsbury, 2001) The segment was filmed in Roscoff, a small town in Brittany. Louis Malle accepted the job of directing the segment \\"William Wilson\\" in order to raise money for his next film Murmur of the Heart. The financial process of raising money for Murmur took him three years after completing \\"William Wilson\\" and in the meantime he shot two documentaries about India. Malle stated that he did not consider his collaboration in Histoires Extraordinaires a very personal one and that he agreed to make some compromises with the producer, Raymond Eger, in order to make the film more attractive to mainstream spectators. Malle's original conception of the film was closer to Poe‚Äôs tale than the final result. The most important changes were: casting Brigitte Bardot in the role of Giuseppina with the purpose of adding some erotic touches to the film, the inclusion of the dissection scene, and a somewhat explicit use of violence in some scenes.Mena Jos√© Luis and Cuesta Javier ‚Äì Diccionario de Cine (Edimat, 2004) Malle did not enjoy working with Delon. He wanted Florinda Bolkan for the female lead but the producers insisted on someone more well known, like Bardot. Bardot agreed to make the film; Malle thought she was miscast. Federico Fellini directed the segment \\"Toby Dammit\\" which he wrote with Bernardino Zapponi. Zapponi had a love for gothic literature which can be seen in his short story collection Gobal (1967) where he attempted to re-shape the genre into a contemporary setting. Zapponi's stories caught Fellini's attention. Fellini was particularly interested in C'√® una voce nella mia vita (\\"There is a voice in my life\\"), which was his first choice in adapting into a film for Spirits of the Dead. The producers were reluctant to have Zapponi's name on the film, so Fellini changed his mind and returned to Poe for inspiration. Fellini considered \\"The Scythe of Time\\" and \\"The Premature Burial\\", but eventually chose \\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\". Zapponi and Fellini only used the ending of the story in their adaptation of the material. The film has thematic similarities to three earlier Fellini films. The disintegrating protagonist and the hellish celebrity demimonde he inhabits are reminiscent of both La Dolce Vita and 8¬Ω, while the interweaving of dreams and hallucinations into the plotline and the use of highly artificial art direction to reflect inner states resemble similar techniques used in 8¬Ω and Juliet of the Spirits.George Porcari ‚Äì Fellini's Forgotten Masterpiece: Toby Dammit (CineAction Magazine, January 2007) Fellini rejected Poe's version of the devil, a lame old gentleman with his hair parted in front like a girl‚Äôs, and cast a 22 yr old Russian woman (Marina Yaru) to play the devil as a young girl. Lending a \\"pedophiliac slant\\"Kezich, Tullio (2006). Fellini: His Life and Work (New York: Faber and Faber), 284. to Toby's character, Fellini explained that \\"a man with a black cape and a beard was the wrong kind of devil for a drugged, hipped actor. His devil must be his own immaturity, hence, a child.\\"Alpert, Hollis (1988). Fellini: A Life (New York: Paragon), 197. Release Spirits of the Dead opened in Paris in June 1968. Spirits of the Dead was released in Italy on September 12, 1968 in Italy where the film was distributed by P.E.A. It grossed a total of 512 million Italian lira on its domestic release in Italy. Samuel Z. Arkoff offered the producers $200,000 for American International Pictures to have the US and Canadian rights, but was knocked back as Arkoff wanted to cut a scene from the Fellini sequence. A year later the producers had not been able to find another buyer so when Arkoff made the same offer they took it.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p276 The film was released in the United States on July 23, 1969. In the UK the film was retitled Tales of Mystery and released in 1973. Critical reception The film received a mixed critical reception, with the Fellini segment widely regarded as the best of the three. Reviewing the picture under its English language title Spirits of the Dead, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \\"Toby Dammit, the first new Fellini to be seen here since Juliet of the Spirits in 1965, is marvelous: a short movie but a major one. The Vadim is as overdecorated and shrill as a drag ball, but still quite fun, and the Malle, based on one of Poe's best stories, is simply tedious.\\"Canby, Vincent.

Sinhalese architecture also displays many ancient North Indian influences. Buddhism had a significant influence on Sri Lankan architecture after it was introduced to the island in the 3rd century BC, and ancient Sri Lankan architecture was mainly religious, with more than 25 styles of Buddhist monasteries.Pieris K (2006), Architecture and landscape in ancient and medieval Lanka Significant buildings include the stupas of Jetavanaramaya and Ruwanvelisaya in the Anuradhapura kingdom and further in the Polonnaruwa Kingdom (11th‚Äì13th centuries). The palace of Sigiriya is considered a masterpiece of ancient architecture and ingenuity, and the fortress in Yapahuwa and the Temple of the tooth in Kandy are also notable for their architectural qualities. Ancient Sri Lankan architecture is also significant to sustainability, notably Sigiriya which was designed as an environmentally friendly structure. Monasteries were designed using the Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra, a manuscript which outlines the layout of the structure. The text is in Sanskrit but written in Sinhala script. The script is believed to be from the 5th century, It is exclusively about Buddhist monasteries and is clearly from the Mahayana school. The text shows much originality and there is nothing similar in the existing Indian treatises, which deal only with Hindu temples. Buddhist architecture in Sri Lanka Cave temples Dambulla Cave Temple The earliest evidence of rudimentary cave temples are found in Mihintale, a unique feature in these caves was the use of a drip ledge carved along the top edge of the rock ceiling which stopped rain water running into the cave. With time doors, windows and walls of brick or stone were added. The roof and walls were plastered white and finished with decorative paintings, these are evident in the cave temples of Dambulla. Cave complexes of Dambulla, Situlpahuwa, Mulkirigala are significant cave temples which demonstrate rudimentary architectural developments of the island. The Kaludiya Pokuna, Mihintale cave temple was constructed with brick walls, granite window openings, and ceilings. The Gal vihara, Polonnaruwa and the cave temples of Dambulla were initially constructed as cave temples, later on the cave temples were converted to image houses. Dagobas or stupas Ruwanveliseya, Anuradhapura The dagobas or stupas of Sri Lanka are significant to the architectural and engineering development in the island, stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world.Silva, R. 1990, \\"Bricks ‚Äì A unit of construction in ancient Sri Lanka\\", ICTAD Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 21-42, Colombo. Demala Maha Seya, which was never completed, had a circumference of , Jetavanaramaya at the time of its completion was the largest stupa constructed in any part of the world at 122 m in height. Jetavanaramaya was also the third tallest building in the ancient world, Abhayagiri Dagaba (370 ft) and Ruwanwelisaya (300 ft) were also significant constructions of the ancient world. The construction of stupas were considered acts of great merit, the purpose of stupas were mainly to enshrine relics of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within most of the stupas, entrances to stupas are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers. Stupa design it is admired for its structural perfection and stability, stupas such as Jetavanarama, Abhayagiri, and Mirisaveti Stupa were in the shape of a paddy heap. Other shapes such as the bubble(Ruwanweli), pot and bell developed later, it is suggested that the stupa at Nadigamvila was in the shape of an onion. An ornamented vahalkada was added to stupa design around the 2nd century; the earliest is at Chaitya. The four vahalkadas face the cardinal points, ornamented with figures of animals, flowers, swans and dwarfs. The pillars on either side of the vahalkada carry figures of lions, elephants, horses or bulls, depending on the direction of the structure. The stupas were covered with a coating of lime plaster, plaster combinations changed with the requirements of the design, items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and saliva of white ants. The fine plaster at Kiri Vehera used small pebbles, crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas from the 5th to 12th centuries. Vatadage Vatadage, Polonnaruwa The vatadage is considered to be one of ancient Sri Lanka's most prolific architectural creations; this design represented a changing perspective of stupa design independently within the island.Bandaranayake, S. (1974), Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: the vih√°ras of Anur√°dhapura Early provincial vatadages have been in the form of a square later it developed into a circular form enclosing the dagoba. Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya and Tiriyaya vatadages still have their circles of slender, graceful pillars. The vatadage roof was of a sophisticated design unique to ancient Sri Lanka, it is a three-tiered conical roof, spanning a height of 12‚Äì15 m, without a centre post, and supported by pillars of diminishing height. The weight was taken by a ring beam supported on the inner row of stone columns, the radiating rafters met in a cartwheel-like design. The ornamental qualities of the Polonnaruwa vatadage are highly valued and scholars maintain that the Polonnaruwa vatadage represents the best architectural work of the Polonnaruwa period. Meditation houses Ritigala Ruins The meditation houses found in the forest monasteries in Ritigala and Arankele are unique to Sri Lanka, Each house consist of two raised platforms, linked to each other by a monolithic stone bridge. The outer platform is open to the sky, larger and higher than the inner platform. These meditation houses achieved a very high degree of perfection in their architecture, the design combined square and rectangular shapes and yet maintained symmetry, indicating the architects' sophisticated knowledge of geometry. The stone masonry is also of a very high standard. The basements of these buildings were constructed of monumental blocks of stone, cut to different sizes, carefully dressed and very finely fitted together. The bridge connecting the two platforms was formed out of a single slab of stone. Some such slabs measured by . The sides have been cut with precision where the joints between the slab and the stone moulding of the platforms are hardly perceptible. Vaulted roof shrine The brick shrine with vaulted roof, as seen at Thuparama, Lankatilaka and Tivanka Pilimage, is also considered unique to Sri Lanka. The Thuparama is almost intact today and gives an idea of the manner in which the vaulted roof was created. The principles of the true arch were known to the ancient Sri Lankans, but the horizontal arch was considered a safer method of construction. Skyscrapers The nine-storied Lovamahapaya (3rd century BCE) would have been an elegant building. It had an exposed wooden frame supported on stone pillars. It was plastered in white, with shining copper roof tiles and a pinnacle at its apex. It had lightning conductors or chumbakam made of amber and tourmaline. Its rafters were made of talipot palm. It rose to a height of and had approximately of floor space. It could seat 9000 monks. Roland Silva remarked in 1984 that such an extensive floor space would stagger the designers in Sri Lanka \\"even today\\". The dominant element in these buildings, was the tiled roof supported by timber beams and rafters. The roofs were tiled, from as early as the 3rd century BCE, with red, white, yellow, turquoise and brown tiles. There were also tiles made of bronze. Palaces A Royal Palace in Polonnaruwa Five royal residences have been identified. They are Vijayabahu's palace in the inner city at Anuradhapura, the palaces of Nissanka Malla and Parakramabahu in Polonnaruwa, the palace of Sugala in Galabadda in the Uva province, and Parakramabahu's palace in Panduwasnuwara near Hettipola, when he was ruling over Malaya rata. Ground plan All the palaces had the same ground plan. Each was set in a rectangular area enclosed by galleries with an entrance from the east. A spacious courtyard in front acted as a reception room, where sitting was not allowed. A flight of steps led to a central building where there was an imposing pillared hall with a dais at the end. Around the royal complex were over fifty small cells, in two or three rows. The hall in Nissanka Malla's palace was by . The floors of the upper storey in Parakramabahu's palace were of concrete. [Panduwasnuwara] palace had good provision for ventilation and there were soakage pits for drainage. Rock Palaces There was a palace on top of Sigiriya rock as well. The outlines, layout and several detailed features of this Sky Palace are still visible. There was an upper palace that ran parallel to the lower one, but at a much higher elevation. It had a viewing gallery. The innermost royal abode, which was originally a storeyed structure, had a magnificent 360 degree view of the city gardens and countryside below. There was a series of successive courtyards, chambers, and terraces connected by stairs and paved pathways.  Pool Design  Kuttam Pokuna in Polonnaruwa provides one of the best examples of the construction of a royal bath. A flight of long narrow steps led to an oblong shaped pond that had graduated gangways. The water was conducted by underground pipelines from the canal nearby and led into the bath by two makara gargoyles. A stone water lock acted as water locking valve and an exit for used water. There is also a now-ruined changing room. Other magnificent pool designs in Anuradhapura era such as \\"Twin Ponds\\" Kuttam Pokuna, \\"lotus Pond\\" Nelum pokuna, \\"hot water pond\\" janthagara Pokona, ath Pokuna-built for water storage and \\"black water pool\\" Kaludiya Pokuna are significant. Also there are significant series of ponds and pools which contains water fountains at the Sigiriya citadel, which marvels the hydro engineering in the ancient Sri Lanka. Audience halls Polonnaruwa also has the remains of two magnificent audience halls. They are the public audience halls of Parakramabahu and council chamber of Nissanka Malla. Parakramabahu's council chamber was a three-tiered oblong structure built on a broad terrace, facing north, and consisted of an entrance provided with two flights of steps, having a gangway in between at ground level. The pillars in the council halls at Polonnaruwa are square at the bottom, octagonal in the middle and square again at the top. Hospitals Some idea of hospital architecture can be inferred from the monastic hospitals at Mihintale and Polonnaruwa. This hospital plan can be seen at the National Museum, Colombo. There was an inner and outer court and the rectangular inner court had a series of cells, toilets and bath, with an exit at one end. One cell had a medicinal bath. Alahena had long dormitories instead of cells. The outer court accommodated a refectory, a hot water bath, storerooms and dispensary. A wall cordoned off the hospitals. The provision of two open courts in addition to windows ensured maximum ventilation and free circulation of air within the building itself. Houses A house dated to 450 BCE, built of warichchi (wattle and daub) has been discovered near Kirindi oya. Another has been found at Adalla, Wirawila, and at Valagampattu evidence has been discovered of houses dating from 50 CE to 400 CE. The kitchen utensils are still there. In medieval times, the rich had large houses built of stone, mortar and lime, with tiled roofs and whitewashed walls. There were rooms and apartments with doors and windows. The windows had fanlights. The doors had keys, locks, and hinges. The houses had compounds or courtyards and balconies. There were separate rooms for pounding paddy, a storeroom or atuva for paddy, and sheds for keeping chariots. Latrines are also mentioned. All houses however had small kitchens. Design and construction Architects There were architects to attend to the built environment. A cave inscription refers to a \\"city architect\\". Building was done scientifically, using superior instruments. For example, some stone slabs were so precisely cut that the joints are hardly visible and nothing could be inserted between the slabs. Ashley de Vos points out that this would require sophisticated instruments even today. Lifting and placing of slender stone slabs, twenty feet long, would have needed knowledge of structural mechanics. De Vos also suggests that Sri Lanka may have had the first pre-fabricated buildings in the world. Some sections of the monastic buildings were prepared separately and then fitted together. Artistry Vatadage Temple, Polonnaruwa, with fine examples of carvings There was artistry in addition to technical finesse. This is illustrated in the elegantly executed stone pillars dating from the 8th century. They are in various designs. The lotus-stalk pillars of the Nissanka Latha Mandapaya are unique in South Asian architecture. Lime mortar was used in brickwork only when there was a structural risk such as a vault or an arch. Water There were island pavilions surrounded by water called Sitala Maligawa. There were ponds with lotuses. The royal gardens in Polonnaruwa had dozens of individually named ponds in different shapes and sizes. Sigiriya had an octagonal pond. Polonnaruwa had one resembling the coils of a serpent and another like an open lotus. Kuttam Pokuna in Anuradhapura had a graduated series of ponds going from shallow to deep. Essential facilities were not forgotten: the Nandana Gardens had a large gleaming bathroom. Air cooling There was an air cooling method in the ancient period. A dried buffalo skin was fixed above the roof of the building. Water dripped onto it from several pipes, creating the effect of rain and sending in a cooling breeze. Pictures on walls were changed according to the season; cooling pictures for the hot season and warming pictures for the cool season. Building materials Builders worked with a variety of materials, such as brick, stone and wood. Corbelled and circular brick arches, vaults and domes were constructed. Rock faces were used as supporting walls for buildings. The platform carrying the mirror wall at Sigiriya and the brick flight of steps stand on steep rock. Around the 6th century, the builders had moved from limestone to the harder gneiss. The vatadage in Polonnaruwa had walls that were constructed of stone to the height of the upper storey. The lowest step of an imposing granite stairway that led to the upper storey of Parakramabahu's palace can still be seen. Meticulous detailing had been done in the leaf huts used by the forest monks of the 5th century. Timber It is important to note, however, that the ancient architecture was not stone architecture. The stone remains seen are misleading. It was primarily timber architecture, with mud or masonry walls. There were sophisticated wooden buildings from the 3rd century. Sigiriya had an elaborate gatehouse made of timber and brick masonry with multiple tiled roofs. The massive timber doorposts remaining today indicate this. The timber carried the load. Frames were made out of whole trunks of trees. The gatehouse at the eastern entrance to Anuradhapura built in the 4th century BC used whole trees. The palaces at Polonnaruwa and Panduwasnuwara show vertical crevices in the brickwork where wooden columns, consisting of entire trunks of trees, carried the load of the upper floors and roof. These openings still retain the spur stones upon which the wooden column once stood. The text of the Manjusri silpa describes methods for the cutting and seasoning of wood. Mature trees were selected and cut in the new moon when the sugar content in timber was lower, so that destructive woodboring insects were not attracted to the timber. The stone remains show that sound carpentry techniques were employed. The axe, adze and chisel were the common tools used in timber work. Saddharmarat-navali mentions two practices of carpentry. Oil was applied to timber to prevent decay, and wood was heated to straighten it.

He was the second employee at Microsoft Corporation, joining the company during his final year at Stanford University. At 35, he left Microsoft to focus his time on investment management and philanthropy, becoming a quiet but well-respected donor to the LGBTQ social justice movement, the environment, health and human services, and education. After his death, the Chronicle of Philanthropy called Weiland's bequest the 11th largest charitable gift in the nation with more than $165 million distributed between 20 nonprofit beneficiaries.  Early life  Weiland was a high-school classmate and friend of Paul Allen, with whom he created the Lakeside Programmers Group at Lakeside School, a preparatory school in Seattle, Washington. Weiland, Allen, Bill Gates, and Gates' childhood best friend Kent Evans were involved with the Computer Center Corporation, using their PDP-10. They worked together to create a payroll program in COBOL for a company in Portland, Oregon, and wrote scheduling software for Lakeside School.  Microsoft  Allen and Gates hired Weiland in 1975, the same year they founded Microsoft in Albuquerque. As one of only five employees, Weiland was a lead programmer and developer for the company's BASIC and COBOL language systems. After a couple semesters at Harvard Business School, in 1976‚Äì77, he rejoined Microsoft and became the project leader for Microsoft Works. He was described by Allen as a \\"brilliant programmer\\" and a key contributor to the company's success.  Philanthropy  During his life Weiland was a donor to more than 60 nonprofit organizations and distributed an estimated $21.5m primarily between 1996‚Äì2006. His largest gift was to establish an endowed chair in his mother's name at Stanford - the Martha Meier Weiland professorship in the School of Medicine. He was influential as an active member of the Northwest gay community. During his time as a volunteer on the Pride Foundation's board of directors from 1997 to 2001, he helped win the fight to get General Electric to include sexual orientation in their non- discrimination policy. A member of the national GLSEN board (an organization focused on supporting gay-straight alliances in schools across the country) from 2002‚Äì2005, he was a fervent supporter of programs promoting safe schools for all kids. Nancy Pelosi presents Sam Altman with the Ric Weiland Award at GLAAD 2017 Ten LGBTQ/AIDS organizations benefited from a donor advised fund Weiland established through the Pride Foundation at his death. More than $56 million was distributed between 2007 and 2017 to these organizations. For most of these nonprofits it was the largest gift in their history. Beneficiaries included: Lambda Legal, GLSEN, GLAAD, amFAR, the Task Force, OutRight Action International, PFLAG, Project Inform, In the Life Media and OutServe. Eight other estate beneficiaries received endowment gifts including United Way of King County, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Lakeside School, Pride Foundation and three environmental organizations - the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife Federation. The Nature Conservancy received two direct gifts of $6.4m each - one to support programs in Washington State and another to support their global environmental work. In 2007, Weiland's $54m gift to Stanford was called the largest bequest since the Stanford family's founding grant. 12 endowed Weiland funds have been established at the university, with a focus on supporting undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships. More than 175 PhD students in more than 30 fields of study have received Weiland fellowships since the program started, making it the largest fellowship program on campus. There are also 5 endowed Weiland chairs, the Martha Meier Weiland professorship at the Stanford University School of Medicine. the William Hershel Weiland professorship in Physics honoring his father, and three Richard William Weiland chairs in the School of Engineering. Weiland funds also support the Stanford LGBTQ community through the university's first endowment to Student Affairs, undergraduate education, the School of Business, the Center for Social Innovation and the university's general endowment. The permanent endowment funds established through Weiland's estate have a 2017 value of more than $150m and generate approximately $7.5m per year in program support. As the investment returns on these funds compound, Weiland's impact, especially in support of students will continue to grow.  Death  Weiland committed suicide by gunshot on June 24, 2006. Besides his longstanding HIV diagnosis, he was reported to have suffered from clinical depression. Survivors include his partner Mike Schaefer as well as two nieces and two nephews in Oregon and Washington.

Green Hell was given a lavish production by Universal Pictures, which built a massive indoor jungle set on a sound stage. An Inca temple 125 feet high, 225 feet wide, and 45,000 square feet in area were constructed. Having spent a great deal of money on a film that turned out to be a critical and financial disaster, Universal used the set again, recycling it into an Egyptian temple for The Mummy's Hand (1940). Whale made only one more completed film after this, the 1941 World War II romantic melodrama They Dare Not Love, starring George Brent as an exiled Austrian prince fighting the Nazis. Plot A group of adventurers journey deep into the South American jungle in search of ancient Incan treasure. A beautiful woman, brought to their camp by hired bearers, has come to join her husband, a newer member of the group, who was recently killed by hostile natives. As the months pass, jealousies and tempers flare as fights break out over the woman. The Incan treasure is eventually found but the treasure- seekers, now united by a common enemy, are about to be attacked by hordes of fierce natives armed with bows and poisoned arrows.

Playing career Imre Varadi was born in Paddington, London, to a Hungarian father and Italian mother. He started out in non-League football with Letchworth before joining Sheffield United in 1978, shortly before his nineteenth birthday. Varadi went on to become a nomadic journeyman, who rarely spent more than two years with any club and never made 100 league appearances in the colours of any team he played for. From Sheffield United, he moved on to Everton, Newcastle United, Sheffield Wednesday, West Bromwich Albion, Manchester City, Swansea Town, Sheffield Wednesday again, Leeds United, Luton Town, Oxford United, Rotherham United, Mansfield Town, Boston United, Scunthorpe United and finally had a spell as player-manager at Matlock Town. He was part of the Leeds United side that won the old First Division in 1992 but only played in three matches which was not enough games to earn a winner's medal. He was also part of the Sheffield Wednesday side that won promotion to the First Division in 1984, after 14 years away. He was sold to West Bromwich Albion a year later and was their top scorer with nine league goals in 1985‚Äì86, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated in bottom place with just 4 wins in the league. He was then sold to Manchester City, and was unable to prevent their relegation the following season, although he did help them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in his second campaign there. He was nicknamed \\"Imre Banana\\" by the City fans, following the inflatable banana craze which the club's fans helped start that season. He left Maine Road to sign for Sheffield Wednesday for a second time in the summer of 1988, and spent two seasons there, before they were relegated to the Second Division and he was sold to newly promoted Leeds United. He spent three seasons at Elland Road, but rarely played after his 1990-91 first season there, and did not make enough appearances in 1991-92 to earn a league title medal. He had loan spells at Luton Town and Oxford United before dropping down two divisions to sign for Rotherham United in the summer of 1993. He spent two seasons at Millmoor, scoring 25 Division Two goals, before brief spells at Mansfield Town and Scunthorpe United. He called time on his professional career in 1995 when he became player-manager of non-league Matlock Town, where he spent two years. In the Spring of 1997, Varadi signed with the South Jersey Barons of the USISL D-3 Pro League in the United States. He only played in two league games before returning home to England with his manager Matt Driver citing \\"personal reasons.\\" He scored his lone goal of his brief stint with the Barons against the New Hampshire Phantoms on May 3, 1997 in the club's first-ever home game at Carey Stadium in Ocean City, New Jersey. Post-retirement He became a fully licensed FIFA Agent in March 2004 and provides commentary on games for both PA Sport (for the Football Live project) and BBC Radio Sheffield.

The first checkpoint for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission at the Mandelbaum Gate, from the close of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War in 1949 until August 1952, was moved from the Israeli side of the Gate to the Demilitarised Zone after the \\"Barrel Incident\\".Commander E H Hutchison USNR \\"Violent Truce: A Military Observer Looks at the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951-1955\\" Chapter III The Barrel Incident p 20-30 The second checkpoint existed until the 1967 Six- Day War. The Gate became a symbol of the divided status of the city. History Mandelbaum House The crossing was named after the Mandelbaum House, a three-story building that stood at that location from 1927 to 1948. The house was built by a Jewish merchant named Simcha Mandelbaum, who had raised his ten children in the Old City but who needed a home with more space to accommodate his married children and guests. Rather than build in more populated areas like Jaffa Road or Rehavia, he chose to build on a lot at the end of Shmuel HaNavi Street, near the location of the Third Wall from the time of King Agrippas. Although Mandelbaum wanted to set an example for other Jews to build in the area and expand Jerusalem's northern boundary, the Waqf owned large tracts in the area and forbade Arabs from selling any more land to Jews, so the house stood alone. During the uprisings of 1929 and 1936, the Haganah Israeli paramilitary group took up positions in the house to drive back the Arabs leaving Damascus Gate toward the Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael neighborhoods.Regev, Chaya. \\"The Mandelbaum Gate: Home of the Mandelbaum Family\\". Yated Ne‚Äôeman (Israel-English edition), 5 November 2004, pp. 16-18. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, the Mandelbaum House stood between the Jewish neighborhoods and the area under Jordanian control. Mandelbaum‚Äôs widow, Esther Liba, and her family members abandoned the house on less than a day's notice after being asked to do so by the Haganah. The Haganah then took up residency and repelled Jordanian attacks in the surrounding neighborhoods until a cease-fire was signed. During this period the roof of the house was \\"protected\\" by painted plywood cutouts designed to look from above like anti- aircraft guns. As per the status quo agreement, the house remained on the Israeli side. In July 1948, the Jordanians attacked the house with a huge quantity of explosives and the building collapsed with 35 Haganah members inside. Part of the front wall with the entry gate remained standing until 1967 as a memorial to the divided Jerusalem. Outside this gate was the official crossing between Israel and Jordan. A few days after the Six-Day War and the unification of Jerusalem in June 1967, Mayor Teddy Kollek sent in heavy equipment to demolish the remains of the Mandelbaum House. \\"When a journalist asked him why he committed this act, which was probably beyond his authority to order, he explained that it was a period of chaos in terms of distribution of responsibility, and he did not want to leave this geographic landmark and make the area hefker (abandoned). He was totally unaware of the story behind the house, except for his acquaintance with the Mandelbaum Gate. When asked whether he knew who Mandelbaum had been, he shrugged his shoulders and replied, 'Some German doctor, I think'.\\" Mandelbaum Gate The Mandelbaum Gate in operation, 1955 Dismantling the Mandelbaum Gate The location of the checkpoint was determined by the entrance into the city of the Anglo-Jordanian Arab Legion following the withdrawal of British troops in May 1948. The Jordanians pushed Jewish defenders west and out of the Sheikh Jarrah area. Clergy, diplomats and United Nations personnel used the 50-yard (46 m) gateway to pass through the concrete and barbed wire barrier between the sectors, but Jordanian officials allowed only one-way passage for non-official traffic. Anyone with an Israeli stamp in his or her passport was denied passage. The Jordanians permitted a twice-monthly supply convoy from the Israeli sector to access Jewish property on Mount Scopus, and an annual Christmas crossing for Israeli Christians making a pilgrimage to Bethlehem. In 1964, special arrangements were made for the Israelis to greet Pope Paul VI as he crossed from Jordan to Israel at Mandelbaum Gate. The original sites of Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital were technically under the protection of the United Nations, but despite the \\"Mount Scopus agreement\\", the institutions were not permitted to reopen. The last person to pass through the Gate was the American journalist Flora Lewis, shortly before the outbreak of the Six-Day War in June 1967. Jordanian forces joined the war on June 5, with a massive bombardment of the Israeli sector of the city. Israeli forces captured the Jordanian part of Jerusalem within two days and soon tore down the Mandelbaum Gate. Only a historical marker remains.

Today it consists of remains in the village of Caerwent in Monmouthshire, south east Wales. Much of it has been archaeologically excavated and is on display to the public. History Foundation Venta was established by the Romans in around AD 75 as an administrative centre for the defeated Silures tribe in Roman Wales. Venta Silurum seems to mean \\"Market town of the Silures\\" (cf. Venta Belgarum and Venta Icenorum). This is confirmed by inscriptions on the \\"Civitas Silurum\\" stone, now on display in the parish church.Photograph of church The town, which was located on the Roman road between Isca Augusta (Caerleon) and Glevum (Gloucester) and close to the Severn Estuary, was - in contrast with nearby \\"Isca\\" - essentially established for civilian administration rather than for military purposes. Development Initially Venta had a forum and basilica. By the early part of the 2nd century, during the reign of Hadrian, the civitas had begun construction work on a market place and developing centre of local government. Public baths and shops, including a blacksmiths, were built about the same time. Remains of farms and dwellings, some with courtyards, have also been excavated. A Roman temple, perhaps dedicated to Mars and the Celtic god Ocelus, have been identified on the site. A bowl with a chi-rho symbol shows that early Christian worship had begun in the late 3rd century.Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1, 2004, Post-Roman legacy Following the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain, the town remained occupied until at least the mid-5th century. Early Christian worship was still established. The town might have had a bishop. A monastery was founded by Saint Tatheus in the 6th century. The site of the present church occupies part of an early Christian cemetery. The name Venta gave its name to the emerging Kingdom of Gwent (called initially \\"Kingdom of Guenta\\"), and the town itself became known as Caer-went or \\"the castra/fort of Venta/Gwent\\". Tradition holds that Caradog Freichfras of Gwent moved his court from Caerwent to Portskewett around the 6th century. Archaeology The Civitas Silurum Stone, which refers to the \\"council of the Silures.\\" Remains of a Roman Basilica and Forum The town lacked substantial defences until the mid 4th century when stone town walls were built. A small garrison may have been based in the town during this period. Large sections of the defensive walls are still in place, rising up to 5 metres in height in places. The walls have been described as \\"easily the most impressive town defence to survive from Roman Britain, and in its freedom from later rebuilding one of the most perfectly preserved in Northern Europe.\\" In 1881 a portion of a highly intricate coloured floor mosaic or Tessellated pavement, depicting different types of fish, was unearthed during excavations in the garden of a cottage. In 2008, a dig involving Wessex Archaeology and volunteers from the local Chepstow Archaeology Society, found a row of narrow shop buildings and a villa with painted walls, frescoes of Roman art and mosaic floors. Among the artefacts excavated were a bone penknife hilt depicting two gladiators fighting, coins, Roman glassware, ceramics, human and animal bones, lead patches used for repairing and pieces of mosaic. These excavations featured in Channel 4's Time Team programme, broadcast on 25 January 2009.Time Team Modern houses are built on top of half the site of the old Roman market place. The ruins of several Roman buildings are still visible, including the foundations of a 4th-century temple.Photograph of temple foundations The fact that most of the houses lacked mosaic or hypocaust-heated floors, however, suggests that despite its size, Caerwent never achieved the cultural level of other Romano- British tribal capitals.Caerwent at Roman-Sites.com In 2010 a programme of archaeological work was carried out, by Monmouth Archaeology, as part of the construction of a new garage, at Museum Cottage.

It is closely related to Nysius aa, which is endemic to the summit of the neighboring Mauna Loa. Description The wƒìkiu bug is flightless and inhabits the summit area of Mauna Kea, over . It is named after Puu Wƒìkiu, which means \\"topmost hill\\" in the Hawaiian language, the summit peak of Mauna Kea. Ecology The summit of Mauna Kea is a bleak, cold apparently lifeless place with cinder cones on a plateau of lava, but there are a number of organisms that have adapted to the inhospitable environment. These include lichens, algae, mosses, insects, spiders and other small arthropods. There are at least twelve species of endemic arthropods living there, and the community is largely dependent on the wind-blown insects that are deposited there. Unlike most other lygaeids, which eat seeds, the wƒìkiu bug has adapted to feed on insects that are blown up to the top of the mountain and die. This is not as small a resource as it might seem; snow packs at the summit are often covered with hundreds of them. When the snow melts, wƒìkiu bugs can be found at the edge feeding on insects that drop out of the melting snow. They have an antifreeze protein in their blood that allows them to survive at low temperatures.  Conservation  The stability of wƒìkiu bug populations has been a matter of controversy. Development of the summit area of Mauna Kea for telescopes has adversely affected the ecology of the area, including compaction of the loose cinder and traffic from tourism. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the summit the bugs inhabit other cones that are well removed from activity. Surveys by the University of Hawaii have shown populations to be stable with population variations driven by precipitation on the summit area. As a result of ongoing population monitoring a request to list the species as endangered was declined in 2011. The common name is also used to refer to the closely related Nysius aa, which occupies the same niche on Mauna Loa. It is even more poorly known than N. wekiuicola, but appears to be in less danger since the summit of Mauna Loa is not under threat of development. Although it receives a large number of hikers, the area is largely made up of rocky lava rather than loose cinder, and is less vulnerable to human influence.

Romans writers recorded the town as Venta Belgarum (The Venta of the Belgae) to distinguish it from the other tribal markets in Britain such as Venta Silurum and Venta Icenorum.Matasoviƒá, Ranko, Etymological dictionary of proto-Celtic, Brill, 2009, p. 413.Balles, Irene, \\"A Greek laryngeal metathesis that needn't be either...

It became the tribal capital of the Belgae who had probably held several Iron Age hill forts in the near vicinity of the site (St Catherine's Hill, Oram's Arbour and Worthy Down) once the Romans had pacified the area, as was their policy for relocating many other British tribes.The Towns of Roman Britain, J.Wacher. Anchor Press 1974. The River Itchen was diverted and a street grid laid out. Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to Silchester and Chichester, Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century.Cunliffe B. Wessex to AD 1000 1997 A defensive bank and ditch were dug around the town in the 2nd century.The Towns of Roman Britain, J.Wacher. Anchor Press 1974. p. 277 At the beginning of the third century, Winchester was given protective stone walls. At around this time the city covered an area of 144 acres (58 ha), making it among the largest towns in Roman Britain by surface area. The city had many fine Roman town houses or domus, as well as public buildings and Roman temples. Like many other Roman towns however, Winchester began to decline in the later fourth century. Religion The forum-basilica appears to have included a temple to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva along with an accompanying Jupiter Column. Elsewhere, there was a Romano-British style temple dedicated to the Celtic horse goddess, Epona. There was a large Romano-British cemetery to the north of the town, at Lankhills, and another to the east. Excavations of the cemetery were carried out by British archaeologist Julian Richards in 1998, and again in 2013, as part of the BBC television Meet the Ancestors series. Decline Red Roman bricks can be seen mixed with medieval material in this wall on St. George's Street From the mid-4th century, new development at Venta halted. Houses fell into disrepair and the drainage system collapsed. The population concentrated itself in the higher and drier areas of the town. The defences were however strengthened and the cemeteries remained in use, notably with burials of males wearing so-called military-style mercenary belts.

Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain in 410, urban life seems to have ceased around 450, although a small administrative centre might have continued after that on the site of the later Anglo-Saxon palace.

See Hatti, Raichur for the census town with the same name. Hutti Gold Mines also spelled as Hatti is a town in Raichur district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Location Hatti is situated in Raichur District, Karnataka State and is 80 km (50 miles) due west of Raichur, which is also the nearest railway station. Hatti was a small village in 1939, with hardly 60 or 70 huts and kutcha houses. Now there is a town Panchayat, and the population of the village is about 20,000. The population of the labour colony constructed by the Company is about 20,000. History This mine is probably one of the most ancient metal mines in the world, dating to the Pre-Ashokan period, the ancient miners having worked down to a depth of over 2300 feet. It is probable they had broken the rock by \\"fire-setting\\" i.e. heating it by means of fires and suddenly cooling it by pouring water onto the heated rock causing pieces to break off. As per carbon dating done by Dr. Rafter from Australia in the year 1955, the age of the two samples of timber found in old workings was estimated to be about 1980 years old. For crushing the ore to extract the gold they used a grinding stone similar to those used now for making masalas and a few of which can even now be found in the area. The actual gold was recovered by passing the crushed ore, mixed with water, over goats' skins, the fur trapping the heavy particles of gold while allowing the lighter minerals to be washed off. In addition to the ancient mining in mentioned above, there was further mining in the area between 1890 and 1920 when the price of gold was about Rs. 18 for 10 grams (Rs 20.97 per tola). The biggest of these ventures was at Hutti where, from 1902 to 1919, nearly 7,400 kg of gold were obtained from very rich ore, at an average yield of 19 g/metric tonne. Most of this ore came from the main mine, which reached a depth of about 1,100 m below surface. The industry closed down in 1920 due to technical difficulties and lack of funds. In 1937, the Nizam's Government decided to prospect the area again with a view to possible re- opening of the mines (the only industry in the area apart from agriculture) so as to provide employment. The area was a backward district, which was considered at that time to be a more or less perpetual famine area. In 1940, after some satisfactory exploratory work, it was decided to install a plant to treat 100 metric tons of mine ore per day, but before the plant could be obtained, operations were suspended, and from 1942 to 1946, due to World War II, the mine was shut down except for pumping. After the end of the war, the scheme was resumed and production started in September 1948, at the rate of 130 tonnes of ore per day. By 1972 this rate had progressively increased to 600 tonnes of ore per day. The Hatti Gold Mines Co., Ltd., Hatti, Raichur District The Company was originally formed in 1947 as the Hyderabad Gold mines Company Ltd., with the Hyderabad State Government holding a majority of the shares. With the re-organisation of the States in 1956, the Company was transferred to Mysore State (now known as the Karnataka State) and became Hatti Gold Mines Limited. Process of Gold Recovery and Disposal Ore containing gold is broken in the underground workings by drilling and blasting. The broken ore is hoisted up to surface and sent to the Mill where it is crushed and ground to fine powder. This powder is mixed with water and is passed over tables covered with blankets which trap the free gold. This concentrate of gold is further purified by melting with fluxes to remove impurities and then cast into bars, weighing about 25000 g. Each, in which form it is known as \\"bullion\\". The gold which is not trapped by the blankets is either very fine or is associated with other minerals, such as iron sulphide. The powdered ore containing this gold is agitated in a weak solution of sodium cyanide which dissolves the major portion of gold. The cyanide solution containing the dissolved gold is then passed over zinc, which causes the gold to be precipitated. The cyanide polluted effluent water is contaminating the local ground water. This gold precipitate is acid treated and roasted to remove impurities and then cast into bullion bars. Method of working and production: There are six separate reefs (Viz., Oakley's Reef, Middle Reef, Zone I Read, Village Reef, Strike Reef and Strike Reef Football) which are being actively worked in the mine at present. The mine is developed mainly through two vertical shafts up to 22nd level at present. Cross-cuts in the country rock from these shafts are put to intersect and develop all the reefs (6 reefs) at the vertical interval of 30 to 40 litres. Development rise are taken driven in the mineralized zone. Along the entire strike length of the reef connection the level above and below by series of rises by winzef at the interval of 60 to 70 meters forming different stoping blocks. The blocks that are formed are black stripe and black concreted with 0.6 meters reinforced concrete, two meters above the level. The blocks are made ready for stoping. Stoping will then mainly be done at 15 level by overhand flat black shrinkage method by breasting along the strike in slices of two to three meters. Stoping by overhand step and filling by hydraulic stand storing is adopted for level below 15th level. This is done by breasting along the strike in two meter slices. The main mine (mineries) which was extensively worked in previous years is water-logged and is still to be re-opened after dewatering and revlaction. As this is a major operation requiring considerable money and time, this will be undertaken time in the future between September, 1984 and 31 March 1983 the mine produced about 38,56,300 metric tonnes of ore to yield about 26,550 kg at an average recovery of 6.88 g per metric tonne. In addition about 48,800 metric tonnes of gold tailings lifted about 112 kg of gold production for the year 1982 ‚Äì 83 was about 62.83 kg gold per month at an average recovery grade of 5.24 per g per metric tonne. Demographics India census, Hutti Gold Mines had a population of 14,716. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Hutti Gold Mines has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 82%, and female literacy is 66%.

The word ‚ÄúChippiannock‚Äù is a Native American term which means ‚Äúplace of the dead‚Äù. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Rock Island was in need of a permanent cemetery in 1854. The town's population was 5,000 and the dead were being buried somewhat haphazardly in Bailey Davenport's pasture, which is now Longview Park. The first board of directors of the Chippiannock Cemetery Association included Holmes Hakes, S.S. Guyer, William L. Lee, Bailey Davenport, and Henry A. Porter. In 1855 Chippiannock's founders purchased on Manitou Ridge and secured the services of noted landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss to design a cemetery patterned in the rural cemetery style of Mt. Auburn in Massachusetts (America's first garden-style cemetery). Almerin Hotchkiss also designed Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn and Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Cable monument by Paul de Vigne The property consists of a western slope and the crest of Manitou Ridge. The site features gently rolling wooded hills that climb to a broad plateau. It is located near the midpoint between the Mississippi and Rock Rivers. Hotchkiss designed a system of curvilinear driveways winding around the various burial sections. The cemetery includes impressive monuments by Alexander Stirling Calder and Paul de Vigne. Many of the monuments reflect attitudes about death and mourning from the Victorian Era. Some of the more memorable grave markers include life- size stone statues, a ship's anchor, a six-ton granite ball, a baby's cradle, the sleeping dog statue guarding the Dimick children, and the mourning woman at the Cable monument. The Sexton's House is a Gothic Revival farmhouse that predates the cemetery. It continues to serve as the home of the cemetery superintendent. There are more than 25,000 people buried at Chippiannock Cemetery. The preservation of the cemetery is the responsibility of the Chippiannock Cemetery Heritage Foundation as well as other interested citizens. Chippiannock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1994. It was the first cemetery in Illinois to be listed on the National Register.

Intended to serve as a royal yacht, its interior was luxuriously furnished with sculptures and mirrors. During the Boshin War, Banry≈´ participated in the Naval Battle of Awa, Japan's first engagement between two modern fleets, on 28 January 1868. Subsequently, she was used to transport Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu from Edo to exile in Sumpu following the Fall of Edo to imperial forces of 11 April. Under the command of Bankichi Matsuoka, she was one of the ships seized by Enomoto Takeaki and other Tokugawa loyalists in their escape to create the Republic of Ezo in Hokkaido later that year. Matsuoka was dispatched to participate to the Naval Battle of Miyako Bay in March 1869, but had to return to Hachinohe due to the weather. During the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, she sank one of the Imperial navy's warships, the steam corvette in the first recorded modern warship being sunk in ship to ship combat in Japanese history. Towards the end of the battle, with her ammunition exhausted and suffering from severe damage due to numerous hits, she was beached near Benten Daiba, and set on fire (although the fire went out before it could consume the vessel). She was salvaged by an Englishman, and after repairs and rebuilding in Shanghai was renamed the SS Emperor. She then returned to Japan in 1873 as for use in transporting colonists and supplies to Hokkaido. She was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1877 as Raiden, serving as a training vessel until January 1888. Afterwards, she was demilitarised, and served as a whaling ship out of Kochi, and later as a transport, passing through several owners until she was scrapped in 1897.

Ironically, however, agriculture in this taluk is rain-fed mainly because the government has failed to harness the capacity of the reservoirs. Barring the Kabini reservoir, the other reservoirs are always dry. As a result, farmers who could otherwise raise three crops are able to hardly raise one and are perennially in debt. This is one of the main reasons for the economic backwardness of the taluk and distress migration to cities is common.

The project entails pumping water 6 km from the Kabini reservoir into the Taraka reservoir; it was completed in 1983. Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited is in charge of this project and claims that 80% of the project is complete. The lift irrigation project was expected to be completed by January 2007. The Taraka reservoir was in the news in October 2006 as one of the crest gates of the reservoirs breached leading to a major flooding of the villages downstream.

Stupas, also called dagebas and cetiyas, are considered an outstanding type of architectural creation of ancient Sri Lanka. Under the influence of Buddhism, there were several changes in the field of architecture in Sri Lanka. The stupa commands a prominent place among these changes. The Stupa is also known by synonymous names such as Chaithya, Dagaba, Thupa, Seya and Vehera. Stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world.Silva, R. 1990, \\"Bricks ‚Äì A unit of construction in ancient Sri Lanka\\", ICTAD Journal, Vol.2, No. 1, pp. 21-42, Colombo. After Rev.

The earliest monument found in Sri Lanka is the Stupa, which is described as a hemispherical dome surmounted with a spire (kota). Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara in Mahiyangana, Uva Province is regarded as the first stupa of ancient Sri Lanka The first historical stupa constructed after the arrival of Mahinda in Sri Lanka is Thuparamaya, which was built during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa. Afterwards many stupas were built, some colossal stupas, biggest of which is Jetavanaramaya. History of Stupas Mahiyangana Stupa is the first stupa of ancient Sri Lanka There are two recorded instances regarding the construction of stupas in Sri Lanka in the lifetime of Gautama Buddha. One of those instances is the construction of the cetiya at Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara at Mahiyangana in the valley of Mahaweli, which enshrines the Buddha's Hair Relic reputedly presented by the Buddha to Saman, a deva.The other instance is the construction of a stupa at Tiriyaya enshrining the Hair Relics presented to the tradesman brothers Tapussa and Bhallika from Okkalapa (present-day Yangon). The gift of the Hair Relics to the brothers is explicitly mentioned in the Pali Tipitaka. The latter This event is mentioned in an inscription written in Sanskrit found at this site. During the time of Ashoka, numerous ‚Äòstupas‚Äô were built at hallowed sites in India. In these were enshrined relics of the Buddha which people venerated. When it was observed that there were no Buddha relics in Sri Lanka, the king, at Mahinda‚Äôs suggestion, appealed to Emperor Asoka to send some relics. He responded to the king‚Äôs request and sent the right collarbone relic of the Buddha. King Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparamaya to enshrine this relic, the right collarbone of the Buddha. The Thuparamaya is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. The building of colossal stupas started during the reign of King Dutugamunu. Afterward many kings built stupas. Construction of a stupa The construction of stupas were considered acts of great merit. The purpose of stupas were mainly to enshrine relics of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within most of the stupas, entrances to stupas are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers.Pieris K (2006), Architecture and landscape in ancient and medieval Lanka The stupas were covered with a coating of lime plaster, plaster combinations changed with the requirements of the design, items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and saliva of white ants. The fine plaster at Kiri Vehera used small pebbles, crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas from the fifth to twelfth centuries. Parts Tissamaharama Stupa across the paddy fields (Gharbaya, Hatharas Kotuwa, Devatha Kotuwa, Koth Kerella and Kotha of the stupa are visible). A stupa usually has six parts: * Pesavalalu ‚Äì Berms or terraces A stupa consists of three such berms at its base. The three berms rising from the base gradually reduce in size. * Gharbaya ‚Äì Hemispherical dome The hemispherical dome is constructed on the three berms. In the middle of the dagaba was built a relic chamber (Dhathu garbhaya). The Buddha's relics are enshrined there. In the centre of the Relic Chamber was placed a bo-tree made of precious metals, and an image of the Buddha round which were groups of figures representing various events in the life of the Buddha. * Hatharas Kotuwa - Tee cube Relics are enshrined in this part too. * Devatha Kotuwa - Cylindrical neck This is built on the Hatharas Kotuwa. Figures of deities are carved on the surface. * Koth Kerella - Conical spire This is built on the Devatha Kotuwa. A crystal (chudamanikya) on a pinnacle made of metal is placed at the top of the spire to adorn it. * Kotha ‚Äì This is also called \\"silumina\\" in Sinhala. This is usually a pinnacle made of metal on top of which is a precious crystal or gemstone(chudamanikya). There are other constructions associated with the stupa: * Vahalkada (frontispiece) This is a structure constructed joining the stupa at its four cardinal directions as a decorative flourish. Later these frontispieces came to be decorated or embellished with designs such as the creeper design. Stone slabs erected for the purpose of offering flower at the stupa too have been added to these frontispieces. * Chethiyagara (shrine house) or Vatadage (circular relic chamber) The chetiyagara is a structure constructed as a protection chamber for the stupa. There is evidence to show that such chambers were erected to shelter the small stupas built during the early years. The roofs of these structures are believed to have been wooden. Types of Stupas Basically, a stupa has several salient features. Buddhist literature mentions six types of stupas differing according to the shape of the dome or body of a dagaba. This is mentioned in \\"Vijayantha Potha\\". They are: * Dhanyakara - Heap of paddy shape e.g. : Kelaniya stupa * Ghantakara - Bell shape e.g. : Ambastala dagaba at Mihintale * Bubbulakara - Bubble shape e.g. : Ruwanweli Maha Seya at Anuradhapura, Rankoth Vehera & Kiri Vehera at Pollonnaruwa Kiri Vihara stupa, Polonnaruwa has the 'Bubble shape' * Ghatakara - Pot shape e.g. : Situlpavwa, Somawathiya, Kiri Vehera at Kataragama * Padmakara - Lotus shape e.g. : Vijayarama at Anuradhapura, Puliyankulama, Indikatu Seya at Mihintale * Amlakara - Shape of Nelli fruit (Phyllanthus emblica L.) No records exist of the finding of this type of stupa in Sri Lanka. Another type of stupa is mentioned in the book \\"Manju Sri Vasthu Vidya Shastra\\" * Palandawakara - Shape of an onion e.g. : Nadigamvila stupa Thuparamaya King Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparama dagaba to enshrine the Right Collar Bone of Lord Buddha. The Thuparama is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. Originally it was in the shape of a heap of paddy but as restorations were done in later years, it took the form as seen today. It has a diameter of at the base. As the name suggests, Thuparama comprised a ‚Äòstupa‚Äô and an ‚Äòarama,‚Äô a residential complex. Ruins of such a complex can be seen within an area of over around the ‚Äòstupa.‚Äô The Great Stupas of Sri Lanka The ‚Äòstupas‚Äô built later on were much larger than the Thuparama.It is accepted that the building of colossal stupas started during the reign of King Dutugemunu. King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC) built the Mirisaveti which has a diameter of at the base and the most venerated ‚Äòstupa‚Äô - Ruvanvali Mahaseya, also known as Ratnamali Mahathupa. While the base has a diameter of , the height is given as 120 cubits (‚Äòriyan‚Äô), equivalent to around . It took the form of ‚Äòbubbulakara‚Äô or bubble shape. When the Abhyayagiri dagaba was originally built by King Vattagamani (Valagamba - 103 BC) it was not very large but later enlargements made it larger than the Mahathupa. Jetavanaramaya in Anuradhapura is the biggest brick structure in the world. King Mahasena (276-303 CE) is credited with building the largest of them all - the Jetavana, which has a diameter of at the base. Though the present height is estimated at , the original height is supposed to have been 400 feet. The main feature of Jetavana is its foundation, which goes all the way to the bedrock and deep. The height of Jetavana and the depth of the footing is approximately equal. Large stupas were also built at Mihintale at the site where Arahat Mahinda met the king, Magama, Dighavapi (near Ampara), Kataragama and other places. The builders of ‚Äòstupas‚Äô in Sri Lanka had closely followed the designs of such monuments built in Sanchi and other places in India. In huge monuments, the dome rose from a triple-based platform. The dome was surmounted by a square railing of wood or stone which later became a cube of masonry. A stone pillar embedded in the dome rose above the railing. The ‚Äòstupa‚Äô was crowned by an umbrella (‚Äòchattra‚Äô) or a series of umbrellas. Small Stupas The Kantaka Chaitya in Mihintale is a fine example of a small dageba. It features some of the finest stone carvings and terra cotta figures. They are well preserved to this day. The presence of a ‚Äòvahalkada‚Äô or front piece is another interesting feature in this chaitya. There are carvings of animal figures, pot and foliage and other familiar ornamental motifs. These front pieces seen in most dagebas project from the base and face the cardinal points. Vatadage The Polonnaruwa Vatadage. It can be observed that after the 4th century, the building of colossal dagebas has virtually ended. Thereafter smaller ones have been built using Thuparama in Anuradhapura as a model. This type came to be known as ‚Äòvatadage‚Äô or rotunda. It is a circular relic house and apart from Thuparama and Lankarama in Anuradhapura, the best example is seen in Polonnaruwa. There are two other beautiful ones at Medirigiriya close to Polonnaruwa and Tiriyaya off the Anuradhapura- Trincomalee road. These circular shrines enclosed stupas of smaller size and had wooden pillars right round. Later they were replaced by carved stone pillars. The pillars are arranged in four to two concentric circles, diminishing in size outwards.  Notable stupas  *Ruwanwelisaya - King Dutugamunu Ruwanwelisaya cent. 140 BC *Thuparamaya - King Devanampiya Tissa *Ridi Vihara - King Dutugemunu *Abhayagiri Dagaba - King Valagamba *Jetavanarama - King Mahasena *Mirisaveti Stupa - King Dutugamunu *Lankarama - King Valagamba *Rathna Prasadaya - King Kanittha Tissa *Dakkhina Stupa - Minister Uttiya *Sela Cetiya - King Lajjitissa *Naka Vihara *Kiribath Vehera - Unknown *Somawathiya Chaitya - King Kavan TissaSomawathiya Stupa *Tissamaharamaya - King Kavan Tissa *Kiri Vehera - King Mahasena, Kataragama *Kiri Vehera, Polonnaruwa *Neelagiriseya - King Kavan Tissa or King Bhathikabaya Ancient technology associated with stupas It is important to examine the technology applied in the construction of stupas comprising the features mentioned above. Examining the building of the foundation of a stupa to suit its size, one can get an idea of the application of the knowledge of science and geometry prevalent in ancient times. The Jetavana excavations conducted recently confirm that the construction of the platform or base on which a stupa stands has been very solid and strong. The skill shown by the craftsmen in maintaining the shape of the stupa reveals the advanced state of technology prevalent at the time. One wonders how the materials used in building Jetavanaramaya could have been carried to such a height.

Located in Downtown Los Angeles at 847 Golden Avenue, the complex consisted of 20 geodesic domes and was inhabited by \\"up to 34 individuals and their family members\\". Operated by Justiceville/Homeless USA, a non-profit organization, members of Dome Village were politically active in homelessness, nonviolence, and environmental issues. History Prior to becoming the Dome Village, the site was a shantytown inhabited by the homeless. In 1993, the village was founded by activist Ted Hayes. The village setting is intended to create stability for residents who live an otherwise-precarious existence. A song titled \\"People In Need\\" recorded by Gospel legend, Edwin Hawkins, Tramaine Hawkins and the Edwin Hawkins Singers was dedicated to the creation of Dome Village by The Benefit Network in 1988. In 1987, Tom \\"Beefbone\\" Bolema produced a benefit 12 inch single \\"Justiceville/Ted's Rap\\" featuring The Butchers and Electro-Shock. The song became the soundtrack for the video \\"Justiceville\\", produced by Gary Glaser, which documents the bull-dozing of a Ted Hayes encampment that preceded Dome Village. The dwellings were designed by architect Craig Chamberlain, a former student of Buckminster Fuller. The domes, which cost about $10,000 each and are easy to repair and maintain, are made of polyester fiberglass. Funding for the village provided by ARCO, a subsidiary of British Petroleum. In late 2005, the inhabitants of Dome Village were threatened with eviction as the result of an increase to the property's rent. The owner of the property, Milton Sidley, was quoted as saying that he, \\"was tired of helping Ted and the Dome Village.\\" The announcement about the increase came shortly after a Los Angeles Times article about an address Hayes delivered to the Bel-Air Republican Women's Club. According to Hayes, \\"When I founded the Dome Village 12 years ago, we had an understanding that he could ask for his property back at any time for any reason, and I would say \\"absolutely\\" without hesitation.\\" Accordingly he has \\"no intention of causing any trouble for this property owner\\", and \\"will not go to court\\". However, he admitted that he \\"cannot help but be saddened by the whole business. ...his reason was prejudice against Republicans.\\" On August 31, 2006, Hayes announced that the residents of Dome Village were being evicted and that domes would be auctioned off online. Residents, were given until October 2006 to get out, moved in traditional homeless shelters. They hope to recreate Dome Village elsewhere in Los Angeles with the proceeds from the auction. Programs Dome Village offered numerous programs for its residents, including workshops in computer literacy, jobseeking, legal issues, and children's theatre, a community art program called Street Without a Name (SWAN), two cricket teams, community gardening programs, and many others.

Features The Home Park is divided from the main Windsor Great Park by the high-volume Albert Road (A308) to Old Windsor. It is the private estate of the castle and, as well as beautiful parkland, gardens and avenues of fine trees, contains much farmland (cattle grazing and winter feed), a golf course, a bowling green (for the Royal Household Bowling Club), a cricket field (for the Royal Household Cricket Club), tennis courts (Windsor Home Park Lawn Tennis Club), the playing fields of St. George's School, Adelaide Cottage (on the site of the old Keeper's Lodge) and the Frogmore Estate, including Frogmore House, and gardens with Frogmore Cottage and a large lake, the Royal Mausolea and the Royal Burial Ground. Also attached are Shaw Farm, the Prince Consort's Home Farm and the Windsor Farm Shop. The grave of Dash, the favourite spaniel of Queen Victoria, can be found on the grounds. History Originally in the manor of Orton and not a Royal possession, part of the area was first emparked (for deer hunting) by King Edward III in 1368 and expansion continued over many centuries. Areas of the Home Park are mentioned in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor and show that the main road to Datchet then ran through it. The famous Herne's Oak stood nearby. Oliver Cromwell trained his New Model Army in the Park. George III removed the deer in 1785. The modern boundaries of the Park were set by the Windsor Improvement Act in 1846 and the Windsor Castle Act 1848 when the road to Datchet through the Park was closed and public access denied. Frogmore House and gardens alone are open on a few specific days in the spring and summer. The Royal Windsor Horse Show and the Windsor Rose Show also take place within the Park.

He served as a councillor in St Pancras and Camden, and then as a Member of Parliament (MP). He retired from the House of Commons at the 1983 general election and became a life peer in the 1983 Dissolution Honours. Early life Stallard was born in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the son of Frederick Stallard, a postman and driver from Tottenham. His family had moved to Scotland before his birth, and he retained the nickname \\"Jock\\" in later life. He was educated at Low Waters Public School, winning a place to continue his education at the Hamilton Academy. His family returned to London in 1937, and he left school aged 16 to become an apprentice in precision engineering. He was a socialist, becoming a shop steward for the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. He found himself working in a reserved occupation during the Second World War. He was elected to St Pancras Council in 1953. Along with other councillors from St Pancras led by John Lawrence, he was expelled from the Labour Party for flying the red flag from the town hall on May Day 1958, in protest at the exacerbation of endemic Rachmanism by the relaxation of rent controls under the Rent Acts in the post-war years. He left the council in 1959, but rejoined the party and became an alderman in 1962. He served as a member of Camden London Borough Council from its formation in 1964 as the successor to St Pancras Council until he became an MP in 1970. Parliamentary career Stallard was Member of Parliament for St Pancras North from 1970 until the constituency was abolished in boundary changes at the 1983 general election. In both the February 1974 and October 1974 general elections, his Conservative Party opponent was future Prime Minister John Major, who was making his debut as a parliamentary candidate. When the Labour party returned to government in 1974, Stallard became a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Edward Bishop, Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and, from October, PPS to Reg Freeson, minister of housing and construction in the Department of the Environment. He became a government whip in early 1976, when James Callaghan replaced Harold Wilson. The whips were essential at that period, with a minority government only able to pass legislation thanks to the Lib-Lab pact. Stallard was promoted to become a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in 1978, but resigned in January 1979 when the Prime Minister, Callaghan, promoted a Bill which would increase the representation of Northern Ireland in the House of Commons from 12 seats to 17. After being passed over for selection for a re-drawn seat of Holborn and St Pancras in the 1983 general election in favour of Frank Dobson, the younger Labour candidate from Holborn and St Pancras South, the other half of the merged constituency, Stallard was appointed to the House of Lords. He was created a life peer as Baron Stallard, of St Pancras in the London Borough of Camden, on 7 September 1983. In the House of Lords, he opposed compulsory sex education in schools, the 1990 Embryology bill and along with many peers of his generation, felt homophobia was not just acceptable but enshrined in the teachings of his religion. A devout Roman Catholic, during debates in the Lords on the equalisation of the age of consent in 2000, he compared homosexuality to child abuse and attacked the Blair government for threatening to impose the will of the House of Commons on the Lords by way of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949: \\"[]he one thing I cannot come to terms with is the concept that homosexuality must be equated with heterosexuality and that homosexual couples must be equated with married couples.\\" He married Julia (Sheila) Murphy in 1944. His wife was Irish, originally from County Kerry. They had a son and a daughter. His wife died in 2004. Following a long illness, Lord Stallard died in a nursing home in north London.

A guitarist and singer, he is best known for his work as the original and current lead guitarist with The House of Love and as the former frontman/guitarist for Levitation and Cradle. During the late 1980s and 1990s Bickers was hailed as one of Britain's leading young guitarists, as well as attracting plenty of press coverage due to his unconventional pronouncements. Bickers's most recent work has been with singer-songwriter Pete Fijalkowski, with whom he released the album Broken Heart Surgery in July 2014. He is currently based in Brighton, England where he teaches music at the college Access To Music. Biography and musical career Early years Terry Bickers was born in Kensington, London, and grew up in nearby Fulham into what he describes as \\"a family of big gamblers and card players. I learnt from them how to hold my hand back. They'd all be drinking and because I was only seven, I'd be straight, checking them out and learning from their behaviour.\\" When he was twelve years old, his parents split up, an event which he later described as \\"my whole life falling down in front of me. The relationship between your parents is how you see the world at that age. You learn not to trust anything.\\" Bickers would often cite this event as contributing to his later personal vulnerability and his consequent reactions to both people and to band politics. Bickers's first significant band was the Northern Irish indie-rock band Colenso Parade, which he joined in 1985 on their move to London. He played on their Hallelujah Chorus EP and Glentoran album, both released in 1986 on Fire Records. The House of Love In 1986 Bickers left Colenso Parade to join The House of Love, playing the role of lead guitarist and creative foil to singer and songwriter Guy Chadwick. The House of Love rapidly gained critical acclaim in the British weekly music press (much of it focused on Bickers' intense psychedelic guitar approach). The band's 1988 debut album ‚Äì also called The House of Love, and released on Creation Records ‚Äì received glowing reviews and saw the Chadwick/Bickers partnership being compared to the Smiths partnership of Morrissey and Johnny Marr. Hotly tipped as being future stars, the band soon moved on to the major label Fontana and came under pressure to write more commercial singles. Already a withdrawn character, Bickers had difficulty adjusting both to his musical celebrity and the demands of the record industry, During this time, although his playing remained acclaimed, he suffered from depression and drug abuse and his relationship with Chadwick began to break down. This culminated in a notorious episode during a House of Love tour in 1989, when Bickers set fire to a banknote in the back of the band's tour van while chanting \\"Breadhead!\\" at Chadwick. He was ejected from the band shortly afterwards (although his playing would feature on the band's second album, released the following year). Bickers would later describe the tour van event as a protest against The House of Love's commercialised state, commenting \\"That was frustration. I just found at the time that I didn't have the same aspirations as the rest of the band. I was more into exploring music than exploring the exploitation of markets around the globe. They were really into crusading. And winning. I wasn't.\\" He would also confess to having had a nervous breakdown during this period, recalling \\"It was exhaustion... I kind of couldn't function as I did before and it's very frightening. It makes you stronger, the experience of something like that helps you build a resistance, because you have to in this day and age.\\" After leaving the band, Bickers sought greater stability, choosing to marry and have a daughter, Ella, in 1991.Levitation biography (on fansite) He has commented that part of his \\"difficult\\" reputation over the years (particularly in his House of Love days) came from his previous behaviour of \\"push(ing) love away. It was just fear, really. Fear of my own vulnerability. Fear of rejection maybe, being hurt. It was me doing battle with myself.\\" Levitation In 1990, Bickers formed the psychedelic rock band Levitation with drummer David Francolini, former Cardiacs guitarist Bic Hayes, multi-instrumentalist Robert White (later of The Milk and Honey Band) and bass player Joe Allen (who went on to join Strangelove and was replaced by Laurence O'Keefe). As well as playing guitar, Bickers took on the role of lead singer in the band. The band quickly became known for their intense collective playing, and were hailed in both the underground and mainstream music press as new psychedelic heroes as well as potential rehabilitators of progressive rock. Levitation recorded a number of EPs (including the Coppelia EP, heralded by Melody Maker as \\"this generation's Marquee Moon,\\") and two albums ‚Äì Coterie and Need For Not. With Bickers already notorious for his time with House of Love, Levitation gained a good deal of press attention very quickly. Despite the band's collective approach (and Bickers' insistence that Levitation was a democracy),Levitation interview in Melody Maker, April 27 1991 (copy hosted on Levitation fansite), accessed 2 December 2010Organ magazine ‚Äì interview with Bic Hayes of Levitation April 1993], accessed 6 December 2010 (copy hosted on Levitation fansite) much of this attention was focussed on the eminently quotable Bickers himself. In interviews with the music press, Bickers would provide career-friendly quotes by, for example, citing an interest in the then-current dance and rave music scenes as well as the indie-rock and psychedelic music movements. However, he was equally likely to suggest that Levitation were considering performing in masks or carrying out a concert tour of Britain via canal, or to raise esoteric ideas such as Gaia theory or the possibilities of communicating with dolphins. Although reviewers continued to praise his skill as a musician, his schemes and philosophical ideas (though presented with sincerity) led to him being mocked and caricatured for his apparent eccentricity, leading to his reputation and nickname as \\"Bonkers Bickers\\". Despite rave reviews and an excellent reputation as a live band,Melody Maker review of Coterie (scan)Levitation live review in Select magazine, 1991 (scan)\\"Prog What?\\" ‚Äì live review of Levitation by Simon Williams in New Musical Express (scan)\\"England's dreaming\\" ‚Äì live review of Levitation/Chapterhouse/Blur concert by Simon Reynolds in Melody Maker, 16 November 1991 plus a growing fanbase, the band's career was set back by Bickers's refusal to tour America following an incident on the band's first American tour in which the band was caught in crossfire during a gun battle between police and a criminal gang. This led to tension between Bickers and the other members, culminating in Bickers departing the band, acrimoniously, in 1993. Bickers famously quit Levitation onstage during a London concert, announcing \\"We've lost it, haven't we?\\" Bic Hayes would later comment \\"It had happened a few times before that last gig but I think that we all knew very early on at (that) one that there was no going back again.\\" Years later, Bickers would speak about his departure with regret and shame, but claim that his mounting depression had had much to do with the manner of his departure. In 2018, he temporarily and amicably reunited with his former Levitation bandmate Bic Hayes onstage, when he guested with the latter's psychedelic band ZOFFF. Paradise Estate, Cradle, Monkey 7 and others Within a week of leaving Levitation in 1993, Bickers teamed up with guitarist Clive Giblin (Alternative TV, Shock Headed Peters, Two Worlds Collide, Sol Invictus). The duo formed a band called Paradise Estate, named after the Television Personalities' track as they were both fans. They spent about six weeks writing and recording the songs that would convince Warner Bros to sign Bickers, following which the pair drifted apart (with Giblin leaving the band). Bickers renamed the project Cradle and drafted in three new members. A year later, unhappy with the band, Bickers approached Giblin and asked him to rejoin Cradle (also recruiting former King Kurt drummer Daniel). This line up ‚Äì together with Bickers' partner, singer Caroline Tree ‚Äì spent the summer of 1994 locked away in a studio in Lincolnshire recording an album for Warner Bros. The band recorded almost 20 tracks in various forms (with fifteen finished and mixed) but this period was allegedly a difficult time for all concerned due to strong destructive external influences in several band members' personal lives. The end result was an album and single for Warner Bros, neither of which were released (although some copies of the single were pressed and reviewed in the music press). Once again Giblin jumped ship, and not long after Warner Bros dropped the band. Moving to Rye in Sussex, Bickers put together a third line-up of Cradle with himself on guitar, vocals, and various instruments, Caroline Tree as co-lead singer (and main creative foil) and Ian Mundwyler on guitar, plus a floating cast of contributing musicians. Recording sessions for this project were more successful and Cradle released what would be their only completed album, Baba Yaga, in 1995. This displayed a divided approach, alternating distinctly between noisy indie rock songs (predominantly sung by Tree) and ghostly psychedelic material (predominantly sung by Bickers) which showed a much softer approach than either Levitation or The House of Love. (During this period, Bickers also played on Divan, the 1995 debut album by Oedipussy, a project headed by former The Perfect Disaster member Phil Parfitt).Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books, , p. 245 In contrast to the reception afforded to Bickers' two previous bands, the press received Cradle with indifference or even contempt, with Caroline Tree being labelled as \\"the worst singer in the world\\" in a review in New Musical Express. Tree left the band shortly afterwards. Despite playing a few concerts with Bickers as lead vocalist, and more or less ditching the more conventional indie rock approaches in favour of dark psychedelia, Cradle did not last for much longer and quietly dissolved in 1996. Bickers went on to work in production, resurfacing briefly in 1999 with a new band called Monkey 7 (also featuring Sam Smith and Nik Webb). In contrast to the serious intent of Bickers' previous bands, Monkey 7 were described as \\"Tony Bennett steaming headfirst into the last working remnants of Shaun Ryder\\" and \\"a lo-fi ska Blur playing for laffs.\\" The band released one single, \\"The Snowy Peaks/It All Comes Back on You\\", on Anvil Recording Co. in 2001. Return to The House of Love In 2003, Bickers (now much more able to cope with his depressive tendencies due to courses of therapy and the martial art shintaido) reconciled with Guy Chadwick (who himself had suffered severe depression following the collapse of The House of Love). The two bonded over a new mutual sympathy, which in turn led to a reformation of The House of Love at the end of 2004. At the start of 2005 the reunited band released their first post-reformation album, Days Run Away. After another eight years, She Paints Words in Red was released on 25 March 2013 by Cherry Red Records. Other current work Pete Fij / Terry Bickers  In 2009, Bickers joined up with Worthing resident Pete Fijalkowski (ex Adorable/Polak) for a new \\"stripped down\\" project.

The pioneer who helped the Community (of Nilgiri Hills, South India) in the field of education, was Rao Bahadur H. J. Bellie Gowder, a great leader and the leading light of the people during his time. He started a school for the upliftment of the community, which was incidentally one of the oldest non-European schools in the region, started on 1 July 1930. Students from all through the district and beyond came to study, education was free and so was the boarding and lodging - the school hostel to this day remains free and is run as a shelter by the family for deserving students. This school was later donated to the Tamil Nadu government and to this day known as the Rao Bahadur Bellie Gowder Higher Secondary School. Hubbathalai Village Cloudy and Blissful climate at Hubbathalai Village It is at the same Hubbathalai Village where he often used to invite the 'Seeme Gowdas' (Leaders of other areas of the Nilgiris, each area being called a 'Seeme' or a small 'kingdom') to discuss the situations and problems prevalent at that time and give his advice. People from \\"Naaku Betta\\" (from all over the Nilgiris - spread on all the four [naaku] sides by mountains called 'bettas' in Kannada language) always kept coming to see him, seek his advise and settle their difficulties. In fact, it is said that the kitchen fire in the house of Bellie Gowder was never extinguished (to feed the people who came to see him). Like the proverbial seven philanthropists (Kadai Ezhu Vallalgal) described in Tamil literature, he too was a great philanthropist. He gave a lot of importance to social justice, development and education, he established the Hubbathalai High School to help not only the poor, but the people in the region to be literate. He died on 10 April 1935. This article was originally written in Tamil by A.

Portrait by Fredrik Ahlstedt Karl Emanuel Jansson (7 July 1846, in Finstr√∂m ‚Äì 1 June 1874, in Jomala) was a Swedish-Finnish painter, primarily of genre scenes. Biography His father was a farmer. He was first inspired to pursue an artistic career by the parish painter, who was teaching him to read and write. After being apprenticed to a shoemaker for a year, he quit to become the painter's assistant. In 1859, the Vicar, Frans von Knorring, happened to see some of Jansson's drawings and sent them to the with a letter of recommendation. As a result, he was given a scholarship to study at the Society's drawing school in Turku, which was under the management of Robert Wilhelm Ekman.Brief biography @ Uppslagsverket Finland. Upon his arrival, Ekman arranged for lodging and provided the necessary art materials. In 1862, he moved to Stockholm to continue his studies at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts with Johan Fredrik H√∂ckert. This was, however, a very slow period for the Swedish economy and he had difficulty selling his works. Finally, one of his canvases depicting the Prodigal Son was awarded a prize. In 1867, he graduated and received a state scholarship to study at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf under Benjamin Vautier. This period was the most decisive in determining his style. He attended classes until 1872, between periods spent at home in Finstr√∂m. By this time, he had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and went to Rome, seeking a healthier climate. Finding little relief, he travelled to various health resorts, including Davos and Merano, with no improvement. After a few months spent completing his affairs in D√ºsseldorf, he returned home for what would be the last time. Once there, he took up residence in Jomala with a local judge and his wife, who cared for him. On his deathbed, he learned that he had been accepted as an associate member of the Imperial Academy of Arts.Biographical notes @ the √Ölands Kunstmuseum.

He pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on June 29, 2006, to six sample charges of sexually abusing four pupils, three of whom were boarders, at the college on dates from 1974 to 1981. The abuse began with Bennett touching them outside their clothing, culminating with the abuse taking place in some cases with both parties totally naked. Some of the abuse took place in Bennett's office, while conducting sex education lessons, to which victims were summoned over the college tannoy system and direct access to which was controlled by a set of red and green lights outside his office door (a standard feature of all offices in the college at the time) The Irish Times reported that the Franciscans in charge of Gormanston College during Bennett's tenure were made aware of abuse but did not remove him.

For twenty years (1996‚Äì2016) Tavar Zawacki created and signed all of his artworks with his street artist pseudonym, 'ABOVE'.Tavar Zawacki, Metamorphosis. Germany: Urban Spree Books, 2017 page155. Tavar was born and raised in California until the age of 19, at which time, Zawacki bought a one-way flight from California to Paris, France, bringing with him a backpack full of art supplies, all the money in his bank account ($1,500 USD), and a 'rise above your fears' approach to starting his art career. Starting in Paris in 2000, Tavar transitioned from painting traditional letter style graffiti of A-B-O-V-E, to his 'Above arrow' icon that represented his optimistic mentality to 'rise above fears, challenges, and anything holding you back from your goals.' During a 20-year period, the artworks of ABOVE could be seen in over 100 cities spanning 50 countries around the world.*Above:Passport, October 2011. In January 2017, Zawacki decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of anonymity, and start creating, and signing artworks with his real birth name ‚Äì allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as liberation from the arrow icon he has associated himself with. Tavar Zawacki's painting styles with his large scale mural works, as well as his indoor fine art are characterized by the use of hard-edge painting, color field, geometric abstraction, Op art, and Trompe-l'oeil painting styles. Zawacki has been showcasing his work in galleries and creative institutions around the world since 2005.  Career   Early career of traditional graffiti (1995‚Äì2000)  Tavar Zawacki was born in the foothills of Northern California in 1981 from two creative hippie parents who invented his name. Tavar was encouraged by both parents at a very young age to express himself through art, and music. At the age of 13 years old, Tavar was introduced to skateboarding and graffiti. Zawacki stated 'as a teenager, I spent my time after school skateboarding and painting graffiti on trains at the train yard. I was magnetized towards skateboarding, and graffiti because they were both D.I.Y. and independent ways of expressing myself.' In 1995, at age fourteen, Tavar started spray painting the traditional letter style graffiti with his moniker 'ABOVE' on freight trains in California. Five years later, he changed from painting traditional letter graffiti to an arrow symbol that pointed 'Above'.Graff it No. 4, July 2002. (Paris, France) Zawacki credits an impactful, and pivotal experience where a train he had painted with the letters A-B-O-V-E was leaving the train station and his name was completely illegible due to the increased speed of the departing train. He realized that he needed to find a way for his artwork to connect and be recognized in a fraction of a second.  'ABOVE' Arrow period (2000-2006)  During a six-year period from 2000-06, Tavar's artist focus was exclusively on the 'ABOVE' arrow icon he invented. During a 20-year period, the artworks of ABOVE could be seen in over 100 cities spanning 50 countries around the world.*Above:Passport, October 2011. In 2000, at the age of 19, Tavar moved from California to Paris, France. At that time Paris was home to street artists like Zevs, Invader, Stak, and Andr√©Backspin No. 46, July 2003 (Berlin, Germany) Tavar and the other Parisian artists were part of a movement in street art that was heavily based on characters and logos. During this period Tavar started painting his upward-pointing 'Above' arrow icon. After two years of painting his arrow logo in the streets of Paris, Zawacki returned to California in 2003, where he invented a technique of his hanging wooden 'Arrow mobiles' from overhead wires. He would later proliferate this hanging process of his 'arrow mobiles' for years to come. A site-specific wooden arrow mobile that reads \\"shoe/tree\\" hung from a tree full of shoes. Nevada, U.S.A. 2004 In the summer of 2004, Zawacki went on a self-titled \\"U.S.A. Tour\\". He drove across the United States hanging 300 plus arrow mobiles in 14 major cities. It was during Zawacki's self-titled, U.S.A. tour that he introduced elements of word play by writing a word on both sides of the spinning arrows to suggest a dialog. Zawacki has declined to respond to questions about how he is able to hang his mobiles so high, saying, \\"I value and respect that we all have imaginations and for me to interfere with what your imagination would be wrong.\\" Zawacki returned to Europe in 2005. When asked in an interview why he did not hang his arrow mobiles in Europe after his U.S.A. tour, he responded, \\"In the United States there is an almost infinite amount of overhead telephone wires and street cables. However, I was unsure if the different European countries had many overhead wires like in the United States? I decided instead to make wooden arrows that were able to adhere to the sides of buildings, at elevated heights. During my travels around Europe, I was able to in fact see that most of the countries I visited had overhead wires to support the future hanging of my arrow mobiles.\\"Pulp No. 46, Aug/Sep 2005 (Sydney, Australia) Tavar visited 15 countries during his 4-month long European tour, installing around 500 of the larger wooden fabric arrows.Bant No. 31. Feb 2007 (Istanbul, Turkey) Tavar Zawacki's wordplay arrow mobiles. Every arrow mobile had a word on each side creating a sign language once installed. Zawacki installed his arrow mobiles in 26 countries around Europe in 2006. In 2006, Tavar began planning a new tour which he titled the 'Sign Language Tour'. By his own reports, he counterfeited Eurail tickets for a six-month duration, spanning 26 countries around Europe.Lodown No. 58. Oct/Nov 2007 (Berlin, Germany)Omagiu No. 9. June 2007, (Bucharest, Romania) Tavar's 2006 'Sign Language Tour' focused almost exclusively on his word play sign language arrow mobiles. Zawacki is quoted saying 'sign language is a form of communication using movements instead of sound. I found a lot of charm knowing that the arrow mobiles, once installed, are constantly spinning around. To create a dialog I painted one word on each side of the arrow. Conceptually speaking, when the wind would spin the arrow mobile there would be a small word play dialog to anyone who looked at it.\\" He customized arrows to certain countries language such as French (J'ai/faim, chez/vous), Spanish (Hace/sol, como/esta) German (uber/alle) and Italian (ciao/ciao).\\"  South & Central America Tour (2007)  In 2007, Tavar expanded from the wordplay of the previous year's 'Sign Language' tour around Europe. His 2007 South, and Central America tour was focused on painting larger wordplay murals on the exterior of building facades. He said in an interview, \\"I wanted to return to painting letters, like the traditional graffiti I did when I was younger, but instead of painting my graffiti name, I wanted to paint word-based art that was site specific and could easily be read and understood.Soma No. 6 July 2008, (S√£o Paulo, Brasil)Serie B: second edition No. 18 July 2008 (Madrid, Spain) He funded his 'South Central Tour' by working as a waiter in a restaurant in Alaska for four months in spring 2007.Atypica No. 32, Sep 2008. (Buenos Aires, Argentina) His south-central tour lasted six months, starting in October 2007 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and ending in Mexico City, Mexico in May 2008. Tavar had painted in 18 cities in 13 countries along the six-month tour.DIF No. 62, October 2008. (Lisbon, Portugal)  Stencil period (2008‚Äì2010)  \\"Giving to the poor\\" stencil in Lisbon, Portugal, addressing the issue of homelessness 2008 was the start of another new chapter in Tavar Zawacki's career. While still using his street moniker, ABOVE, Tavar had abandoned his previous year's focus of the arrow icon, and started painting site-specific figurative stencil works that often had a statement of social and or political awareness.*Above:Passport, October 2011. In September 2008, Zawacki traveled to Lisbon, Portugal, where he painted his \\"Giving to the poor\\" stencil commenting on the social issue of homelessness. He stated, \\"Every day I walked by this bank ATM machine and this particular homeless woman was sitting in the same place every day begging for money. I found it sadly ironic that just six feet away from here there were people lining up to withdraw money. The sharp social and economic clash inspired me to make this piece.\\" In October 2008, Zawacki returned to California, when the New York Stock Exchange (NTSE) crashed, marking a worsening of the 2008 recession. He stenciled on the exterior of a Washington Mutual building (one of several banks that collapsed during this period) an image of the NYSE bar graph with a downward sloping red line that went all the way down into the street gutter, mimicking the results that occurred just a few days before. In April 2009, Zawacki created a stencil mural depicting four children searching for \\"Easter AIGs\\" in response to the breaking scandal surrounding American International Group and the degree to which it profited from 2008 bailout. In May 2009, Zawacki started another tour of Europe lasting four months. This tour did not seem to have a title, as with most of his previous tours. In July, he painted a social and political stencil piece titled 'Bridging The Divide' directly on the Berlin Wall. The artwork depicted a young girl jumping up, with arm extended trying to grab a bouquet of flowers from a person on the opposite side of the Berlin. The painted scene was completed with a smiling guard looking at the young girl jumping. 'Bridging The Divide' was painted on the 20th anniversary of the German reunification \\"Bridge the divide\\" a site-specific stencil & installation on the Berlin Wall. Berlin, Germany. 2009 In January 2010, just days after the Haiti Earthquakes, Zawacki flew to La Havana, Cuba, to make a site-specific stencil commenting on the recent devastation in the neighboring country of Haiti. His stencil work was titled 'Help Thy Neighbor' and depicted a young Cuban boy with tire raft, first aid medical kit, and a Haitian flag in hand ready to embark to what is assumed to be Haiti. Blek le Rat one of the first graffiti artists in Paris, and has been described as the \\"Father of stencil graffiti\\". had personally selected Tavar Zawacki (still using his moniker, ABOVE) to make a duo exhibition together at White Walls Gallery in San Francisco on 1 May 2010. In a press release from White Walls gallery, \\"The meeting of these two artists is a passing of the torch from the original stencil artist to a younger generation of urban artists following in his legacy. Blek let Rat first pioneered stencils in the early 80s as a bold, attention-grabbing form of street art that was never before seen. ABOVE is the prominent stencil artist of the new generation, drawing on Blek's methods to project a social message into the urban environment.  Mainstream Media / Social & Political works (2011-2012)  In October at the height of the global Occupy Wall Street protest, Zawacki flew to Miami and painted a long wordplay mural that read \\"Give A Wall St. Banker Enough Rope And He Will Hang Himself.\\" Zawacki's mural incorporated a hanging effigy of a suited banker to the installation. When NBC News did a news report on Tavar's \\"Wall St.\\" piece, he told the reporter, \\"You don't have to read it, you just get it immediately when you see it. It's extremely aggressive and that's actually the point.\\" His final reply was, \\"Everybody's entitled to their own opinion, and some people will praise it, others will deny it and criticize it, but the point being is that it's getting people talking about the movement.\\" In February 2012, Zawacki traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he painted a mural commenting on the illegal blood diamond trade. He appropriated the proverb 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and painted the message 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend and a man's worst enemy' on the exterior wall of Jewel City, one of the world's largest diamond exporters. The site-specific statement was tall and in length, spanning the entire city block. The story of how Zawacki was able to trick the owners of Jewel city to paint such a large controversial statement on the exterior of their building without any trouble was, in the artist's words, a 'jewel heist' of his own. He said, \\"I was able to get away with this diamond wall heist because I told the owners I would paint in big letters 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend' on the exterior of their building. The owners loved the idea and all quickly agreed.\\" According to Zawacki, the owners never came outside to inspect, or question his actions. In an interview with a reporter from ABC News, he said, \\"I decided to take it upon myself to justify lying as I felt that making this controversial statement seen, and the topic of blood diamonds talked about more, would justify my actions. I have justified my lying as I feel it created a powerful social and political piece.\\" A social and political stencil where Tavar addressed the Eurozone crisis and more specifically Spain's unemployment. Zaragoza, Spain. 2012 In September 2012 amidst the Eurozone financial crisis, Zawacki flew to Zaragoza, Spain. He painted a long stencil mural of a queue of silhouettes accompanied by the statement '24% Desempleados' ('24% unemployed' in English) that were waiting in line for the unemployment office. This social, political, and time-sensitive mural addressed the hard financial times that Spain was facing with its highest unemployment rate in the world. At the time that Zawacki painted this mural 24.6% of Spaniards were unemployed; for under-25-year olds, 53% were unemployed. In the same month of September, Zawacki went to Copenhagen, Denmark, to created a time-lapse film titled #Socialmedia. He painted a message on the wall, then repainted the wall white, only to repaint a new message. He repeated this process of painting new statements over a duration of two days. Zawacki's messages were sarcastic mocks, factual, and confrontational towards society and the uses of social media. He profiled such social media platforms such as Facebook, :Twitter, and Instagram. In an interview, Zawacki said that he does not use social media such as Facebook, or Twitter, which allowed him to act as an outsider, looking in on how society uses such social media platforms.  Timing Is Everything (2013)  In August 2013, Zawacki created a time-relative stencil titled 'Timing Is Everything' in London, England. The colorful stencil painted on the side of a wall depicted a break dancer positioned upside down, with his arm extended downwards. At night, the context of the stencil is 'activated' by the street light, thus creating a shadow of the nearby street pole directly onto the wall. The stenciled breakdancer is now seen in a newer context of balancing himself on top of the street sign's shadow. In an interview, Zawacki said, \\"all of my stencil works exist in a site-specific context. I have been searching for this fixed shadow in a high visibility location for the past eight months during my global travels. I finally found the perfect shadow in Shoreditch area of London.\\" According to Tavar, the main reason why 'the perfect shadow' was so challenging to find was because it needed to exist in a highly trafficked area of a major city. A reporter from the news blog The Huffington Post claimed, \\"If Banksy and James Turrell were ever to collaborate, we like to think Tavar Zawacki would be their brainchild.\\" The majority of Zawacki's street works have topics of social or political issues suggested in the artworks. During an interview, he commented, \\"The Timing Is Everything stencil painted in London was void of any political or social message, but what it did have was an interaction with the city, and how things alter from day to night. The stencil shows how timing and lighting can be the platform, as well as the inspiration for a piece of work.\\" He closed the interview by saying, \\"My main intention with this piece is to have people observe, and re-evaluate their surroundings of how literally, timing is everything.\\"  Abstract Arrow Period (2014‚Äì2016)  In June 2014 Zawacki was one of the international artists invited to paint at Artscape mural event held in the city of Malm√∂, Sweden. He painted a mural titled Metamorphosis on an eight-story building in a style replicating the color printing process of CMYK. He explained, \\"I've been interested in shapes and colors for many years now. The arrow is its own unique shape, and when I overlap this colorful shape using the CMYK color blend process, it allows for new shapes and colors to metamorphosis into something new.\\" He continued, \\"It's about having fun and experimenting. As an artist it's important for me to experiment with my work, otherwise one can become stagnant. Making this mural put the arrow into a new context, giving it room for expansion of a new life.\\" In September 2014 Zawacki had a three-month-long artist-in-residence run in Detroit, Michigan in preparation for his solo exhibition titled 'Remix'. His Remix exhibition displayed a variety of different laser cut wood panels that were then 'remixed', and exchanged into the artwork's final configuration. \\"The intention for the Remix body of work is to find a balanced symbiosis between curved and straight lines. The characteristics of the arrow are straight, sharp, angular, and void of any curved elements. My intention is to mix a variety of curved shapes within the straight-arrow design, creating a totally new visual appearance.\\" When asked the question, 'What strides do you think you have made with this work?,' Zawacki replied, \\"The variety of new curved elements from the Remix exhibition allowed me to expand the arrow design into something new and exciting. The emphasis was less on the arrow, and more on the mix of curved, and straight-lined shapes. The arrow icon was breaking apart and morphing into new (and exciting) abstract shapes.\\" In October 2015 Zawacki painted the largest mural of his career at that time, a 33-meter tall (108 feet) by 17-meter wide (55 feet) mural titled 'Incognito' in Johannesburg, South Africa as part of the City of Gold Festival. He spent ten consecutive days painting the mural and when asked in an interview about his process, challenges, and color choices he stated 'My color selections were predetermined by the relationship of how each color transforms when laid on top of another. This was easy, however, in the designing of the mural I had to constantly move colors and shapes to finally get the final color arrangement you see. The biggest challenge for me during the Incognito mural was ensuring the proportions of the design were correct. I needed precision and a lot of it. The lines needed to be sharp and straight. If any line was miscalculated or skewed the design as a whole would suffer. This was my largest hurdle I had to overcome both with mapping it out and painting it. Later in the interview, Zawacki said, 'What I enjoy most about the Incognito design is the secondary shapes, and colors achieved from the overlapping of each arrow on top of another. There are many fun intersections of color and new shapes that emerge using this style of design. I look forward to exploring more in-depth into this style in the future in my indoor and outdoor works.' In March 2016 Zawacki, still using his moniker, 'ABOVE', had a solo exhibition in Z√ºrich, Switzerland titled '12 Months'. In a section of Zawacki's artist statement, he wrote, 'My intention with my recent body of work is to show the viewer a visual portrayal of associations, and experiences I‚Äôve had with each Month. This body of work explores new ways of incorporating my arrow icon into a variety of patterns, configurations, and abstract styles while using the entire color spectrum as my palette. My process started with reflecting back on each year, making detailed lists of colors, feelings, and associations I have with each month. I would use my written notes and transform these words into the visual designs of shape and color, you see in each painting. I aimed to create each work with a unique feeling, while still having consistency within the body of work. I intended to have my arrow icon act as a supporting role in every month's composition. My goal is to have the arrow interact, transform, and re-create its shape as much as possible, helping illustrate the emotion and feeling of each month. During my creative process, the consistent changing of colors, and emotions of each month both inspired, and challenged me.' In the summer of 2016, Zawacki served as artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts program at the Quin Hotel in New York City, furthering his exploration of geometric abstraction through colorful multi-layer arrow compositions. As curated by DK Johnston, the exhibit featured 36 works of handmade sculptural relief using acrylic and resin on wood. It opened on 14 July and was Zawacki's first solo show in New York City.  Metamorphosis (2017)  A trompe l'oeil style painting from Zawacki's Metamorphosis solo exhibition, Berlin, 2017 In January 2017, Zawacki decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of anonymity, and start creating, and signing his artworks with his real birth name ‚Äì allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as freedom from the arrow icon he had formerly associated himself with. He stated, 'My decision suddenly liberated me, as well as opened up creative ideas to a seemingly unlimited expansion of new opportunities. I see a new foundation to expand upon, free of any artistic restrictions, and my curiosity to push my creative limits to new, higher levels'. Zawacki debuted his museum-style solo exhibition titled, Metamorphosis in September 2017, at Urban Spree Galerie in Berlin. Metamorphosis' entire body of work was painted on large format canvases, and profiled four different painting styles, Op-Art, Trompe l'oeil, CMYK and Hard-edge painting. He described his exhibition: 'Metamorphosis is about transformation from one state into a newer dynamic one. With a lot of brutal honesty, and conviction for growth I was able to take inner inventory of what no longer served me. I was able to let go of the fears that were stifling my creative progression. I was prepared for feeling uncomfortable during this metamorphosis. I was learning how to unblock my personal censors, and be valiant in painting the styles of works I‚Äôve previously been too reluctant to paint.' Zawacki's Metamorphosis exhibition was the first time in his career that he made, and signed all his works with his real name. In September Zawacki's second book, also titled Metamorphosis, was published. Metamorphosis is a 168-page hardcover book covering his last 3 years of creative works, from his seminal 2014 Remix exhibition in Detroit to his latest and most ambitious show to date at Urban Spree Galerie in September 2017. The book covers all his outdoor murals during that period and illustrates how the artist navigates between his indoor and outdoor works and the influences thereof.  Shapeshifting (2018)  An abstract artwork from Tavar's solo exhibition, Shapeshifting, at Wunderkammern gallery in Milan, Italy. November 2018 In November 2018, Zawacki presented his solo exhibition, Shapeshifting at Wunderkammern gallery in Milan, Italy. For this occasion the artist has decided to reflect on the concept of metamorphosis intended in a personal and artistic sense, testing himself with the use of different types of shapes and colors. Artist Shepard Fairey wrote the introduction text for the Shapeshifting exhibition: \\"I have known Tavar Zawacki‚Äôs art for more than 15 years. I initially knew him by his street name, 'ABOVE'. Tavar impressed me with his dedication to mastering the most essential aspects of street art: widespread coverage, recognizable iconography, and impressive placements on the street in terms of risk and visual impact. It seems to me that two years ago Tavar Zawacki had pushed his anonymous ABOVE concept to the pinnacle of what is possible and respected in the street art world, and decided it was time to expand his parameters and evolve, stepping into the sunlight by using his birth name and evolving away from just his long-present arrow icon. However, Tavar did not abandon the fruits of his years of graphic mastery in form and color, he simply chose to apply them in broader, more ambitious, and more sophisticated ways. The recent works in the street and the studio leading up to his Shapeshifting exhibition are the most visually dynamic but seductive pieces of Tavar's career. Sometimes the fundamental ingredients are there, but it takes the subtle moves to yield sublime alchemy. Tavar‚Äôs newest works embody power and beauty in elegant harmony, but especially the pieces that utilize trompe l‚Äôoeil push beyond design-based art to create a provocatively surreal 2D/3D dialogue that distinguishes them. Tavar‚Äôs 2D/3D dialogue extends to three-dimensional pieces using gradients to mimic light play on reflective surfaces and cast shadows. Tavar has evolved and in the process developed a truly distinctive, powerful but luxurious, visual language.\\"  Metamorphosis #5 (2019)  In September 2019, Tavar was commissioned by one of the oldest public arts institutions in the United States, The Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery Museum in Buffalo, New York for their largest and most ambitious public art project, as well as Tavar's largest mural of his career. Tavar's Metamorphosis #5 mural received a lot of media attention from the city of Buffalo, as his mural is the largest public art mural not only in Buffalo but all of Western New York. When interviewed by local TV channel NBC WGRZ Channel 2 about his mural he stated 'If you look at it closely you can see an upward pointing arrow symbol that represents a 'rise above' mentality. For me now, I'm actually more interested in the abstract shapes that compose the design. Tavar continues to say, 'I think what's great is the mural it's open to interpretation, that's why I love abstract art, each person can see it for what they want. Some people might not even see the arrows, which I think is great.' Aaron Ott, Curator of Public Art for the Albright Knox Museum said this about Zawacki's mural. 'Recently he's begun to expand his practice. The Metamorphosis #5 mural is an expansion of his studio practice, something that he wants to share with people, that is hopeful, but also talks about the kind of energy that you get from the streets but that you can share throughout the world in museum settings, galleries, and here, with public art.\\"  NFL Super Bowl (2020)  Tavar collaborated with Wilson football and the National Football League to create a design on 104 limited edition footballs for the Super Bowl LIV which took place on Monday, February 03, 2020, in Miami, Florida.

His large scale trademark arrows were painted on a roll down gates, trucks, and storefronts with impressive coverage throughout the city. Above is extraordinarily driven. To paraphrase Radiohead, \\"ambition can make you look pretty ugly,\\" but in Above's case, his ambition makes the streets look very engaging. I am very impressed by Above's diligence, but after I got to know him and his artwork more, I began to realize that his output is not evidence of selfish ego, but of a lust for life, a utopian life, where his generosity, and curiosity, and his pursuit of creativity and social-consciousness have led him around the world making more friends than enemies. Above made the time to act as a tour guide for me and my wife and our two young daughters in a city he knows well and we didn't. The gesture made me greatly value Above's friendship and reinforced my belief that what you give is what you get.

Fox) state July 23; some others state July 24 ‚Äì August 15, 2014) was an Italian-born American operatic soprano. Noted especially for her portrayals of the lyric heroines of Verdi and Puccini, Albanese was a leading artist with the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1966. She also made many recordings and was chairwoman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation, which is dedicated to assisting young artists and singers. Life and career Felicia Albanese was born in 1909 in Torre Pelosa, (a subdivision of Noicattaro, Italy), later become Torre a Mare, a quarter of Bari (the chief town of the Apulia region).Petition for Naturalization: Licia Albanese GimmaFor some years before her death, many print and online resources gave her birth year as 1913, and this was the year used by many reports of her death and obituaries. Licia Albanese obituary by Alan Blyth, The Guardian, 19 August 2014 She made her unofficial debut in Milan in 1934, when she replaced another soprano in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, the role for which she would be celebrated. Over 40 years, she sang more than 300 performances of Cio-Cio-San. Although she has been praised for many of her roles, including Mim√¨, Violetta, Li√π and Manon Lescaut, it is her portrayal of the geisha which has remained her best known. Her connection with that work began early with her teacher, Giuseppina Baldassare-Tedeschi, a contemporary of the composer, and an important exponent of the title role in the previous generation. There is some controversy regarding when she made her formal debut. It was either in that same year (1934) at the Teatro Municipale in Bari, singing in La boh√®me, or in Parma, or in Milan in 1935 in Madama Butterfly. By the end of that year, she had debuted at La Scala as Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi. She soon realized great success all over the world, especially for her performances in Carmen, L'amico Fritz and Madama Butterfly in Italy, France and England. Albanese made her Metropolitan Opera debut on February 9, 1940, in the first of 72 performances as Madama Butterfly at the old Metropolitan Opera House in spite of the fact that after the December 7, 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, performances of that opera were banned in the U.S. until the end of World War II. Her success was instantaneous, and Albanese remained at the Met for 26 seasons, performing a total of 427 performances of 17 roles in 16 operas. She left the company in 1966 in a dispute with General Manager Sir Rudolf Bing, without a grand farewell. After performing in four productions during 1965/66, she was scheduled for only one performance the next season. She returned her contract unsigned. Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to join his broadcast concert performances of La boh√®me and La traviata with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in NBC's Studio 8H in 1946. Both performances were later issued on LP and CD by RCA Victor. In 1959, Albanese sang for thousands of radio listeners in collaboration with Alfredo Antonini, Richard Tucker and members of the New York Philharmonic during the popular \\"Italian Night\\" broadcasts from Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.Stadium Concerts Review ‚Äì Stadium Symphony Orchestra, Herald Square Press, Volume XLII, No. 1 22 June 1959, p. 17 Stadium Concerts Review program listing for Licia Albanese, Alfredo Antonini, Richard Tucker and The New York Philharmonic on 25 June 1959 p. 17 on nyphil.org She and her colleagues were showcased in selections from operas by Giacomo Puccini including: Tosca, La boh√®me, Turandot, Manon Lescaut and Madama Butterfly.Licia Albanese, Alfredo Antonini, Richard Tucker, performing at Lewisohn Stadium on wqxr.org She was also a mainstay at the San Francisco Opera where she sang between 1941 and 1961, performing 22 roles in 120 performances over 20 seasons, remaining in part because of her admiration for its director, Gaetano Merola. Throughout her career, she continued to perform widely in recital, concert, and opera, she was heard throughout the country; she participated in benefits, entertained the troops, had her own weekly radio show, was a guest on other broadcasts and telecasts, and recorded frequently. Albanese went to San Francisco in the summer of 1972 for the special gala concert at Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove celebrating the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Opera. Joining numerous colleagues who had sung with the company, Albanese sang the duet from Madama Butterfly with tenor Frederick Jagel, accompanied by the San Francisco Opera Orchestra conducted by longtime director Kurt Herbert Adler. Even after a career spanning seven decades, Albanese continued to perform occasionally. After hearing her sing the national anthem during a Met opening, Stephen Sondheim and Thomas Z. Shepard cast her as operetta diva Heidi Schiller in Sondheim's Follies in concert with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in 1985. During the 1987 spring season of the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston, Texas, Albanese starred in a stage revival of Follies, which was a great success. Albanese died on August 15, 2014, at the age of 105 in her home in Manhattan.\\"Licia Albanese, Exalted Soprano, Is Dead at 105\\" by Margalit Fox, The New York Times, August 16, 2014 Her popularity in La traviata was such that she sang more performances of that opera at the Met and the San Francisco Opera than any other singer in either company's history. Schuyler Chapin describes her as \\"a splendid former prima donna of the Italian repertoire, remembered by old-timers as the frailest Mim√¨, the tenderest Butterfly, and perhaps the most haunting of modern Violettas.\\" Her voice had a distinctive character which the Italians call a lirico spinto, marked by its quick vibrato, incisive diction, intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact. During her career she performed with many of the contemporary greats of opera‚ÄîBeniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Jussi Bj√∂rling, and Franco Corelli. She worked with some of the best conductors of her time, but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured. Despite her talent and numerous performances, she was not the best known of her contemporaries, overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Victoria de los √Ångeles and Renata Tebaldi. Alfredo Vecchio, a frequent member of the audience at her performances, gave the following tribute to the career of Albanese at the Columbus Club, Park Avenue, New York City, in 1986: > Like all great artists, Licia's specific ingenuity as a singer, the > originality of her art, lay in the fact that technique for this artist at > least was always a means to an end and never an end in itself: for the > salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the > emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the > musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she > acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was > this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, > into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after > week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been > before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of > Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our > times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of > effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the > lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard > her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she > was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.Vecchio, Alfredo, A > Tribute to Mme. Albanese To all of her work, Albanese brought passion and commitment, with her rich soprano voice, equalized throughout its range, thrilling in its climaxes. However, despite her repeated performances, she never fell into routine. As she explained in a 2004 interview with Allan Ulrich of the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"I always changed every performance. I was never boring, and I am against copying. What I learned from the great singers was not to copy, but that the drama is in the music.\\"Davis, Dan, \\"Licia Albanese\\" (review) Recordings and legacy Albanese appeared in the very first live telecast from the Metropolitan Opera, Verdi's Otello, opposite Ram√≥n Vinay and Leonard Warren, conducted by Fritz Busch. One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio, her performances, now reappearing on both compact disc and video, have provided a lasting testament to her ability. From these recordings, future generations will be able to form some impression of what she was like as a singer and to understand what made her unique as an artist. Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to sing Mim√¨ in the 1946 NBC Symphony Orchestra performance of La boh√®me. The broadcast marked the 50th anniversary of the opera's premiere which he had conducted in 1896. The following season Toscanini cast her again, this time as Violetta in a now- classic performance of La traviata, broadcast nationally on NBC Radio on December 1 and 8, 1946. Both performances were subsequently released on records by RCA Victor and have since continuously remained in print. Albanese was noted for the grace with which she performed La traviata under the maestro's famously intense direction. \\"Maria Callas once asked me how I ever got through it, but Toscanini wanted it that way,\\" Albanese later recalled. \\"'It should be like champagne,' he said. I complained to him, and he said, 'You can do it.' Before I sang the part, I went to a hospital to study the behavior of people with tuberculosis and I learned that sometimes they can be hysterical.\\"Ulrich, Allan, \\"Many a tear was shed when soprano Licia Albanese sang. Now she is celebrating her signature work, Madama Butterfly\\", San Francisco Chronicle, October 4, 2004. She recorded mainly for RCA Victor. Among her recordings are Bizet's Carmen under the direction of Fritz Reiner, with Ris√´ Stevens and Jan Peerce (1951) and Puccini's Manon Lescaut with Jussi Bj√∂rling and Robert Merrill, conducted by Jonel Perlea (1954). For a 1951 recording conducted by Leopold Stokowski of Tatiana's Letter Scene from Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, a part she had never sung before, she learnt Russian especially for the occasion. Soprano Teresa Stratas was quoted as crediting a Metropolitan Opera performance of La traviata starring Albanese at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, with motivating her toward a singing career. Albanese was chairman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation, founded in 1974 and dedicated to assisting young artists and singers. She also served as a trustee of the Bagby Foundation. She worked with the Juilliard School of Music, the Manhattan School of Music, and Marymount Manhattan College, and conducted master classes throughout the world. National and international honors Albanese became a United States citizen in 1945. On October 5, 1995, President Bill Clinton presented her with the National Medal of Honor for the Arts. She received awards and honorary degrees from Marymount Manhattan College, Montclair State Teachers College, Saint Peter's College, New Jersey, Seton Hall University, University of South Florida, Fairfield University, Siena College, Caldwell College, and Fairleigh Dickinson University. She was awarded the prestigious Handel Medallion, the highest official honor given by the City of New York and presented to individuals for their contributions to the city's cultural life, from Rudolph Giuliani in 2000.

Indapur is known for Jahagir of Shivaji Maharaj's father and grandfather. Shivaji Maharaj's grandfather Malojiraje died in battle in Indapur. It has National Highway 65 connecting the south and west region of India. Indapur city is located to the nearest Bhima River, Ujani Dam & Baramati-the hometown of Indian politician Mr. Sharad Pawar. Demographics India census, Indapur had a population of 21,584. Men constitute 52% of the population and Women ~48%. Indapur has an average literacy rate of 69%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: Male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 62%. In Indapur, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age. Climate Indapur is a quiet hot place as it receives scanty rainfall. Shetphal lake is the major water reservoir in the district. Ujjani dam backwater along with Nira left canal and Khadakwasla canal system are major sources of irrigation and water supply for Indapur Taluka. Crops Crops like wheat, sugarcane and jowar are grown here. The place also owns many heavy machinery factories. The most noted among these is the ordnance factory of Government of India at Walchand Nagar. This factory holds great importance for the defense of India.  History  Indapur has historic significance in the expansion of Mughal empires in Central-South India, and subsequent Maratha resistance. Indapur was the Jagir of Malojiraje and Shahajiraje Bhosale. The historical place where Shivaji's grandfather Shri Malojiraje was living & died in a war. This place also known for the Shri 1008 Shantinath Digambar Jain Teerth Kshetra. Vishwasrao Peshwa of the Maratha Empire was born in Indapur. And Former Minister of Maharashtra Harshvardhan patil (Bhau) is from Indapur. He was four times MLA from indapur & also work as minister in maharashtra..  Malojiraje  Born to Babaji Bhosale, Malojiraje ( Grandfather of the great warrior, Shivajiraje) was a SARDAR under Nizamshah - the ruler of that region appointed by the Moghul emperor. At the start of his service, Malojiraje received the Jagir of Indapur and Supe from Nizamshah. In Indpaur Jagir there were about 34 villages. The neighboring ruler, Adilshah, was a constant threat to Nijamshah, mainly over territorial disputes. In the year 1599, AD, Malojiraje died fighting in the Indapur Battle against Adilshah; at that time, his son (and Shivaji's father) Shahajiraje was only 5 years old. The brother of Malojiraje, Vithojiraje gave 17.5 RUKE(Nearly 1 Acres) of land for the SAMADHI (final resting place) of Malojiraje. However, this structure was destroyed over the years. But the Footprints(PADUKA) on the Samadhi are in a good condition and put in the \\"Indreshwar Mandir\\" in Indapur.  Shahajiraje  After the death of Malojiraje his elder son Shahajiraje became Sardar of Nijamshah and again the Jagir of Indapur came under Shahajiraje and later on the same was transferred to Shivaji. While Shahajiraje was the Sardar of Adilshah, Nijamshah offered the Jagir of Indapur and Supe to him in order to get him back. From this incident, the importance of Indapur city is very much evident. Battle of Sinhagad In the year 1660, Indapur, Baramati and Pune had been captured by the Mogul army headed by Shaistekhan. Nearly 10 years later in 1670, the entire area was won back by the Maratha Army under the leadership of Shivaji in the battles starting from the battle of Sinhagad. In June 1670, the Mogul army was totally unprepared and ill-equipped as the Monsoon had arrived. Sensing this as a unique opportunity, before the preparation of the Mogul army, Shivaji decided to attack the urban area of Pune, Baramati, Supe and Indapur in the rainy season. Within 10‚Äì15 days, Marathas captured all these areas back from Mughals using their famous guerilla warfare techniques. Nearly 1500 Mogul infantry fled to Pune from Sinhagad after the battle. By the time rainy season started, Indapur , Baramati and many other regions, excluding Pune, were won by Marathas. This battle significantly boosted the confidence of Marathas and within two months after this battle, the Maratha army won all nearby forts like Purandar, Lohagad and so on. Nira Narsingpur Nira Narsingpur is a village in Indapur taluka of Pune district, Maharashtra, India.[1] The confluence of rivers Bhima and Nira is 3 km from the temple. The Shri Laxmi Narsimha Temple is the Kuldaiwat (family deity) for a number of Marathi families of different castes. This place gets its prominence because it is believed that Prahllad took a bath in this Bhima river and with his hand he made an idol of \\"Lord Narasimha (Lion Faced God)\\" with the sand and worshipped Him. The idol made of sand of \\"Lord Narasimha\\" is still intact by the magic of science. This had been smeared in the past by the diamond powder by then Winchurkar's (now Parvatikar) ancestors of the family all over the idol, which does not disintegrate the sand. This sounds strange but it's true. Recently within 2‚Äì4 years one person by name Mr. Dandawate who stays in this place got this the diamond mixture imported from United States and smeared it again on this idol to increase the life of the idol. The story of the Lord Narasimha temple goes back to history. In olden times there was a demon called Hiranya-kashayap who was the king. He was an atheist who envied Lord Narayana (Shri Hari), because his brother Hiranyaksha had been killed by Lord Narayana earlier. Hiranya-kashyap was a self-proclaimed god. He was cruel to people who did not accept him as a god. He punished the people who offered special poojas (Yagnya, Homa) conducted by sages to please Lord Narayana. However, without his knowledge, his wife worshipped Lord Narayana and she was a great devotee of Lord Narayana, by the virtue of which both the couple gave birth to a son who was named Prahllad. Prahllad was not an ordinary child. He was an extraordinary child blessed by Lord Narayana who by birth had spiritual powers. His face glowed like a moon and he was filled with utmost devotion towards Lord Narayana, unlike his father. As soon as the child Prahllad was of age between 5‚Äì7 years, he was sent to Gurukoola (a residential school away from home where spiritual education takes place). Since this Gurukoola was owned by his father Hiranya-Kashyap, instead of worshiping the Lord Narayana they thought here to worship the idol of his father. He denied this and started to chant Lord Narayana's mantra, \\"Om Namo Narayanaya\\". This continued and all his school mates continued to meditate on Lord Narayana only. When this came to the knowledge of Hiranya-Kashyap he was furious. He tried to convince Prahllad to chant his name and worship him like a god. But Prahllad was a hard core devotee of Lord Narayana and he never agreed. Though Prahllad was his own child the king did not forgive him; he started to punish him by asking the soldiers to beat him with a rope. But the rope turned into a flower garland by the grace of Lord Narayana. Like this there were several incidents which did not shake Prahllad's faith towards Lord Narasimha. Hiranya-Kashayap was fed up with this kid Prahllad. Once he took him to the palace and wanted to check his faith and belief. Wanting to put an end to the child's devotion, he asked Prahllad, \\"Can you show me  where's your god? Where's Lord Narayana? Show him now, I want to see him.\\" Prahllad replied, \\"He is everywhere and is omnipresent.\\" The king laughed at the poor child and wanted to embarrass him so he asked the child whether \\"your Lord Narayana is present in the pillar.\\" \\"Yes,\\" came the reply. The king took his Gadha (a weapon shaped like a dome in the top which can be held at the bottom with two hands) and banged on the pillar. The pillar broke and the Lord Narayana, incarnated as \\"Lord Narasimha\\" (Lion Faced God), tore Hiranaya-Kashyap apart with his nails and killed the demon.

It is believed that the name of this village was earlier Dard which later became Indergaon. The ruler of Indergaon was Indersen Jat. He constructed a strong fort here, that gave this place the name Indergarh. The Jat rulers were of Dondaria gotra. Lt. General Khem Karan Singh was also from this clan. That time it was centre of collection of revenue of 58 villages. Demographics India census, Indergarh had a population of 23,045. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Indergarh has an average literacy rate of 79%, higher than the state average of 69%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 69%. In Indergarh, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age. History Maharaja Balwant Singh (dabariya Jat clan) in about 1650 A.D founded the Jat State of Indargarh. He is reputed to have had an ancestral patrimony around Shivpuri, some 65 miles West of Gwalior. Whether he emigrated under duress from Shivpuri or brighter prospect abroad beckoned him, or was enticed away from his native Shivpuri by promise of a larger patrimony by the Bundela Chiefs of Orchha and Datia, still remains an enigma. What however is unambiguous is that. Raja Balwan Singh's new principality in the Trans-Sind Region initially comprised some 40 villages along the South Bank of the Sind in the intervening tract between Datia and Seondha. As the principality of Datia was relatively weaker than that of Pichor, it is to be inferred that the principality of Indargarh may have been utilized as a convenient buffer by the Bundela chiefs to constrict Pichor's expansion South of the Sind. This stratagem might even have had the tacit acquiescence of the neighboring Kushwaha ruler of Narwar, who was actuated by a similar design towards Pichhor. Whether the tale is true or apocryphal is however difficult to discern. There is on the other hand no tradition of any enduring internecine feud between the neighboring Hindu Jat principalities of Pichhor and Indargarh. It is however probable that with the interposition of kindred hindu Jat principality as a buffer, the subsequent expansion of Pichhor was deflected Westwards beyond Bhitarwar in the Narwar territory and southeastwards towards Lahar and Daboh. Maharaja Balwant Singh was succeeded by his son Indar Singh who further enlarged his patrimony and built a stone fort, still extant, which even now perpetuates his name and memory. The principality of Indargarh remained unimpaired during Aurangzeb's and some of the later Mughals' reigns, but had rather a precarious existence during the ascendancy of the Marathas in the 18th century A.D. During this period, the ruler of Indargarh was sometimes constrained to side with the Marathas, the allies of the Bundela Chief, but when left uncoerced joined forces with the neighboring Jat Chiefs of Pichhor and Gohad to resist the Southern intruders. After the demise of Pichhor in 1816 A.D, the Jat principality of Indargarh was also obliterated by the connivance of the Marathas in the beginning of 1817 A.D. and its ruler like his kinsmen of Pichhor and Gohad forced into exile. After the fall of Indargarh all the Jat forts have remained untenanted in this region; staggered in a line between Bhind and Jhansi, they are now like a row of avenging ghosts rather than abodes of patricians of yesteryears.

It is located in the municipality of ƒåukarica.  Location  Umka is located south- west of Belgrade, on the right bank of the Sava river, close to river's . It is a crossroads on the IB-26 highway, with roads connecting it with another important highway to the east, the Ibarska magistrala.  Administration  Umka was a separate municipality, comprising surrounding villages of Rucka and Peƒáani which had a population 3,044 by the 1953 census. It was later enlarged with several surrounding villages, but the municipality was ultimately dissolved in 1960 and divided between ƒåukarica (Umka, Rucka and Peƒáani) and Barajevo (Meljak and Vraniƒá).  Geography  One of the characteristics of the Belgrade city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the \\"high risk\\". They cover almost 30% of the city territory. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20 degrees and Umka, especially its neighborhood of Duboko, is one of the largest and most active. The creep stretches into the municipality of Obrenovac. The settlement Duboko, on the creep, developed in the 1960s. It is unevenly constructed, with over 500 houses and other objects. Historically, the largest movements of the land occurred in 1914, 1941, 1978, 1982 and 2005. The creep itself is triangularly shaped, on the long slope, wide at the base, with the average inclination of 9 degrees. It covers an area of and is deep on average. The mass wasting causes the damages on the houses and the freeway which sink and get ruptured constantly. Damages are being repaired and patched but the massive project of stopping down the terrain is found to be too expensive. It caused the problem for the route of the future A2 motorway, as the Belgrade City government planned to conduct the road on the left bank of the Sava, in the flat Syrmia region, bypassing the mass wasting area, while the government of Serbia pushed the right bank route. Ensuing debate became highly political and resulted in open clash between the Belgrade's mayor Nenad Bogdanoviƒá and Serbian minister for capital investments Velimir Iliƒá in 2006. In the end, in March 2017 the construction of the motorway through Syrmia began. The projected cost of repairing Duboko is over 30 million euros. The most likely process would be a massive filling up of the area with stone, which would shift the river current from the right side, where it erodes the creep, to the left, Syrmian side.  Population  Umka is classified as an urban settlement (town), but many published sources refer to it as varo≈°ica (small town) even though statistically there is no such classification. The settlement experienced high growth of population after World War II, but has stagnated in the last four decades. New tourist settlement (vikend naselje) is built on the bank of the Sava. According to the 2011 census, the population of Umka was 5,272. Umka makes a continuous built-up urban area with the neighboring urban settlements of Peƒáani (pop. 562 in 2011) and Rucka (pop. 316).  Economy  Umka was well known in former Yugoslavia for its two major factories: Zelengora, the knitted goods manufacturer and general representative for the Speedo swimsuits, and Umka cardboard factory. Both factories followed the destiny of other companies during the economic collapse in the 1990s. Umka also has an advanced agricultural farm. In 1928, a railway tunnel was dug at Umka. It was part of the Belgrade-Dubrovnik narrow gauge railway. The long tunnel was later abandoned when the narrow gauge railways were discontinued and the gas pipeline was conducted through a part of it. As of 2018, the entrance into the tunnel is accessible.

The school here was part of the chain of schools called Atomic Energy Central School. Etymology The name \\"Jadugora\\" or \\"Jadugoda\\" has been derived from the word \\"Jadagoda\\", which means 'land of elephants in a local tribal language.

Another beautiful place to visit is Galudi Bridge, which is around 5km from UCIL colony towards Musabani. This bridge is the largest bridge/stop dam on Subarnarekha River. River Gudru, which is an important tributary of Subernarekha meets with it here. As per tradition, gold was mined near the origin of the river at a village named piska near Ranchi. This is why it was named Subarnarekha, meaning \\"streak of gold\\". Legend has it that traces of gold were found in the river bed. Even now, people look for traces of gold particles in its sandy beds. The name is a combination of two words meaning gold and line/ streak in Indian languages. UCIL Residential colony is very close to small hills which provides good adventure and sight seeing opportunity to the residents and visitors. Aam Jharna is located just opposite of the UCIL residential colony. This place is known for its scenic beauty. It is a very good picnic spot in Jadugoda.

Uranium Mines at Jadugoda & Narwapahar Jadugora or Jadugoda is the headquarters of Uranium Corporation of India Limited (A Govt of India Enterprise). It was established in the late 1960s due to presence of rich ore of Uranium. The Uranium Corporation of India Ltd. (UCIL) recently completed its project of uranium Mining and Mill at Narwapahar, Jharkhand. Adequate resources of uranium in Jaduguda uranium mine have been identified to meet the requirements of India's nuclear power program. The uranium deposit at Jaduguda, Singhbhum district, Jharkhand, has been under exploitation since 1962. The uranium deposits at Bhatin and Narwapahar are currently being exploited. Ore from the three deposits is treated in a mill at Jaduguda in the Singhbhum region, and the yield is 300 tons of uranium per year, which is more than sufficient to meet expected requirements for years. The Narwapahar mine, 12 km north west of Jaduguda, is one of the most modern mines in the country. The new uranium mine, Narwapahar Mine, was built with Russian technology. Trackless mining equipment are in use for the first time in the country. Mine development progress rates of over 300 meters per month have been achieved and the underground output per man shift is 1.9 tonnes, which is considered to be best in the country. The Narwapahar mine is worked by a decline and a vertical shaft. The decline has the advantage that heavy equipment can be lowered to the working area without dismantling. The shaft is used for hoisting ore and movement of personnel.

He died in office in 1981 and was replaced in parliament by the first Social Democratic Party member to be elected, the former Labour Education Minister Shirley Williams. With W.J. Leaper, Page wrote a book called Rent Act 1965 in 1966. He corresponded with Winston Churchill and Enoch Powell. He was a governor of St. Thomas's Hospital, London, and the chairman of the Pedestrians' Association. Death Page's death, aged 70, caused a high-profile by-election in which Shirley Williams became the first Social Democratic Party MP to be elected in Britain. It was a shock result which overturned a 19,272 Conservative majority Sir Graham had won in 1979. However, the Conservatives regained the seat in 1983.

The single-seat low-wing monoplane was to serve as a multi-purpose fighter and escort to replace all other fighters in the Polish Air Force. Designed after 1936, its prototype first flew in February 1939. A further two prototypes were under construction by the time of the Invasion of Poland, but the fighter never entered mass production. Design and development In early 1930s the Polish Air Force was equipped with the then state-of-the-art PZL P.11 all-metal high-wing monoplanes, the latest of a family of fighter aircraft designed by Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski. However, by the end of decade they had become obsolete, as new fighter and bomber aircraft with higher performance started to appear. There was no development carried out on other fighters, apart from PZL P.24 export variants of Pu≈Çawski's P.11 design. By the mid-1930s, the Polish Air Force Command led by Gen. Ludomi≈Ç Rayski expected, that a basic Polish general-purpose fighter and light bomber would be a twin-engine heavy fighter-bomber PZL.38 Wilk, supplemented by a light, cheap low-wing monoplane PZL.39/LWS-4. While potentially a suitable design, the PZL.38 had problems finding proper engines and the estimated performance of the PZL.39 was too low (maximum speed ), resulting in both programs being canceled.Gruszczy≈Ñski, Jerzy. JastrzƒÖb nie zdƒÖ≈ºy≈Ç.... pp. 46‚Äì53. Future wartime experience showed, that heavy fighters were not well matched against fast single-engine interceptors. It became evident that the Air Force needed a modern interceptor aircraft to defend the country, and at last, in October 1936, the Armament Committee (KSUS) submitted a demand for such an interceptor. In late 1936, Rayski ordered the PZL (National Aviation Works)'s Chief Designer Wsiewo≈Çod Jakimiuk, a lead designer of the P.11c, to abandon work on the PZL.44 Wicher passenger airliner, and to start work on a modern single-engine fighter with retractable landing gear and a speed of some . At the same time, Rayski selected the British 840 hp Bristol Mercury VIII radial engine as the project's powerplant. PZL had already manufactured Mercury V engines and would be able to retool to build the later version, as a Polish-produced engine was one of primary considerations in the design. This choice however restricted performance of the future fighter, and, according to historians, the whole program started at least two years too late.Cynk, Jerzy B. \\"PZL.50 JastrzƒÖb w prawdziwej postaci ('The PZL.50 JastrzƒÖb in an authentic shape')\\". Skrzydlata Polska, nr. 6/2005, p. 59. The project PZL.50 (or PZL P.50) and named JastrzƒÖb (Hawk), started in late 1936. The design was accepted by the Air Force Command in 1937 and two prototypes were ordered. In June 1938, 300 Mercury VIII engines were also ordered for the PZL, the first to be delivered in June 1939. The engine for the prototype was imported from Great Britain and fitted in September 1938. The prototype was almost ready by October, but its completion was delayed by the lack of a retractable landing gear, delivered by the British Dowty firm.Cynk 1962, p. 387. Due to the delay, the Polish aviation authorities missed the chance of starting flying tests with some temporary fixed landing gear, since Polish industry had not yet produced suitable retractable gears. Avia-manufactured undercarriage units were specified for the production series. Finally, the first prototype PZL.50/I was completed and flown in late February 1939 by pilot Jerzy Widawski. Despite being officially classified as a secret, on 27 February it was on static display for the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano.Cynk 1962, p. 386. Tests were carried out mainly by Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski and several other pilots who noted that the prototype, after modifications to the tail, exhibited satisfactory handling and maneuverability characteristics although it was not agile enough as an interceptor.Cynk 1962, pp. 387‚Äì388. The greatest concern was that even without radio and machine guns, it was able to achieve only .Cynk 1962, p. 388. The Mercury VIII engine had problems with delivering full power due to an unsuitable carburetor intake and, after modifications, the prototype was able to reach . Test pilots continued to complain about power output being too low, although with a better engine, some observers estimated that a production example would have been able to top It was first planned to order 300 P.50s,Glass 2008, p. 130. but in April 1939, the new Air Force Commander Gen. Kalkus and Air Defence Inspector Gen. J√≥zef ZajƒÖc estimated that the current PZL.50 design did not meet its specified performance goals and ordered PZL to develop it further, building an improved pattern aircraft with only a limited series of 25-30 aircraft on order, designated the P.50A.Cynk, Jerzy B. JastrzƒÖb ujawniony, pp. 55‚Äì60.Green 1961, p. 121. Production aircraft were to have the wing area increased from 15.8 m¬≤ to 19 m¬≤. The total planned order was decreased to 200 and Poland started to look for fighters abroad, ordering 160 Morane-Saulnier MS 406 fighters from France. As an interim measure, 100 PZL P.11g Kobuz fighters were ordered, fitting the P.11c airframe with Mercury VIII engines. The second prototype PZL.50/II was to be equipped with a more powerful 1,200-1,400 hp engine, but never was. Only in 1939, was the PZL.50/II reworked with a 1,100 hp Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N21 for an export variant P.50B (estimated maximum speed ) or 1,150 hp Bristol Taurus III or IV for the Polish Air Force (estimated speed ). The Gnome-Rhone engine was only delivered in August 1939, while the newest British Taurus was scheduled to be delivered in October or November, but final deliveries were prevented by war. Nonetheless Taurus development had proved to be troublesome. Other possible engine alternatives were the Polish PZL Waran engine, which was to be ready in spring 1940, the 1,000 hp Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp or 1,375 hp Bristol Hercules. As early as 1938, Jakimiuk proposed a variant with the 1,100 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Y inline engine, designated PZL.56 Kania, but it was not accepted. Operational history By the end of August 1939, the first unarmed flying prototype PZL.50/I, the second incomplete and engine-less prototype PZL.50/II, an incomplete preliminary PZL.50. and parts of four PZL.50As were all that was completed. The first prototype had a short fairing behind the canopy, all the others were distinguished by having a cut down rear fuselage to accommodate an \\"all-round vision hood\\". The production series would have incorporated a different canopy and a ventral fuselage fairing. After the German invasion and outbreak of World War II, on 2‚Äì3 September 1939, two incomplete aircraft (pattern PZL.50 and PZL.50/II) were moved from the WP-1 factory in Warsaw to car workshops at Czerniakowska Street in Warsaw, where they were captured by the Germans, and possibly scrapped after 1940. The first prototype was flown east by Jan Widawski towards Lw√≥w on 6 September, but crash landed near Rawa Ruska upon running out of fuel. Because of the secrecy surrounding the aircraft, for over 65 years its existence was only partly known based on four photographs of fragments of the first prototype, made during a presentation to Ciano, two of which are shown in the book, Polish Aircraft 1893-1939 by Jerzy Cynk, which also contains representative drawings of the aircraft.Cynk 1971, pp. 259‚Äì265. Only in 2005 were a couple of photographs discovered that showed two incomplete aircraft at Czerniakowska street. The photographs made by German soldiers and a Polish amateur photographer, made it possible to authentically reconstruct the PZL.50's design features.

Environment and Health A South African Board Certified Candidate Clinical Metal Toxicologist, Carin Smit, visiting Faridkot city in Punjab, India, instrumental in having hair and urine samples taken (2008/9) of 149/53 children respectively, who affected with birth abnormalities including physical deformities, neurological and mental disorders. These samples were shipped to Microtrace Mineral Lab, Germany. At the onset of the action research project, it was expected that heavy metal / chemistry toxicity might be implicated as reasons why these children were so badly affected. Surprisingly, high levels of uranium were found in 88% of the samples, and in the case of one child, the levels were more than 60 times the maximum safe limit. A study, carried out amongst mentally retarded children in the Malwa region of Punjab, revealed 87% of children below 12 years and 82% beyond that age having uranium levels high enough to cause diseases, also uranium levels in samples of three kids from Kotkapura and Faridkot were 62, 44 and 27 times higher than normal. An investigation carried out The Observer newspaper, in 2009, revealed the possible that cause of contamination of soil and ground water in Malwa region of Punjab, to be the fly ash from coal burnt at thermal power plants, which contains high levels of uranium and ash as the region has state's two biggest coal-fired power stations. Unscientific farming practices, that emerged after the introduction of Green Revolution, are also alleged to be a reason for growing incidence of not just cancer but also, high rates of spontaneous abortions, reproductive ailments, genetic deformities, anaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting, fluorosis and a host of skin ailments including rashes and boils. A 2007 epidemiological study found that the surface waters of Malwa region are contaminated with arsenic, cadmium, chromium, selenium and mercury primarily due to the discharge of untreated waste water from surrounding industries. With increasing poisoning of the soil, the region once hailed as the home to the Green revolution, now due to excessive use of chemical fertilizer, is being termed the \\"Other Bhopal\\", and \\"even credit-takers of the Revolution have begun to admit they had been wrong, now that they see wastelands and lives lost to farmer suicides in this 'granary of India'\\".

The numerous water samples collected from various districts had testified that people in many parts of the state have been drinking water unfit for human consumption, which is officially stated to be a major cause of gastroenteritis in Punjab.

The city had a flourishing market, and was defended by a line of walls with 18 towers and by the castle of the Patriarchs. In 1420, it was annexed to the Republic of Venice, but its trades and industries did not suffer from the change, and the city maintained its privileges. In 1797, with the Treaty of Campo Formio, it was handed over to the Austrian Empire, and, after a short Napoleonic rule, it was included in the client Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. Tolmezzo became part of the new unified Kingdom of Italy in 1866. Main sights *The Duomo (cathedral) *Palazzo Campeis (late 18th century): Museum External links * (Map of Tolmezzo region).

A man named Legion appears and tells Jack that the power he seeks does exist and offers to share this power with him if Jack constructs an insane asylum for like-minded killers in Deadside ‚Äì the land of the dead. Proclaiming \\"for we are many!\\", Jack commits suicide. In the present day, Michael LeRoi becomes the current Shadow Man ‚Äì a lineage of voodoo warriors who protect the world of the living (known as Liveside) from threats crossing over from Deadside ‚Äì after the voodoo priestess Mama Nettie bonds the Mask of Shadows to him. Nettie has a prophetic dream that Legion is preparing to usher in the Apocalypse by claiming the Dark Souls ‚Äì the immortal souls of damned warriors ‚Äì and using them to create an immortal army and send it into Liveside. Nettie reveals that Michael cannot stop the Five, a group of serial killers recruited by Legion, without his powers. The Five, who each have a Dark Soul within them, are hiding in Liveside, where Michael's powers do not work during the day. Michael travels to Deadside with the use of his dead brother's teddy bear, which serves as a link between both worlds. After collecting all of the Dark Souls in Deadside and passing trials set by the gods of Deadside, Michael assembles a magic knife called the Eclipser. Returning to Liveside, Nettie uses the Eclipser to trigger an eclipse, which enables Michael to become the Shadow Man in Liveside. The ritual drains Nettie of her powers and causes her to go into a deep sleep. Michael returns to Deadside and finds the Asylum as well as the Dark Engine which powers it. Michael finds his long-dead brother Luke within the Dark Engine along with several paths to Liveside which lead to the hiding places of the Five. Michael defeats the Five and claims each of their souls in the process. During this time, Michael finds Jack the Ripper's diary, which contains instructions on how to shut down the Engine. Michael returns to Deadside and shuts down the Engine, giving Luke his teddy bear back. Luke reveals himself to be Legion in disguise. Legion reveals that he sent Nettie the dream so that Michael would be forced to collect all of the Dark Souls and confront Legion, enabling Legion to claim all of the souls at once and use them to power the Engine, creating his army and sending it into Liveside. After an intense battle, Michael gives Legion all of the souls, whose combined power overwhelms Legion and kills him, destroying the Asylum as well. However, Michael is now stranded in Deadside but embraces his position as lord of Deadside.

Geography Jalali is t .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Jalali It has an average elevation of 178 metres (583 feet).Gazetteer of District Aligarh 1926  History  Jama Masjid in Jalali Jalali is an ancient and historical town in the district of Aligarh and is known for its culture and traditions. Formerly known as Nilavati, Jalali was founded by Jalaluddin Khilji during the reign of Ghiyas ud-din Balban.Aligarh Gazetteer, Lucknow, Volume 6, 1926. One of the oldest inhabited sites in the district of Aligarh, Jalali has been a perfect example of communal harmony for decades. Jalali has been under the influence of Mughals and Britishers . Its history can be traced back to the 16th century (1628-1658) when Syeds migrated from Srinagar, Kashmir and settled down here. They are descendants of Shah-e-Hamdan Ameer Kabir Sayyed Ali Hamdani, a great Islamic Scholar and well known Sufi saint Syeds of Jalali were well educated and acquired good positions in Civil Services, Engineering, Education and Army. They owned the majority of agricultural and residential lands in and around Jalali. Jalali has good examples of old Mughal architecture. Though Syed were the most influential and powerful community in Jalali, they maintained religious and social harmony with other residents through which all were benefited with their education and rich culture. Jalali has been an active contributor in the development of the Urdu language. It produced a poet of international fame: Ustad Qamar Jalalvi. Some other well-known poets of Urdu who emerged from Jalali are Mohabbat Jalalvi, Peer Mohammad Gauhar Jalalvi, S. Shabber Husain Saher Jalalvi, S. Sajjad Hussain Hadaf Jalalvi, S. Ali Baqar Chacha Jalalvi (known for his humorous poems) and Syed Afsar Ali Baqa Jalalvi. Baqa Jalalvi, one of the greatest poets, wrote some marsiyas, nauhas and salams. His most well known marsiya is \\"Uffaqe shaam se utthi jo ghata zulmat ki\\". His father Sayyed Zille Hussain Fiza wrote a well-known marsiya \\"Andaleebe gule gulzaar risalat hun mein\\". He edited famous salam composed by Dilgeer: \\"Hai salaam us per jo baikas be padar be yaar tha\\".Another Marsiya composed by Syed Zille Hussain was \\"Hinda ne Jab ke Khwab Sunaya Yazeed ko\\". Imambargahs and mosques Jalali has many imambargahs and mosques. One of the finest imambargahs in Jalali is the Imambargah of S. Farzand Ali, which is over 200 years old. It is an imposing structure with a mosque inside. It can accommodate more than 5,000 persons at a time. In addition, women and children gather on the terrace of the imambargah and the mosque in large numbers on 9th of Muharram and on the occasion of Chehlum. Another famous Imambargah of Jalali is in mohalla 'Garhi', called Bara Imambara where a huge Alam of about 30 metres is hoisted on the morning of Ashura. The Ashura procession of Alam, Taazia, Taabut and Zuljinah ends here. A Persian inscription on Jama Masjid, Jalali An important landmark in Jalali is the historic Jama Masjid that is taken care by Sayyids of Jalali. It was built by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban and is over 700 years old. The masjid bears an inscription with the name of Balban dated 665 Hijri or 1267 AD. The mosque is well maintained and is looked after by a trustee appointed by Shia Waqf Board, Lucknow. The photograph of the mosque and its brief history along with the inscriptions of Sultan Balban, Mohammad Shah and Jalaluddin Akbar was published in the Archaeological Survey of India, 1936. The mosque was renovated and rebuilt by Haji Syed Mehdi Ali of Jalali in 1901. The original mosque had one dome. Two more domes were built by Haji Mehdi Ali who also added a golden kalas on top of each. An account of the contributions of Haji Mehdi Ali is engraved in Persian on the marble stone which forms part of the middle arch of the mosque. In 1826, the arch in the middle of the mosque near mimbar was built by Syed Ahmed Hussain. An engraved stone just above the arch gives complete details. A shia procession during 19th Chehlum Agriculture Jalali is famous for its fertile agricultural lands. The name of Jalali was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in one of his famous travelogues, Rihla. It is also known by the name of S. Mohammad Husain Qamar Jalalvi, who paid a tribute to Jalali in one of his couplets: :\\"Her sans ghaneemat hey mera ahl-e-watan ko / Duniya mein Jalali Ki hawa bandh raha hun\\".

In formulas, this binary operation is indicated by \\"implies\\", \\"if ..., then ...\\", \\"‚Üí\\", \\"\\\\rightarrow \\", etc.. Virtual completeness as an operator Implication alone is not functionally complete as a logical operator because one cannot form all other two-valued truth functions from it. However, if one has a propositional formula which is known to be false and uses that as if it were a nullary connective for falsity, then one can define all other truth functions. So implication is virtually complete as an operator. If P,Q, and F are propositions and F is known to be false, then: *¬¨P is equivalent to P ‚Üí F *P ‚àß Q is equivalent to (P ‚Üí (Q ‚Üí F)) ‚Üí F *P ‚à® Q is equivalent to (P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üí Q *P ‚Üî Q is equivalent to ((P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üí ((Q ‚Üí P) ‚Üí F)) ‚Üí F More generally, since the above operators are known to be functionally complete, it follows that any truth function can be expressed in terms of \\"‚Üí\\" and \\"F\\", if we have a proposition F which is known to be false. It is worth noting that F is not definable from ‚Üí and arbitrary sentence variables: any formula constructed from ‚Üí and propositional variables must receive the value true when all of its variables are evaluated to true. It follows as a corollary that {‚Üí} is not functionally complete. It cannot, for example, be used to define the two-place truth function that always returns false. Axiom system The following statements are considered tautologies (irreducible and intuitively true, by definition). *Axiom schema 1 is P ‚Üí (Q ‚Üí P). *Axiom schema 2 is (P ‚Üí (Q ‚Üí R)) ‚Üí ((P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üí (P ‚Üí R)). *Axiom schema 3 (Peirce's law) is ((P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üí P) ‚Üí P. *The one non-nullary rule of inference (modus ponens) is: from P and P ‚Üí Q infer Q. Where in each case, P, Q, and R may be replaced by any formulas which contain only \\"‚Üí\\" as a connective. If Œì is a set of formulas and A a formula, then \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A means that A is derivable using the axioms and rules above and formulas from Œì as additional hypotheses. ≈Åukasiewicz (1948) found an axiom system for the implicational calculus, which replaces the schemas 1‚Äì3 above with a single schema *((P ‚Üí Q) ‚Üí R) ‚Üí ((R ‚Üí P) ‚Üí (S ‚Üí P)). He also argued that there is no shorter axiom system. Basic properties of derivation Since all axioms and rules of the calculus are schemata, derivation is closed under substitution: :If \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A, then \\\\sigma(\\\\Gamma)\\\\vdash\\\\sigma(A), where œÉ is any substitution (of formulas using only implication). The implicational propositional calculus also satisfies the deduction theorem: :If \\\\Gamma,A\\\\vdash B, then \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A\\\\to B. As explained in the deduction theorem article, this holds for any axiomatic extension of the system containing axiom schemas 1 and 2 above and modus ponens. Completeness The implicational propositional calculus is semantically complete with respect to the usual two-valued semantics of classical propositional logic. That is, if Œì is a set of implicational formulas, and A is an implicational formula entailed by Œì, then \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A. Proof A proof of the completeness theorem is outlined below. First, using the compactness theorem and the deduction theorem, we may reduce the completeness theorem to its special case with empty Œì, i.e., we only need to show that every tautology is derivable in the system. The proof is similar to completeness of full propositional logic, but it also uses the following idea to overcome the functional incompleteness of implication. If A and F are formulas, then is equivalent to where A* is the result of replacing in A all, some, or none of the occurrences of F by falsity. Similarly, is equivalent to So under some conditions, one can use them as substitutes for saying A* is false or A* is true respectively. We first observe some basic facts about derivability: ::Indeed, we can derive A ‚Üí (B ‚Üí C) using Axiom 1, and then derive A ‚Üí C by modus ponens (twice) from Ax. 2. ::This follows from () by the deduction theorem. ::If we further assume C ‚Üí B, we can derive using (), then we derive C by modus ponens. This shows A\\\\to C,(A\\\\to B)\\\\to C,C\\\\to B\\\\vdash C, and the deduction theorem gives A\\\\to C,(A\\\\to B)\\\\to C\\\\vdash(C\\\\to B)\\\\to C. We apply Ax. 3 to obtain (). Let F be an arbitrary fixed formula. For any formula A, we define and Consider only formulas in propositional variables p1, ..., pn. We claim that for every formula A in these variables and every truth assignment e, We prove () by induction on A. The base case A = pi is trivial. Let We distinguish three cases: #e(C) = 1. Then also e(A) = 1. We have #::(C\\\\to F)\\\\to F\\\\vdash((B\\\\to C)\\\\to F)\\\\to F #:by applying () twice to the axiom Since we have derived by the induction hypothesis, we can infer #e(B) = 0. Then again e(A) = 1. The deduction theorem applied to () gives #::B\\\\to F\\\\vdash((B\\\\to C)\\\\to F)\\\\to F. #:Since we have derived by the induction hypothesis, we can infer #e(B) = 1 and e(C) = 0. Then e(A) = 0. We have #::\\\\begin{align}(B\\\\to F)\\\\to F,C\\\\to F,B\\\\to C&\\\\vdash B\\\\to F&&\\\\text{by (1)}\\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\vdash F&&\\\\text{by modus ponens,}\\\\end{align} #:thus (B\\\\to F)\\\\to F,C\\\\to F\\\\vdash(B\\\\to C)\\\\to F by the deduction theorem. We have derived and by the induction hypothesis, hence we can infer This completes the proof of (). Now let F be a tautology in variables p1, ..., pn. We will prove by reverse induction on k = n,...,0 that for every assignment e, The base case k = n follows from a special case of () using : F^{e(F)} = F^1 = ((F \\\\to F) \\\\to F) and the fact that F‚ÜíF is a theorem by the deduction theorem. Assume that () holds for k + 1, we will show it for k. By applying deduction theorem to the induction hypothesis, we obtain :\\\\begin{align}p_1^{e(p_1)},\\\\dots,p_k^{e(p_k)}&\\\\vdash(p_{k+1}\\\\to F)\\\\to F,\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_1^{e(p_1)},\\\\dots,p_k^{e(p_k)}&\\\\vdash((p_{k+1}\\\\to F)\\\\to F)\\\\to F,\\\\end{align} by first setting e(pk+1) = 0 and second setting e(pk+1) = 1. From this we derive () using modus ponens. For k = 0 we obtain that the tautology F is provable without assumptions. This is what was to be proved. This proof is constructive. That is, given a tautology, one could actually follow the instructions and create a proof of it from the axioms. However, the length of such a proof increases exponentially with the number of propositional variables in the tautology, hence it is not a practical method for any but the very shortest tautologies.  The Bernays‚ÄìTarski axiom system  The Bernays‚ÄìTarski axiom system is often used. In particular, ≈Åukasiewicz's paper derives the Bernays‚ÄìTarski axioms from ≈Åukasiewicz's sole axiom as a means of showing its completeness. It differs from the axiom schemas above by replacing axiom schema 2, (P‚Üí(Q‚ÜíR))‚Üí((P‚ÜíQ)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR)), with * Axiom schema 2': (P‚ÜíQ)‚Üí((Q‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR)) which is called hypothetical syllogism. This makes derivation of the deduction meta- theorem a little more difficult, but it can still be done. We show that from P‚Üí(Q‚ÜíR) and P‚ÜíQ one can derive P‚ÜíR. This fact can be used in lieu of axiom schema 2 to get the meta-theorem. # P‚Üí(Q‚ÜíR) given # P‚ÜíQ given # (P‚ÜíQ)‚Üí((Q‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR)) ax 2' # (Q‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR) mp 2,3 # (P‚Üí(Q‚ÜíR))‚Üí(((Q‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR))‚Üí(P‚Üí(P‚ÜíR))) ax 2' # ((Q‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR))‚Üí(P‚Üí(P‚ÜíR)) mp 1,5 # P‚Üí(P‚ÜíR) mp 4,6 # (P‚Üí(P‚ÜíR))‚Üí(((P‚ÜíR)‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR)) ax 2' # ((P‚ÜíR)‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR) mp 7,8 # (((P‚ÜíR)‚ÜíR)‚Üí(P‚ÜíR))‚Üí(P‚ÜíR) ax 3 # P‚ÜíR mp 9,10 qed  Testing whether a formula of the implicational propositional calculus is a tautology  In this case, a useful technique is to presume that the formula is not a tautology and attempt to find a valuation which makes it false. If one succeeds, then it is indeed not a tautology. If one fails, then it is a tautology. Example of a non- tautology: Suppose [(A‚ÜíB)‚Üí((C‚ÜíA)‚ÜíE)]‚Üí([F‚Üí((C‚ÜíD)‚ÜíE)]‚Üí[(A‚ÜíF)‚Üí(D‚ÜíE)]) is false. Then (A‚ÜíB)‚Üí((C‚ÜíA)‚ÜíE) is true; F‚Üí((C‚ÜíD)‚ÜíE) is true; A‚ÜíF is true; D is true; and E is false. Since D is true, C‚ÜíD is true. So the truth of F‚Üí((C‚ÜíD)‚ÜíE) is equivalent to the truth of F‚ÜíE. Then since E is false and F‚ÜíE is true, we get that F is false. Since A‚ÜíF is true, A is false. Thus A‚ÜíB is true and (C‚ÜíA)‚ÜíE is true. C‚ÜíA is false, so C is true. The value of B does not matter, so we can arbitrarily choose it to be true. Summing up, the valuation which sets B, C and D to be true and A, E and F to be false will make [(A‚ÜíB)‚Üí((C‚ÜíA)‚ÜíE)]‚Üí([F‚Üí((C‚ÜíD)‚ÜíE)]‚Üí[(A‚ÜíF)‚Üí(D‚ÜíE)]) false. So it is not a tautology. Example of a tautology: Suppose ((A‚ÜíB)‚ÜíC)‚Üí((C‚ÜíA)‚Üí(D‚ÜíA)) is false. Then (A‚ÜíB)‚ÜíC is true; C‚ÜíA is true; D is true; and A is false. Since A is false, A‚ÜíB is true. So C is true. Thus A must be true, contradicting the fact that it is false. Thus there is no valuation which makes ((A‚ÜíB)‚ÜíC)‚Üí((C‚ÜíA)‚Üí(D‚ÜíA)) false. Consequently, it is a tautology.  Adding an axiom schema  What would happen if another axiom schema were added to those listed above? There are two cases: (1) it is a tautology; or (2) it is not a tautology. If it is a tautology, then the set of theorems remains the set of tautologies as before. However, in some cases it may be possible to find significantly shorter proofs for theorems. Nevertheless, the minimum length of proofs of theorems will remain unbounded, that is, for any natural number n there will still be theorems which cannot be proved in n or fewer steps. If the new axiom schema is not a tautology, then every formula becomes a theorem (which makes the concept of a theorem useless in this case). What is more, there is then an upper bound on the minimum length of a proof of every formula, because there is a common method for proving every formula. For example, suppose the new axiom schema were ((B‚ÜíC)‚ÜíC)‚ÜíB. Then ((A‚Üí(A‚ÜíA))‚Üí(A‚ÜíA))‚ÜíA is an instance (one of the new axioms) and also not a tautology. But [((A‚Üí(A‚ÜíA))‚Üí(A‚ÜíA))‚ÜíA]‚ÜíA is a tautology and thus a theorem due to the old axioms (using the completeness result above). Applying modus ponens, we get that A is a theorem of the extended system. Then all one has to do to prove any formula is to replace A by the desired formula throughout the proof of A. This proof will have the same number of steps as the proof of A.  An alternative axiomatization  The axioms listed above primarily work through the deduction metatheorem to arrive at completeness. Here is another axiom system which aims directly at completeness without going through the deduction metatheorem. First we have axiom schemas which are designed to efficiently prove the subset of tautologies which contain only one propositional variable. * aa 1: ÍûàA‚ÜíA * aa 2: (A‚ÜíB)‚ÜíÍûà(A‚Üí(C‚ÜíB)) * aa 3: A‚Üí((B‚ÜíC)‚ÜíÍûà((A‚ÜíB)‚ÜíC)) * aa 4: A‚ÜíÍûà(B‚ÜíA) The proof of each such tautology would begin with two parts (hypothesis and conclusion) which are the same. Then insert additional hypotheses between them. Then insert additional tautological hypotheses (which are true even when the sole variable is false) into the original hypothesis. Then add more hypotheses outside (on the left). This procedure will quickly give every tautology containing only one variable. (The symbol \\"Íûà\\" in each axiom schema indicates where the conclusion used in the completeness proof begins. It is merely a comment, not a part of the formula.) Consider any formula Œ¶ which may contain A, B, C1, ..., Cn and ends with A as its final conclusion. Then we take * aa 5: Œ¶‚àí‚Üí(Œ¶+‚ÜíÍûàŒ¶) as an axiom schema where Œ¶‚àí is the result of replacing B by A throughout Œ¶ and Œ¶+ is the result of replacing B by (A‚ÜíA) throughout Œ¶. This is a schema for axiom schemas since there are two level of substitution: in the first Œ¶ is substituted (with variations); in the second, any of the variables (including both A and B) may be replaced by arbitrary formulas of the implicational propositional calculus. This schema allows one to prove tautologies with more than one variable by considering the case when B is false Œ¶‚àí and the case when B is true Œ¶+. If the variable which is the final conclusion of a formula takes the value true, then the whole formula takes the value true regardless of the values of the other variables. Consequently if A is true, then Œ¶, Œ¶‚àí, Œ¶+ and Œ¶‚àí‚Üí(Œ¶+‚ÜíŒ¶) are all true. So without loss of generality, we may assume that A is false. Notice that Œ¶ is a tautology if and only if both Œ¶‚àí and Œ¶+ are tautologies. But while Œ¶ has n+2 distinct variables, Œ¶‚àí and Œ¶+ both have n+1. So the question of whether a formula is a tautology has been reduced to the question of whether certain formulas with one variable each are all tautologies. Also notice that Œ¶‚àí‚Üí(Œ¶+‚ÜíŒ¶) is a tautology regardless of whether Œ¶ is, because if Œ¶ is false then either Œ¶‚àí or Œ¶+ will be false depending on whether B is false or true.

It may involve venture philanthropy that actively invests in social programs to pursue specific philanthropic goal that would yield return on investment over the long term, or in a more passive form whereby \\"social investors\\" benefit from investing in socially-responsible programs.  History  The term was coined by Matthew Bishop and Michael Green in their book Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save The World. The book was endorsed by Bill Clinton, who wrote in its foreword that this concept drives the Clinton Foundation.Linsey McGoey, No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy, , 2015 The shift in implementing business models in charity is not a new concept - John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie sought to apply their business strategies in their philanthropy in the twentieth century. Since then, a significant increase in charity spending by other organizations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, both described as examples of philanthrocapitalism, has been noted. These more modern organizations differ from other groups or organizations since their funds come more from the private capital of an individual rather than donors or profit from physical products. The integration of business models in charity foundations has focused on a symbiotic relationship between social responsibility and the local, national, and international markets. Philanthrocapitalism has been compared and contrasted with altruism due to the similar stated goals of the movements‚Äô advocates. Criticism There are many criticisms of philanthrocapitalism beginning with the limited transparency and accountability involved. There are also concerns that private philanthropy erodes support for governmental spending on public services. The main worry with this practice is that collectively, it can lead to tax revenue problems for the government. Donations are still going towards philanthropy, but some public services may not be able to utilize these funds because they may never receive them. Because of this, there is concern from John Cassidy that the wealth of a few may be able to determine what organizations receive the most funding. It was also noticed by Linsey McGoey that many current and past philanthropists amassed their fortunes by predatory business practices which enhanced the very social problems their philanthropy is intended to alleviate. Finally there are concerns of the existence of ulterior motives. These ulterior motives can range from business owners avoiding capital-gains taxes by donating their company's excess stock instead of selling it and estate taxes which would be assessed onto their family to collecting tax credits from the government.

In the 1990s, Santofimio was involved in the campaign Process 8000 as head of the Liberal Party in Tolima Department as that party's office was accused of receiving money from companies part of an investigation in order to support the campaign for the presidency of Colombia for Ernesto Samper. He was part of the 1990 pool of candidates for the presidency in the Liberal Party. After the assassination of another candidate, Luis Carlos Gal√°n, he and the other members of the National Directive of the Liberal Party, decided to support C√©sar Gaviria, the campaign manager of Gal√°n to be the sole Liberal Party candidate in 1990. During the investigations about the assassination of Luis Carlos Gal√°n, Santofimio was mentioned as a rumour that he and other former presidencial candidates could have been involved in reference to influencing the crime.

On May 12, 2005, the investigation over Santofimio's role in the assassination of Gal√°n started again, and he was arrested after new evidence surfaced. On October 2007 he was found guilty and sentenced to 24 years in prison. His attorneys immediately appealed the case before the State Supreme Court, the Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Cundinamarca. A year later, on October 2008, a panel of 3 Supreme State Court Justices, citing lack of substantial evidence against the accused, overthrew the original judge's decision, and order Santofimio freed. The Court added that the credibility of the only witness against the accused, a hired assassin of Pablo Escobar's known as \\"Popeye,\\" was highly controversial because he was a well-known criminal who had stated for 17 years, in various investigations, that Santofimio had nothing to do with the crime, and then had suddenly recanted his testimony. On August 31, 2011, however, the Colombian Supreme Court voided the State's Supreme Court decision and ratified the original sentence.

History Villa Moretti Tarcento occupies a strategic location at a bridging point on the River Torre. Archaeological finds indicate a very early date for its first human occupation. Tarcento first appears in the historical record around the year 1126 CE, when an Austrian nobleman, Machland, from Perg, was feudal overlord of the castle around which the town had developed. Subsequently, a second castle was built on the hill of Coia. In 1219 the Caporiacco family took over as feudal overlords. Both castles were badly damaged during wars for control of the area between the Holy Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice in the Middle Ages, and in 1420 CE Tarcento became part of the territory controlled by the Venetian Republic. The main castle was burnt down in a peasant's uprising and then damaged by a serious earthquake, both in 1511 CE. Nothing remains of that castle today. A corner of the tower of the castle on the hill of Coia can still be seen. Following the Napoleonic conquest of the Venetian Republic in 1797, Tarcento came under Austrian Rule. In 1866 Tarcento became part of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War I, Tarcento was close to the front line on the eastern front. After the Italian rout at the Battle of Caporetto in 1917, Tarcento was occupied by the Austrians until the end of the war. A catastrophic earthquake in 1976 caused a great deal of damage in the town and its surroundings, all of which has subsequently been repaired.

Casanova de Seingalt, √©crits par lui-m√™me Portrait of Giacomo Casanova (made about 1750‚Äì1755) by his brother Francesco Casanova (State Historical Museum, Moscow). First page of Casanova's manuscript. Histoire de ma vie (Story of My Life) is both the memoir and autobiography of Giacomo Casanova, a famous 18th-century Italian adventurer. A previous, bowdlerized version was originally known in English as The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova (from the French M√©moires de Jacques Casanova) until the original version was published in 1960. From 1838 to 1960, all the editions of the memoirs were derived from the censored editions produced in German and French in the early nineteenth century. Arthur Machen used one of these inaccurate versions for his English translation published in 1894 which remained the standard English edition for many years. Although Casanova was Venetian (born 2 April 1725, in Venice, died 4 June 1798, in Dux, Bohemia, now Duchcov, Czech Republic), the book is written in French, which was the dominant language in the upper class at the time. The book covers Casanova's life only through 1774, although the full title of the book is Histoire de ma vie jusqu'√† l'an 1797 (History of my Life until the year 1797). On 18 February 2010, the National Library of France purchased the 3,700-page manuscriptThe manuscript can be viewed in the site gallica.bnf.fr. of Histoire de ma vie for approximately ‚Ç¨7 million (¬£5,750,000). The manuscript is believed to have been given to Casanova's nephew, Carlo Angiolini, in 1798. The manuscript is believed to contain pages not previously read or published. Following this acquisition, a new edition of the Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade, based on the manuscript, was published from 2013 to 2015. Contents of the book The book comprises 12 volumes and approximately 3,500 pages (1.2 million words) covering Casanova's life from his birth to 1774. Story of the manuscript Casanova allegedly wrote the first chapters of the book in 1789, during a profound illness. In 1794, Casanova met Charles Joseph, Prince de Ligne. The two of them established a mutual friendship. The Prince expressed a desire to read Casanova's memoirs, and Casanova decided to polish the manuscript before sending it to the Prince. After reading at least the first three tomes of the manuscript, Charles Joseph suggested that the memoir be shown to an editor in Dresden to publish in exchange for an annuity. Casanova was convinced to publish the manuscript, but chose another route. In 1797, he asked Marcolini Di Fano, minister at the Cabinet of the Saxon Court, to help him with the publication. In May 1798, Casanova was alone in Dux. He foresaw his death and asked for members of his family currently residing in Dresden to come and support him in his last moments. Carlo Angiolini, the husband of Casanova's niece, traveled without delay from Dresden to Dux. After Casanova's death, he returned to Dresden with the manuscript. Carlo himself died in 1808 and the manuscript passed to his daughter Camilla. Because of the Napoleonic Wars, the climate was not favorable for publishing the memoirs of a character belonging to a past age. After the Battle of Leipzig (1813), Marcolini remembered the manuscript and offered 2500 thalers to Camilla's tutor, who judged the offer too modest and refused. After some years, the recession compromised the wealth of Camilla's family. She asked her brother Carlo to quickly sell the manuscript. In 1821, it was sold to the publisher Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus. Brockhaus asked Wilhelm von Sch√ºtz to translate the book into German. Some extracts of the translation and the first volume were published as early as 1822. The collaboration between Brockhaus and Sch√ºtz stopped in 1824, after the publication of the fifth volume. The other volumes were then translated by another unknown translator. Due to the success of the German edition, the French editor Victor Tournachon decided to publish the book in France. Tournachon had no access to the original manuscript, and so the French text of his edition was translated from the German translation. The text was heavily censored. In response to the piracy Brockhaus brought out a second edition in French, edited by Jean Laforgue (1782‚Äì1852) which was very unreliable as Laforgue altered Casanova's religious and political views as well as censoring sexual references. The French volumes were published from 1826 to 1838. These editions were also successful, and another French pirate edition was prepared with another translation from the German edition. As the German edition was not entirely published at this time, this edition allegedly contains passages invented by the translator. From 1838 to 1960, all the editions of the memoirs were derived from one of these editions. Arthur Machen used one of these inaccurate versions for his English translation published in 1894 which remained the standard English edition for many years. The original manuscript was stored in the editor's head office in Leipzig until 1943, when after the closure of the office, Brockhaus himself secured them in a bank, saving them just before the 1943 bombings of Leipzig. In June 1945, it was moved to the new head office in Wiesbaden by the American troops. In 1960, a collaboration between Brockhaus and the French editor Plon led to the first original edition of the manuscript. In 2010, thanks to the support of an anonymous donor, the manuscript was purchased by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France for over $9 million, the institution's most expensive acquisition to date. Main editions Sch√ºtz translation (1822‚Äì1828) This first edition is a censored German translation for Brockhaus (the first half was translated by Wilhelm von Sch√ºtz, the remaining parts by an unknown translator). Its \\"original\\" title is: Aus den Memoiren des Venetianers Jacob Casanova de Seingalt, oder sein Leben, wie er es zu Dux in B√∂hmen niederschrieb. Nach dem Original-Manuscript bearbeitet von Wilhelm von Sch√ºtz. Tournachon-Molin translation (1825‚Äì1829) The success of the first German edition spawns the pirate Tournachon-Molin edition, without access to the original manuscript. The first French edition is a German to French translation from the French to German Sch√ºtz translation, which results in a very approximate and imperfect text. Laforgue adaptation (1826‚Äì1838) In reaction to the pirate edition, Brockhaus decided to publish its own French edition. This edition was done with the original manuscript, but still heavily censored and \\"arranged\\" by Jean Laforgue. Laforgue rewrote parts of the text, and even added some others of his own. Furthermore, four chapters of the manuscript were not returned to the publisher. The edition was prepared from 1825 to 1831, but difficulties with the censors slowed the publishing of the volumes, especially after the book had been put in the list of Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1834. Several editions are in fact re-editions of this Laforgue edition: * Garnier edition (1880). This is a popular and cheap edition. * The La Sir√®ne edition (1924-1935). * The first Pl√©iade edition (1958-1960). Busoni pirate edition (1833‚Äì1837) The Laforgue edition success spawned a new pirate edition in France. This new edition began as a copy of the first eight published volumes of the Laforgue edition, but because the other volumes of the Laforgue edition were slow to appear (because of censorship), the publisher Paulin asked a journalist, Philippe Busoni, to take over the balance of the project. Busoni wrote the two remaining volumes using the Tournachon-Molin translation, adding new episodes he invented. Several reeditions of the Busoni edition are: * The Rozez reedition (1860). * The Flammarion reedition (1871‚Äì1872). The Brockhaus-Plon reference (1960‚Äì1962) The manuscript remained hidden for many years because Brockhaus didn't want it to be pirated further. Then wars and economics crises slowed their edition projects until the end of the 1950s. The first complete and authentic edition of the text was published between 1960 and 1962 (minus the four lost chapters, replaced by their Laforgue version, with the annotations by Sch√ºtz). The Bouquins reedition (1993) has since become the first French reference edition. The new Pleiade edition (2013‚Äì2015) Following the acquisition of the manuscript by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, a new Pl√©iade edition, based on the manuscript, was published from 2013 to 2015.

Geraint Morgan was born in the Llandeilo area of Carmarthenshire, the son of dairy farmer Morgan Morgan (1888-1950) and Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Oliver (1893-1980). The family subsequently relocated to Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire where his father continued farming at Woad Farm, Lathbury. Morgan was educated at Bedford School, University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Bi- lingual, from an early age, in Welsh and English, he learnt French to a high standard at school and added German and Italian by his own efforts. He enlisted in the Suffolk Regiment in 1939 and was commissioned in the Royal Marines. He landed on Gold Beach on D-Day and ended the war a Major. He became a barrister, called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1947, and a Queen's Counsel. He practised on the Northern circuit. Geraint Morgan contested Merioneth in 1951 and Huyton in 1955 against Harold Wilson. He was Member of Parliament for Denbigh from 1959 to 1983, when the seat was abolished in boundary changes. He was noted for very rarely making any speeches in the House during his 24 years as a member. His obituary in The Independent (a British newspaper) recorded: :\\"Although not the most frequent of speakers in the Commons, his commitment to the North Wales constituency was unswerving - and totally fair to those he represented. He answered letters from Welsh-speakers in Welsh - and in his own meticulous handwriting. There were triumphs too small to register on the Westminster scale which were of importance to his constituents. Many householders living near the A55 - a road designated \\"a highway of opportunity\\" - thanked him for the compensation they received when the road was upgraded.\\" Geraint Morgan was never one unquestioningly to troop through the lobby designated by the party whips. Soon after his election, he refused to support his own party over the Profumo affair. In 1972, he voted against British entry to the Common Market, which is now known (in a significantly evolved form), as the European Union. This was contrary to party policy, since British entry to the Common Market, at that time, for the Conservative leadership and notably for the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, was a central aim. At the 1983 general election he attempted to be selected for the new seat of Clwyd North West, which was largely based on his old Denbigh constituency, with the addition of parts of the Flint constituency, but found himself in a heated selection battle between Sir Anthony Meyer and Miss Beata Brookes, the Member of the European Parliament for North Wales. Conservative Party central office tried to parachute Beata Brookes in as candidate, although she lacked grassroots support in either Denbigh, or Flint. Antony Meyer successfully sued in law to have the imposition of Brookes as the candidate declared unlawful. A new selection meeting was held, where the choice was between Meyer and Brookes, Geraint Morgan's application to be included being rejected, despite (according to eyewitnesses) his having considerable support from the floor of the public meeting (open to Conservative Party members, who were not permitted a general vote). After leaving Parliament, Geraint Morgan continued to practise law as a Crown Court Recorder. Geraint Morgan was married, with four children. An historian, as well as a linguist, Geraint Morgan liked to point out, when he knew he would be the last MP for Denbigh, that the first MP for Denbigh had occupied the adjacent (literal) seat in Parliament in Westminster to the very last MP in Westminster for Calais.

Background Gordon is believed to have been the son of Doctor Thomas Gordon and Jean Hay of Aberdeen, but his origins are uncertain. His date of birth may have been 1658, and he is believed to have owned property in Aberdeen of which town he was made an honorary burgess on 30 June 1736. The official announcement was recorded as follows: > \\"Considering that the most illustrious gentleman, Thomas Gordon, Knight, > Admiral in the Fleet of the Most Serene Empress of Russia, is a man of noble > birth in this our kingdom of Scotland, being honourably descended from the > ancient race of Gordons whose present chief is the most powerful Duke of > Gordon; that he was from his early years a most worthy citizen of this city > of Aberdeen; that this same brave man, when in the British navy, strenuously > defended the commerce and ships of this city from pirates and enemies of > every kind; and that he, being an account of his great valour deservedly > promoted to the highest honours by the Empress of Russia, still befriends > this city; we, in token of our gratitude and esteem, do approve and confirm > the aforesaid most illustrious gentleman, Thomas Gordon, as a burgess of > this burgh, with all the rights and privileges of a guild brother. Given > under the private seal of this our city and signed in our name and by our > appointment by Walter Cochran.\\"  Early career  He was captain of the merchant ship Margaret of Aberdeen in 1693 when he obtained an essential Mediterranean pass of safe conduct to go abroad to the Barbary States of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. The account books of the Shipmaster's Society of Aberdeen show him operating from that port between 1688 and 1693 during which time he voyaged to Shetland, Sweden, Norway, and Holland. Scots Royal Navy On 17 July 1703 Gordon received a regular commission as captain of the Royal Mary a vessel of the Royal Scots Navy. Royal Mary was being rigged out at Leith in order to protect the east coast of Scotland against privateers or warships of the enemy. In May the following year, the Royal Mary captured a French privateer, the \\"Fox\\" of Dunkirk, and took her to Leith where her crew were incarcerated in the tolbooths of Leith and the Canongate. The prisoners were given an allowance for their sustenance. In August 1704 he captured a privateer ship named Marmedon of Dunkirk and also brought her into Leith where the crew were similarly treated as those of the previous French ship. Later in the year he captured two or three privateers and was considered to have ended that problem for the time being. On 28 January 1705 Gordon captured a Dutch ship Catherine. This arrest caused great consternation in Holland and an appeal was written to Queen Anne pointing out that the owners of the vessel were blameless since they had passports to land their cargo of wine from the Canaries in Rotterdam. Trade with Spain and the Canaries was allowed by agreement between the two countries. The case went on for years but the vessel was sold at Leith in two weeks. Apparently she also had an illegal French passport and the ship's cook took revenge on the captain, who had had him beaten the previous day, by revealing this to Gordon. He also captured a small four-gun privateer, St. Esprit, from Ostend. After obtaining permission from the Admiralty to purchase the vessel he renamed her Little Gordon and sent her trading. On 12 March 1705 Lieutenant George Ramsey with two sergeants, three corporals, and thirty-three soldiers were on board the Royal Mary for some two months whilst she cruised off the Scottish east coast. On 6 June the cruise was extended for another two months in the company of her sister ship Royal William. A record of the soldier's purpose on board is not known but possibly they were to be landed at places where Jacobites were at work. Due to the execution for piracy of Captain Thomas Green of the English East India Company's vessel Worcester and two of his officers at Leith in 1707, relationships were poor between the Scottish and English governments. Scotland's attempt to found a colony at Darien had failed, and when the expedition returned one of them, the Speedy Return, was found to be missing. Captain Green was accused by a Scottish mob of killing the crew and sinking the ship. He and his men were tried by the High Court of Admiralty of Scotland, found guilty, and executed on Leith Sands, despite a complete lack of valid evidence against them. The ill-feeling between the two countries led the Jacobites from the court of Louis XIV of France to enquire if the Old Pretender could claim his monarchy in Scotland at least. Colonel Nathaniel Hook, an Irishman and French spy, was landed at Slains Castle near Peterhead where he could be sure of a good welcome at the home of the Earl of Errol. He was then transferred to the Hay fortress at Delgatie Castle, near Turriff where he could meet with Jacobite leaders. Scots noblemen had promised twenty-five thousand Highlanders and five thousand horses. Having been promoted to commodore on 7 March 1706 Gordon joined the Royal William, which sailed from Leith accompanied by the Royal Mary (Captain Hamilton). Their commission was to guard and convoy the shipping on the east coast of Scotland. However, faithful Captain Gordon was in capturing French and Ostend privateers, out of which he could make handsome awards of prize money, he was not averse to letting a French ship land Jabobite political agents at Slains Castle to visit the Countess of Errol. The Gordons and Errols, who were closely connected, played their part in Scottish history though not always on the monarch's side. There were fourteen signals agreed upon by Commodore Gordon and the captain of the French frigate Audacious, which brought over Hooke, whereby they could recognise each other. Union with England Negotiations between Scotland and England for a union were going on at this time. Commodore Gordon intimated to the French that he would soon be obliged to quit the service since, when it came to Union, he could not see himself taking the oath of abjuration to repudiate the late King James Stewart as the legitimate claimant to the throne. If the King of France required his services, he would come to France along with his thirty two-gun frigate. In 1706 Commodore Gordon complained that, whilst entering the port of Tynemouth Haven, after having received some damage to a mast in a gale, Captain Jones of the Royal Navy vessel Dunwich had fired a shot at him. After sending his lieutenant to the Dunwich to enquire why the shot had been fired, he learned that Scottish Navy vessels were forbidden from flying a broad pendant whilst in English waters. Gordon pointed out that English and Dutch vessels often wore a broad pendant in Scottish waters. Jones also complained when Gordon fired a morning and evening gun. Gordon and Jones wrote to their Lord High Admirals for instructions on the matter but the Act of Union, which required both vessels to fly the Union Jack, automatically rectified it. When the Old Scots Navy merged with Royal Navy there was some dispute over the seniority of the Scottish captains. It was finally agreed that their time would count from when they received their commissions as captains from Queen Anne. This meant that four years at sea did not count and the dispute continued for some time. The Scottish vessels were renamed Edinburgh and Glasgow since the Royal Navy already had vessels named Royal William and Royal Mary. Ships under these names still operate in the Royal Navy today. A third Royal Scots Navy ship was allowed to retain her name of Dumbarton Castle. Their absorption into the English navy was unpopular with many Scots seamen. One hundred of Gordon's men mutinied at Leith having got it into their heads that they would be sent to the West Indies or elsewhere outside of home waters. They were used to serving in Scottish and continental waters and just did not relish service abroad. On 3 February 1708 Captain Gordon was posted to the Leopard (50 guns) and distinguished himself off Montrose when he was involved in a running fight between British ships under Admiral Sir George Byng and French ships under Admiral Forbin. Captain Gordon when off the Firth of Forth captured the French man of war 'Salisbury' that was the sole trophy of the fight. The rest of the French ships were scattered and did not arrive in Dunkirk until three weeks afterwards. Admiral Byng had been promoted to Admiral of the Blue and had been in control of the North Sea fleet to oppose any French ship that attempted to land the 'Pretender' at Burntisland and, it was believed, five thousand French troops. Admiral Byng had his critics and the question was raised that had Byng done all he could and for a while the threat of an enquiry was held over him. Fortunately the discontent subsided and Byng was given the freedom of the City of Edinburgh, and Parliament passed a vote of thanks to Prince George for his promptness. Unbeknown to the British, jealousy and disputes between the French officers had frittered away much valuable time. On the eve of his voyage, the royal guest became ill due to measles, contracted from his sister, so the attempt at landing him had been cancelled before they sailed. They no doubt still planned to land the troops. On 10 August 1709 the Edinburgh ex-Royal William was deliberately sunk to become a breakwater at Harwich. She was described as a vessel of 364.5 tons with two decks and 32 guns carrying a crew of 145 men. The length of the gun deck was , and she was wide with a depth of . On 5 November 1709 Gordon was posted to the Moor. He joined her accompanied by his son William. On 6 May he took up command of the Advice. He refused to take an oath of abjuration to King George I when he came to the throne in 1714 and resigned his commission. Later Career - Russian Navy Upon leaving the Royal Navy, new opportunities opened up to Gordon and he went first to France to visit Queen Mary. There he met Captain Oglivie and told him that indeed he was \\"the famous Captain Gordon\\". He had crossed the English Channel to Calais with Elizabeth Oglivie (Oglivie‚Äôs cousin, or possibly wife) who was employed as a messenger between the Jacobites in England and France. She was known as the \\"Courier of Jupiter\\" and wrote from Calais the following letter to Ogilvie: > \\"I have a countryman of ours with me, who was pinned on me by our friends in > London. I was ordered to put him into your hands, and I long for an > opportunity to get him off my own. I don‚Äôt know if he was designed for my > guide, but I find myself under a necessity of being his, for to take him out > of his wooden world, he knows no more about travelling than a child of six. > He is in a prodigious hurry to be at Dunkirk before Saturday. I wish to God > he maybe soon wanted. He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves > with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of ¬£5 on purpose to be almost > ‚Äúdrounded,‚Äù or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my > fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but > our light heads could have kept us from the bottom.\\" He joined the Russian Navy of Peter the Great on 1 June 1717 and remained a Russian officer until his death on 18 March 1741. Gordon, who was now considered as a refugee, was engaged by the Tsar in Holland along with Captain Saunders, who is described as an Englishman, Captain Hay and Captain- Lieutenants Urquhart and Serocoled; along with two land officers, all British. After Gordon arrived in Russia, the Jacobites saw an opportunity to interest the Tsar in their affairs. There were a number of letters sent to the Tsar for just this purpose: nine from Prince James (1721‚Äì30), two from the Earl of Mar (1716‚Äì1717), five from Captain Hay, and others. Promotion was soon to come since there were old Russian Admirals retiring. There were also newly built ships to be manned. On New Year's Day Prince Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov was promoted Rear Admiral of the White, Captain-Commodore Sievers made Rear Admiral of the Blue and Captain-Commodore Gordon Rear-Admiral of the Red. The Russian Fleet was divided into three sections after the system used by the British and the Dutch. Regrettably there was jealousy between Rear Admiral Seivers and Gordon. Seivers had been born at Copenhagen and served the King of Denmark in his navy about the year 1708. Having been engaged by Peter the Great as captain, he was sometimes employed on board, sometimes in the yard, as Under-Equipage Master. He was reported as a man of excellent sense, general knowledge and very exact and methodical in his conduct. He was also able to speak and write most European tongues and was fluent in Russian. But he just could not stand Thomas Gordon. Seivers refused to suffer Rear Admiral Gordon to be present at discussions upon the executions of any orders even when required by the Tsar. He felt that Peter the Great esteemed Gordon before him and indeed the Tsar appointed Gordon to take charge of a fleet over his head on the strength of his having been a British officer and trained in a better navy than Sievers had. Unlike Seivers, Gordon could not speak Russian but was fluent in Dutch. The rift between Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating the battle of 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out between the two men in the presence of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane‚Äôs behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his conversation he referred to Gordon as ‚Äòyour admiral‚Äô to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers was going to leave the Tsar‚Äôs service at the end of the campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink a glass of wine together hoping that this would end their bickering. In 1726 Admiral Gordon took out a fleet to meet the powerful British fleet under Admiral Sir C. Wagner that had been sent to the Baltic Sea to anticipate or prevent any action of Russia as a party to the Treaty of Vienna. However, since Gordon had told Catherine I that action was hopeless, courtesies were exchanged instead of cannonballs. On 6 May 1727 he was promoted to admiral and in November he became chief commander of the port of Kronstadt, a position he held until he died there in 1741. Gordon was in command of the Russian fleet that brought about the surrender of Danzig in 1734 (the Siege of Danzig). At that time the Russian Navy had grown in confidence and had been asserting the power of Russian ships in the Baltic. A claimant to the Polish throne, Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, supported by King Louis XV of France, had been in hiding at Danzig. Eighteen hundred French soldiers had disembarked and a fleet lay at anchor nearby. The Russian Empress Anna ordered that Augustus III should be the new king of Poland. On 15 May it became necessary to supplement the fleet engaged at Danzig. Admiral Thomas Gordon sailed there with a squadron of fourteen battleships, five frigates, and several smaller vessels. Gordon had his flag on the 100-gun ship Peter I and II and arrived at Danzig on 1 June. The French finally failed to repulse the Russian army and navy and surrendered on 13 June. The dispute over, the Polish throne ended in favour of August III and Leszczy≈Ñski quickly left Danzig, which was occupied by the Russian Army. This was to be Gordon's last battle and he finally took up the position as Governor of Kronstad (1). He knew the port of Danzig well since, apart from his times as a merchant seaman, he also escorted convoys of Scottish ships back to Scotland whilst in command of the Royal Mary. France had sent sixteen warships and three regiments to Leszczy≈Ñski‚Äôs aid, so it had been necessary for Russia to increase her attacking force, which she did by sending Gordon‚Äôs ships. He flew his flag in the battleship Peter1 and 11 and commanded a fleet of fourteen battleships, five frigates, and several small vessels. He discharged guns for the 60,000 Russian and Saxon army at Pillau and then bombarded the fort of Weksselmunde and the French camp outside it. He captured a French frigate and a small vessel and recaptured three Russian vessels. His countryman Field Marshal Keith, writing from Javarof to congratulate Gordon on the Danzig expedition, said: \\"All the Poles that I have seen assure me that the so sudden surrender of the town was entirely owing to appearance of the fleet which cut off all hopes of succours, and therefore they look on you, as the main instrument of the loss of their liberty, for that is their ordinary term for us who have been employed on this side of Poland.\\" Family The family name of the Admiral's wife is disputed with one source calling her a daughter of Sir Thomas Elphinstone of Calderwood whilst another names her as the daughter of Sir James Elphinstone of Logie, Aberdeenshire; however, in 1710 his wife was definitely Margaret Ross, widow of Mr. William Monypenny of the Pitmilly family. Margaret is believed to be the daughter of George Ross, 11th Lord Ross. She died before 1721‚Äì2 and was buried near the grave of the Tsar‚Äôs sister. Gordon had a son, previously mentioned as being with him on the Moor, and another may have been Thomas Gordon, merchant, who died at Saint Petersburg in 1806. There were three daughters, Anna, Mary and Jean; the former married Sir Henry Stirling of Ardoch. In 1726, Mary was married to William Elmsal also at St. Petersburg. Jean married John Young, whose daughter Ann Young married Lt. Thomas MacKenzie in 1738, two years after the latter joined the Russian Navy in 1736. They had a son born 1740 also named Thomas Mackenzie who rose to the rank of rear admiral in the Russian Navy and was the founder of the city of Sevastopol in 1783. On 9 July 1771 young Thomas MacKenzie was awarded the Knight of the Order of St. George IV Class for successfully navigating one of only two fire ships which contributed to the destruction of the Turkish Fleet during the Russo-Turkish war at the Battle of Chesma in July 1770.

Immediately after the Warsaw Uprising, it was systematically blown up by the German Army. After World War II, the Old Town Market Place was restored to its prewar appearance. History The town hall in 1701 The Old Town Market Place is the true heart of the Old Town, and until the end of the 18th century it was the heart of all of Warsaw. It originated in the late 13th century, at the same time that the city was founded. Here the representatives of guilds and merchants met in the town hall (built before 1429, pulled down in 1817), and fairs and the occasional execution were held. The houses around it represented the Gothic style until the great fire of 1607, after which they were rebuilt in late-Renaissance style and eventually in late-Baroque style by Tylman Gamerski in 1701. The main feature at that time was the immense town hall, reconstructed in 1580 in the style of Polish mannerism by Antoneo de Ralia and again between 1620-1621. The architecture of the building was similar to many other structures of that type in Poland (e.g. the town hall in Szyd≈Çowiec). It was adorned with attics and four side towers. A clock tower, embellished with an arcade loggia, was covered with a bulbous spire typical for Warsaw mannerist architecture (an example being the Royal Castle). The district was damaged by the bombs of the German Luftwaffe during the Invasion of Poland (1939). The ancient Market Place was rebuilt in the 1950s, after having been destroyed by the German Army after the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Today it is a major tourist attraction. Features The current buildings were reconstructed between 1948‚Äì1953, to look as they did in the 17th century when it was mostly inhabited by rich merchant families. The Warsaw Mermaid, a bronze sculpture by Konstanty Hegel, has stood as the symbol of Warsaw since 1855. Names of 18th-century Polish parliamentarians are used for the four sides of this vast (90 by 73 m or 295 by 240 ft) square: * Dekert's Side (Strona Dekerta), the north side (numbers, 28‚Äì42), named after Jan Dekert, which houses the Warsaw Historical Museum.

Jandiala is a village in Jalandhar district in the Indian state of Punjab. Jandiala is also known as Jandiala Manjki, (A part of a small area known as Manjki region). Jandiala is a big village as compared to the surrounding villages. Jandiala is located at the centre of a circle with its curvature passing through many major towns such as Nakodar (14Km), Jalandhar (20Km), Phagwara (14Km), Goraya (12Km), Phillaur(21Km) and Nurmahal (8Km) The village Jandiala now looks like a city. There were mandis of dozens of surrounding villages. As a result, the municipality was formed by the British government in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, but due to strong opposition from the people, it was disbanded in 1872. However, in 1998, the Punjab government issued a notification to the Nagar Panchayat But then similar protests arose and within four years the Nagar Panchayat was dissolved. As a result, Jandiala was once again deprived of urban amenities. It is generally believed that the reason for the protest was the imposition of excise duty on imported goods. But some believe that this village of patriots believes in a complete people's system and when the bureaucracy prevailed due to the Nagar Panchayat, the villagers did not like it. Some politicians, through village shopkeepers, had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court to have the notification canceled. Well-meaning people don't like it. Jandiala, one of the largest villages in the Doaba , now has a panchayat, but its sarpanch is recognized equal to an MLA. ‚àí Jandiala's revenue records show that the total area of ownership of the village is 3399 acres out of which (according to the figures of 2006 census) the village is situated on sixty one acre and farming is done on two thousand nine hundred and eighty nine acres. Thirty-five acres is ‚ÄòBarani‚Äô and two thousand nine hundred and ninety-four acres are ‚ÄòChahi‚Äô. Of this, one hundred and sixty-seven acres are Mushtaraka and one hundred and eighty-two acres are owned by the Panchayat. According to CENSUS 2006, the total number of houses is 1666.. ‚àí The people of Jandiala believe that the foundation stone of Jandiala Manjki was laid in 1426 by a Johal Jatt named Ladha. His nephew Dhunni was also with him at the time. But some believe that the navel came much later. When Ladha settled down, he had laid the foundation of his ‚Äòdera‚Äô(Camp) with a ‚ÄòJand tree‚Äô which was called ‚ÄòMorhi Gadna‚Äô. Due to this, the name of Ladha Johal's dera became Jandwala. The Jand tree, which was gutted by lightning many years ago, is still standing, but after many years, it started turning green again. Pipple has also sprouted in the Jand, which was struck by lightning. According to legend, this Jand tree has withered many times in the past centuries. People believe this myth to be true because the present event has happened before their eyes. ‚àí After all, the story of the migration of the Johals goes back to Central Asia, but the Johals of Jandiala consider their former settlement to be the village of Dhaleke near Moga. Some of the families who had come up from village Dhaleke had settled at Thabalke village, about two and a half kilometers from the present Jandiala. The village is still inhabited but not as flourishing as Jandiala even though there is a railway station. The story of coming from Thabalke to Jandiala is very interesting. Residents believe that they used to give more milk when their elders used to graze their milch cattle on this side. He also realized the secret that the water of a large pond (dhab) built on this place is very beneficial. The mound came to be known as the 'Baan wala Chhaparh' and is still maintained by the villagers. Then some of them settled down nearby. The rest of Johal remained there whose heirs are still living there. ‚àí The people of Jandiala are politically, educationally and economically strong and conscious. Jandiala is a revolutionary village from the very beginning. The village played an important role in the freedom struggle and produced prominent political leaders. Jandiala is the only village in India where two flags were hoisted in the village square called ‚ÄòJhandian wala chowk‚Äô. A red flag with hammer and sickle (Communist Party of India) and another tri colour flag (Congress Party). The two flags are about five feet apart. Jandiala has produced 81 patriots. Baba Lal Singh, Baba Dhian Singh, Baba Waryam Singh, Baba Gurdit SinghAnd Baba Puran Singh's sacrifices made the Ghadar movement even brighter. Munsha Singh Dukhi was from here that he got the taste of patriotism. He touched the hearts of Punjabis through revolutionary poems. Bhai Chanchal Singh is a prominent name associated with the Babbar Akali movement. Bhai Sher Singh, Jagjit Singh Jaggi, Bhai Juginder Singh, Baba Lachhman Singh, Lala Pars Ram, Jai Singh, Kartar Singh Kirti, Hazara Singh Kanth who fought in the Jaito Morcha, made important contributions in the freedom struggle. . ‚àí No one has yet been able to grasp the secret of Jandiala's freedom fighters. Fifty freedom fighters are fighting in one of the six Patti‚Äôs of the village, while one in one Patti and not one in the other, even though that Patti is very small called Mohanpurian. There was a stark difference between the political understanding of the people on the east and the west. The Patti that produces fifty freedom fighters is called Barri Patti. ‚àí Former Chief Minister of Punjab S. Darbara Singh's village was also Jandiala Manjki. Prominent economist, agronomist and former Vice Chancellor of Punjabi University Patiala Dr. Sardara Singh Johal rose to international prominence from the streets of Jandiala. Today he is the Chancellor of Central University Bathinda. Former Registrar of Guru Nanak Dev University S. Mohan Singh Johal was also a native of Jandiala. Retired from Punjab State Electricity Board Santokh Singh Johal had his roots in Jandiala. Headmaster Ajit Singh Johal was an important figure in the field of education.The efforts of the late Major Swaran Singh Johal, Major Karnail Singh Johal, Head Master Ajit Singh Johal and Comrade Piara Singh, a degree college named Guru Gobind Singh Republic College was established here in 1967 which was taken over by the government in 1983. Former Dean of Punjabi University Patiala and Head of the Department of Journalism Navjit Singh Johal, Secretary General of Punjab Arts Council and President of Punjab Press Club Dr. Lakhwinder Singh Johal, Ex-Director of Akashbani Davinder Singh Johal, Famous Punjabi poet late Avtar Jandialvi and famous lyricist Tarlochan Singh 'Chan Jandialvi' spent their childhood in the streets of Jandiala. Nachhatar Singh Johal, who broke all previous records from Defense Academy Dehradun and became an Army officer, and Gatibodh Johal, a senior officer in the Indian Oil Corporation, are residents of Patti Dhunni Ki in the same village. Satnam Chana, a journalist, writer, film script writer, TV anchor and former secretary of the International Union of Students, was born and raised in Jandiala. He was also the first Editor-in- Chief of Vidyarthi Jeevan, the first student magazine started in Punjab. ‚àí The village has been a hotbed of communist and Congress politics. The soil of this village has been touched by the feet of great politicians. Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Comrade Nambudripad, BT Randhive, Harkishan Singh Surjit, Ajay Ghosh, Teja Singh Sutantar, Comrade Baba Bujha Singh, Darshan Singh Canadian, Avtar Singh Malhotra, Satpal Dang, Vimla Dang, Jagjit Singh Anand and Baba Bhagat Singh Bilga. At times, Jandialas have been giving political guidance to the people. The Gadar Party's news paper 'Kirti' has been being printed in the house of Fatteke in Patti Barri Jandiala. This family has made a significant contribution to the freedom struggle. The late Pritam Singh Khalsa and the late Comrade Jeet Singh of this family, who had settled in Pilibhit in the seventies, took part in the freedom struggle. The ‚ÄòKhara Khooh‚Äô and the ‚ÄòJhandian wala chowk‚Äô have been the center of politics. The village contributed to almost all national independence movements. Any Jatha to take part in any morcha were begin from 'Jhandian Wala Chowk' Were the red and tricolor flags are still flying at the same time in this square. In order to preserve the memory of Jandiala-related patriots in the hearts of future generations, progressive thinkers have set up a 'Desh Bhagat Yadgar Library' in the flagged square where a large number of valuable books of knowledge are kept. ‚àí The only rural Government College in District Jalandhar is called 'Guru Gobind Singh Government College Jandiala'. Earlier this college was private. In the year 1983, the pride of this village went to S. Darbara Singh's tenure as Chief Minister, the college was taken over by the government. Baba Bohar of Punjabi Literature Principal Sant Singh Sekhon was the first principal of this college. Dr. Raghveer Singh 'Sirjana', Harcharan Singh Bains and former Sports Director of Punjab University Reet Mahinder Singh have been teaching in this college. Prior to its inception, the college had a high status in the field of education and sports. Manga Bassi, Baljit Bassi, Bakhshinder and film producer Dr. Juginder Singh Bhangalia are old students of this college. But after coming into government, the college has lagged behind in every aspect. Senior Secondary School for Girls in Jandiala, a symbol of village unity Samrai-Jandiala Govermnt Secondary School for Boys, Republic High School and two government primary schools are spreading the light of education. There is a magnificent building of the primary health center but the health facilities are negative. The absence of high quality private hospitals and specialist doctors is alarming. People have to go to Jalandhar or Phagwara for treatment of minor ailments. For the convenience of the people in the premises of this health center, a non-governmental social organization called 'Jandiala Lok Bhalai Manch' has set up a 'Mortuary' with modern technology.BSNL Has a 3000 line telephone exchange. ‚àí Many people of this village have migrated abroad for employment. Go to any corner of any country in the world, you will find some Jandialia. The area is economically strong. At present there are twelve commercial banks in Jandiala - Punjab National Bank (Two Branches) , Union Bank of India, State Bank of India , Canara Bank , Punjab and Sind Bank , ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda. UCO bank, HDFC Bank.Further Capital local area bank and branch of a Central Co-operative bank.

The historic Gurdwara Dehura Sahib associated with Guru Arjan Dev Ji is situated on Jandiala to Nurmahal road. ‚àí Before the formation of Pakistan , the Doaba bus owners had formed a transport union called 'Sutlej Transport' in which Bir Singh Johal, Prakasha Singh Johal and Bhai Sher Singh of Jandiala were prominent contributors. The 'Kartar Bus Company' was later formed which was owned by Milkha Singh Johal and Avtar Singh Johal of Jandiala and now the Congress leader Avtar Singh Henry is owner of this company. ‚àí At one time, the ‚ÄòChhinjh‚Äô of Jandiala was very popular in which national level wrestlers took part. Jandiala is now far behind in the field of sports. The village's 'Young Sports Club' has been organizing tournaments on a large scale till the eighties, but the generation since then has shifted from sports to drugs. After poppy , cannabis , opium and smack,‚Äôchitta‚Äô dominates today. Political bitterness has also divided sports activities.The name of the village has shone all over the world by Pardeep Singh Johal (s/o Amrik Singh Johal and Grand son of Bans Bhalwan -Bisse Ke family-Patti Barri). In the \\"Commonwealth Games\\" of 2018, he won ‚ÄúSilver Medal‚Äù in the 105 kg weight class.Now he is preparing for Olympic Games.Manjki Sports and Welfare Club Jandiala has started holding Kabaddi competitions every year since 2014 which have become very popular. This initiative of healthy thinkers has been given a lot of encouragement by sports lovers from home and abroad. ‚àí The first Panchayat elections were held in Jandiala after independence in 1952.

Jangaon was the second capital region of the Kalyani Chalukyas in the 11th century. After the demise of the Nayaks 50-years rule, this region came under the Kakatiya dynasty from 1195 to 1323, before transferring to the Khalji dynasty of Delhi Sultanate under Ala-ud-din Khalji rule. The region was part of the Bahmani Sultanate and then the Sultanate of Golconda Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1512. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb conquered Golconda in 1687 and it remained part of the Mughal empire. Qamar-ud-din Khan Asaf Jah I declared sovereignty in 1724 and established the Asaf Jahi Dynasty. In 1854 the Jangaon area was under the administrative region of Bhonagheer Circars. Jangaon is mentioned as Zungaon in an 1854 map. In 1866 new districts were created; all Circars were delimited and merged. Bhonagheer, Davercondah and Nelgoondah Circars merged to form Nalgonda District but the Jangaon area was transferred from Bhongir Circar to Warangal District in 1866, Cherial was renamed Taluka by adding some parts of Wardannapet region, with its headquarters at Jangaon.

Hyderabad State was annexed to the Dominion of India by operation polo in 1948, and became an Indian state. In 1948 Jangaon taluka was part of Nalgonda district in Gulshanabad Division of Hyderabad State. In 1953, there was a shuffling of areas, shifting some villages from one taluka to the other. Subsequently, when Warangal district was divided to facilitate administrative control and on 1 October 1953, Khammam district was formed.Khammam, Yellandu, Madhira, Burugunpahad and Palavancha talukas have been made part of it.

After these changes in 1953, few villages of Jangaon taluka went to Medak district and some remained in Nalgonda district. During the reigm of Marri Chenna Reddy in 1979, Jangaon taluka was split into Cherial, Kodakandla and Jangaon talukas, at that time Jangaon taluk consist of 7 Circles namely Jangaon, Cherial, Rebarthi, Narmetta, Ippaguda, Chennur and Kodakondla Cirles. In 1985, when N. T. Rama Rao introduced the mandal system, Jangaon taluka was further divided in to Jangaon Mandal, Raghunathpalle, Lingalaghanpur and Devaruppula mandals. On 11 October 2016 Jangaon was made the district headquarters, along with 21 newly formed districts in Telangana. Warangal district was divided in to Five districts are Warangal Urban district, Warangal Rural district, Jangaon district, Jayashankar district and Mahabubabad district.

The mother organization Operation Brotherhood International was founded by Oscar G. Arellano. OBI provided medical help and community upliftment assistance to the war refugees in Vietnam and Laos. When OBI started operations in the Philippines in 1963, village projects became its first priority including schools for the poor. Ambassador Preciosa S. Soliven who had been teaching young children in Vietnam and later worked with a Swiss Montessori preschool teacher in Makati was asked by OBI (Oscar G. Arellano) to manage these schools. Retrieved on 18 March 2009. OB Montessori offers toddler, pre-school (known as Casa), elementary school, high school and college levels and is the first school in the Philippines to use the Montessori method. Retrieved on 18 March 2009. Oscar G. Arellano, founder of OBI Phils also opened another Montessori school in 1975. Smaller in scale compared to its neighbor and counterpart, OB Montessori Center. This little school is nestled in Barangay Addition Hills, San Juan City. History Operation Brotherhood International (OBI), the mother organization of O.B Montessori Center, Inc., was founded by Oscar Arellano in 1956. OBI provided assistance to the war refugees in Vietnam and Laos. The OBI team was made out of doctors, nurses, food technologists, agriculturists, and Social Workers. In 1963, its Filipino team helped relocate 3,000 squatter families from Intramuros, Manila to Sapang Palay, Bulacan. The principle of \\"self help\\" pervaded all OBI activities. The education of the family unit was given emphasis. Thus, while the adults were engaged in community activities, their children attended nursery school. When OBI started operations, village projects including kindergarten schools for the poor were set up. Oscar Arellano asked Ambassador Preciosa S. Soliven to manage these schools. OBI assisted in the fundraising that initially financed the O.B Montessori Center making it self-supporting until its incorporation in 1975. Amb. Soliven assumed the presidency of this non stock, non profit institution. The original board members were SEC commissioner Angel Limjoco, Sen. Salvador Laurel, Greek Counsel General Alexander Adamson, Sony Philippines President Elena Lim and Philippine Star publisher Max Soliven. In 1964, Italian Ambassador, Signor Rubino awarded Amb. Soliven, project manager Operation Brotherhood International Village Children's Schools, a government organization to train in the Association Montessori International (AMI) Primary Course in Perugia, Italy. Years later, eight of her teachers received the same kind of scholarship grant. They were enrolled at the AMI Primary Course for 3-7 year old's. Amb. Preciosa Soliven specialized in the Montessori Language Arts in London, England as arranged by Mr. Mario Montessori and Muriel Dwyer, head of the Maria Montessori Center at Lyndhurst Gardens. A British counsel grant was also given to her in the same year which included observation of British primary schools. In 1968-1969, she was awarded an additional Italian scholarship to take the AMI Elementary Course for 7-12 year old's in Bergamo, Italy. Internationally recognized Montessori experts with whom Soliven has worked with were Antonietta Paolini, Elnora Ilonegger, Camilo Grazzini, and Sofia Cavaletti of AMI Italy. Montessori became a household word when Soliven hosted 2 children's shows at ABS-CBN: \\"Montessori for the Home\\" in 1970 and \\"Montessori for everyone\\" in 1971. The shows were broadcast in both Filipino and English. They became so popular, that their ratings surpassed that of \\"Sesame Street\\" which aired simultaneously in another channel. \\"Montessori for Everyone\\" ranked 17 in the list of 400 weekly TV programs aired over local channels. In 1990, Soliven moved to a new medium, informing the country about the Montessori way in her column, \\"A Point of Awareness\\". Every morning in OB, the high school students read, cut and paste these columns in their SSDG notebooks. Every year, O.B Montessori Center stages a play or a musical, usually based on well-loved fairy tales and Broadway plays with participants from among the students aged 3‚Äì18 years. The gala affairs are often attended by national leaders, members of the diplomatic corps, entertainment personalities and well known socialites. Their common observation is that OBMCI students perform like \\"professionals\\". Funds raised are used for the O.B Montessori Twin Project of Pagsasarili Preschools and Mothercraft Training and Literacy Course for Village Mothers. When Mrs. Corazon C. Aquino became president in 1986, she appointed Dr. Soliven to represent the Philippines in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris, France. It was here that she was elected a member for the Executive Board, the highest governing body of UNESCO. In discussing the UN priority of literacy projects for Asia, Latin America and Africa, Amb. Soliven would often mention to the Director-General and members of the board how the Montessori System has worked so well in the Philippines for all Social classes of children as well as adults. Her colleagues, former Prime Mister of Australia, Mr. Whitlam; Amb. Wagner de Reyna of Peru, Dr. Zhao of China, Amb. Aboussouan of Lebannon and Mr. Cosmapodoeus of Greece were touched by her constant reference of Dr.Maria Montesori who championed for the cause of the child. Back in the 1940s when UNESCO was founded, the popular Peruvian ambassador recalled that it was Dr.Maria Montessori's philosophy of the \\"inner man\\" that triggered off a rich spiritual discussion among the founding members of the Executive Board. Mesdames Halima Inayatullah of Pakistan, Paronetto-Valier of Italy and Ulvhammer of Sweden were attracted to the O.B Montessori Pagsasirili Preschool and Mothercraft programs. Soliven demonstrated the modified Montessori Pagsasarili Program by convening a class compound of the children of African, European, Asian, and Latin American employees in the 2 succeeding years during which she participated in the spring seasons at Place des Fontenoy in Paris. Dr. Zacarias of the Education Committee adapted several Montessori ideas in their primary school experiment in South Africa. Meantime, in 1988, then Secretary of Education, Dr. Lourdes Quisumbing appointed Soliven as one of the 9 founding members of the Education Department Task Force to coordinate Early Childhood Education in the Philippines (CONCEP). Its work was to streamline the curriculum teacher training and facility guidelines to make it easier for Congress to include preschool education within the national budget in the near future. Teachers O.B. Montessori Center, Inc. conducts \\"in house\\" training for its own teachers. This is patterned after the International Montessori Training Centers and has been approved as a \\"proficiency\\" course by the Department of Education. It is a one and a half year course that focuses on Montessori theories and practice. Amb. Preciosa Soliven heads the training team and is assisted by Ms. Sara Soliven-De Guzman, Executive President. The training program covers seven courses leading to proficiency in teaching preschool, primary school, intermediate school, and professional high school. Pagsasarili preschool and Mothercraft Literacy Training for the village mother and their children. Prospective teachers are also retained in specialized areas such as Home Arts, Food Technology, Agriculture, Physical Education, Music, and Religion. Academic Programs Toddlers The O.B. Montessori Toddlers Program centers on the philosophy of \\"Helping the Child Help Himself\\" through the Montessori Prepared Environment. The Toddlers Room simulates a house where the child is given freedom to work independently in a Prepared Environment that is complete, functional and orderly, thus maximizing his potential to the fullest. The furniture and materials are also designed within the child's level that would enable him to develop independence in movement and language in preparation for preschool education. Preschool (Casa) Montessori Education in the Philippines did not start among the rich. It started among the poor in Sapang Palay, Bulacan. When Amb. Soliven returned to the Philippines, she put up a school for middle class while maintaining services to the poor. The first full-time Montessori Nursery School was organized and conducted at the Syquia Apartments in Malate, Manila. It was named O.B. Montessori Children's House. Soon, other Children's Houses were opened in Paco, Makati, and Quezon City. Most of O.B. Montessori Children's Houses were established between 1966 and 1970 in rented mansions in Manila and Quezon City. The Casa Curriculum makes use of 177 hands-on apparata for Practical Life activities, Sensorial Life activities, Language, Mathematics and Cultural Arts (divided into History, Botany, Geography, Science, Music and Arts). Grade School After Soliven completed her AMI Elementary course for 6-12 year old's in Bergamo, in 1969, she continued the Montessori project by opening the grade school level in 1970. The first grade school graduation was held in 1977 with 10 students as the first batch of graduates. The first grade school started operations in Paco, Manila. From that old schoolhouse, it was transferred to Taft Avenue. When this Schoolhouse became to crowded to accommodate all the children, the grade school was transferred to Sta. Ana, Manila. The grade school curriculum, called the Cosmic Curriculum follows Dr. Maria Montessori's philosophy which is to make the child realize that he is part of the universe and he has a special role to play in it. It teaches the child to appreciate the creation of the universe from the atom, plants and animals, to the coming of man. It also teaches them the universal responsibility of mankind, to care for life. Academic subjects include Language, Filipino, Mathematics, Geometry, and Cultural Arts (which is divided into 4 subject areas, namely: History, Geography, Botany, and Zoology). Agriculture, Home Arts, Music, Character Education, Physical Education and Scouting have innovative programs. School activities such as Exhibits, Poetry Festivals, Fashion Shows, Scouting Investiture, Barn Dance, Formal Dining, Intramurals, Musical Presentations and others are held to complement the academic and special subjects. Field trips are arranged to supplement the lessons learned inside the classroom. OBMC has a variety of extra-curricular activities. Membership in school clubs such as the: O.B. Montessori Angels Choir, Angklung Ensemble, Marching Band, Glee Club, O.B.Montessori Dance Club, Basketball, Varsity, Badminton and Taekwondo Varsity Teams, Junior Police Training Program, and the participation in the Poetry/Declamation Festival and the semi-regular religious/historical musical productions including the Christmas Tableau are encouraged to develop the child's confidence, discipline and appreciation of the arts. From 1977 to 1982, OBMCI grade school graduates would normally go to traditional schools for their secondary education. Some were able to adjust well to the traditional set up, while others did not. They would come back to OBMCI asking the school to open a high school level. Due to these numerous requests, Soliven launched the O.B. Montessori Professional High School. Professional High School Between 1972 and 1982, Soliven received various study grants from the U.S State Department, Europe and Australia to visit professional high schools. Among these she visited was Ecole Culinaire in Paris, France. What Amb. Soliven saw in these various academic and technical schools, she applied in the innovative O.B Professional High School, the first of its kind in the Philippines. Maria Montessori believed that the period of development between 12 and 18 is a quest for economic independence. This develops self-confidence among teenagers. To meet this adolescent need, Operation Brotherhood Montessori opened the O.B Montessori Professional High School in 1983. The Professional High School curriculum provides special training in entrepreneurship, leadership and citizenship. The O.B. Montessori Professional High School Curriculum is composed of 4 core subjects: Communication Arts (Filipino, English, Public Speaking, Logic/Argumentation and Debate, Spanish/Italian/Nihonggo/French); Science and Technology (Physical Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics); Mathematics (Algebra, Geometry with Logic, Trigonometry with Calculus and Statistics); and Makabayan Subjects (Social Studies, Law on Persons, Technology, Home Economics and Livelihood Education, Computer, Accounting, Values Education, Music, Physical Education, Health, Leadership Training and the Revitalized Homeroom Guidance Program) Co-curricular activities complement the classroom activities. Field trips are regularly scheduled through the year. High school joint school-endorsed clubs include: OBMC Leadership Corps, Women's Volleyball Varsity, Marching Band, Show Band, Taekwondo Club, Men's and Women's Basketball Varsity, Glee Club, Dance Club, Rainbow Catering Club, and UNESCO ASPNet Club. To symbolize adolescence, the symbol of knightlihood and chivalry is used for the OBMC Professional High School. The motto is \\"to fight for the right without question or doubt\\". College As the young adult reaches the age between 18-24, he begins to make his decisions in the choice of his career. This stage focuses in the preparation for a profession and for his future family life. With these in mind, Operation Brotherhood Montessori College Courses have been designed for the adult to mature professionally. Since 1995, OBMC has been offering the 4 year \\"Bachelor in Early Childhood Education with specialization in the Montessori Method\\". This is based on the original international curriculum designed by Dr. Maria Montessori. This degree entails daily \\"practice teaching\\" in the freshman year. This intense classroom work is closely monitored and each trainee's ability to \\"normalize\\" children is carefully evaluated. Unique to this 4-year course is the inclusion of the Montessori School Management Program which exposes students to the operation and management of a full Montessori school. OB College also offers a \\"Proficiency Course in Montessori Preschool Education\\" to college graduates who would like to open up or teach in a Montessori School. This intensive course may be completed in just 2 semesters and 1 summer. The short course in \\"Professional Education\\" is likewise given to those who would like to earn the 18 units required by the Professional Regional Commission (PRC). Completion of the required units will qualify non- education majors to take the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) In 1995, Soliven founded \\"Istituto Culinario\\", as the first specialized school for Culinary Arts in the country. It will continue to instill the disciplines and prepared environment brought about by Maria Montessori. The primary objective of the organization is to provide training for chefs. The course prepares students to establish their own business highlighted by the actual training in catering management and marketing. Students are exposed to a wide range of activities such as culinary exhibits and competitions, exposure tours, and actual management of food business. It likewise emphasizes the importance of eating safe, cost efficient food and further aims to develop proper work attitudes and values. 2 year Diploma course in Food Service is patterned after the well equipped European state-supported culinary schools which thoroughly trains high school graduates in becoming self-reliant featuring a \\"ladderized\\" program leading towards a subsequent degree course. The course allows immediate employment after graduation and promises an opportunity for graduates to work as a chef in any of the international hotel kitchens. Dual training consists of simultaneous classes on international cuisine, computer skills, and entrepreneurship together with the in house apprenticeship in Ristorante La Dolce Fontana. In 2012, there were major renovations in the college and in the school restaurant. Ristorante La Dolce Fontana and OB Culinary College was replaced with Brasserie Cicou and Istituto Culinario. In 2016 both the Brasserie Cicou and Istituto Culinario were taken down, Istituto Culinario was taken down in order to have space for the grade 11 and 12 rooms Prepared Environment The Prepared Environment is a unique feature of the Montessori system. It must be beautiful, complete and functional. All Montessori materials used in the classroom have been universally tested and conform to international Montessori standards. Maria Montessori believes that the environment must be prepared for the child. Therefore, care must be given in setting up an environment at home or in school. The aim of the Prepared Environment is to facilitate the development of independence. The Casa and Grade School Prepared Environment is equipped with furniture proportional to the children's size. It also contains classroom materials which are scientifically designed to fulfill the children's needs and sensitivities. In the Montessori High School and College levels, the environment is still an important feature. According to Dr. Maria Montessori, the young adult must be exposed to a Prepared Environment that will acquaint him with the structure of society where order is respected and rules are consistent. If the environment is not in order, chaos, disturbance, ignorance and disrespect may occur. The \\"professional\\" set-up of laboratories (kitchens, science, computer, agriculture farm) where theories are turned into practical activities enhances the students' quest for self-sufficiency. Apprenticeship of the Food Service programs are done in ristorantes, bistros, and cafes of the school. Courtesy A unique practice of courtesy in OBMC schools is the handshake. Students greet their teachers by shaking their hands every morning and a sign of gratitude during dismissal. Cadet officers render a hand salute to the staff members as a sign of respect. Community Services and Programs OBMC students are given the awareness of sharing and caring for the less privileged members of society through the following foundations. In the Professional High School curriculum, the Junior Operation Brotherhood Service (JOBS) through the Mothercraft Literacy Program and Project Kaibigan satisfies the need to serve his fellowmen.

This encounter is the third major battle of the Gallic Wars. Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine, seeking a home in Gaul. Prior to the battle, Caesar and Ariovistus held a parley. Ariovistus' cavalry cast stones and weapons at the Roman cavalry.Caesar, Julius, De bello gallico , caes.gal.1.43 Caesar broke off negotiations and instructed his men not to retaliate to prevent the Suebi from claiming they were induced into a trap by their accepting an opportunity to talk. Prelude Caesar was not far away, probably at or near Bibracte, where he had just won a major victory over the Helvetii and other Celtic tribes, and had disposed of the remaining Boii, allowing them to settle in Aeduan land. As only small numbers of Boii were left after the battle, the Aedui were obliging. Caesar must have immediately begun marching up the Sa√¥ne valley. Ariovistus, being a skilled general in his own right, identified Vesontio as the key to the strategic Doubs valley and marched for it, but Caesar, probably relying on intelligence from the Gauls, arrived there first and established a main base. He had to combat a panic among his own men, who had heard that the Germans were some sort of superior warriors. Caesar called a meeting and then berated the centurions for making that necessary instead of just following orders. In one of his noted speeches he recalled them to duty and ended by threatening to march the next morning early with only the 10th legion, about whose valour he said he had no doubts at all. The speech had the intended effect of arousing fanatical loyalty in the 10th and shame and rivalry in the others. Vesontio is about from the Rhine. Apparently Ariovistus had learned of the Roman presence there because he stopped marching and waited. Using Diviciacus as a guide, Caesar's troops marched in 7 days, arriving probably in the vicinity of Belfort. The army was moving only 7 miles per day and was relying on Diviciacus to lead them through open country; thus, it is probably safe to assume there were no Roman roads between Besan√ßon and Belfort at that time. Caesar says that he took a detour to stay in open country, most likely west of the Doubs, through the lands of his Celtic allies. Ariovistus sent ambassadors to Caesar agreeing, because Caesar had come to him, to a conference. Caesar, known for giving his potential enemies every last chance, entertained the idea that Ariovistus was coming to his senses. It was agreed that they should meet on horseback, accompanied only by cavalry. Caesar brought mounted soldiers of the 10th legion, who joked that they had been promoted to knights, which was the origin of the 10th legion's nickname Equestris.Keppie, Lawrence, The Making of the Roman Army. From Republic to Empire, University of Oklahoma Press, 1984, pp. 84. The meeting of the two on a high mound between the camps with the bodyguards a few hundred yards away is surely a rare event in the history of parleys. They both got a chance to present and defend their points of view, face to face, with no filtering or interference from others. Caesar concentrated on Roman policy. Ariovistus now took the tack of claiming the Aedui had attacked him rather than vice versa. Caesar reports that Ariovistus stated that \\"he was not so uncivilized nor so ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in the very last war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to the Romans, nor received any from the Roman people in the struggles which the Aedui had been maintaining with him and with the Sequani.\\"Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.44 Ariovistus described official Roman friendship as a sham, and he uttered another uncanny prophecy: that he could gain the real friendship of many leading men at Rome by killing Caesar. Moreover, the senate, he said, had determined that Gaul should be governed by its own laws and so ought to be free. By then, Caesar had to escape to his bodyguards, as the Germanic cavalry was beginning to hurl missiles. The next day, Ariovistus invited Caesar to another parlay. Making a point to emphasize that he could not trust the Germans, Caesar sent two junior officers, Gaius Valerius Procillus and Marcus Mettius. They found Ariovistus in the process of moving his army up and were put in chains. Over the foollowing few days, Ariovistus moved his camp to within two miles of Caesar's, covering the move with cavalry skirmishes. The Germanic tribes had developed a special force consisting of cavalry mixed with equal numbers of light infantry whose only function was to support cavalrymen, individually or in units, who had become enmeshed in combat. Caesar's men stood in battle formation outside the walls of his camp each day, but only skirmishes were offered. Finally, from a distance of two miles, Ariovistus cut Caesar's supply line, isolating his garrison. Caesar claims the Germanic side did not attack in force because their wise women had pronounced from their divinations that they should not engage in battle before the new moon. However, it is evident that there was a more mundane reason for Ariovistus declining battle: he had Caesar surrounded. Dio Cassius notes the presence of Germans on the slope of the hill behind the camp, where the Porta Quaestoria, the gate where provisions were brought in, would have been. Ariovistus had Caesar under siege and hoped to starve him out. Under its best general, the Roman army now demonstrated the classic tactics that had made Rome master of the entire Mediterranean region to such an extent that the Romans were able to call it \\"our sea\\". It is unlikely that Ariovistus suspected what was coming. Caesar knew that the Germans outnumbered him and that his best and only defence was an attack. He had to force the Germans to battle or be starved into surrender. Leaving a light defence in camp Caesar advanced in acies triplex to within of the German camp. Under guard of the first two lines, the third built another castrum (camp) in which Caesar placed two legions and the auxiliaries while the other four legions returned to the main camp. It is easy to say in retrospect that Ariovistus should have thrown his entire force against the two lines of battle while the third (the reserve) was preoccupied or that he should have attacked the four legions while they were divided from the two, but the tides of battle are never predictable, no matter what the odds. The next day Caesar used the auxiliaries from the forward camp as cover while he brought all six rested and fed legions to a starting line before it in acies triplex formation. Each tribune conspicuously took personal charge of one legion, and the quaestor took the 6th. Caesar wanted the men to see that they were under the eyes of the entire senior command, which would certainly share their fate. They then began an advance on the weakest feature of the Germanic force, its open camp. Caesar says that the enemy camp was defended by a wagon train, drawn up behind the German forces, which had now either to fight or to run. The usual chorus of wailing women was placed on the wagons. The effect that it really had on the Germanic soldiers is unclear. The idea was to place the tribe in a situation where they must be victorious or be annihilated with their women and children. Battle The Germans formed by ethnic group before the Romans: Harudes, Marcomanni, Triboci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, and Suebi. Apparently, they lacked a reserve, and the Romans followed their established practice of two units forward to one back. Caesar opened the battle with a charge against the Germanic left, which seemed the weakest part of the line. The Germanic forces responded by charging with such speed that the Romans were unable to cast pila and the fight entered the swordplay stage immediately. The Roman open line of battle, in which each man was left room to fight, prevailed. The Germans crowded into a phalanx and began to push the Romans backward, even though the latter jumped up on the shields of the enemy to thrust downward. A cavalry officer, Publius Licinius Crassus, from his advantageous position on his horse, grasped what was happening and on his own initiative ordered the third line of battle (the infantry reserve) into action in support of the Roman right. The Romans were momentarily victorious on their left. That decision was usually reserved to senior officers but Crassus won high praise for it after the battle and was probably slated for rapid advancement. The enemy line broke and ran, women and all, for the Rhine, which was away, with the Roman cavalry in hot pursuit. Aftermath Some, including Ariovistus himself, managed to cross the river in boats or by swimming. The rest were cut down by Roman cavalry, including both of Ariovistus's wives and one of his daughters; another daughter was taken prisoner. Both Caesar's emissaries were rescued unharmed, to relate their harrowing adventures as the Germans debated (in their presence) whether they should be burned then or later. Caesar said that encountering Procillus and freeing him from his chains gave him as much pleasure as the victory, which offers some insight into the emotional climate of Caesar's forces. The officers were a sort of family. Caesar had for the moment secured his German border. Caesar did not stop there. He chased them into Germania, building a bridge to cross the Rhine in only 10 days.

In 1286, his son Aziz ud-Din went to Delhi, and his own son Ala ud-Din eventually settled in Bado Sarai, in Barabanki district. Ala ud-Din had two sons: Jalal ud-Din and Jamal ud-Din. Jalal ud-Din incurred the ire of the Delhi sultan Ghiyath ud-Din Tughluq, who had him executed. Ghiyath ud-Din later tried to make amends to Jamal ud-Din by granting him 25,000 bighas of land, revenue-free, in Barhauli, on the south bank of the Gogra, and another 25,000 in Jarauli on the north bank.

Formed in 1942, No. 35 Squadron operated during World War II, transporting cargo and passengers around Australia, New Guinea and the Netherlands East Indies, equipped with a variety of aircraft including the Douglas Dakota. It was disbanded after the war, but was re-raised in the 1960s for service during the Vietnam War, flying transportation and resupply operations with DHC-4 Caribous in support of Australian and US forces. The squadron was subsequently augmented with rotary-wing aircraft, operating UH-1 Iroquois in both the transportation and gunship roles. In the late 1980s, the squadron returned to a solely fixed-wing transport role. It ceased operations in 2000, but was re- raised in January 2013. It began re-equipping with C-27 Spartan transports in 2015. History World War II No. 35 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, on 11 March 1942, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Percival Burdeu, as a transport unit.. After moving to Maylands, the squadron's operations were restricted to flying only within Western Australia as it was equipped with just one de Havilland Dragon and a de Havilland Fox Moth. Later in the year, the squadron was augmented with an assortment of aircraft including de Havilland Moth Minors, Fairey Battles, de Havilland Tiger Moths, an Avro Anson, a de Havilland Dragon Rapide and a Northrop Delta. In August 1943, the squadron was moved back to Pearce, where it was re-equipped with Douglas Dakotas; following this its operations were extended to cover all of Australia. During the later years of the war the squadron provided air transport to the Australian military throughout the South West Pacific area, operating out of Guildford, Western Australia, Brisbane, Queensland, and Cape York. In the final years of the war, detachments operated out of Darwin, Northern Territory, Townsville, Queensland, and later Morotai Island. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, No. 35 Squadron flew Australian soldiers and ex-prisoners of war home. In early 1946, it supported the movement of No. 81 (Fighter) Wing to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron was disbanded at Townsville on 10 June 1946. Vietnam War On 1 June 1966, the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV), which had been formed for operations in Vietnam in July 1964, was redesignated No. 35 Squadron at Vung Tau in South Vietnam. Assigned to the 834th Air Division, Seventh Air Force, and operating DHC-4 Caribous, the re-formed squadron flew cargo, passenger and medevac flights throughout South Vietnam in support of Australian, South Vietnamese and United States forces. During its time in Vietnam the squadron was nicknamed \\"Wallaby Airlines\\", in reference to its callsign \\"Wallaby\\". Despite not being employed in an offensive role, the squadron's aircraft were regularly called upon to fly into dangerous areas of the conflict zone, often at low level, and on several occasions the Caribous were fired upon and aircrew wounded.. By June 1971, the squadron's complement of aircraft was reduced from seven to four as a part of the drawdown of Australia's forces in Vietnam; as a result of requirements for maintenance, however, only two aircraft were operational at any one time after this. No. 35 Squadron flew its last mission on 13 February 1972 and departed South Vietnam for RAAF Base Richmond in Australia on 19 February 1972; it was the last RAAF unit to leave following the decision to withdraw. During the five years that it was deployed, the squadron lost two aircraft destroyed in accidents, the result of poor weather and the difficult nature of some of the landing grounds that the Caribous were required to use when supporting isolated garrisons. Another aircraft was destroyed from Viet Cong mortar fire, struck while conducting a resupply mission at Th·∫•t S∆°n in 1970. Although its work was not glamorous, the squadron developed a good reputation among the US air commanders as an efficient and effective unit, achieving a record that prompted US commanders to send personnel to the squadron to study their techniques. For their involvement in operations in Vietnam, members of the squadron received several honours and decorations including two appointments to the Member of the Order of British Empire, eight Distinguished Flying Crosses, one Distinguished Flying Medal, one British Empire Medal, and 36 Mentions in Despatches. 1972‚Äì2000 In 1976, No. 35 Squadron was relocated north to RAAF Base Townsville, where it operated in support of Army units based in Northern Australia. In early 1977 the squadron's role was expanded when it was equipped with four UH-1 Iroquois helicopters as well as its Caribous, making it the only RAAF squadron to ever be simultaneously equipped with rotary- and fixed- wing aircraft. These aircraft were employed in a multitude of roles including support to the local community in the form of flood relief, medevac and search and rescue operations. No. 35 Squadron's role was further expanded in November 1986 when it was issued with gunship variants of the UH-1, which it received when No. 9 Squadron RAAF converted to flying Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk. In November 1989, No. 35 Squadron reverted to a purely fixed-wing role when responsibility for flying the UH-1 helicopters was transferred to the Australian Army. Operating eight Caribous, the squadron continued to provide tactical transport to Army units based in Northern Australia until 2000, when it was reduced to \\"paper only\\" status and its aircraft transferred to No. 38 Squadron. 2013 Re-establishment No. 35 Squadron Alenia C-27J Spartan flying over Wagga Wagga Airport in 2019 On 14 January 2013, No. 35 Squadron was re-raised under the command of Wing Commander Brad Clarke as an element of No. 84 Wing. A skeleton organisation, the squadron was expected to expand to approximately 250 personnel by 2015, when it was scheduled to begin operating the RAAF's ten Alenia C-27J Spartan transport aircraft. The squadron is based at RAAF Base Richmond. On 21 January 2014 No. 35 Squadron was temporarily transferred from No. 84 Wing to the C-27J Transition Team. The squadron returned to No. 84 Wing mid 2016 once 35 Squadron was nearing Initial Operating Capability. The RAAF's first C-27J arrived in Australia on 25 June 2015, and No. 35 Squadron began operating the aircraft from RAAF Base Richmond. However, the squadron is planned to move to RAAF Base Amberley prior to achieving full operational capability in early 2019. The unit reached initial operating capacity in December 2016. No. 35 Squadron received its tenth and final aircraft on 2 April 2018.

The school was founded in 1906 by Rex Corbett, an ex-England football player, and started with ten pupils in a building that was formerly a brewery. Tom Pellatt, his brother-in-law who ran Durnford School at Durnford Court in the same village had blasted out a swimming bath in the rocks at Dancing Ledge, a mile and a half away on the coast and the pupils of both schools used this daily in the summer term. Durnford's most famous former pupil is Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In 1939, the school was sold by Corbett to Victor Haggard (H) and Evan Hope-Gill (Hopper) who inherited 37 boys. Durnford was requisitioned by the army later that year and the Durnford boys transferred to the Old Malthouse. Durnford was acquired by the owners of the Old Malthouse when the army gave it up in 1948. The main buildings were variously pulled down or sold, leaving the OMH with the grounds, which were levelled for playing fields. A third joint headmaster Peter Mattinson (Mr Matt) joined after World War II and the triumvirate ruled until 1974 when the school, then with about 80 boys, was sold to a Trust under the headmastership of Quintin Ambler. Ill-health led to Mr Ambler's early departure to be replaced as headmaster by Patrick Jordan in 1975 who expanded the school by adding a pre-prep department in the early 1980s. In 1988, Jon Phillips took over as Headmaster, remaining for 15 years. During this time the school became fully co-educational. Richard Keeble became Headmaster in January 2004 and left the school in July 2006 handing over the reins to longtime deputy Dr Moira Laffey.

It is a live-action film adaptation of the Japanese anime of the same name, which in turn is based on the novel by Hideyuki Kikuchi. The film stars Jacky Cheung, Leon Lai, Yuen Woo-ping, Roy Cheung, Tatsuya Nakadai, Michelle Reis, and Carman Lee. (Michelle Reis said that Tsui Hark actually directed many scenes himself. ) It tells fictional story of conflicts and relationship between demon-like creatures and humans in 1990s' Hong Kong. The film was one of the most popular Tsui Hark production in USA and Europe, and still plays in festivals and midnight screenings around the USA and Europe. Plot The story takes place in Hong Kong in a conflict between worlds of Humans and \\"Rapters\\" (\\"Reptoids\\" in some dubbed versions) before the handover. A special police unit in the city are investigating a mysterious drug named \\"Happiness\\". Taki, one of the policemen, meets his old lover Windy, who is a rapter and now a mistress of a powerful old rapter named Daishu. Taki and other special police members track down and fight Daishu, but later find that he hoped to coexist with humans. The son of Daishu, Shudo, is the mastermind. In the end Shudo is defeated, but Daishu and Taki's friends die, too. Windy leaves alone. Synopsis The film begins with the sun setting in Tokyo. Unknown to most people, there is the demonic \\"Rapter World\\" in conflict with human world. Rapters shift their shapes and infiltrate human world. Taki (or \\"Leung\\", played by Leon Lai) is a sales of a Hong Kong import/export company, but that is only his cover. He reveals his real occupation when he hunts down a seductive spider-like rapter in Tokyo. Ken saved his life when Taki ran out of bullets. Taki belongs to the Anti-Rapter Special Police. One day he is transferred back to Hong Kong. The 1997 transfer of Hong Kong is near, Anti-Rapter Special Police Headquarter transferred many agents from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom. This is a chaotic period when Hong Kong is most vulnerable to rapters. That's why Taki is sent to Hong Kong to help. Also in the unit is Taki's buddy Ken Kai (or \\"Ying\\", Jacky Cheung). Ken's father fall in love with a rapter, thus in the veins of Ken flows the black blood of rapter, which caused distrust on him every time. But he always hopes to prove his humanity. Besides Taki, Orchid (\\"Loh\\", by Carman Lee) is the only one in the unit on his side. When Ken felt Taki did not trust him well enough, Taki tells him about his past relationship with a rapter, Windy (\\"Gaye\\", Michelle Reis). Taki was ordered to arrest Windy and was critically injured by the other rapters who were hunting down Windy. Windy healed him out of goodwill, as she escaped to the human world in hope for peace. Windy became Taki's informant against raptors and the two become romantically bound. However Taki was afraid he will step into Ken's father's shoes, and he eventually ran away from Windy. Once Taki is back in Hong Kong from Tokyo, the unit begins investigation on an addictive and harmful performance-enhancing drug named \\"Happiness\\". The emotionless leader of the police unit Sergeant Kayama (\\"Commander\\", Yuen Woo-ping) suspects that Happiness is imported from the Rapter World by a tycoon named Daishu (\\"Yuen\\", Tatsuya Nakadai). He orders Taki and Ken to slip into Daishu's mysterious 150th birthday party. There Taki meets his former lover (\\"Gaye\\", Michelle Reis), who is now a mistress of Daishu. On the other hand, Daishu and his raptor staffs are having a meeting, because they don't know who is importing Happiness the drug either. The staffs are nervous, but Daishu persuades them to control humans' economy to bargain with humans. The meeting is attacked by two rapter killers. All other staffs are killed. Daishu is injured and Windy is injected with Happiness, however they escape from killers and police. Sergeant Kayama suspects a traitor in the unit. He suspends Ken from duty and says he has a suspicious origin. Knowing rapters would access energy to recover, Sergeant Kayama pays attention to electricity consumption over districts and locates the rapters in a power plant. Taki enters the plant, lets Windy escape but catches Daishu. Windy seeks help from Daishu's son Shudo (\\"Gwei\\", Roy Cheung). Shudo orders her loyalty to him and sexual intercourse happens between the two. Windy is sent to hurt Taki with the poison and later she too is caught by police, as she is also framed by Shudo. Daishu hopes to coexist with humans, since worlds of rapters and humans are together facing the energy crisis. Further more, he hopes to learn human emotions. His son Shudo is the mastermind who imports Happiness and attacks Daishu. Shudo also trades with Orchid, the real traitor in the police unit. Orchid doesn't care about either humans or rapters, she only wants to make money and leave the city to survive the energy crisis. With help of Windy, Taki and Ken find out the truth, but Windy falls into hands of Shudo. They rescue Daishu from the unit and join forces to fight Shudo and his two killers. On the other hand, Sergeant Kayama's announcement to suspend Ken is a trap to lure out the real traitor. Orchid is caught by Sergeant Kayama after she sabotaged the police unit's facility. Sergeant Kayama kills Orchid in cold blood, and leads a team to go after Taki. Because of Orchid's sabotage, an artificial magnetic field that protects Hong Kong is turned off, and Shudo is now able to turn the time backward to an age when humans are easy to control. Taki and Ken collaborate with Daishu to stop Shudo. After night battles, Shudo's killers are eliminated by Daishu, but Ken under Shudo's influence turns into a rapter and then is injured by Sergeant Kayama's team. Windy is dying from the effect of Happiness. Daishu returns to his rapter form to battle Shudo. Daishu says it is because only a rapter can kill his own son. Shudo is happy for his father finally turns back to a rapter. Later they jump on an aeroplane and fight above Hong Kong. Daishu's power is weakened by age, but he dives into Shudo's shadow and defeats him with the power of his shadow. Shudo takes Taki as hostage, as he knows human emotion is his father's weakness. As an act to protect Taki, Windy stabs Ken in the stomach. At the same time Ken regains human consciousness. He gives his blood to Windy so that Windy is able to overcome Happiness and rescue Taki from Shudo. In the end Shudo is killed. Sergeant Kayama's team put the aircraft on the tip of Bank of China Tower. With remorse of failing to prove his humanity, Ken dies in arms of Sergeant Kayama. Weighting his duty and emotion, Taki frees Daishu and Windy from hands of special police, as he knows Daishu is the one who can protect Windy well. Taki pretends the other police will come down to arrest them and Windy claims she will not appear in the city again, making Taki turning against his missions. As the two turn around, a hurt Taki sadly remarks: \\"I don't mind, I don't mind at all...\\". Taki meets a sad Sergeant Kayama and says Kayama may have become too emotional to lead the unit. On a car, Daishu dies for depletion of energy, hoping humans do not need any more \\"happiness\\", leaving only Windy drives away from the city alone at dawn. Special effects Andrew Lau and Joe Chan are the photographers of this film. They featured the film with darkness from many night scenes and dark interior scenes. They used coloured lighting in these scenes, especially for supernatural combat sequences. The filmmakers also used black light on Shudo's special make-up and creature costume to make him glow in the darkness. Some jumping and flying effects were done with Wire fu (wire work). Monster transformations and abilities were done with simple optical effects such as double exposure and step frame printing (Morton, 2001). References * Morton, Lisa. \\"The Wicked City\\".

It has the primary responsibility of establishing and maintaining secure military communications channels for the command and tactical elements of the Malaysian Army. It is also responsible for all electronic support, electronic warfare and early warning system for the Malaysian Army. History of Formation The Royal Signals Regiment has its roots with the formation of a ‚ÄúCommunications Troop‚Äù at the Training Depot of the Malay Regiment in Port Dickson in 1949. The Communications Troop was formed by centralising the radiomen of the signals Platoon of 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of Royal Malay Regiment (Rejimen Askar Melayu).

History Lignano Sabbiadoro developed in the early 20th century from some hospitality resorts, which at the beginning could be reached only by sea. The first inhabitants came in 1931, after the draining of the nearby marshes. The first road connecting Lignano with the nearby comune of Latisana was built in 1926. Formerly known as simply Lignano, the name (from \\"golden sand\\") was added in 1935 for promotional reasons. It is divided into three zones, each with its own particular traits: the historic centre, rife with shops and restaurants (Lignano Sabbiadoro itself); the greener area of Lignano Pineta, with lovely gardens and lanes for strolling; and Lignano Riviera, the waterfront, rich in salty sea air and coastal pines. During World War II, the final operations of the German navy - involving the evacuation of troops and personnel from Istria and Trieste ahead the advancing Yugoslavs - took place here in May 1945. An estimated enemy force of 4000 landed from 26 ships of all types at the mouth of the Tagliamento River. Germans equipment included E-boats, LSTs, a small hospital ship, all types of transport, and a variety of weapons. The 21st Battalion of the New Zealand 2nd Division was outnumbered by 20 to one, but at the end, on 4 May 1945, the Germans surrendered. Lignano became an autonomous commune in 1959. Lignano lives on summertime tourism, and is home to Austrian, German, and Slovenian citizens. In the late 2010s to early 2020s the town gained popularity on the Internet because of the satirical YouTube channel Cartoni Morti starring the recurring character of \\"il Sindaco di Lignano\\" (\\"the Mayor of Lignano\\"). Terrazza a Mare The ( \\"terrace on the sea\\" in English) of Lignano Sabbiadoro was designed by the architect Aldo Bernardis in 1969 and opened in 1972. It replaced the previous building designed by the architect Valle. It is considered to be one of the most important monuments of the city, housing shops, bar, and a solarium. Marina and dock The mooring complex (marina) of Lignano is the largest in Italy and among the largest in Europe, having more than 5,000 berths. The various structures of Aprilia Marittima, the harbour Marina Punta Faro, and the docks Porto Vecchio, Marina Uno, and Marina Punta Verde, are strategically positioned around the peninsula of Lignano, from the Marano lagoon to the river Tagliamento.

Raja Bhumi Chand Katoch of Kangra, a great devotee of goddess Durga, dreamt of the sacred place and the Raja set people to find out the whereabouts of the site. The site was traced and the Raja built a temple at that location. www.himachalhillstations.com/jawala-ji.html The building is modern with a gilt dome and pinnacles, and possesses a beautiful folding door of silver plates. Under the gaze of the Dhauladhar mountain range and set amidst the undulating hills that character sub-Himalayan Himachal Sati's tongue is believed to have fallen at Jwalamukhi and the goddess is manifest as tiny flames that burn a flawless blue through fissures in the age old rock. The temple is located on a small spur on the Dharamsala-Shimla road at a distance of about 20 km from the Jwalamukhi Road Railway Station attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year. No idol is located in the temple and the deity is worshipped in the form of flames which come out from the crevices of the rock. There is a small platform in front of the temple and a (check usage) big mandap where a huge brass bell presented by the King of Nepal is hung. Usually milk and water are offered and the ahutis or oblations are offered to the sacred flames in the pit, situated in the centre of the temple in between the floor pillars supporting the roof. Jawalamukhi Devi Temple in Jawalamukhi, Himachal Pradesh The deity is offered Bhog of Rabri or thickened milk, Misri or candy, seasonal fruits, milk. There is a mystic Yantra or diagram of the goddess, which is covered with, shawls, ornaments and mantras are recited. The puja has different 'phases' and goes on practically the whole day. Aarti is performed five times in the day, havan is performed once daily and portions of Durga Saptasati are recited. For Aarti, the temple remains open from 11.00 A.M. to 12.00 P.M. and from 06.00 P.M. to 07.00 P.M. The Mughal Emperor Akbar once tried to extinguish the flames by covering them with an iron disk and even channelizing water to them. But the flames blasted all these efforts. Akbar then presented a golden parasol (chattar) at the shrine. However, his cynicism at the power of devi caused the gold to debase into another metal which is still unknown to the world. His belief in the deity was all the more strengthened after this incident. Thousands of pilgrims visit the shrine round the year to satisfy their spiritual urge. Maharaja Ranjit Singh paid a visit to the temple in 1815 and the dome of the temple was gold-plated by him. Just a few feet above the Jwalamukhi temple there is a six-feet deep pit with a circumference of about three-feet. At the bottom of this pit there is another small pit about one and a half feet deep with hot water bubbling all the time. The temple is identified as one among the 51 Shakti Peethas. It is also one of the most renowned temples of Goddess Durga.www.durga-puja.org/jwalamukhi- temple.html Genealogy registers Hindu genealogy registers at Jawalamukhi are the genealogy registers of pilgrims maintained there by pandas.Tracing your Asian roots www.overseasindian.in.Hindu Pilgrimage Marriage Records www.movinghere.org.uk.10 Places Across The World That Help You Trace Your Ancestors, India Times, 29 Jan 2016. The Jwalamukhi shrine as a Shakti Peeth The shrine is regarded as a Maha Shakti Peetham. It is believed that Sati Devi's tongue fell here. Shakti Peethas are shrines of Devi, the primordial Mother Goddess. Each Shakti Peetha has a shrine for the Shakti and Bhairava. Siddhida (Ambika)is the Shakti and Unmatta Bhairava is the Kalabhairava. The Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation had immense significance in shaping the ancient Sanskrit literature and even had impact on the culture of India. It led to the development of the concept of Shakti Peethas and there by strengthening Shaktism. Enormous stories in puranas took the Daksha yaga as the reason for its origin. It is an important incident in Shaivism resulting in the emergence of Shree Parvati in the place of Sati Devi and making Shiva a grihastashrami (house holder).203x203px 203x203px 481x481px References Cities and towns in Kangra district ","title":"Jawalamukhi"},{"id":"5795288","text":"Jawar is a village and a gram panchayat in Khandwa district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

Despite the prevalence of several peptide sequences which can be both foreign and self in nature, a single antibody or TCR (T cell receptor) can be activated by just a few crucial residues which stresses the importance of structural homology in the theory of molecular mimicry. Upon the activation of B or T cells, it is believed that these \\"peptide mimic\\" specific T or B cells can cross-react with self-epitopes, thus leading to tissue pathology (autoimmunity). Molecular mimicry is a phenomenon that has been just recently discovered as one of several ways in which autoimmunity can be evoked. A molecular mimicking event is, however, more than an epiphenomenon despite its low statistical probability of occurring and these events have serious implications in the onset of many human autoimmune disorders. In the past decade the study of autoimmunity System, the failure to recognize self antigens as \\"self\\", has grown immensely. Autoimmunity is thought by many researchers to be a result of a loss of immunological tolerance, the ability for an individual to discriminate between self and non-self, though others are beginning to think that many autoimmune diseases are due to mutations governing programmed cell death, or to environmental products that injure target tissues, thus causing a release of immunostimulatory alarm signals,. Growth in the field of autoimmunity has resulted in more and more frequent diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population. Growth has also led to a greater characterization of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With an increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth in the study of the several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is molecular mimicry. The mechanism by which pathogens have evolved, or obtained by chance, similar amino acid sequences or the homologous three-dimensional crystal structure of immunodominant epitopes remains a mystery.  Related terms  * Viral apoptotic mimicry, defined by the exposure of phosphatidylserine ‚Äî a marker for apoptosis ‚Äî on the pathogen surface, in the case of apoptosis, the dead cell surface that is used to gain viral access to the interior of immune cells.  Immunological tolerance  Tolerance is a fundamental property of the immune system. Tolerance involves non-self discrimination which is the ability of the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta. After pre-B cells leave the bone marrow where they are synthesized, they are moved to the bone marrow where the maturation of B cells occurs. It is here where the first wave of B cell tolerance arises. Within the bone marrow, pre-B cells will encounter various self and foreign antigens present in the thymus that enter the thymus from peripheral sites via the circulatory system. Within the thymus, pre-T cells undergo a selection process where they must be positively selected and should avoid negative selection. B cells that bind with low avidity to self- MHC receptors are positively selected for maturation, those that do not die by apoptosis. Cells that survive positive selection, but bind strongly to self- antigens are negatively selected also by active induction of apoptosis. This negative selection is known as clonal deletion, one of the mechanisms for B cell tolerance. Approximately 99 percent of pre-B cells within the thymus are negatively selected. Only approximately 1 percent are positively selected for maturity. However, there is only a limited repertoire of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and negative selection mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as clonal anergy. The mechanism of clonal anergy is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of foreign antigen in the absence of an adjuvant which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a na√Øve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient. Tolerance is also produced in T cells. There are also various processes which lead to B cell tolerance. Just as in T cells, clonal deletion and clonal anergy can physically eliminate autoreactive B cell clones. Receptor editing is another mechanism for B cell tolerance. This involves the reactivation or maintenance of V(D)J recombination in the cell which leads to the expression of novel receptor specificity through V region gene rearrangements which will create variation in the heavy and light immunoglobulin (Ig) chains.  Autoimmunity  Autoimmunity can thus be defined simply as exceptions to the tolerance \\"rules.\\" By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known by many to be intrinsic. However, there are pathogenic mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a mitogen to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic protein may act as a superantigen which causes rapid polyclonal activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are self antigen determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs. Molecular mimicry has been characterized as recently as the 1970s as another mechanism by which a pathogen can generate autoimmunity. Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the linear amino acid sequence or the conformational fit of the immunodominant epitope may be shared between the pathogen and host. This is also known as \\"cross-reactivity\\" between self antigen of the host and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogen. An autoimmune response is then generated against the epitope. Due to similar sequence homology in the epitope between the pathogen and the host, cells and tissues of the host associated with the protein are destroyed as a result of the autoimmune response.  Probability of mimicry events  The prerequisite for molecular mimicry to occur is thus the sharing of the immunodominant epitope between the pathogen and the immunodominant self sequence that is generated by a cell or tissue. However, due to the amino acid variation between different proteins, molecular mimicry should not happen from a probability standpoint. Assuming five to six amino acid residues are used to induce a monoclonal antibody response, the probability of 20 amino acids occurring in six identical residues between two proteins is 1 in 206 or 1 in 64,000,000. However, there has been evidence shown and documented of many molecular mimicry events. To determine which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, known as the UniProt database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of molecular mimicry becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 107 residues. The probability of finding a perfect match with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10‚àí7 (0.055). Therefore, within the SwissProt database, one would expect to find 1.5 X 107 X 3.7 X 10‚àí7 = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third hypervariable region of HLA- DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the Epstein-Barr virus and in E. coli. This motif occurs 37 times in the database. This would suggest that the linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of molecular mimicry since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.  Structural mimicry  Despite no obvious amino acid sequence similarity from pathogen to host factors, structural studies have revealed that mimicry can still occur at the host level. In some cases, pathogenic mimics can possess a structural architecture that differs markedly from that of the functional homologues. Therefore, proteins of dissimilar sequence may have a common structure which elicits an autoimmune response. It has been hypothesized that these virulent proteins display their mimicry through molecular surfaces that mimic host protein surfaces (protein fold or three-dimensional conformation), which have been obtained by convergent evolution. It has also been theorized that these similar protein folds have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer, most likely from a eukaryotic host. This further supports the theory that microbial organisms have evolved a mechanism of concealment similar to that of higher organisms such as the African praying mantis or chameleon who camouflage themselves so that they can mimic their background as not to be recognized by others. Despite dissimilar sequence homology between self and foreign peptide, weak electrostatic interactions between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off- rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges on the floor of peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur in the absence of any true sequence homology. There has been increasing evidence for mimicking events caused not only by amino acid similarities but also in similarities in binding motifs to the MHC. Molecular mimicry is thus occurring between two recognized peptides that have similar antigenic surfaces in the absence of primary sequence homology. For example, specific single amino acid residues such as cysteine (creates di-sulfide bonds), arginine or lysine (form multiple hydrogen bonds), could be essential for T cell cross-reactivity. These single residues may be the only residues conserved between self and foreign antigen that allow the structurally similar but sequence non-specific peptides to bind to the MHC.  Epitope spreading  Epitope spreading, also known as determinant spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the molecular mimicry mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated de novo by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage. T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated as a consequence of the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory Th1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to self antigen. The result of this is an autoimmune response that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly autoimmune response against mimicked self antigen and other antigens. From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given autoimmune response.  Implications in human disease  Diseases of the central nervous system The HIV-1 virus has been shown to cause diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans through a molecular mimicry apparatus. HIV-1 gp41 is used to bind chemokines on the cell surface of the host so that the virion may gain entrance into the host. Astrocytes are cells of the CNS which are used to regulate the concentrations of K+ and neurotransmitter which enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to contribute to the blood brain barrier. A twelve amino acid sequence (Leu-Gly-Ile-Trp-Gly-Cys-Ser-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ile-Cys) on gp41 of the HIV-1 virus (immunodominant region) shows sequence homology with a twelve amino acid protein on the surface of human astrocytes. Antibodies are produced for the HIV-1 gp41 protein. These antibodies can cross-react with astrocytes within human CNS tissue and act as autoantibodies. This contributes to many CNS complications found in AIDS patients. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leads to the development in mice of a progressive CD4+ T cell-mediated response after these cells have infiltrated the CNS. This virus has been shown to cause CNS disease in mice that resembles multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in humans that results in the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath coating axons of the CNS. The TMEV mouse virus shares a thirteen amino acid sequence (His-Cys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Trp-Leu-Gly-His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Phe) (PLP (proteolipid protein) 139-151 epitope) with that of a human myelin-specific epitope. Bystander myelin damage is caused by virus specific Th1 cells that cross react with this self epitope. To test the efficacy in which TMEV uses molecular mimicry to its advantage, a sequence of the human myelin-specific epitope was inserted into a non-pathogenic TMEV variant. As a result, there was a CD4+ T cell response and autoimmune demyelination was initiated by infection with a TMEV peptide ligand. In humans, it has recently been shown that there are other possible targets for molecular mimicry in patients with multiple sclerosis. These involve the hepatitis B virus mimicking the human proteolipid protein (myelin protein) and the Epstein-Barr virus mimicking anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (contributes to a ring of myelin around blood vessels). Muscle disorders Myasthenia gravis is another common autoimmune disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven amino acid sequence (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the Œ±-subunit that demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross- reactivity of the self epitope (Œ±-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus is associated with the initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause immunologic cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the Œ±-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the Œ±-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.  Control  There are ways in which autoimmunity caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination seems to be the most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this has been shown to be ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.  Conclusion  The concept of molecular mimicry is a useful tool in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of autoimmune disorders. Molecular mimicry is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow future research to be directed toward uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant. This way, future research may be able to design strategies for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders. The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to molecular mimicry.

It is situated in the southern suburbs of Kolkata. As an urban setup in the vicinity of Kolkata, the city is within the area of Greater Kolkata. It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Jaynagar and Majilpur are two separate towns. Since the formation of the municipality, these twin towns are known together as Jaynagar Majilpur. The city is very famous for its confectionery called Jaynagarer Moa. Etymology Jaynagar is an ancient settlement. The name of Jaynagar comes from the name of the local goddess Joychandi, from which the town derived the name, Joychanditala. Over time it became Joychandinagar and then Joynagar or Jaynagar. Another ancient settlement is Majilpur. The etymology of the name is an interesting one. Originally the Ganges would flow over where the town is, but slowly it started silting down. This silting is called Moje Jaoa in Bengali language, from which the town derived the name, Mojapur. Over time it became Mojpur, Mojipur and then Mojilpur or Majilpur. History Many janapadas grew up along the old Bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: Kalighat, Boral, Rajpur, Harinavi, Mahinagar, Baruipur, Baharu, Jaynagar, Majilpur, Chhatrabhog etc. Bipradas Pipilai's Manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. \\"Chand Sadagar, a merchant character of the Manasavijaya, reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea\\". Chaitanyadeva (1486‚Äì1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to Puri he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. \\"His last stoppage in 24 Parganas was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the Mathurapur police station. Chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel\\". Rama Chandra Khan, the zamindar of Chhatrabhog, helped Chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey. The city of Jaynagar Majilpur carries the memory of a very significant incident in the history of the Bengal. When Raja Pratapaditya Roy, the last independent Hindu king of Bengal at Jessore was defeated by the Mughal forces, the State Diwan's (Grand vizier) family and the State Priest's family were forced to flee to avoid persecution and conversion. They settled down in the city to form the estate of the Duttas, and the Brahmin priest, Sree Krishna Udgata, who came over, settled down in what is today the Bhattacharya Para. All the Bhattacharyas in the city are his scions, with the current 13th generation being settled out of the city. The city is famous for the ancient Dhanwantary Kali Temple, believed to be very benevolent, who listens to the prayers of her devotees promptly. An annual event is held, called the Besher Mela, where the goddess Kali is dressed up as Radha Krishna and other goddesses. It attracts thousands of devotees, and is one of the most iconic yearly events in the city. Also, by the express direction of the Dhanwantary Kali, every year, during Kali Puja, it is mandatory to host a Kali Puja in every Brahmin household of the city. It used to be a big annual festival, with hundreds of houses performing Kali Puja on the night of the Diwali, and going out on the next day in a beautifully orchestrated procession, going around the city, before the immersion or the Bisarjan. However, over the past few years, the number of houses performing Kali Puja has fallen drastically, now performed in only twenty odd houses. This has been mainly due to the gradual outward immigration of people from the hamlet, the reluctancy of the younger generation, and their inability to get hold of funds considering the deteriorating economic condition of Bengal, the rise of public subscription or locally called Barowari Puja and also the rise of Muslim immigrants and converts, who have posed problems while the peaceful immersion procession was on its way.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, p. 78, The Asiatic Society of Kolkata, The city was also called Half-Calcutta owing to the development it had seen before independence, with stalwarts like Sivanath Sastri and Umesh Chandra Dutta emerging. It was also a centre for active freedom fighting, with names like Kanailal Bhattacharya and Rajaram Bhattacharya to name a few.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, pp. 70-71, Sahitya Samsad, Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, pp. 522-523, Sahitya Samsad, Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 2013, Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, p. 117, Sahitya Samsad, Geography Area overview Baruipur subdivision is a rural subdivision with moderate levels of urbanization. 31.05% of the population live in the urban areas and 68.95% live in the rural areas.

History Family Tree of ruling Talukdars of Jetpur State (1884) during British India During the British period, the talukdars of Jetpur were Kathis of the Vala tribe. The talnka was a large and wealthy one consisting of 143 villages, and if under one chief would be a second class or even a first class state, as the revenue is not less than eight lakhs of rupees (Rs. 8,00,000). The Vala Kathis entered the province several centuries back, and one of their earliest seats was at Devlia Mota whence they conquered Chital. From Chital they acquired Jetpur and subsequently Mendarda and Bilkha. There are two different accounts given of the acquisition of Jetpur, viz. (1) that of the Tarikh-i-Sorath, which says that the first Nawab of Junagadh, Bahddur Khan I, granted Jetpur to Vala Vim; (2) tradition, which says that Vala Viro Najo of Chital aided the Valas of Bagasra in their feud with Vaijo Khasia of Mitiala, and that Vala Samat of Bagasra was slain in the battle. In consideration of Vira's aid the Valas of Bagasra gave him Jetpur. These Bagasra Valas acquired their share in Jetpur from the Khadia Baloch who received it from the local Muslim governors of former times. Jetpur is said originally to have been a holding of the former Valas, and to have been conquered from Vala Champraj by Shamskhan at the same time as the Vala town of Kileshvar in the Bardas was sacked. It is said that Vala Champraj had a beautiful daughter whom he refused to give to Shamskhan in marriage on which that noble sacked Kileshvar and took Jetpur, Vala Champraj and eighteen hundred Kathi horse being left dead on the field. But Vala Champraj is said to have killed his daughter, hence Shamskhan failed to obtain her. The great- grandfather of this Vala Champraj was Jetji who founded and named Jetpur (as said in the Tarikh-i-Sorath). Jetpur was held by sixteen talukdars descended from the common ancestor Vala Naja Desa in 1880s. Geography Jetpur is situated on the western bank of the Bhadar river. The Bhadar river, which has a south-westerly course to within a few miles of Jetpur, here suddenly takes a curve-to the north for a few miles, and then turns to the west. A bridge has been constructed across the Bhadar about a mile north of Jetpur on the Rajkot- Jundgadh highway.  Population  India census, Jetpur Navagadh had a population of 118,302. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Jetpur Navagadh has an average literacy rate of 98%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 98%, and female literacy is 97%. In Jetpur Navagadh, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. The population according to the census of 1872 was 9600 and according 1881 was 18,085 souls.

Flora and fauna Nagi Dam and Nakti Dam Bird Sanctuary Site description: The Nagi Dam (791 ha) and Nakti Dam (332 ha) are two sanctuaries so close to each other that they can be taken as one bird area. Nagi is 7 km from Jhajha in the Jamui District, and Nakti is a further 4 km from Nagi, occupying similar habitat. These notified sanctuaries are surrounded by rocky hillocks, formed by the damming of streams. Both these waterbodies are quite deep, with a clear water surface. These dams were built to supply water to local farms. There are cultivable lands adjacent to both the waterbodies. Biodiversity  Birds: About 1,600 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) have been recorded from this site. According to Wetlands International (2002), 1% threshold of this species is 560; accordingly about 3% of the population is found at this IBA site. This site could also attract more than 20,000 birds, if fishing and other disturbances are curtailed during winter when most of the migrants are found in India. Beyond the cultivated areas, these waterbodies are surrounded by barren, rocky terrain. Consequently, dryland birds are also seen, such as the Indian courser Cursorius coromandelicus, chestnut-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles exustus), yellow-wattled lapwing (Vanellus malabaricus) and Indian robin (Saxicoloides fulicata). The site falls in Biome-12, i.e. Indo-Gangetic plains, but species of Biome-11 are also sighted.

The first fossils were excavated in 1938 in Gombasek, Slovakia. More of its fossil remains were excavated from the Olivola site in Italy, while finds elsewhere in Italy were initially named Panthera toscana. Later fossils were found in England, Germany, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. Sometimes it is recognized as a subspecies of Panthera onca, the jaguar, as Panthera onca gombaszoegensis. Description European jaguars were larger than modern-day jaguars found in South America, such as Pantanal and Peruvian jaguars. With a bodyweight between 70 and 210 kg (154 to 463 lbs), they were therefore probably capable of bringing down larger prey. Like other Panthera species, they are thought to have been sexually dimorphic, with significantly larger males. History The ancestors of jaguars are thought to have arisen in Africa; a related form of Panthera was present in South Africa 1.9 Ma ago. Another form similar to P. gombaszoegensis has been found dating from early Pleistocene East Africa and had both lion- and tiger-like characteristics. P. gombaszoegensis was initially the only European Pantherinae species in the Early Pleistocene, being present alongside the felines Acinonyx pardinensis and Puma pardoides and the machairodontines Homotherium latidens and Megantereon whitei. Leopards arrived later in the Early Pleistocene or the Middle Pleistocene, and lions in the Middle Pleistocene. Taxonomy Leo gombaszoegensis was the scientific name proposed by Mikl√≥s Kretzoi in 1938 for teeth found in Tertiary deposits in Gombasek Cave, Slovakia. It was reassessed and subordinated to the genus Panthera in 1971. The following are considered to belong to P. gombaszoegensis as well: *Panthera toscana proposed in 1949 for carnassial teeth found in Villafranchian deposits in the Arno river valley in Italy. These remains were originally described as a distinct species and later as subspecies Panthera gombaszoegensis toscana. It is sometimes referred to as the Tuscany jaguar or Tuscany lion. *Felis (Panthera) schreuderi proposed in 1960 for cat fossils found in Tegelen, the Netherlands. *Jansofelis vaufreyi proposed in 1971 for cat fossils found in southeastern France. Some remains once attributed to P. gombaszoegensis have more recently been identified as Acinonyx pardinensis. Habitat and behavior The European jaguar has often been thought to be a forest-dwelling cat, similar in habits to the modern jaguar, although recent work suggests that the association between the European jaguar and forested habitats is not as strong as has often been assumed. It was probably a solitary animal.

Relocation According to the state government this is the worst site of India, the town of Jharia is to be shifted due to the uncontrollable coal mine fires (see below), which have found to be undousable, leading to loss of property and lives. Coal worth Rs. 60,000 crore (US$12 billion) is lying unmined, and the state government feels the shifting will help in exploiting this resource. The Jharia Rehabilitation and Development Authority is supposed to relocate much of the population to Belgaria and other towns nearby. However, as of 2017, the organization was facing considerable challenges in acquiring land and doing construction, and a 2016 book reporting on the relocation effort, found that the relocation was not accounting for Just Transition of jobs, or adequate high quality housing. Coal field Jharia Coal mine The coal field lies in the Damodar River Valley, and covers about 110 square miles (280 square km), and produces bituminous coal suitable for coke. Most of India's coal comes from Jharia. Jharia coal mines are India's most important storehouse of prime coke coal used in blast furnaces, it consists of 23 large underground and nine large open cast mines. The mining activities in these coalfields started in 1894 and had really intensified in 1925. The first Indians to arrive and break monopoly of British in Coal mining were Gujarati. After the mines were nationalized in 1971, due to easy availability of coal, many steel plants were set up in close proximity to Jharia. Coal field fire Jharia is famous for a coal field fire that has burned underground for a century. The first fire was detected in 1916. According to records, it was the Khas Jharia mines of Seth Khora Ramji, who was a pioneer of Indian coalmines, whose mines were one of the firsts to collapse in underground fire in 1930. Two of his collieries, Khas Jharia and Golden Jharia, which worked on maximum 260-foot-deep shafts, collapsed due to now infamous underground fires, in which their house and bungalow also collapsed on 8 November 1930, causing 18 feet subsidence and widespread destruction.Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar & Orissa 1917 Khora Ramji ColliriesKhora Ramji Mines capsized in 1938Diary of Golden Days at Jharia ‚Äì A Memoir & History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia ‚Äì written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa:1998 Page:12Nanji Bapa ni Nondh-pothi published in Gujarati in year 1999 from Vadodara.

It was formed in January 1943 and conducted patrols off the east coast of Australia until it was disbanded in August 1944. History During the first half of 1943 Japanese submarines operated off the Australian east coast, sinking 16 ships and damaging several more. In response to these losses the Australian Government expanded the military's anti- submarine warfare (ASW) forces. Three new RAAF maritime patrol units equipped with Avro Anson training aircraft, No. 66, No. 67 and No. 71 squadrons, were raised during this expansion. While it was recognised that the Ansons lacked sufficient range and payload to be effective in the ASW role, superior aircraft were not available.Wilson (1992), p. 48 No. 71 Squadron was formed on 26 January 1943 at RAAF Station Lowood, Queensland, from aircraft and aircrew drawn from No. 8 Service Flying Training School. The squadron was organised into flights located at RAAF Stations Amberley and Bundaberg in Queensland, and RAAF Stations Richmond and Coffs Harbour in New South Wales.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 88 The squadron began flying anti-submarine and convoy escort patrols shortly after its formation. On 17 March a No. 71 Squadron aircraft attacked what its crew believed was a Japanese submarine. The same crew claimed to have been fired on by another submarine eleven days later. On 5 May a No. 71 Squadron Anson was patrolling over a convoy when the merchant ship SS Fingal was torpedoed and sunk. While the aircraft's crew spotted the torpedo tracks, they were unable to locate the Japanese submarine.Odgers (1968), p. 146 Ten days later one of the squadron's aircraft on a routine anti-submarine patrol spotted a lifeboat containing survivors from the AHS Centaur which had been sunk by a Japanese submarine on 14 June; the loss of the ship was unknown at the time, and this was the first sighting of survivors. No. 71 Squadron took part in the subsequent intensive search for both further survivors and the submarine responsible, but only found empty life rafts.Odgers (1968), pp. 147‚Äì148 The squadron was involved in another attack on a convoy on 16 June when one of its Ansons was patrolling ahead of Convoy GP55 at the time two ships were torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-174. The aircraft ran low on fuel shortly after the attack, however, and had to return to base without sighting the submarine.Odgers (1968), p. 151 Two of the squadron's Ansons crashed during patrols in 1943 with the loss of their entire crew.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 89 In December 1943 No. 71 Squadron's headquarters moved to Coffs Harbour, with the flight at Lowood following in June. In July 1944 it was decided to disband No. 71 and No. 73 squadrons as part of a reduction in the RAAF's ASW effort.Odgers (1968), p. 349 The squadron was declared non-operational on 12 July 1944 but continued to fly training exercises until it was disbanded on 28 August.

Asahi no kata was first married to Saji Hy≈´ga no kami, but when her brother Toyotomi Hideyoshi wished to make peace with Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Hideyoshi expressed interest in marrying her to Ieyasu. In 1586, the retainers of Oda Nobukatsu were dispatched as messengers to Yoshida in Mikawa and, via Sakai Tadatsugu, proposed a marriage to appease Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu accepted the proposal and sent Sakakibara Yasumasa as his representative to Ky≈çto to exchange betrothal gifts. As a result, Saji Hy≈´ga committed suicide, in order to not pose an obstacle to such a powerful political marriage, and the two were married soon afterwards. Asahihime departed from ≈åsaka Castle and went to Hideyoshi‚Äôs formal residence in Ky≈çto known as jurakutei. In the fifth month, a wedding procession departed from the capital with over 150 participants including Asano Nagamasa and others famous warlords. During the procession, retainers of Nobukatsu including Oda Nagamasu also joined. Days later, the procession reached Nishino in Mikawa, and, in May 14, arrived in Hamamatsu whereupon she was marred into the Tokugawa family as the formal (second) wife of Ieyasu. At this time, Ieyasu was forty-five years old and Asahihime was forty-four. Thereafter, Asahihime kept a residence in Fuch≈´ in Suruga so she was referred to as Suruga Gozen. Even after completion of the wedding ceremony, Ieyasu did not go to Ky≈çto so, on the premise that ≈åmandokoro would visit Suruga Gozen in Okazaki, she further became a hostage, whereupon Ieyasu went to Ky≈çto and entered into a peace arrangement with Hideyoshi. In 1588, Suruga Gozen visited Ky≈çto to visit her ill mother, but, before long, she began to recover, so, on September, she returned to Suruga. It is not certain when she went to Ky≈çto again, but while residing in Hideyoshi‚Äôs residence, she fell ill in the first month of 1590, and died on January at the age of forty- seven. Around this time, Ieyasu was preparing for an expedition known as the Conquest of Odawara, and, while concealing his mourning, interred her at the T≈çfuku Temple in Ky≈çto. Suffering from ill health in her later years, Suruga Gozen became a follower of the Rinzai sect of Buddhism, and her posthumous name is Nanmei-in. A memorial tower was built at the T≈çfuku Temple so that Ieyasu could pay tribute to her after her death. This is the family temple for the Tokugawa sh≈çgun family where her portrait is kept.Ieyasu also had built a grave at the Zuiry≈´ Temple on Mount Taiun in Sunpu. Hideyoshi visited this site to pay his respects while en route on the Conquest of Odawara. A memorial tower was constructed for memorial services and he donated lands to the temple. Tokugawa and his new wife visited her mother when she fell ill in 1589; the mother of Asahi no kata and Hideyoshi died the following year, as did Asahi no kata herself.

History No. 73 Squadron was formed at Cootamundra, New South Wales on 1 July 1942 from personnel loaned by No. 1 Air Observers School.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 90 The squadron's formation was part of the RAAF's response to Japanese submarine attacks on shipping off Australia during mid-1942, and it was equipped with Avro Anson training aircraft. While it was recognised that the Ansons lacked sufficient range and payload to be effective in the anti-submarine role, superior aircraft were not available.Wilson (1992), p. 48 The squadron conducted training in the Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga areas during July and early August. The squadron moved to RAAF Base Nowra in September and began flying operational patrols. It was allocated twelve Ansons in October, which were split equally between its two flights. 'A' Flight's six aircraft were based at Nowra and 'B' Flight was stationed at RAAF Base Richmond.

It was formerly called Andhernagri and Pratishthan Pur or Puri. The place is also noted for being one of the Neolithic site, that provides one of the earliest evidence of farming in South Asia. Geography Jhusi has an average elevation of . It is the biggest town area in Allahabad district. Demographics India census, Jhusi had a population of 33,901 including the population of Jhusi nagar panchayat and Jhusi Kohna 13,878 and 20,023 respectively. History Archeological site near the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers yielded a C14 dating of 7106 BCE to 7080 for its Neolithic levels. Historically, Jhusi was known as Prathisthanpuram. Prayag's past buried at Jhusi The historian Dr. D. P. states it once belonged to the rulers of Mauryan, Shunga, Kushana and Gupta period, the ancient Pratisthana has lost its identity to the modernity of Jhusi. The only evidence related to this historical fact is still visible in the shape of high mounds in Jhusi. Surprisingly, these high mounds have further added to the significance of the city as the articles excavated from here belong to the sixth century BC and antiquities belonging to five cultural phases ranging from chalcolithic to early medieval period have been found here. As per the historians and the pre NBP ware deposit the site of Kumbh Mela is marked at this place as the earliest culture represented at the site. Early layer of this deposit has yielded iron objects. Some pottery items and antiquities are similar to those found at different chalcolithic sites in UP, Bihar and Northern Vindhyas. From the pre-NBP Ware period to the Gupta period there had been continuous settlement at the site. However, there appears to be a cultural gap between the end of Gupta period and the beginning of early medieval period. \\"There is every likelihood that the site may show up no gap at all when excavated extensively. This possibility is based on the strategic location of the site itself which, by virtue of the same reason, would have never been abandoned after having been once occupied. The excavations in the area only hint at the above fact. The ruins of ancient Pratishthana which are represented by the high mounds of Jhunsi on the eastern bank of Ganges are spread over an area of about four square miles. Pratishthana was the most important locality of Prayag and it was founded by king Ila and was the capital of Pururavas and other kings of Lunar dynasty Kalidasa too mentions about Pratishthana in his drama Vikramor-vasiyam. He has given an imaginary account of this palace of Pururavas which was magnificent. Various myths are also associated with this site. An inscription of Trilochanapala, the Pratihara king, was discovered from the site in 1830. In his book, VN Pandey mentions that the naming of Jhunsi too has a legend associated with it. It was once ruled by Har-bonga, an imbecile and foolish king in whose reign chaos prevailed everywhere. When the cup of his inequity was full there was an upheaval on the earth and the capital Pratishthana was turned upside down, hence now known as 'Ulta Quila'. There was a conflagration which completed the destruction of the city and the ruins went by the name of Jhulsi, a burnt town, from the Hindi root jhulasna. It is also said that the town was destroyed in an earthquake in 1359 CE as a result of the invocations of saint Maqdoom Shah Taqiuddin, whose tomb lies on one side of the fortress. Dubey states these traditions and the etymological meaning of the name Jhusi possibly indicate to the destruction and burning of the site by the Muslim invaders in the thirteenth century C.E. He adds that traditions relating to the scattering of Brahmana and Kshatriya clans abandoning their homes in Jhusi and emigrating to distant places during the medieval period lend colour to this theory. There is also the historical and sacred Samudrakoop here, which has its own story. \\"It is known as Samudrakoop since it belongs to the period of Samudragupta. In fact five such wells are found in Ujjain, Mathura, Prayag (Allahabad), Varanasi and Patalpur. It was dumped with garbage once but the efforts of a sage Dayaram brought its historical importance to limelight.\\" Research on lost heritage of Allahabad under Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) suggests that the site is slowly losing its identity on account of continuous erosion of Ganges river. \\"The high mound, which belong to Kushana period, has few bricks exposed right now\\".

Cook told Alison James from Soaplife that \\"basically he's an intelligent, responsible man who wants the best for the people he loves. He cares deeply for his family. Unfortunately, these feelings don't seem to be reciprocated by certain members.\\" Andrew arrives in Charnham as part of the new Warrington family. It consists of his two children Sara (Beth Cordingly) and Luke Warrington (Royce Cronin), wife Nikki Warrington (Rebecca Blake) and her teenage children Becky Scott (Chandra Reugg) and Darren Scott (Joe Fox). Nikki begins an affair with Luke. Blake who plays Nikki described Andrew as \\"a very straight guy\\" who could not imagine a bigger betrayal than his son and wife having an affair. Their tryst is discovered by Nikki's ex-husband Adrian Scott (Ariyon Bakare) and he takes Becky and Darren away in exchange for his silence. Cook explained that Andrew becomes suspicious of Nikki following the children going to live with Adrian. He confronts Nikki and she admits to having an affair. But her lies continue as she claims her lover is a colleague. Nikki's admission leaves the character devastated but willing to save his marriage. But he does want revenge against her.

Cook believed that his character experienced \\"utter devastation\\" and numbness because the betrayal came from both his wife and son. Andrew feels \\"terribly hurt\\" and thinks that his family view him as a fool. Though he blames Nikki entirely for the affair because she is eleven years Luke's senior.

They believed that Andrew would not be able to live on the same street as Nikki. Cook was upset to leave the role but agreed with their decision.

It originates from Slavic ancestors of first prominent Svantes in Sweden. The Slavic languages have the name which is rendered as Sviatopolk in Russian, ≈öwiƒôtope≈Çk in Polish and Svatopluk/Sv√§topluk in Czech and Slovakian. Also Svjatopluk and so forth in other renditions. In the latter half of the 13th century, Svantepolk of Viby (d 1310), a lord of high nobility, settled in Sweden. His mother had been a Pomeranian lady whose first name and precise origin is not known to us, but who is indicated to have come from the ducal family of Pomerelia. Svantepolk's father was Canute, Duke of Revalia, a bastard son of king Valdemar II of Denmark with a high-born Swedish lady Helena, daughter of Earl Guttorm. The name was presumably given to Svantepolk as namesake of some maternal relative of Slavic princely dynasties. Svantepolk's brother Eric, Duke of Halland, had got a traditionally Scandinavian first name. Svantepolk became justiciar (lagman) of √ñsterg√∂tland and a wealthy and remarkable feudal lord in Sweden. His wife was Benedicta, granddaughter of king Sverker II of Sweden. Svantepolk and Benedicta's daughters married lords of Swedish high nobility and became ancestresses of several Swedish noble families, bringing substantial dowries. Lord Svantepolk, with royal ancestry and rights to ducal dignity of Halland, Blekinge and Revalia, was a valued ancestor, well-remembered in his noble Swedish descendants' pedigrees and family lore.

Shell description  The Late Jurassic forms were elongate, with both valves being similarly shaped, often pipe or stake-shaped, while the reef-building forms of the Cretaceous had one valve that became a flat lid, with the other valve becoming an inverted spike-like cone. The size of these conical forms ranged widely from just a few centimeters to well over a meter in length. Their \\"classic\\" morphology consisted of a lower, roughly conical valve that was attached to the seafloor or to neighboring rudists, and a smaller upper valve that served as a kind of lid for the organism. The small upper valve could take a variety of interesting forms, including: a simple flat lid, a low cone, a spiral, and even a star-shaped form.  Fossil range and extinction  The oldest rudists are found in late Jurassic rocks in France. The rudists became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, apparently as a result of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. It had been thought that this group began a decline about 2.5 million years earlier which culminated in complete extinction half a million years before the end of the Cretaceous. The extinction of rudist bivalves was stepwise during the Maastrichtian (end of the Cretaceous).  Taxonomy  The rudists are, according to different systematic schemes, placed in the orders Hippuritida (Hippuritoida) or Rudistes (sometimes Rudista). Order: ‚Ä†Hippuritida * Suborder: ‚Ä†Hippuritidina  Superfamily: ‚Ä†Caprinoidea * Family: ‚Ä†Antillocaprinidae * Family: ‚Ä†Caprinidae *Family: ‚Ä†Caprinuloideidae * Family: ‚Ä†Ichthyosarcolitidae  Superfamily: ‚Ä†Radiolitoidea * Family: ‚Ä†Caprotinidae * Family: ‚Ä†Diceratidae * Family: ‚Ä†Hippuritidae * Family: ‚Ä†Plagioptychidae * Family: ‚Ä†Polyconitidae * Family: ‚Ä†Radiolitidae * Suborder: ‚Ä†Requieniidina  Superfamily: ‚Ä†Requienioidea * Family: ‚Ä†Requieniidae *Family: ‚Ä†Epidiceratidae Bieler, Carter & Coan in 2010 also named the non-Hippuritid families Megalodontoidea and Chamoidea, of Megalodontida and Venerida respectively, as \\"Rudists\\", but this classification was not monophyletic.  Ecology  The classification of rudists as true reef-builders is controversial because they would catch and trap much sediment between their lower conical valves; thus, rudists were not completely composed of biogenic carbonates as a coral would be. However, rudists were one of the most important constituents of reefs during the Cretaceous Period. During the Cretaceous, rudist reefs were so successful that they may have driven scleractinian corals out of many tropical environments, including shelves that are today the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. It is likely that their success as reef builders was at least partially due to the extreme environment of the Cretaceous. During this period tropical waters were between 6¬∞C and 14¬∞C warmer than today and also more highly saline, and while this may have been a suitable environment for the rudists, it was not nearly so hospitable to corals and other contemporary reef builders. These rudist reefs were sometimes hundreds of meters tall and often ran for hundreds of kilometers on continental shelves; in fact at one point they fringed the North American coast from the Gulf of Mexico to the present-day Maritime Provinces. Because of their high porosity, rudist reefs are highly favored oil traps. pteriomorph Volviceramus grandis (right) and the rudist Durania maxima (left) References   External links   Prehistoric bivalves Jurassic first appearances Maastrichtian extinctions ","title":"Rudists"},{"id":"5795599","text":"Jubbal is a town and a nagar panchayat in Shimla district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

Constructed around 800-1000 AD, the temple was renovated by the Jubbal rulers in the 19th century; the main idol of Hatkeshwari and the inner sanctum sanctorum were barely affected though. The place looks truly ethereal and out of this world during the evening prayer hours, when the fumes and sounds of the evening aarthi reverberate through its premises Getting there Traveling to Jubbal by road is the most preferred mode, because many state owned buses ply from Shimla to Jubbal. Buses and cabs are available for travel within the city. Private vehicles are also available from Shimla to Jubbal for moderate prices around 1000-2000 INR. The nearest narrow gauge railway line is at Shimla again, which is connected to Delhi by train. Jubbar Hatti airport provides irregular services, mainly due to fluctuating weather. You can obtain a more reliable service at Shimla airport which has direct flights to New Delhi.

The Academy is non- denominational and state-run by South Ayrshire Council. In 2008 the school transferred from the 48-year-old campus into a new building, which was opened to pupils in August 2008. History The original Belmont Academy was built in 1960. When the school leaving age rose to 15, Ayr Academy no longer had the capacity for all the secondary school children in Ayr and so Belmont was built. Construction of the current campus started on 10 January 2007 and the new building was opened to pupils in August 2008. Mainholm Academy decant In mid-2006, Mainholm Academy was closed for repairs and all of the school's pupils were decanted into neighbouring schools ‚Äì namely the Belmont, Ayr and Kyle Academies. Subsequently, on 24 November 2006 it was revealed by South Ayrshire Council that Mainholm would be closed permanently and the transfer of pupils to new schools became permanent. The public-private partnership rebuild Belmont Academy, along with Prestwick Academy, has had a new campus built to replace their aged original buildings. South Ayrshire Council made use of the controversial public-private partnership (PPP) plan to finance the project. Construction work was contracted to the British-based company Carillion. Work was originally due to start in the summer of 2006 but was delayed and did not begin until 10 January 2007. The former playing fields beside the school were entirely fenced off during this process. Although work started later than intended the school was completed by the original date in 2008 and opened to pupils on 24 August 2008. The gradual dismantling and demolition of the original buildings began shortly after the new facilities opened, during which time the old campus was completely sealed off from the new. The demolition and clearing was finished by February 2009. New Head Teacher, 2013 Early in the year, and after many years serving Belmont Academy, headteacher Alan Moir left his post. A temporary headteacher Allan Rattray of Girvan Academy occupied the role for several weeks before his replacement, Susan Beattie, was able to take up her post. Houses The school has 5 houses into which the pupils of the school are assigned. Originally named after islands in the Firth of Clyde, the houses were Arran, Craig, Cumbrae and Bute. As the school roll varied, first Kintyre was added to make 5 houses, then Bute was dropped as the school roll fell, however it was reinstated together with Lomond as the school roll was subsequently increased again with the partial assimilation of Mainholm Academy. In 2010 Craig house was dropped and the pupils split between the remaining 5 houses. The remaining 5 houses are Cumbrae, Bute, Lomond, Kintyre and Arran.

Hugo Gellert (born Hug√≥ Gr√ºnbaum, May 3, 1892 December 9, 1985) was a Hungarian-American illustrator and muralist. A committed radical and member of the Communist Party of America, Gellert created much work for political activism in the 1920s and 1930s. It was distinctive in style, considered by some art critics as among the best political work of the first half of the 20th century. His family immigrated to New York in 1906. Gellert studied in art schools in New York. His illustrations were first published in radical Hungarian and American magazines, but in the 1920s Gellert worked as a staff artist for The New Yorker magazine and The New York Times newspaper. Although he was opposed to United States' entry into World War I, when conditions were worsening in Europe in 1939 after the rise of Nazi Germany, Gellert helped organize \\"Artists for Defense\\"; he later became chairman of \\"Artists for Victory\\", which included over 10,000 members. Biography Early years Hugo Gellert ()See: his \\"Gell√©rt Hug√≥\\" signature in his 1916 cover art from El√∂re\\" was born Hug√≥ Gr√ºnbaum on May 3, 1892 in Budapest, Hungary. In 1906, the family immigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City. They settled there and changed their surname. Gellert studied at the Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design. He married a woman named Livia. Art and politics Gellert, a committed socialist who later joined the Communist Party of America, considered his politics inseparable from his art. He had said that \\"Being an artist and being a communist are one and the same.\\" He used his art to advance his ideals for the common people. Much of his art depicted what he saw as the injustices of racial divides and capitalism. Often his works were captioned with slogans to further the illustration. The Working Day, for exampleFrom Karl Marx in Pictures, published in 1993, France shows a black laborer standing back to back with a white miner. It is accompanied by a phrase from Karl Marx's Das Kapital, \\"Labor with a white skin cannot emancipate itself where labor with a black skin is branded.\\"  Art as politics  \\"Out of the War.\\" This cover image of an armless veteran being spoon-fed, from a February 1916 issue of El≈ëre, exemplifies Gellert's radical anti-militarism. Opposed to World War I, Gellert published his first anti-war art in 1916. His work was prominently featured both in the illustrated magazine of the Hungarian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America, El≈ëre (Forward), as well as Max Eastman's radical monthly magazine The Masses from this time.The Masses collection at Michigan State University He also created numerous illustrations for Eastman's successor magazine, The Liberator, as well as sundry publications of the Communist Party USA after its formation, such as The Workers Monthly and The New Masses. Later, Gellert was offered a position as a staff artist for The New Yorker magazine. In 1925, he moved to the New York Times. In 1927, Gellert was appointed the leader of the Anti-Horthy League, the first American anti-fascist organization. In this capacity, he organized a demonstration against U.S. president Calvin Coolidge, and both he and his wife were arrested while picketing the White House. In 1932, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, feeling uncomfortable about Gellert's public persona and politics, petitioned to have Gellert's work removed from its collection. However, they were forced to reconsider when other artists, many of whom did not share Gellert's social idealism, came to his defense as fellow artists and threatened to withdraw their own works. In 1934 Gellert was among the leaders of the Artists Committee of Action, an informal group which had formed to protest Nelson Rockefeller's destruction of Diego Rivera's mural Man at the Crossroads early in the year at Rockefeller Center. Gellert was instrumental in the establishment of Art Front magazine, which started publication in November 1934 and was at first jointly published by the ACA and the Artists Union.Patricia Hills (2010). Art Front. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Accessed February 2015. In 1939, Gellert helped organize the group, \\"Artists for Defense\\". He later became the Chairman for \\"Artists for Victory\\", an organization that included over 10,000 members. Death and legacy The Liberator in March 1918, the seminal American radical magazine. Gellert died in Freehold Township, New Jersey on December 9, 1985. Gellert's social commentary, his work and his beliefs have placed him among the greatest American social artists of the Art Deco era, according to experts in the field. His brother Ernest, also a socialist, was drafted in 1917 but refused induction, claiming to be a conscientious objector. He was convicted of refusing the draft and sentenced to prison. Gellert fled to Mexico after Ernest died of a gunshot wound in prison at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, officially a suicide. Their brother Lawrence was a music collector; in the 1930s he documented black protest traditions in the South of the United States. Although remembered for his art in print, Gellert also painted a number of public murals and frescoes. Among the surviving frescoes is the series that adorn the front entryways of each of the four buildings of the Seward Park Housing Corporation, a housing cooperative with 1728 apartments, designed and built by Herman Jessor as part of the social housing cooperatives built by the Abraham Kazan and the United Housing Foundation,. In 2003, the series became the topic of controversy after the cooperative converted from its limited equity status to a fully private and market-rate residential co-op. The cooperative attempted to remove or destroy the four giant Gellert murals. The Co-op board felt the socialist- style paintings were no longer representative of the people or the Lower East Side neighborhood. Public protests and letter writing, inspired threats of legal action and other possible setbacks, caused the plan to be delayed. Gellert's artwork can still be seen in each of the buildings.

The study draws from the disciplines of anthropology, psychiatry, history, psychology, sociology, religious studies, and theology. Eileen Barker noted that there are five sources of information on new religious movements (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena. The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its methodology, and is therefore interdisciplinary in nature. A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by social scientists. Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology. Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field, resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions. This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones. The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research. It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the feminist spirituality movement is usually examined by scholars of women's studies, African-American new religions by scholars of Africana studies, and Native American new religions by scholars of Native American studies. Historical development In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War. In the 1960s American sociologist John Lofland lived with Unification Church missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.Conversion , Unification Church , Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, Hartford Institute for Religion Research, Hartford Seminary Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by Prentice-Hall as Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations, Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W. Michael Ashcraft, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 , , page 180Exploring New Religions, Issues in contemporary religion, George D. Chryssides, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001 , page 1 In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s; prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with Pentecostalism for instance being studied by church historians and cargo cults by anthropologists. This Western academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s. By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the American Academy of Religion, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion. The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which Islamic studies grew in Western nations following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western religious studies establishment in the 1990s. In 1988, the charity INFORM (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions. Barker established INFORM due to her \\"conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West.\\" Also in 1988, the Italian scholar Massimo Introvigne established CESNUR (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in Turin; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America. In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara, California, which was directed by J. Gordon Melton. Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs. In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs. It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; \\"an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted.\\" Sympathetic scholarly groups have been accused of uncritically believing what NRMs tell them, being pro-NRM, or ignoring the issues raised by ex-members. The term \\"cult apologists\\" is sometimes used. The term \\"cult wars\\" has been used to describe controversies in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, when academics with a differing views of NRMs confronted each other, including through lawsuits. By the late 2000s, the confrontation had started subsiding.

The SIE carries on its activity in keeping with the Constitution of Romania, the laws of the country, the Decisions of the Country's Supreme Defense Council (CSAT), and military regulations. The activity of the service has the character of a state secret. The sources of intelligence, the ways and means its mission is carried out cannot be disclosed to anyone, under whatever circumstances. The disclosure, in any way, of information and intelligence that make the object of activity of the Foreign Intelligence Service is forbidden, and punishable as laid down in the law. The Foreign Intelligence Service is authorized, under the law, to use specific methods, develop and own appropriate means for obtaining, checking, assessing, turning to account, storing and protecting intelligence information relating to national security. It also has the right, in the conditions established under the law, to ask for and obtain from the Romanian public authorities, companies, other legal entities, as well as from individuals, intelligence, information, or documents needed in accomplishing its missions. History By Decree no. 111/February 8, 1990 issued by the Committee of the National Salvation Front, the Foreign Intelligence Centre (Centrul de Informa»õii Externe (CIE)) was confirmed as an institution of the Romanian state, mandated to carry out its activity in the field of foreign intelligence. Law no. 39/December 13, 1990 gave an identity to the Foreign Intelligence Service, as this regulatory act stipulates for the first time the name of the SIE, as a CSAT member. The legal framework that regulates the activity of the SIE is based on Law no. 51/1991 on national security, Law no. 415/2002 on the organization and functioning of the CSAT, Law no. 182/2002 on the protection of classified information, and Law no. 1/January 6, 1998 on the organization and functioning of the Foreign Intelligence Service, completed by the Emergency Ordinance (OUG) no. 154 on November 21, 2001. Cooperation with the other intelligence services in Romania In a united Europe and in a global world, the SIE has developed, since 1991, a close cooperation with similar institutions in several countries, having beneficial effects on safeguarding the national security. In keeping with national regulations, the Romanian intelligence services frequently carry out joint actions aimed at preventing and countering events that might prejudice Romania's national security. The cooperation between the SIE and other structures with responsibilities in the field of national security is achieved through operational intelligence exchanges on matters of common interest, as well as in other aspects or working ways that contribute to ensuring national security. This process is carried out according to certain cooperation protocols negotiated between the parties, which stipulate the obligation of immediately informing each other on aspects regarding national security. Communication with the civil society and the media The relation of the Foreign Intelligence Service with the civil society and the media is managed by a special structure in its organizational chart. This structure coordinates at the same time, in keeping with its responsibilities, the institutional relations of SIE with the Parliament, the Presidential Administration, the Government and the governmental organizations, as well as with the other structures in the central public administration. In communicating with the civil society and the media, the SIE strikes a necessary balance between the citizen's right to be informed in conditions of transparency and the obligation to keep secret the information that, under the law, cannot be disclosed. This inevitably leads to a range of restrictions entailed by the specificity of the work that can otherwise be found in all the intelligence services in the democratic states. Overseeing the activity of the SIE The activity of the Foreign Intelligence Service is organized and coordinated by the Country's Supreme Defence Council (CSAT). The CSAT approves the organisational structure, the staff in peacetime or during mobilization, the functioning regulation, and the tasks of the Foreign Intelligence Service. Every year, or whenever the circumstances make it necessary, the SIE Director submits to the CSAT reports on the way the Service accomplishes its missions. Control upon the activities of the SIE is exercised by the Parliament of Romania, via a special Parliamentary Committee, tasked with observing the confidentiality and the means and sources of intelligence collection. The special committee is made up of three deputies and two senators, elected from among the Committees for Defence, Public Order and National Security of the two Chambers. Parliamentary oversight aims to check whether the activity of the Foreign Intelligence Service is consistent with the Constitution of Romania and the policies of the Romanian state. While exercising the prerogatives incumbent upon it, the Commission demands from the SIE, through its director, papers, information, and intelligence, and may conduct hearings of individuals connected to the issues being analysed. The Foreign Intelligence Service is bound to meet, in due time, the Committee's requests and allow the hearing of the respective persons, with prior approval by the SIE Director. Financially, the activities of the Foreign Intelligence Service are audited by the Ministry of Public Finances, which exercises a delegated pre-emptive financial verification, and the Audit Office, through its follow- on control over the execution of the revenue and expenses budgets. The Public Ministry also gives clearances on and authorizes the legality of some activities conducted with a view towards gathering intelligence.  Surveillance of private persons and the press  On February 4, 2015, Mugur Stroe - a former chief of SIE, declared that the Service possessed compromising pictures of TV presenters and press writers.http://www.realitatea.net/fost-ef-sie-vor-mai-fi-surprize-in-cazul- fotografiilor-cu-udrea-i-bica-a-fost-par-ial-mana-sri_1624943.html This alarming statement has been made in the context of accusations of corruption against the Romanian Intelligence Service.

The village is situated on the Granta branch of the River Cam, seven miles south of Cambridge. Whittlesford Parkway railway station serves the village. Listed as Witelesforde in the Domesday Book, the name Whittlesford means \\"ford of a man called Wittel\\", indicating the importance of a local ford across the river in the village. History The parish lies to the west of the River Cam, just to the north of the Icknield Way, an ancient thoroughfare which forms the historic parish boundary on the south. The parish contains 1,976 acres, and the area was occupied in Roman times. A hospital, then a form of almshouse, was founded in the village by Sir William Colville before the time of Edward I, and there are some remains of the original building still standing. Whittlesford was at one stage a market town. Roger Ascham, the tutor of Elizabeth I, lived in Whittlesford, and a road in the village is named after him. Church The first record of the church in Whittlesford dates from 1217, but there has certainly been a church on the present site since at least Norman times. The church has been dedicated to Saint Andrew since medieval times, and from the 16th century the dedication to Saint Mary was added. The present building consists of a chancel and nave with south chapel, south aisle and a central tower. It is built of field stones with ashlar dressings. The north wall of the nave dates from the 11th century Norman church as well as the base of the tower and several south windows. The chancel dates from the 13th century and the south chapel from the 15th century. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the church had strong links with Jesus College, Cambridge and vicars were frequently fellows of the college. The church contains a square 13th century font. A late 12th or early 13th- century Sheela na Gig can be observed on a high window arch of the church, accompanied by an ithyphallic male figure.The Whittlesford Sheela na Gig A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in the village in the early 19th century, but was closed before the end of the century. A Congregational chapel was built in 1903. Village life The village now has two public houses, the Tickell Arms (named after the Tickell family, former lords of the manor), and the Bees in the Wall, but it formerly had many more; in 1851 there were six pubs, and by 1904 there were eight. Most notable among these was the Waggon and Horses that closed in 1937. The two surviving pubs are both Grade II listed. The village is served by the William Westley Church of England Primary School, named after the 18th century businessman who endowed the village's first school in his 1723 will.William Westley Primary School Whittlesford has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V, known locally as 'The Lawns'. Hill figure In September 2004, a crop mark in a surrounding field surfaced, resembling a horse, discovered by the Whittlesford Society Archive Project by aerial view (similar to how the Rockley Horse was discovered). This led to speculation that this was possibly the site of a newly discovered hill figure of a white horse. The mark particularly resembled the Uffington White Horse. Ground investigation was planned but whether the investigation project will go through or has already gone through is unknown.

Its primacy has been recently questioned because of a wagonway built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600 and possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, this line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away. Also, a wagonway at Broseley in Shropshire was probably earlier.P. King, 'The First Shropshire Railways' in G. Boyes (ed.), Early Railways 4: Papers from the fourth early railways conference (Six Martlets, Sudbury 2010), pp. 70-84. The wagonway was the earliest form of railway. Although modern historians are uncertain as to whether it evolved or was invented, it is known that, between the Autumn of 1603 and 1 October 1604, a wagonway had been built near Nottingham, by Huntingdon Beaumont who was the partner of Sir Percival Willoughby, the local land-owner and owner of Wollaton Hall. It ran for approximately two miles (3 km) from Strelley to Wollaton to assist the haulage of coal. The actual track gauge is unknown but some websites state it was . No documentary evidence exists to support such statements although Lewis' work (1970) on early wooden railways, and the practicalities of horse haulage, suggest a gauge close to that dimension is plausible. The above is from Sir Percival Willoughby's agreement with Huntingdon Beaumont dated 1 October 1604. Sir Percival was Lord of the Manor of Wollaton and Huntingdon Beaumont was the lessee of the Strelley coal pits. They worked the Strelley mines in an equal partnership. Comparatively little is known of the wagonway. It cost ¬£172 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and ended at Wollaton Lane End, from where most of the coal was taken onwards by road to Trent Bridge and then downstream on the River Trent by barge. The wagons or carriages were drawn by horses on wooden rails. The Strelley mines were worked only until about 1620, by which time all readily recoverable coal had probably been mined. The wagonway was presumably then abandoned. The success of the Wollaton Wagonway led to Huntingdon Beaumont building other wagonways for his other mining leases near Blyth in Northumberland. A continuous evolution of railways can be traced back to the Wollaton Wagonway.

Migration Kairana and Kandhla migration row (also known as Kairana exodus) refers to alleged mass migration of families from Kairana and Kandhla in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh during the period 2014‚Äì16. Media sources have stated that the migration was due to threats of extortion from Mukim Kala, described as a \\"gangster.\\" The National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the migration from Kairana.[1] Bharatiya Janata Party politician Hukum Singh released a list of 346 Hindu families which had migrated from Kairana. On 14 June, he released another list, this time containing the names of migrant families from Kandhla. Both these list and the subsequent response have received extensive media coverage and are expected to play a key role in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, 2017. Several families have reportedly deserted the city due to extortion and loot by goons of gangsters like Mukim Kala. Many families have reportedly been forced to shift to nearby Haryana villages due to the terror. Locals said they were getting threats on phone and through letters. If one refuses to give protection money, he is killed by the henchmen. They have no option but to leave the city to save their lives. However it was also reported that many migrated not because of communalism, but crime. National Human Rights Commission confirmed the exodus in an inquiry which also cited the influx of Muzaffarnagar Riot refugees as exacerbating the harmony in Kairana.

He was born in Uxbridge Township, Upper Canada in 1808, the son of Quakers who had come from Pennsylvania after the American Revolution. He bought a farm and sawmill there. He became interested in the Reform movement of William Lyon Mackenzie and took part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. Gould was captured and sentenced to be exiled to Van Diemen's Land but his sentence was reduced to 9 months in prison. He was pardoned as part of a general amnesty in 1838. After his release, his farm prospered; he also owned mills and factories and operated the Whitby, Lake Scugog, Simcoe and Huron Road. He also promoted the development of railway links in the region. Gould served on the district council from 1842 to 1854 and became the first reeve of Uxbridge Township and the first warden for Ontario County. He was elected to the Legislative Council for the North Riding of Ontario in 1854 and 1857; he was defeated in 1861. While in office, he helped pass measures to abolish seigneurial tenure and secularize the clergy reserves. After he left politics, he helped other members in his community by supporting the building of churches and primary schools. Having received very little schooling himself, he did not believe in higher education. He died in Uxbridge in 1886. His son Isaac James later served as a member of the legislative assembly for the province of Ontario and in the federal parliament. His daughter Alma Gould Dale was a founding member of the Quakers in western Canada.

Situated at a distance of 56 km from Imphal, it is surrounded by hillocks and agricultural land. Tarang Turel, a rivulet flowing down from the eastern hills, runs through the middle of the town serving as a natural spring. It is connected to other parts of the state by the Imphal -Sugnu state highway. Population India census,Census of India Kakching Khunou had a population of 11,379. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. It has an average literacy rate of 66.74% (Male literacy: 75.43%, and female literacy: 57.27%), lower than the national average of 74.04%. In Kakching Khunou, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. History As the name clearly indicates, the people inhabiting Kakching Khunou had once migrated or bifurcated from Kakching. It is believed that these people under the leadership of Khamlangba first came from the west (of Manipur) and settled down at Uripok, Imphal though their pre-historic records could not be traced. These laborious people in search of their iron-ore moved from Uripok towards the south and settled for sometime near Kshetri Leikai of present Thoubal, during the reign of Charailongba (49th King of Manipur 1697‚Äì1709 A.D.\\"Manipur and The Mainstream\\" by N. Tombi Singh, 1975) Shortly thereafter, they migrated to Kakching Khuman near Pallel. During the reign of Garib Niwas (50th King of Manipur 1709‚Äì1748 A.D.\\"Manipur and The Mainstream\\" by N. Tombi Singh, 1975) Kakching was governed by Budhiraj.The Meitheis, Page 9, T.C. Hudson In the year 1790, during the reign of Bheigyachandra, they shifted to the present Kakching site while some sections moved further south and settled at Kakching Khunou. During the reign of Chourajit in 1726(Saka) one Leimapokpam Chandra was transported as Loi at Kakching Khunou which is evident of the village having existed.Cheitharol Kumbaba, page 184, 1989 edition The Historical evidence of these people can easily be traced from many authentic books and records. Special mention in this connection can be made of that of Captain R. Boileau Pemberton's \\"Report on the Eastern Frontier of British India,1835\\" in which he described at page 30 > \\"..Kokshing lungsaee, Kokshing Khunao, Kokshing Khoolen and Langathel are > the principal villages at which the iron works are carried on, under the > direction of called Budhiraj Rajah, who claims for his ancestors the merit > of having first discovered the existence of iron-ore in the valley and of > rendering it subserve into the use of man\\". And these professional people were also governed through the leadership of one Khullakpa as Hudson clearly mentioned in his book \\"The Meitheis\\" (page 72). In Gazetteer of Manipur Capt. E.W. Dun clearly stated the settlement of Kakching Khunou village. Moreover, all the Kakching Villages in manipur worshipped Khamlangba and Sekmai Ningthou as their Umanglai (Forest Deity), which are the symbols of iron.

They are: Religion Ibudhou Khamlangba Laikon The pre-historic religion of the Kakchings prior to their arrival at Uripok cannot be traced, but it can definitely be counted that they adopted the Meitei religion before their conversion into Hinduism. In describing the Kakching Lois, Capt. E.W.Dun in his book, Gazetteer of Manipur (page 129) had quoted the writings of Sir James Johnstone in connection with their religion, > \\"..they were Lois but now called themselves Hindoos, having some time since > 1867 been adopted into the Hindoo community by the Rajah, and they give > themselves all the airs of Hindoos!\\" The people of Kakching Khunou also worship \\"Ibudhou Khamlangba\\" and \\"Ibudhou Sekmai Ningthou\\" as their Umanglai (Forest God) which are the symbols of iron. The majority of the population follows Hinduism. Some follow the old Meitei religion of Sanamahism and a minuscule section of the population has embraced Christianity.

Currently, the Chairman of the Town Panchayat is PC Rajan, who hails from the nearby village called Manjuvilai. The town is centered on the Sathya Vageeswarar Temple. Demographics India census, Kalakkad had a population of 30,921. Males constitute 48.9% of the population and females 51.1%.

In Kalakkad, 10.18% of the population is under 6 years of age. History As per popular folklore, the name Kalakkad was due to one of the following: # The place was a forest full of 'kalaa' ‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Ææ(Tamil word) tree; # It was a battlefield or 'kalam'‡Æï‡Æ≥‡ÆÆ‡Øç (Tamil word); # It was the capital of 'kalapirars' who ruled Tamil Nadu from this place. In History of Travancore from the Earliest Times, P. A. Sankunny Menon mentions Kalacaud instead of Kalakkad. A few battles between the Travancore Kings and the British at this place are recorded. Joannes de Lannoy, the only son of Eustachius De Lannoy, was killed in battle of Kalakkad on 14 September 1765 at the age of twenty. Kalakkad was a scene of frequent struggles in the late 1750s during the Polygar revolt led by the Puli Thevar and changed hands several times. The village was the capital of Pandya kings briefly. A rest house constructed by the British is still there at Sengaltheri in the nearby mountains. Even today people refer to Kottai(‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà), the equivalent of a fort, in this area, though no traces of it are found today. Village The village of Kalakkad has several streets, running around the Sathyavageeswarar temple. Generally the streets were inhabited by people of specific castes, though these days one can find a mixture of people in all the streets. The village is surrounded by lush green paddy fields, with the western ghats at the horizon. Many small waterfalls can be seen in the distant mountains. Maalai (Garland) aruvi near Sengaltheri can be seen from a distance of almost 8 km. There are several other temples for Mutharamman, Isakkiamman, Suadalaimadan and Ayyanar in the village. Pari Vettai and Kodai Vizha are annual festivals which are celebrated in these temples. The forest areas have been declared as a protected tiger reserve ‚Äì Kalakkad Mundanthurai Sanctuary. Sathyavageeswarar Temple Gomathiambal, Sathyavageeswarar Temple in Kalakkad was constructed by King Marthanda Varma. Kalakkad is home to an ancient temple dedicated to Sathyavageeswarar (Lord Siva). The other principal deity is Goddess Gomathi. Dating back to the 13th century AD or the late Pandya period, further additions were made till the 17th century AD. The Rajagopuram renovation and temple Kumbha Abhishekam (ritual consecration) was performed on 14 July 2011 by Bhakthar Peravai (Devotees Forum). Gopuram The Gopuram or the temple tower of Sathyavageeswarar Temple is 135 feet tall, having nine tiers. More than 200 ancient paintings adorn the inner walls of each of the nine tiers. A project to conserve these paintings has been undertaken by the REACH Foundation, an NGO. They resemble the Vijayanagara and Nayaka schools of art of the 16th‚Äì17th century AD. This gallery of art on each of these floors depicts scenes from the Ramayana, Thiruvilayadal Puranam, Parvathi Parinayam, the life and work of Saivaite saints and some local events. The Gopuram structure is made of lime mortar and brick. This Gopuram contains the maximum number of sudhais or human figures made of lime. Workmanship The exquisite workmanship of those days is revealed in the stone sculptures around the temple. There are several musical pillars in the mandapams of the temple, which resonate with sapthaswaras when tapped gently by hand.

He edited writings by Mexican writers who preceded him, wrote a biography of Juan de Zum√°rraga, and translated William H. Prescott's Conquest of Mexico. His works on Colonial Mexico continue to be cited today. Life Garc√≠a Icazbalceta was born in Mexico City to a wealthy Spanish family. The family was exiled to Spain in 1825, shortly after the recognition of Mexican independence, by an act of Congress, and was not able to return until seven years later. He was educated by tutors and through independent reading. He learned several Continental languages and delved into the study of Iberoamerica. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, in which he took part. After the war he returned to scholarly pursuits. He married Filomena Pimentel (who died in childbirth), granddaughter of Count of Heras. He spent the better part of his life amassing a large collection of books, documents, and manuscripts from the colonial era, which he used in his work. Work Garc√≠a Icazbalceta wrote his biography of Juan de Zum√°rraga, the first Archbishop of Mexico, during a time when Mexican history was being reevaluated, resulting in criticism of the Archbishop and the mendicant orders who converted the natives. In it, he countered Liberal and Protestant charges that the Archbishop was \\"ignorant and fanatical\\" by casting him and other Franciscans in the role of the saviors of the Indians, from the brutality of the civil authority. He also highlighted the Archbishop's role in fostering early educational institutions such as the Colegio Santa Cruz and credits him with bringing the first printing press to the Western hemisphere. He especially objected to charges‚Äîlevelled by Mier, Bustamante, and Prescott‚Äîthat Zum√°rraga had played any role in the destruction of native Aztec codices, arguing that most of the destruction had occurred before Zum√°rraga's arrival, that no Spanish chroniclers mention any book burnings, and that the one mentioned by Alva de Ixtlilxochitl was committed by Tlaxcalans in 1520. He also used the book to criticize the hypocrisy he viewed in Liberal legislators, who, while attacking the Archbishop for cruelty to the Indians, betrayed the indigenous heritage of the nation by lifting limitations on the export of ancient works of art and artifacts. The book was sufficient to restore the credibility of the Archbishop and the place of the Franciscans as founders of the Mexican society in the Mexican consciousness, but it raised other questions. Many people were uncomfortable with the lack of any mention of the apparition of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Guadalupe or Zum√°rraga's construction of a chapel in her honor. In fact, Garc√≠a Icazbalceta had written a chapter on the subject, which he elected not to include in the final draft at the behest of Francisco Paula de Verea, bishop of Puebla. In it, he divulged that he had not found any contemporary documents referring to the apparition, identifying Miguel S√°nchez's 1648 Imagen de la Virgen as the first to appear. Despite his prestige as Mexico's pre-eminent historian of the time, his political conservatism and his devout Catholicism, attacks were made against his reputation by defenders of the historicity of the apparition. In response to a demand made by Pelagio Antonio de Labastida, Archbishop of Mexico, he wrote a detailed account of \\"what history tells us about the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to Juan Diego\\". In it, he detailed all of the historical problems with the traditional legend of the apparition. These included the silence of historical documents on the phenomenon, especially that of Zum√°rraga, the lack of any of the Nahuatl documents mentioned by previous historians, the unremarkability of the blossoming of flowers during the month of December (an important aspect of the traditional narrative), and the improbability that \\"Guadalupe\\" was a Nahuatl name. He further cited inconsistencies between the studies of the icon as reasons to doubt the apparition's historicity. He started work on a dictionary of Mexican Spanish, Vocabulario de Mexicanismos, which was only finished up to the letter \\"G\\" and was published posthumously. Icazbalceta was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1881.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Death and legacy Garc√≠a Icazbalceta died of \\"cerebral apoplexy\\" at the age of 70. His writings on the work of the Franciscan Order in Colonial Mexico influenced the work of Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, a contemporary historian.

Atwell in his directorial debut and also featuring Stage Combat by Corey Yuen. The film stars Jet Li and Jason Statham. The film was released in the United States on August 24, 2007. War features the second collaboration between Jet Li and Jason Statham, reuniting them for the first time since 2001 film The One. Jason Statham plays an FBI agent determined to take down a mysterious assassin known as Rogue (played by Jet Li), after his partner is murdered. Wars working title was Rogue; it was changed to avoid conflict with another film with the same name. It was re-titled as Rogue Assassin in New Zealand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Australia, the Philippines, and several European countries. Plot During a shootout against Chinese Triads at a San Francisco dock warehouse, FBI agents John Crawford (Jason Statham) and Tom Lone (Terry Chen) stumble across the notorious assassin Rogue (Jet Li), a former CIA assassin who now works for the Japanese Yakuza. Rogue ambushes Crawford and is about to execute him when Lone appears and shoots Rogue in the face, causing him to fall into the water. Rogue's body was never found and he is presumed dead. However, Rogue survives and retaliates against Lone, his wife and his daughter. He kills them, burns down the house, and leaves their three corpses in the ashes of their home. Three years later, Rogue re-appears, working under Chinese Triad boss Li Chang (John Lone). While working with Chang, Rogue secretly instigates a war between the Triads and the Yakuza, led by Shiro Yanagawa (Ryo Ishibashi). Rogue first attacks a club run by the Yakuza by killing the gangsters and later on the runners in order to recover a pair of antique gold horses, family heirlooms of Chang. Now the head agent of the FBI's Asian Crime Task Force, Crawford is determined to hunt Rogue down and exact revenge for Lone's death. Crawford's obsessive pursuit of Rogue has taken a toll on his personal life causing him to be estranged from his family. Crawford comes close to catching Rogue in the wake of Rogue's various killing sprees against the Triads and Yakuza, but Rogue always manages to stay one step ahead. Ultimately, Rogue's actions have gained the trust of both Chang and Yanagawa. Rogue succeeds in killing Chang, but spares Chang's wife and child, turning on the Yakuza. With Chang dead, Yanagawa appears in America, intending to expand Yakuza business operations. However, he is confronted by Crawford and the FBI; Crawford presents Yanagawa with proof that Rogue has betrayed him and spared Chang's family, but Yanagawa refuses to assist Crawford in locating Rogue. Later, Rogue delivers the horses to Yanagawa personally. Knowing of Rogue's betrayal, Yanagawa captures Rogue and demands the location of Chang's family. Rogue turns the tables on Yanagawa's men and kills them all, and engages in a sword fight against Yanagawa himself. Yanagawa discovers that the real Rogue was killed when attempting to assassinate Lone. Lone in turn surgically altered himself to assume the assassin's identity. Lone reveals that his actions have all been designed to bring him face-to-face with Yanagawa, so he could kill the man who ordered the death of his family. Yanagawa reveals that Crawford was in his pocket that whole time and responsible for leaking Tom Lone's identity and home address to the real Rogue. Angered, Lone disarms and decapitates Yanagawa. Meanwhile, Chang's wife receives a package from Lone, containing one of the two golden horses that belongs to Chang's family and a message reading, \\"Make a new life\\". Yanagawa's daughter also receives a package with the same message and inside the box is her father's head. Lone then calls Crawford as he is packing up his office, asking him to meet him at the dock warehouse where they last made their investigation. Before going to the warehouse, Crawford enlists the help of Goi (Sung Kang), an FBI sniper that aided Crawford throughout the investigation. At the warehouse, Crawford and Lone battle each other in an intense hand-to-hand fight in which Lone reveals his true identity to Crawford. When Lone reveals his true identity, a devastated Crawford reveals that it was true that he was working for Yanagawa at the time but had no idea that Rogue was still alive. He was then blackmailed into giving Lone's address to Yanagawa thinking that Yanagawa's men were only going there to \\"rough him up a bit\\". Ever since, Crawford was angry at himself and wanted revenge against Rogue and everyone else involved in what he thought was his partner's death. Crawford protects Lone by jumping in front of Goi‚Äôs line of sight, but is then shot by Lone. The next day, Lone later drives out of town to start a new life.

It is located in Keswick, Ontario, Canada and serves Grade 9 to 12 students from the growing Keswick community. It follows the curriculum standards set by the Ontario Ministry of Education and was officially opened in September 2000. History Construction began in 1998. The school was built in order to accommodate the rising population of its surrounding suburban area, which continues to grow in rapid numbers. Previously, residents of the town of Georgina (including, among others, the communities of Keswick, Sutton, Pefferlaw, and Udora) commuted to Sutton District High School. However, the population count of the Sutton D.H.S. surpassed 2200, and would only rise due in part to the double cohort. Already well above its intended capacity, Keswick High School was built. Notable events *Visual Arts teacher James Ruddle lived in a box for 66 hours, painting the inside of it. *In 2009, an Asian student was the victim of an alleged racially motivated assault. After he fought back, he was charged with assault and threatened with expulsion by his school. 400 students walked out of the high school to protest bullying and stand up against racism. Despite the fact that the Asian student previously had an excellent record and only threw one punch, apparently in self-defence against a racially motivated attack, the principal had originally called for the extreme measure of expelling him from all schools in the region. It was particularly sensitive because of a series of attacks on Asian fishermen in the same area in 2007, which led to an investigation by the Ontario Human Rights Commission.

The oldest formula is ascribed to one Barbarossa, in a letter to Francis I of France.Frazer, William. Elements of Materia Medica. Dublin, 1851, p. 173. Description Blue mass was used as a specific treatment for syphilis from at least the late 17th century to the early 18th.Marten, John. A Treatise of the Venereal Disease. London, 1711, p. 630. Blue mass was recommended as a remedy for such widely varied complaints as tuberculosis, constipation, toothache, parasitic infestations, and the pains of childbirth. A combination of blue mass and a mixture called the common black draught was a standard cure for constipation in early 19th century England and elsewhere. It was particularly valued on ships of the Royal Navy, where sailors and officers were constrained to eat rock-hard salted beef and pork, old stale biscuits (hardtack), and very little fruit, fiber, or other fresh food once they were at sea for an extended period. It was a magistral preparation, compounded by pharmacists themselves based on their own recipes or on one of several widespread recipes. It was sold in the form of blue or gray pills, or syrup. Its name probably derives from the use of blue dye or blue chalk (used as a buffer) in some formulations. The ingredients of blue mass varied, as each pharmacist prepared it himself, but they all included mercury in elemental or compound form (often as mercury chloride, also known as calomel). One recipe of the period included (for blue mass syrup):King's American Dispensatory, 1898. * 33% mercury (measured by weight) * 5% licorice * 25% Althaea (possibly hollyhock or marshmallow) * 3% glycerol * 34% rose honey Blue pills were produced by substituting milk sugar and rose oil for the glycerol and rose honey. Pills contained one grain (64.8 milligrams) of mercury. Toxicity Mercury is known today to be toxic, and ingestion of mercury leads to mercury poisoning, a form of heavy-metal poisoning. While mercury is still used in compound form in some types of medicines and for other purposes, blue mass contained excessive amounts of the metal: a typical daily dose of two or three blue mass pills represented ingestion of more than one hundred times the daily limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States today.

Many landlords used to allow tenants to construct pressurized walls as long as they remove the walls before vacating the apartment.

Majority of the population speaks Punjabi language while Hindi or Bagri ( Haryanvi) is also spoken amongst a small population of Kalanwali. Adjacent to the kalanwali town is the kalanwali village. The often held regret among kalanwali village people is regarding the absence of even semi-solid roads/streets in the village. While many of the minor villages surrounding kalanwali have solid streets, kalanwali village still finds itself in dusty and muddy streets. The whole of kalanwali is surrounded by rivers and canals though despite all these water bodies, the water supply, both for drinking and irrigation, suffers from time to time. Education Kalanwali has 3 government schools. One for primary education, one for girls and another one is common for boys & girls.

Ancient relics and inscriptions relating to the village are found in the local Siva temple named thirukkaraesvara temple. Probably the temple was built by one Thirukkarai and hence the name Thirukkaraesvara (on anology with Rajarajeshvara). If so the history of the village could be traced to the Sangam age. The area was under the control of the MalaiyamƒÅns of Thirukkoiyilur where ruled the famous chieftain MalaiyamƒÅn Thiru-mudikkƒÅrai who has been sung by eminent Sangam poets like AuvaiyƒÅr, Paranar, and Kapilar. It is not unlikely that Thirukkarai of this family built the Siva temple after whom it came to be called Thirukatisvaram. The Sthala purƒÅna of the village seems to support this antiquity.

The 68th Pontiff Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamiji was initiated into ascetic order and ordained as the 68th Acharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Math in Kalavai. Kalavai sprang into worldwide prominence with the association of Sri chandrasekarendra Sarasvati swamigal, the mahaswamigal of Kanchi Kamakoti pitha.

It is the core operation in the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm, which is numerically stable and well-suited to implementation on parallel processors . Only rows k and ‚Ñì and columns k and ‚Ñì of A will be affected, and that A‚Ä≤ will remain symmetric. Also, an explicit matrix for Qk‚Ñì is rarely computed; instead, auxiliary values are computed and A is updated in an efficient and numerically stable way. However, for reference, we may write the matrix as : Q_{k\\\\ell} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & & & & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\ddots & & & & 0 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & c & \\\\cdots & -s & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & s & \\\\cdots & c & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & 0 & & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & & & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} . That is, Qk‚Ñì is an identity matrix except for four entries, two on the diagonal (qkk and q‚Ñì‚Ñì, both equal to c) and two symmetrically placed off the diagonal (qk‚Ñì and q‚Ñìk, equal to s and ‚àís, respectively). Here c = cos œë and s = sin œë for some angle œë; but to apply the rotation, the angle itself is not required. Using Kronecker delta notation, the matrix entries can be written : q_{ij} = \\\\delta_{ij} + (\\\\delta_{ik}\\\\delta_{jk} \\\\+ \\\\delta_{i\\\\ell}\\\\delta_{j\\\\ell})(c-1) + (\\\\delta_{ik}\\\\delta_{j\\\\ell}  \\\\delta_{i\\\\ell}\\\\delta_{jk})s . \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Suppose h is an index other than k or ‚Ñì (which must themselves be distinct). Then the similarity update produces, algebraically, : a'_{hk} = a'_{kh} = c a_{hk} - s a_{h\\\\ell} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{h\\\\ell} = a'_{\\\\ell h} = c a_{h\\\\ell} + s a_{hk} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{k\\\\ell} = a'_{\\\\ell k} = (c^2-s^2)a_{k\\\\ell} + sc (a_{kk} - a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell}) = 0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{kk} = c^2 a_{kk} + s^2 a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} - 2 s c a_{k\\\\ell} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} = s^2 a_{kk} + c^2 a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} + 2 s c a_{k\\\\ell}. \\\\,\\\\\\\\!  Numerically stable computation  To determine the quantities needed for the update, we must solve the off-diagonal equation for zero . This implies that : \\\\frac{c^2-s^2}{sc} = \\\\frac{a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} - a_{kk}}{a_{k\\\\ell}} . Set Œ≤ to half of this quantity, : \\\\beta = \\\\frac{a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} - a_{kk}}{2 a_{k\\\\ell}} . If ak‚Ñì is zero we can stop without performing an update, thus we never divide by zero. Let t be tan œë. Then with a few trigonometric identities we reduce the equation to : t^2 + 2\\\\beta t - 1 = 0 . \\\\,\\\\\\\\! For stability we choose the solution : t = \\\\frac{\\\\sgn(\\\\beta)}{\\\\beta+\\\\sqrt{\\\\beta^2+1}} . From this we may obtain c and s as : c = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{t^2+1}} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : s = c t \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Although we now could use the algebraic update equations given previously, it may be preferable to rewrite them. Let : \\\\rho= \\\\frac{s}{1+c} , so that œÅ = tan(œë/2). Then the revised update equations are : a'_{hk} = a'_{kh} = a_{hk} - s (a_{h\\\\ell} + \\\\rho a_{hk}) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{h\\\\ell} = a'_{\\\\ell h} = a_{h\\\\ell} + s (a_{hk} - \\\\rho a_{h\\\\ell}) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{k\\\\ell} = a'_{\\\\ell k} = 0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{kk} = a_{kk} - t a_{k \\\\ell} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : a'_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} = a_{\\\\ell\\\\ell} + t a_{k \\\\ell} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! As previously remarked, we need never explicitly compute the rotation angle œë. In fact, we can reproduce the symmetric update determined by Qk‚Ñì by retaining only the three values k, ‚Ñì, and t, with t set to zero for a null rotation.

Having an area of 15.37 km2, 40% of Kalliasseri Panchayath is a part of middle land and 60% comes under Coastal Plain. The highest point of Kalliasseri is Kalapram Motta, near the northern boundary of the panchayath. This point gives a view of the paddy fields and coconut groves of Kolath vayal. The Kandanchira Thodu, starting from chudala motta, near Kannur Engineering College, flows along from east to west of the panchayath, to which another stream which flows out from Kunhikulam and joins near Parakkadav. This streamlet reaches Irinav, where it is called Irinav puzha, and at its mouth a saline water regulator was constructed, connecting the islet of Madakkara. Recently, this was converted into a bridge. In the last century, Kolath vayal primarily planted paddy fields, but now it almost entirely consists of coconut plantations.

Culture and politics  Kalliasseri is notable for its contribution to the political space in Kerala, especially through E. K. Nayanar (former Chief Minister of the state) and K. P. R. Gopalan (freedom fighter who escaped the gallows following the intervention of Mahatma Gandhi (whose efforts proved successful in raising the issue inside the British Parliament which culminated in Queen Victoria reducing the death penalty to life imprisonment). Kalliassery also played a prominent role in the freedom movement of India, as well as the emergence of the Communist Party of India as a leading political movement in India. Kalliasseri was the centre of Karshaka Sangham of Chirakkal Taluk. Morazha incident, one of the famous events in the National Movement of Kerala in which a police sub inspector and a head constable was killed during the police intervention on the Anti-imperialist day public meeting on 15 September 1940, took place in Anchampeetika, on the northern border of Kalliasseri Panchayath. Sri.T.Damodaran Nambiar was the first President of Kalliasseri Grama Panchayat and K.V.Narayanan Nambiar. K.P.R.Rayarappan and M.P.Narayanan Nambiar were some of the notable leaders who became presidents of Kalliasseri GP. During 1991‚Äì93, the Panchayat of Kalliassery was chosen for an experiment of Panchayath Level Participatory Planning in continuation with Panchayath Resource Mapping Programme, which was later known as \\"Kalliasseri Planning Model\\". A national seminar, \\"Learning From Kalliasseri\\" organised by Centre for Development Studies (CDS) Thiruvananthapuram in 1995, inaugurated by Sri A.K. Antony, Chief Minister of Kerala and validated by Sri E.M.S. Namboodipad, proclaimed the Kalliasseri planning model to be replicated. Later, this planning model became the role model for the \\"People's Planning Campaign\\" (PPC) of Kerala. Kalliasseri was the first Gram Panchayath in Kerala to establish a Panchayath Vikasana Samithi (PDS) based on Neighborhood Groups and a Panchayath level School Complex.

The club's roots loosely lie with a Methodist New Connexion congregation who had a chapel on the corner of Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale in Everton, Liverpool. Initially formed as St. Domingo FC, named after the chapel, the football team was renamed Everton in 1879 after the district of Everton. Since then Everton have had a successful history winning the Cup Winners' Cup, the league title nine times and the FA Cup five times. They were the first club to play over 100 seasons in the top flight of English football, the 2018‚Äì19 season will be their 116th. Foundation One of the first Everton FC teams, 1878 St. Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel was opened in 1871 in Breckfield Road North, Everton, Liverpool. The chapel took its name from its location on the corner of Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale. St. Domingo related addresses in Everton have their origins in St. Domingo House, a building built in 1758 by West Indies trader and sugar boiler George Campbell who would frequent the Colony of Santo Domingo and later became Mayor of Liverpool (1763). In 1877 Rev. Ben Swift Chambers was appointed Minister of St. Domingo Chapel. He created a cricket team for the youngsters in the area but, as cricket was only played in summer, there was room for another sport during winter. Thus a football club called St. Domingo F.C. was formed in 1878, the club's first match being a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Everton Church Club. Many people not attending the chapel were interested in joining the football club so it was decided that the name should be changed. In November 1879 at a meeting in the Queen's Head Hotel, the team name was changed to Everton Football Club, after the surrounding area. Barker and Dobson, a local sweet manufacturer, introduced \\"Everton Mints\\" to honour the club. The district is also the location of the team's crest image, Everton Lock-Up, sometimes referred to locally by the nickname Prince Rupert's Tower. Everton originally played at Anfield on an open pitch in the southeast corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, the same site for the once proposed new Liverpool F.C. stadium. The first official match under the name Everton F.C. took place in 1879 against St. Peters with a 6‚Äì0 win. John Houlding's house backed onto the park and was attracted to the club that attracted large crowds. Professional clubs required proper enclosed facilities. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home for two years, with proper hoarding and turnstiles. Mr Cruit asked the club to leave his land as the crowds became far too large and noisy. Everton moved to nearby Anfield in 1884, renting from John Orrell, a friend of Houlding. Proper covered stands were built. Houlding bought Anfield one year after Everton moved in, Everton initially making a donation to a local hospital in lieu of rent before paying rent to their own president. Within seven years of moving to Anfield the club had converted the ground from a brick field to a 20,000 plus international standard ground with accommodation on all sides. The club rose from amateur to professional, hosting an international match, England vs. Ireland, founder members of the Football League and winning their first title. The club's income rose substantially.The Everton Collection Football League founders In 1888 Everton became founder members of the Football League, finishing eighth the first season and second the following. First League title 1891 The 1890‚Äì91 season started in superb form with five straight victories, with Fred Geary scoring in each of the first six matches. By mid-January, Everton had completed all but one of their fixtures and were on 29 points, while Preston North End were eleven points adrift with seven games still to play. Everton than had to sit out the next two months as Preston completed their fixture list until they were only two points adrift with one match each left to play. Both teams played their final games of the season on 14 March, with Everton losing 3‚Äì2 at Burnley (Geary scored both Everton goals) and Preston going down 3‚Äì0 at Sunderland. Everton were thus able to win the Football League Championship for the first time, by a margin of two points with fourteen victories from their 22 league games. Geary had been ever- present, and was the club's top goal-scorer with 21 goals. Move to Goodison Park In the early 20th century, rivals Liverpool and Everton produced a joint matchday programme. This example is from April 1910. After winning the league for the first time, the Everton Committee and President John Houlding became embroiled in deep and bitter conflict. Houlding originally rented Anfield from the Orrell family and sublet to Everton FC. In 1885 Houlding bought the land from Orrel and rented directly to Everton FC. The Liberal- leaning committee viewed Conservative councillor Houlding as having a personal financial and political agenda and there was disagreement over the club's business model and the issue of selling refreshments, to which Houlding had sole rights. Houlding had increased the club's rent by 150% after the 1889‚Äì90 season to ¬£250 per annum. John Orrell, who owned the adjacent land, then attempted to legally run a road through the new main stand to access his land. This would require Everton to buy both Anfield and Orrell's land or to rent both. Everton committee members accused Houlding of knowing of the legal right of way and allowing the new stand to be built. The committee wanted Houlding to negotiate on the combined Anfield and Orrell's land rent of ¬£370 or the purchase of both, but were told the rental fee was non-negotiable. Houlding refused to give Everton FC a contractual rental lease. Houlding attempted to hijack the club by incorporating another company, The Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited in January 1892https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00035668 and seeking to get it registered as the official club in March 1892. Everton were still occupying and playing at Anfield, and Houlding sought to take over Everton's fixtures and position in the Football League. The Football League would not recognise Houlding's new company as Everton, resulting in his changing the name to Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd in June 1892, creating Liverpool F.C.. The distrust between Houlding and the Everton Committee resulted in Everton abandoning their substantial ground at Anfield and moving to Goodison Park on the north side of Stanley Park, issuing 5,000 shares as they did so, giving the directors a 6% stake in the club.

Everton then reached their second successive final on 20 April 1907, however, finished in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. Champions again 1914‚Äì15 was to be the final season before league football was suspended for the duration of the First World War. Everton won their second league title, one point ahead of Oldham Athletic, with Bobby Parker finishing the season as the leagues' top scorer on 35 goals. Interwar years: Dean and co. Statue of Dixie Dean outside Goodison Park William Ralph Dean, better known as \\"Dixie\\" Dean, was one of the greatest goal scorers that the English game has seen. After averaging a goal a match for Tranmere Rovers, prolific striker Dean was lured across the River Mersey to play for Everton. In his first season for Everton, the 1925‚Äì26 season, Dean netted 32 league goals in 38 matches, scoring his first two on his debut. The next season, he scored 21 goals in 27 matches. Sixty Making history in 1927‚Äì28, Dean scored 60 league goals in 39 matches, setting a record that has stood ever since and almost single-handedly gave Everton the league title. In a bizarre turn of events, in 1930 Everton finished last in the first division being relegated to the second division. Dean was on top form in the secondary league, scoring 39 goals in 37 matches and lifting Everton to promotion at the first attempt as the Second Division champions. The following season, 1931‚Äì32, Dean scored 45 goals as Everton won their fourth league title. In 1933, Everton won the FA Cup, with Dean becoming Everton's first-ever number 9 in the 3‚Äì0 final win against Manchester City. In this match, numbers were worn for the first time. The number 9 would become synonymous with commanding and high-scoring strikers at domestic and international level football, something Dean embodied. He played his last match for Everton on 11 December 1937. Dean died at a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in 1980, leaving behind a legacy of 383 goals in 433 matches overall. In the 1938‚Äì39 season, Everton, with Joe Mercer, T. G. Jones and Tommy Lawton won the Football League Championship again. Lawton scored 35 goals during the season at the age of 19. The outbreak of World War II interrupted the players' careers for six years, bringing a halt to a team which otherwise may have achieved much more, exactly the same scenario as season 1914‚Äì15. 1940s‚Äì'50s: the barren years Chart showing the progress of Everton F.C. through the English football league system from the inaugural season in 1888‚Äì89 to the present. Although the 1990s have been regarded as a poor decade, this era was worse. The great 1939 championship- winning team was quickly split up in 1946. Tommy Lawton was sold to Chelsea, Joe Mercer disagreed with the manager Theo Kelly and was sold to Arsenal, and they tried to sell T. G. Jones to Roma. Soon, only Ted Sagar was left. Under the management of the uninspired and under-financed Cliff Britton, Everton were relegated after the 1950‚Äì51 season for only the second time in their history to the Second Division. This time it took three seasons before Everton were promoted in 1954 as the runners-up. The final match of the season decided promotion when Everton beat Oldham Athletic away 0‚Äì4. The era nevertheless had some notable players such as Dave Hickson and Bobby Collins. Memorable matches included ending Manchester United's long unbeaten run at Old Trafford with a 2‚Äì5 win in 1956. Everton did reach the FA Cup semi-finals twice, in 1950 losing to Liverpool and 1953, losing to Bolton Wanderers 4‚Äì3. Harry Catterick era (1961‚Äì1974) The 1960s is regarded by many fans as the golden era of Everton Football Club. During this period they won the League Championship and Charity Shield twice (1963 and 1970 for both), and FA Cup once (1966). After the barren period of the 1950s, Harry Catterick took charge of the Everton in 1961. The team were soon to be dubbed the \\"School of Science\\" after their methodical approach in the tradition of the Everton team in the 1920s who were first given this name. Their football was inventive and flowing similar to Tottenham's \\"Push and Run\\" style. In Catterick's first full season as manager Everton conceded fewer goals than any other team and finished fourth. Champions The following season, the Toffees lost just six of their 42 matches and took the title, Everton's sixth. The striking partnership of Roy Vernon and the \\"Golden Vision\\" Alex Young scoring 46 goals between them (the last time two Everton players have scored more than 20 goals each in one season). Other notable players included Billy Bingham, Jimmy Gabriel, Derek Temple, Bobby Collins and Brian Labone. Trebilcock and Temple In 1966, the same year the English international team won the World Cup, Everton took home the FA Cup in a classic, after overturning a two-goal deficit against Sheffield Wednesday in the final to win 3‚Äì2. Everton reached final again in 1968, but were unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. The following year Everton did progress to the semi-finals at Villa Park, losing 1‚Äì0 to Manchester City. The \\"Holy Trinity\\" A year later in the 1969‚Äì70 season, Everton won the Championship again thanks in part to the scoring sensation of Joe Royle, who would later manage the club to FA Cup success in 1995. The success of the team could be seen from the number of points won (one short of the record) and nine clear of Leeds United. The team won the league in style, playing what was virtually a form of Total Football orchestrated by the \\"Holy Trinity\\" midfield of Howard Kendall, Alan Ball and Colin Harvey. With Labone at centre-half and club captain and Royle up front, this is regarded by many fans as the club's finest side ever. Harry Catterick's team of 1969‚Äì70 seemed destined for greatness but declined quickly. In 1970‚Äì71 Everton did not recapture their league form but did progress on two cup fronts. For only the second time, Everton played in the European Cup reaching the Quarter-finals but were knocked out by Greek side Panathinaikos on the away goals rule. The previous weekend Everton took on neighbours Liverpool in the FA Cup semi final and lost 2‚Äì1. Everton finished 14th in 1971, and 15th, 17th and seventh in the following seasons. The stress of an under-performing team was said to be a factor in Harry Catterick's poor health and eventual resignation in 1974. Billy Bingham and Gordon Lee era (1974‚Äì1981) Gordon Lee Honours: Football League Cup- Runners Up (1977), Everton were on course to win the Championship again in the 1974‚Äì75 season under Billy Bingham (some bookmakers had even stopped taking bets at Easter) but some surprising losses to lowly opposition ended the challenge and they finished fourth. After two relatively poor seasons (11th and ninth), Bingham left in 1977. During the interregnum, Everton reached their first League Cup final, with Aston Villa, and the FA Cup Semi final, against Liverpool. In the League Cup Everton and Aston Villa drew the final at Wembley and drew the replay at Hillsborough, before Everton lost late in extra time of the second replay at Old Trafford. The FA Cup Semi final was drawn 2‚Äì2 but the match will forever be remembered for the goal by Bryan Hamilton that was disallowed. Everton lost the replay 3‚Äì0. Under Gordon Lee, Everton finished third in 1977‚Äì78 (Bob Latchford topped the first division scoring chart with 30 goals), and fourth in 1978‚Äì79, after yet again looking serious title contenders for much of these seasons. However, the expectations were high given the success of Liverpool across the park, and finishes of 19th in 1979‚Äì80 and 15th in 1980‚Äì81, too close to the relegation zone for comfort, led to Lee's departure. Everton did reach the FA Cup Semi final in 1980 drawing with Second Division West Ham, but lost the replay. Howard Kendall era (1981‚Äì1987) Honours Won : FA Cup (1984), Charity Shield (1984), European Cup Winners Cup (1985), League Championship (1985), Charity Shield (1985), Charity Shield Shared (1986) League Championship (1987). Runner-Up : Milk Cup (1984), FA Cup (1985), First Division (1986), FA Cup (1986) Former Everton player Howard Kendall returned to the club as manager for the 1981‚Äì82 season, having won promotion from the Third Division with Blackburn Rovers and taken them within a whisker of a second successive promotion. Kendall's reign got off to a promising start with a 3‚Äì1 win over Birmingham City on the opening day of the season, and they finished eighth in the First Division. Their steady progress continued into 1982‚Äì83, as they finished seventh and only narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. The only real letdown that season was a 0‚Äì5 home defeat by Liverpool on 6 November 1982. During the first three seasons after his appointment as Everton manager, Kendall brought through younger players like Neville Southall, Gary Stevens, Derek Mountfield, Peter Reid, Kevin Sheedy and Trevor Steven, with Kevin Ratcliffe and Graeme Sharp already at the club. Other players would be added but the most significant purchase late in 1983 was Andy Gray. Everton hoped to bring in some success having been massively overshadowed since the early 1970s by neighbouring Liverpool. 1983‚Äì84 was a trying season in the league, with Everton being in the bottom half of the First Division for much of the season and fans making continued calls for Howard Kendall to be sacked, but a good run of form in the final weeks of the season saw Everton achieve a seventh-place finish once again. Everton, however, were progressing on two cup fronts. Reaching their second League Cup final, now known as the Milk Cup, the Blues drew 0‚Äì0 with Liverpool at Wembley, but eventually lost the replay. The FA Cup though was the silver lining, with Everton winning the final 2‚Äì0 against Watford to end a 14-year trophy drought. This was the fourth time Everton had won the Cup. 1984‚Äì85 The following season was to be one of Everton's finest. Despite a less than convincing start, this young Everton team began to flourish. (to be expanded) Everton won their eighth league title with four matches to spare. Once again though, Everton were progressing on two cup fronts. In Europe, Everton reached their first European final after defeating German giants Bayern Munich 3‚Äì1 at Goodison, in the European Cup Winners' Cup, after the first leg ended 0‚Äì0. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable in the club's history. The final against Rapid Vienna was also won 3‚Äì1, as Everton clinched their first-ever European trophy. In the FA Cup, Everton reached their second successive FA Cup Final. Having already won the league, and having just won the Cup Winners Cup three days earlier, Everton set their minds on a treble. At Wembley, in the final, a tired Everton lost 1‚Äì0 to Manchester United. Had they not lost, Everton would have joined Liverpool as only the second English team to win three major trophies in one season. The 1984‚Äì85 Cup Winners' Cup campaign was not without its controversy. In a tie with Fortuna Sittard of the Netherlands, an Everton fan streaked on the pitch and was arrested when trying to climb back over the security fencing into the stands. This was one of many high-profile pitch invasions by fans of English clubs at home and abroad around this time. The Heysel Stadium disaster consequently resulted in English clubs being banned from European Competition by UEFA. The 1985 close season saw the acquisition of 24-year-old striker Gary Lineker from Leicester City, with Lineker's arrival sparking the controversial departure of the hugely popular Andy Gray, who returned to Aston Villa. Double runners up 1985‚Äì86, even without European action, would be another exciting season for Everton. By the end of September, it looked as though Manchester United would be champions of the First Division after winning the first ten games of the campaign, while Everton were in fifth place and stood 13 points adrift of Manchester United and also had Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle United above them. However, United's excellent form gradually tailed off and Everton went top of the league on 1 February 1986 thanks to a 1‚Äì0 win at home to Tottenham Hotspur. After this, Everton looked on course to retain the title for most of the remaining season, although Liverpool and surprise contenders West Ham United kept on Everton's heels for the following months. However, failure to beat Nottingham Forest followed by a shock 1‚Äì0 defeat to Division One newcomers Oxford United on 30 April resulted in Everton being unseated from the top spot by Liverpool, with only three games remaining. Unfortunately, their defence of the title was ended on 3 May 1986 as Liverpool's last league game of the season left the title out of Everton's reach, despite Everton crushing Southampton 6‚Äì1 at Goodison Park on the same day. However, Everton won the race for second place by defeating fellow contenders West Ham 3‚Äì1 on the final day of the league season. On 10 May 1986, they took on Liverpool in the first all-Merseyside FA Cup final. A first-half goal by Gary Lineker, his 40th of the season, suggested that the FA Cup would be heading to the blue half of Merseyside, but two goals form Ian Rush and a goal from Craig Johnston saw Liverpool win the trophy to complete the double, while Everton were left with nothing. Had UEFA decided to lift the ban on English teams in European competitions at the end of that season (though the ban on all clubs was indefinite, it was reviewed at the end of every season), then Everton would have entered the Cup Winners' Cup, but UEFA voted for the ban to continue for at least another season and so there would be no European action for English clubs for the second season running. The 1986 close season saw Everton sell leading goalscorer Gary Lineker to Barcelona of Spain, and the arrival of defender Dave Watson from Norwich City, while midfielder Adrian Heath switched to the role of Graeme Sharp's strike partner. Champions again The 1986‚Äì87 campaign began in a familiar fashion, with Everton and Liverpool being firmly among the contenders, though this time there some unlikely other teams also in contention, including Norwich City and Coventry City. By Christmas, Everton were fourth in the league (level with third placed Liverpool) and a point behind second-placed Nottingham Forest, while a resurgent Arsenal were six points ahead of them at the top of the league. However, a 3‚Äì1 win over Coventry City on 7 February 1987 sent them to top of the league, and they clinched the league title on 4 May 1987 with a 1‚Äì0 win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. The European ban on English clubs continued, so Everton would not be able to compete in the European Cup in 1987‚Äì88. During the 1987 close season, Howard Kendall defected to Spain to become coach of Athletic Bilbao, and was replaced as manager at Everton by his former assistant Colin Harvey. Colin Harvey era (1987‚Äì1990) Honours won : Charity Shield (1987) Runner-up : Simod Cup (1989), FA Cup (1989) Colin Harvey's first season as manager brought a fourth-place finish. During the 1988 close season Everton made one of the first ¬£2million signings in English football when they signed 23-year-old striker Tony Cottee from West Ham United. Harvey also signed midfielder Stuart McCall from Bradford City that summer. Despite Cottee scoring a hat-trick on his debut against Newcastle United and going on to be one of the most highly rated frontmen to wear an Everton shirt, Everton's league fortunes declined in 1988‚Äì89 as they finished eighth in the league. Everton did return to Wembley twice, in April for the Full Members Cup final only to lose out to Nottingham Forest and in May in the FA Cup final, losing 3‚Äì2 to Liverpool in extra-time, in a game somewhat overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster in Liverpool's semi- final.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/30267372 Following the disappointments of that season, and with the gulf between Everton and their rivals across Stanley Park widening again, Harvey dipped into the transfer market that summer and signed Norman Whiteside from Manchester United and Mike Newell from Leicester City, while Trevor Steven was sold to Rangers. 1989‚Äì90 began well for Everton, who led the league for two weeks in late autumn. There was extra incentive for title glory this season, as UEFA had vowed to lift the ban on English clubs in European competitions for the following season provided England fans behaved well at the World Cup. However, Everton never regained the lead of the league that they had lost in early November, and finished sixth in the final table. On 31 October 1990, Everton occupied the 18th of 20 places in the First Division. Only the bottom two clubs would be going down this season, as the top flight would be expanding to 22 clubs for 1991‚Äì92. However, it was still Everton's worst start to a league season, and manager Colin Harvey paid for these shortcomings with his job. Return of Howard Kendall (1990‚Äì1993) The Premier League to 25 October 2009 Runner-Up : Zenith Data Systems Cup (1991) Everton had struggled in the first few months of the 1990‚Äì91 season and manager Colin Harvey was sacked. The club sought to bring back Howard Kendall for a second time as manager, and in November Kendall left Manchester City and returned to Everton, along with Harvey who became assistant manager. Things had looked liked they had improved when Everton returned to Wembley for the Zenith Data Systems Cup final, only to lose 4‚Äì1 in extra time against Crystal Palace. Action in the First Division saw Everton climb out of the relegation zone to see Kendall guide Everton to a ninth place finish. The 1991 close season saw the departure of Everton hero Graeme Sharp but the attack was bolstered by Peter Beardsley who was signed from Liverpool and Mo Johnston from Rangers. Despite these changes to the squad, Everton continued to decline in 1991‚Äì92, finishing 12th ‚Äì their lowest finish for more than a decade. 1992‚Äì93 was the first year of the new FA Premier League, which took over from the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football. However, Everton finished 13th and the pressure grew upon Howard Kendall. The opening stages of the 1993‚Äì94 season looked to be the turning point for Howard Kendall in his second spell as Everton manager, as they topped the Premier League after winning their opening three games. However, a dismal run of form followed over the next few weeks, and Kendall walked out on Everton in early December after they had plummeted down the league to occupy a mid table position. This was followed by a dismal run of form under caretaker manager Jimmy Gabriel, which saw Everton drop to the fringes of the relegation battle by mid-January. Mike Walker era (1994) In January 1994, Everton found a successor to Howard Kendall when they recruited Mike Walker from a Norwich City side that had recently finished third in the Premier League and eliminated Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup. Everton would later be fined ¬£75,000 by the Premier League for \\"indirectly inducing\\" Walker to leave Norwich. He was now faced with a challenge of saving Everton from relegation from a top flight which they had so far been members of for 40 successive seasons and been champions of just seven years earlier. Results under the new manager were initially good, but the team stumbled again in March and hit another horrible run of form, and this combined with a freak set of results on the penultimate matchday dumped Everton into the last relegation spot, leaving the club in the unthinkable position of being relegated unless they not only won their last match, but other results went their way as well. The \\"Great Escape\\" On the final day of the season Everton needed to beat Wimbledon at Goodison Park in order to stay up. Wimbledon took a 0‚Äì2 lead, but Everton pulled off a dramatic escape act thanks to a first half penalty from Graham Stuart, a second half goal from Barry Horne and a late winner again from Stuart to win 3‚Äì2 and help send Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic down with already-relegated Swindon Town. Everton made a poor start to the 1994‚Äì95 season and were bottom of the league after 14 games, having won just once (and even then not until their 13th match); Walker was sacked in November 1994. Joe Royle era (1994‚Äì1997) Honours Won : FA Cup (1995), Charity Shield (1995) The \\"Dogs of War\\" Within days of Walker's sacking, former Everton player Joe Royle had returned to the club as manager after 12 years in charge of Oldham Athletic. His key priority was to save Everton from relegation. He made a few changes to the squad in his first few months as manager, including making striker Duncan Ferguson's loan move permanent for a club record ¬£4 million. Everton confirmed their Premier League survival in the penultimate game of the season when they won 1‚Äì0 at already- relegated Ipswich Town. But the biggest success of Everton's season came on 20 May 1995, when a Paul Rideout goal gave them a 1‚Äì0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The unfancied Everton team, dubbed the \\"Dogs of War\\", beat the reigning cup-holders, with the brilliant goalkeeping of Neville Southall also playing a crucial part in Everton's first major trophy win for eight years. Royle bolstered Everton's squad for the 1995‚Äì96 season, with a club record ¬£5 million move for Manchester United's unsettled Ukrainian winger Andrei Kanchelskis. He was determined to build on the FA Cup glory with a good run in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup however runs in the cup competitions were short lived. Everton's league form was vastly improved as they finished sixth and were narrowly pipped to a UEFA Cup place by Arsenal on the final day of the season. It had been a great season for Kanchelskis though, as he scored 16 goals and continued to live up to his reputation as the finest right-winger in the Premier League. However, he defected to Italian club Fiorentina halfway through the next season. Everton slowly fell apart without Kanchelskis, and manager Royle stepped down as manager on 27 March 1997 over a disagreement on transfers and with a relegation battle creeping upon the club. Veteran defender and captain Dave Watson took over as caretaker until the end of the season, helping confirm Everton's survival, but he did not want the job permanently and the hunt was now on for a new manager. Third Howard Kendall era (1997‚Äì98) After the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season, Everton approached Howard Kendall (by now at Sheffield United) following rejections from Bobby Robson and Andy Gray about a third spell as the club's manager. Kendall returned and there was much hype as the new season began about whether Kendall could still work his old magic and re-establish Everton as one of England's top playing sides. However, the 1997‚Äì98 campaign was a difficult one. As in 1994, Everton's survival was not assured until the last game of the season and only achieving survival on goal difference at the expense of Bolton Wanderers. Off the field, the club was in a major financial crisis at this time which would not be resolved until 1999. Kendall's third spell as manager ended in June 1998 when he was sacked, and it seemed likely that chairman Peter Johnson would turn to Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd as his successor, but the job went to Walter Smith instead. Walter Smith era (1998‚Äì2002) Successful former Rangers manager Walter Smith took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998 and big things were expected along with some high-profile signings but his first season saw another relegation battle, and only a late run of four wins from their final six games saw them earn safety a 14th-place finish. During the 1998‚Äì99 season striker Duncan Ferguson was sold to Newcastle United without Smith's knowledge. The resulting outrage from supporters regarding the manner of the sale lead to chairman Peter Johnson stepping down from his post. Theatrical producer Bill Kenwright bought control of the club and installed Philip Carter as the new chairman. Smith's chances of success were hampered by continuing financial constraints which had also contributed to the club's decline in previous years. 1999‚Äì2000 proved to be a better campaign, and the club looked to have an outside chance of qualifying for the UEFA Cup for much of the season. In the reverse of the previous year though, Everton fell apart in the final months of the campaign, claiming just two victories from their last twelve games and finishing in 13th, just one place higher than the previous year. 2000‚Äì01 saw a major step back however, and the club once again fell into a relegation battle, not helped by long-term injuries to several key players. In March 2000 American cable television provider NTL approached the club with a view to purchasing a 9.9% stake in the club. Everton expected to announce a deal before the beginning of the 2000‚Äì01 season, but by October 2000 any chance of an agreement had disappeared leaving Everton with financial difficulties and forced to sell first team players, including Youth Academy products Francis Jeffers and Michael Ball, to balance the books ‚Äì the board had already spent ¬£18.4 million on purchasing new players including bringing back Duncan Ferguson, on the basis that an agreement was in place.Everton FC Accounts 2000‚Äì2001 Around the same time Paul Gregg had been negotiating a deal with United News and Media but this never came to fruition. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough, with Everton still in real danger of relegation. David Moyes era (2002‚Äì2013) Runner-Up : FA Cup (2009) David Moyes managed Everton from 2002 to 2013 In March 2002, the board turned to promising young Preston North End manager David Moyes with the task of moving Everton forward after years of underachievement, and he was able to steer the club to safety in the last few games of the season, finishing 15th. In Moyes' first full season in charge, Everton finished seventh in the Premiership and just missed out on a UEFA Cup place in a campaign which was dominated by the emergence of brilliant young striker Wayne Rooney, who came to national prominence with a spectacular last- minute winner against league champions Arsenal, becoming the youngest English league goalscorer ever and Everton's youngest ever scorer, and consigning the champions to their first league defeat for almost a year. 2002‚Äì03 was Everton's best season since the sixth-place finish of 1995‚Äì96 and for a while it had even looked like they would qualify for the Champions League. In the FA Cup the Toffees were on the receiving end of a giant-killing, away to Shrewsbury Town, who were managed by former Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe and were just four months away from being relegated from the Football League. The following season's league form was a stark contrast, with the club finishing 17th and accumulating the lowest points total in the club's history. Wayne Rooney handed in a transfer request and was sold to Manchester United in August 2004 for a fee of ¬£23 million, with a potential to rise to ¬£30 million due to bonus payments for league positions, trophies, international caps and 25% excess sell on fees. Rooney deal explained on BBC Sport Despite the loss of Rooney, Everton's 2004‚Äì05 was much more successful and finished fourth in the table, their highest position since 1988, achieving Champions League qualification, ahead of rivals Liverpool. They played some of their finest football for years, thanks greatly to the 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 tactic of Moyes and the form of Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen, who was sold to Real Madrid midway through the season. Despite the euphoria of the previous season and the Champions League qualification, Everton started the 2005‚Äì06 badly, with their Champions League campaign ending in defeat by Villarreal in the qualifying stages after referee Pierluigi Collina controversially disallowed an important Everton goal. After being demoted to the UEFA Cup, they were knocked out by Dinamo Bucure»ôti, who thrashed the English side 5‚Äì1 in Romania. After occupying the Premier League relegation zone throughout October 2005, Everton stopped Chelsea's nine-game winning run with a 1‚Äì1 draw to spark a short revival that saw the team finally start to get regular results to put much needed points on the board. However, this was followed by another dismal run including several 4‚Äì0 defeats to sides in the bottom half of the table and a one-sided derby match. A 0‚Äì1 win at Sunderland on New Year's Eve started a run of five straight Premiership wins and six matches unbeaten including victory against Arsenal ‚Äì the club's best run of results since the Premiership began which hauled the team away from the relegation zone, and made a top half finish or even Europe a real possibility. This was not to be as the team remained as inconsistent as ever and a disappointing draw on the last day meant an 11th-place finish instead of moving into the top half. Inconsistency and a shortage of goals let Everton down in 2005‚Äì06, and ended their hopes of another European campaign. Everton began the 2006‚Äì07 season well, including a first league win at White Hart Lane in 20 years, followed by a 3‚Äì0 win over Liverpool. The club's transfer record was broken with the signing of Andrew Johnson from Crystal Palace. At the end of the season, Everton were in sixth place and qualified for the following seasons UEFA Cup competition. During the summer of 2007, the club announced the acquisition of a professional basketball team, called the Everton Tigers, and were entered into the British Basketball League as one of three expansion franchises for the 2007‚Äì08 season. In 2007‚Äì08 Everton again broke their transfer record with the signing of Yakubu for ¬£11.25 million from Middlesbrough. The club reached the group stage of the UEFA Cup, where they went on to win all of their games, including against the eventual winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Having successfully negotiated the next round, Everton were knocked out in the last 16 by Fiorentina on penalties. In the Carling Cup, Everton reached the semi-final for the first time in 20 years, losing to Chelsea. Everton spent much of the season in the top four of the league, but were eventually overtaken by Liverpool and finished fifth, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup. In 2008, Everton signed Marouane Fellaini for a club record ¬£15 million The following summer was one of some turmoil for Everton as their failure to gain Government acceptance for their proposed stadium move to Kirkby, the departure of Chief Executive Keith Wyness and the seeming reluctance of David Moyes to sign a new contract increased the gloom amongst supporters. In the last week of the transfer window, the club transfer record was broken with the signing of Marouane Fellaini for ¬£15 million from Standard Li√®ge. Everton failed to qualify for the UEFA Cup group stages, as they were eliminated by Li√®ge, with Fellaini ineligible to play against his former team. Moyes did eventually sign a new five-year contract with the club, and with it fortunes began to turn. A strong run in November and December (eight wins and two draws in 12 league games) propelled the club to the upper reaches of the league table and raised hopes for another top-six finish. In early February, Everton played Liverpool three times in quick succession, once in the league (a 1‚Äì1 draw at Anfield) and twice in the FA Cup, with Everton ultimately proving victorious in the replay at Goodison Park. Season-ending injuries to Yakubu, Mikel Arteta and Phil Jagielka did not halt Everton's progress and the end of the season saw the team finish in fifth place again in the league on the back of only three defeats in 29 matches, to qualify for the following seasons Europa League competition. Everton did reach their First FA Cup final since 1995 after knocking out Manchester United on penalties in the semi final at Wembley, but were overcome by Chelsea and lost 2‚Äì1. The 2009‚Äì10 season began with the club losing their opening two home games, including a 1‚Äì6 home defeat at the hands of Arsenal and after a long period of speculation, defender Joleon Lescott was sold to Manchester City for ¬£22 million. The club qualified for the group stages of the Europa League, but continued to perform poorly in the league. League results improved in December 2009, but Everton were knocked out of Europe over two legs by Sporting CP. At the end of March, they set a club record in the Premier League with seven consecutive home wins, which included victories over title chasers Chelsea and Manchester United. Everton finished the season in eighth place, just one place and two points adrift of neighbours Liverpool and a place in the UEFA Europa League for the following season. It was only the second out of six seasons where the Toffees failed to achieve European qualification. The 2010‚Äì11 season began with Everton in poor form. They failed to win a league game until October, and had been knocked out of the League Cup by Brentford. However, by the end of that month, the situation had stabilised and they were seventh in the table. Patchy league form ensued through to the new year, but a highlight was an FA Cup 5th Round win at Chelsea. A run of only three defeats in 18 league games ensured that the club would have its seemingly customary strong finish to the season and by mid- April the club was in seventh in the league, one point behind Liverpool. Everton would go on to finish seventh that season with 54 points, being everton's lowest points tally from five years. The 2011‚Äì12 season saw Everton get off to their now customary sluggish start, and were struggling in 16th place at the beginning of November. The turn of the year, and the signing of Nikica Jelaviƒá from Rangers, saw fortunes improve dramatically, however. The club embarked on a sequence of only two defeats in 17 League and Cup matches, including wins over Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Everton also found themselves in an all-Merseyside FA Cup Semi-final for the right to play Tottenham or Chelsea in the final at Wembley. After taking the lead through a Jelaviƒá goal, Everton were pegged back in the second half and conceded a late winner to end their Cup run for the season. This reverse not withstanding, it was Jelaviƒá's goals (nine in 13 appearances since his transfer) that helped secure only four defeats in the last 24 league games, and a seventh-place finish, ahead of Liverpool for the first time in eight seasons. Everton started the 2012‚Äì13 season strongly, losing only one of their first 11 league games by the middle of November, and if the previous seasons games were taken into account, they had lost only three of the previous 29 league games since January. A hotly contested derby match at Goodison ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, with Everton fighting back from two goals down. By the start of the new year, Everton had consolidated their position as genuine Champions League place contenders sitting in fifth position, having lost only three of the first 24 league matches of the season. Form stumbled somewhat post-Christmas winning only one of six league matches between January and February, hampering their Champions League objectives. The club reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and appeared to be well positioned for a third semi-final in the past five seasons, but they were surprised by Wigan Athletic at home. League form improved after this reverse, however, and a run of three successive victories, including a home win against champions Manchester City, maintained the club's challenge for European qualification. However, extremely strong finishes by both Tottenham and Arsenal meant that Everton were forced out of the European places and had to settle for sixth, the consolation being finishing above Liverpool for the second season in succession. The week following the Merseyside derby saw David Moyes announce he was leaving the club at the end of his contract to take up the position of manager of Manchester United after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Moyes' legacy was a strong core of players, who overachieved slightly within the confines of the financial structures in place at Everton. He took over at a difficult time for the club, who had flirted with relegation for several of the previous seasons prior to his arrival. However, the stability brought was balanced by a lack of genuine success, with a poor away record at the top sides, a mediocre record when competing in European competition and no silverware in any of the 11 seasons he was in charge.  Roberto Mart√≠nez era (2013‚Äì2016) Wigan Athletic manager Roberto Mart√≠nez was named as manager on a four-year deal in June 2013 after a search that took the club several weeks to resolve. Mart√≠nez made seven acquisitions prior to the end of the transfer window, including four of his ex-Wigan players‚ÄîArouna Kon√©, Joel Robles, Antol√≠n Alcaraz and James McCarthy. He was also able to engineer something of a coup by persuading Barcelona and Chelsea to allow highly rated youngsters Gerard Deulofeu and Romelu Lukaku, respectively, to join the club on season-long loans. Everton began the season well, with only one defeat in the opening 18 games, fewest in all four English divisions, and a record bettered only by Bayern Munich and Roma across Europe's top leagues. On 4 December 2013, Everton beat champions Manchester United, now managed by David Moyes, 0‚Äì1 at Old Trafford, their first win at the Manchester club's ground for 21 years. At Christmas, the club sat in fifth place in the league, only two points from the top and very much in the thick of what promised to be the most closely fought Premier League title race in history. The club managed to make the quarter-finals of the FA Cup where they were beaten by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. March and April brought seven consecutive wins to cement their fifth-place position, with realistic hopes of occupying a Champions League spot at the end of the season. However, a surprising loss at home to Crystal Palace threatened to derail the challenge as the club entered the final four games of the season. Everton then defeated Manchester United 2‚Äì0 at Goodison Park, a match that proved to be ex-manager David Moyes last game in charge of the Manchester club as he was sacked two days later. Any hope of gaining Champions League football ended with consecutive defeats to Southampton and eventual champions Manchester City. The club did, however, qualify for the following seasons Europa League competition, finishing in fifth with 72 points, seven adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal and their highest return since the Premier League's inception. In July, the club broke their transfer record by signing Romelu Lukaku on a permanent transfer for ¬£28 million. Bosnian midfielder Muhamed Be≈°iƒá was brought in for ¬£4 million from Hungarian club Ferencv√°ros. In a strange deal, Belgian under-18 striker David Henen was brought in on loan from Olympiacos, while the further signings of Christian Atsu (on loan from Chelsea) and Samuel Eto'o (on a free transfer) followed prior to the close of the transfer window. Everton were off to a slow start in 2014, winning only one of their first seven league matches and conceding 16 goals in that span. As the season dragged on, Everton failed to win six in a row around New Year's Day and were sitting only a few points above relegation. However, they performed strongly in the Europa League, winning their group in five matches. This included 4‚Äì1 and 0‚Äì2 wins over eventual German Bundesliga runners-up Wolfsburg. Everton drew Swiss club Young Boys in the Round of 16 and defeated them 7‚Äì2 on aggregate, with Lukaku netting five goals. In the next round, Everton won 2‚Äì1 home to Dynamo Kyiv, but were eliminated with a 5‚Äì2 defeat in the return leg in Kiev. Lukaku's eight goals in nine Europa League matches would still give him the competition's Golden Boot. Back in the league, Everton won six of their last ten matches, including a 3‚Äì0 win over Manchester United at Goodison Park, to push for 11th place at the end of the season on 47 points, 25 less than the previous season. The winter loan signing of Aaron Lennon from Tottenham helped the cause, while Eto'o left on a free for Sampdoria. This concluded a largely poor league performance, in which Lukaku led the team with ten goals. Domestic cups also brought little success; the club won no cup matches. In the League Cup, Everton had lost out 3‚Äì0 to Swansea City in the third round, while in the FA Cup, Everton lost on penalties to West Ham United, also in the third round. Despite the poor performance, Roberto Mart√≠nez was retained for the 2015‚Äì16 season. In the summer, Gerard Deulofeu was brought back in on a permanent deal for ¬£6 million, while midfielder Tom Cleverley was brought in on a free transfer from Manchester United. Two South Americans joined the squad as well ‚Äì Argentinian centre back Ramiro Funes Mori was purchased from River Plate for ¬£9.5 million and Uruguayan striker Leandro Rodr√≠guez was purchased for ¬£500,000 from River Plate Montevideo. Aaron Lennon was also signed on a permanent deal from Spurs for a fee of ¬£4.5 million. Results still proved to be inconsistent however, with the New Year seeing Everton firmly ensconced in mid-table, although the Capital One Cup provided some solace, as the club reached the semi-finals where they would meet Manchester City; unfortunately, they would fall here. In the January window, Everton purchased striker Oumar Niasse from Lokomotiv Moscow for ¬£13.5 million. On 27 February, the club officially confirmed the arrival of a new 49.9% shareholder in Farhad Moshiri, an Iranian billionaire who had previously owned a stake in Arsenal. On 12 May 2016, Martinez was sacked by the club in the face of vocal fan protests against his management in the wake of defeats to rivals Liverpool at Anfield, and in the semi-final of the FA Cup to Manchester United. The club ended the season in 11th position, for the second season running. Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce (2016‚Äì2018) In June 2016 Dutchman Ronald Koeman was appointed as manager under a three-year contract. Everton spent the whole of 2016‚Äì17 in the top half of the league table. By Boxing Day they were 7th, and remained in the same position for the entirety of the remaining season, qualifying for the Europa League. With 25 goals, Romelu Lukaku became the first Everton player to reach 20 league goals in a season since Gary Lineker in 1985‚Äì86, and was the second highest goal scorer in the division. Before 2017-18 the club broke its own record for transfer fee received, as Lukaku was sold to Manchester United for ¬£90m, and fee paid, spending ¬£45m on Swansea City's Gylfi Sigur√∞sson. The club spent a total of around ¬£150m on player acquisitions at this time, including ¬£25m on Jordan Pickford, a British record for a goalkeeper. Wayne Rooney also returned to the club, on a free transfer. The team started the season by winning their Europa League qualifying round games, reaching the group stage. Their form thereafter deteriorated rapidly and a 5‚Äì2 defeat to Arsenal in October left the club in the relegation zone, almost certainly eliminated from the Europa League, and Koeman was sacked the following day. Under-23 coach David Unsworth took temporary charge of the first team, but was unable to prevent being them knocked out of the Europa League or League Cup, and suffered a humiliating 1‚Äì4 defeat at Southampton. After over a month in charge, Unsworth was replaced on a permanent basis by Sam Allardyce. Results stabilised under Allardyce, to the extent that the club was able to move away from the relegation zone and finish 8th. He was also able to gain draws in both home and away league fixtures with Liverpool, yet fans never warmed to his safety first style of football, and he was removed from his position at the end of the season.  Marco Silva, Carlo Ancelotti (2018‚Äìpresent) Marco Silva, owner Farhad Moshiri's first choice once Koeman was sacked, before he turned to Sam Allardyce, was unveiled as Everton manager on 31 May. He had been out of work since being sacked by Watford midway through the previous season. Silva guided Everton to an 8th- place finish in his first season as manager, 2018‚Äì19. During this time Everton also appointed Marcel Brands as Director of Football, notably signing Richarlison from Watford for ¬£35 million. However, Silva was sacked on 5 December 2019 after a run of poor results, culminating in a 5‚Äì2 loss at Anfield in the 234th Merseyside Derby, leaving the club in the relegation zone. Duncan Ferguson was given an interim role as manager. On 21st of the same month, former Napoli and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti was appointed permanent manager on a four-year contract.

His works, particularly his notion of perspectivism, influenced Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy. Biography Teichm√ºller was born in Braunschweig in the Duchy of Brunswick. He was the son of August Teichm√ºller and Charlotte Georgine Elisabeth Teichm√ºller, nee von Girsewaldt. His father was a lieutenant in the Prussian army. His mother also came from a soldier's family. Teichm√ºller received a classical education at the local gymnasium, where he developed an interest in philosophy, especially aesthetic philosophy. Beginning in 1852, he studied philosophy in Berlin under Frederick Adolf Trendelenburg, a well-known specialist in ancient philosophy. He also spent a semester studying in T√ºbingen under Jakob Friedrich Reiff and Friedrich Theodor Vischer, gaining greater knowledge in the areas of natural science and classical philology. He taught as a professor at the Basel University (since 1868) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (since 1871). He died in Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia).  Career  After his father‚Äôs death, Teichm√ºller was forced to find work due to financial difficulties. In August 1855, he was contracted as a tutor at the house of the Baron of Werther. Teichm√ºller, however, found the time to complete his doctorate in Halle, receiving his degree in 1856 with a dissertation entitled Aristotelische Einteilung der Verfassungsformen (‚ÄúAristotle‚Äôs Classification of Forms of Government‚Äù). When Werther was appointed German ambassador to Russia, Teichm√ºller followed his employer to Saint Petersburg. After two years in Saint Petersburg, Teichm√ºller left the service of Werther and, in 1858, took a job as a teacher of Greek and German at the Gymnasium Annenkirche (the school of St. Anne‚Äôs Lutheran Church). In the same year he married his first wife Anna Cramer, the daughter of an Estonian landowner. In 1860 he accepted a position as an adjunct lecturer (Privatdozent) in philosophy at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he became part of an intellectual circle along with the philosopher Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Heinrich Ritter, the historian of philosophy. One of his students was Rudolf Christoph Eucken, who became an important prot√©g√©. Lotze also became a close family friend. In 1861 his first daughter, Anna, was born and followed by his second daughter, Lina a year later. Shortly thereafter his wife died at the age of 20. In 1863, unable to continue his teaching career, Teichm√ºller began a year-and-a-half-long journey that took him to France, Spain, Greece, Italy, the Maghreb, the Levant, and Asia Minor. Returning to G√∂ttingen, he resumed his teaching career, and in 1867 was accorded the title Professor Extraordinary. He also married his sister-in-law, Lina Cramer, with whom he went on to have eight children. His student E.A. Bobrov described Teichm√ºller as ‚Äúa man who suffered a great deal of evil and injustice in his life while never having done wrong or harm to anyone. Empathetic, he spent sizable amounts money to help indigent students. He was a skilled and influential speaker and teacher, a kind and patient mentor.‚Äù Bobrov and Wincenty Lutos%C5%82awski were among his most successful students. Teichm√ºller remained professor of philosophy in Dorpat (now the Estonian city of Tartu) until his death in 1888. He taught as a professor at the Basel University (since 1868) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (since 1871). He died in Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia). Philosophy Teichm√ºller is considered a philosopher of the idealist school and a founder of Russian personalism. His ideas were shaped by his teachers Lotze and J. F. Herbart, who in turn were influenced by G. W. von Leibniz. Some scholars describe Teichm√ºller's personalism as a version of neo-Leibnizianism. His doctrines have also been referred to as constituting a variant of Christian personalism that is in opposition to both positivism and evolutionism as well as traditional Platonism. Teichm√ºller's philosophy has influenced Nietzsche and this link has been explored by scholars such as Hermann Nohl, who traced Teichm√ºller's Die wirkliche und die scheinbare Welt, 1882, as the source of the latter's perspectivism. Teichm√ºller also influenced the Russian thinkers A. A. Kozlov, I.F. Oze, and E. A. Bobrov. His philosophical works can be divided into three. The first was concerned with the study of Aristotle, particularly those under the title Aristotelische Forschungen (Aristotelian Investigations), which were published in three volumes: Contributions to the Poetics of Aristotle (1867), Aristotle's Philosophy of Art (1869), and History of the Concept of Parousia (1873). One of his theories contained in these works was that the Nicomachean Ethics was completed before Aristotle finished Laws. As indicated by the title of the third volume, the second classification was marked by an interest in the history of concepts. His main works of this period involved the Studien zur Geschichte der Begriffe (Studies in the History of Concepts, 1874) and Neue Studien zur Geschichte der Begriffe (New Studies in the History of Concepts, 3 volumes, 1876-1879). In his third philosophical work, Teichm√ºller explored the divide between the real and the apparent world. Teichm√ºller considered it imperative to separate consciousness, which includes feeling and action, from specific theoretical knowledge, and regarded such notions as space, time, and movement only as outwardly projected forms that are alien to reality itself and that condense inner processes into intuitions. His views are articulated in Die wirkliche und die scheinbare Welt (The Real and Apparent Worlds, 1882) and Die Religionsphilosophie (Philosophy of Religion, 1886).

The newspaper Dhinamalar quotes \\" A king ruling this region then desired to build a temple for Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu at a single site. Perumal appeared in his dream and said that there was a stone post at the foot hills of western ghats and that His idol was there. The king found Perumal there and installed Him here. As the Lord was found under a stone post (Cumbam), He was named Kambaraya Perumal and the place Cumbam. He also brought a Shivalinga from Kasi-Varanasi and built the Shiva temple. He celebrated the consecration of the temples the same day. The Holy tree Vanni is worshipped as Lord Brahmma.

However afterwards they were weak and subsequently Vijayanagar dynasty conquered this area. In 1374, \\"Sambanar\\" a king of Vijayanagara dynasty conquered the then Chola kings. In remembrance of that he built a fort which is now the Kambarayar temple. Viswanatha Nayakkar a representative of Vijaya Nagara dynasty when ruled Madurai, constructed temple for Kambaraya Perumal and Kasi Viswanathar inside the fort. This area was once ruled by kambalathars, Kamba Nayakkar and Uthama Nayakkar. This also cited as one of the reasons for the name of Cumbum. It was one of the 72 Palayams formed by Viswanatha Nayakkar. There were high rise walls around the fort to monitor enemies which can be seen even now. Now it is called as Mottaiandi temple. The gates of the forts are historic symbols today. In Silappathigaram, when Kovalan was executed, Kannagi walked along the river of Vaigai and came to Cumbum, Gudalur and from a rock from there, she went to the sky. So, this area was initially called \\"Vinnaethi Parai\\" - A rock from where sky was reached. Later the word got changed to \\"Vannathi Parai\\".

When Colonel Pennycuick decided to divert the west-flowing Periyar (river)'s culmination in the Arabian Sea towards the East so that it could irrigate lakhs of acres of dry land depending only on Vaigai river. Though Pennycuick and other British Engineers went ahead with the construction, braving the nature's fury and the dangers of poisonous insects and wild animals, the construction works were disrupted by relentless rain. Large number of sand bags kept for the construction of the dam was destroyed due to severe flood. Since he could not get adequate funds from the British government, Pennycuick went to England and sold his family property to mobilize money to fund the project (Citation Needed) and also the local Land lords from Kambam,Gudalur provides the fund and manpower to construct the dam and it was completed in 1895. Pennycuick used lime stones and surki paste for construction taking into consideration the gravitational force this allows the dam to withstand tremors and remain strong.There was a shortage of Lime stones Pennycuick met Kathiraiya gouder and asked for the fund which will help to manage the further construction. Kathiraiya gouder provided the materials and asked the people of kambam to ship those materials to the forest area where the construction is going on. For this contribution Pennycuick honoured Kathiraiya Gouder by giving the name kallu Gouder means who provided the stones for the construction.

He was the son of Giovanni Manfredi, who had been lord of Faenza (today's Emilia- Romagna) and other castles in the area before the Papal reconquest. Astorre lived for a while in Pistoia after his father had lost his last possession in Romagna; three years after the latter's death, in 1375, he managed to recover Granarolo. In 1377, he conquered back Faenza, then occupied by the Este, with the help of his brother Francesco and the Ordelaffis, Lords of Forl√¨. To obtain the money to keep his seignory, he formed a Compagnia di Ventura (mercenary band), called Compagnia della Stella (Company of the Star). He was hired by Barnab√≤ Visconti to attack Genoa, but when that city paid him 13,000 florins, he moved back; when he tried again to assault the city, his troops were ambushed in the Bisagno valley and badly defeated. Astorre himself barely escaped being taken prisoner. In the meantime, his brother Francesco has attempted to attain the power in Faenza, and Astorre imprisoned him in the castle of Solarolo. Later, Astorre was at the service of Bologna in the war against the Visconti. His deeds gained him the praise of the Bolognesi, who gave him the palace in the city that still bears his name. In the Battle of Portomaggiore (April 16, 1395), he defeated the Ferrarese rebel Azzo d'Este, which he kept as a prisoner in Faenza in the following year. His excessive pretenses, however, pushed Niccol√≤ III d'Este, lord of Ferrara, to capture his son Gian Galeazzo, who was later exchange with Azzo. In 1400, the possession of the castle of Solarolo caused a war against Giovanni I Bentivoglio, Papal vicar of Bologna, who had hired the famous Alberico da Barbiano. The outnumbered Astorre could only get help from the Pope and, in 1404, Faenza and all his territories were returned to the Papal States. After a period as condottiero under the Papal banners, he was captured when allegedly planning to regain Faenza through a revolt. He was condemned to death and executed in the main square of his city in 1405.

Barring a few pockets, the area was considered unfit for human habitation. However, around this area, there were several dozen villages more or less prosperous, such as Mallickbaag, Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara, Bhawanipur, Ghoshpara, Chandua and Kampa. This area underwent development from 1862- the Sealdaha Kusthia Broad Gauge Railway Line, through 1863- construction of a 132000 m¬≤ locomotive workshop and railway station on the northernmost tip of Bizpur Mouza, undertaken by Eastern Bengal State Railway. In 1914 a carriage and wagon shop were added.

It covers civil measures of protection concerning children, ranging from orders concerning parental responsibility and contact to public measures of protection or care, and from matters of representation to the protection of children's property. It is therefore much broader in scope than two earlier conventions of the HCCH on the subject. The Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the measures of protection. The Convention determines which country's laws are to be applied, and it provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and for the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. The Convention entered into force 1 January 2002 and as of July 2019 has 52 contracting States. Argentina, Canada, North Macedonia, the United States and Argentina have signed the Convention, but have not ratified it. Scope and application The 1996 Convention aims to avoid orders about children's property and welfare (excluding parental responsibility and contact) being made in any state other than the state in which the child is habitually resident. It also allows orders made in the child's state of habitual residence to be registered and made enforceable in other Convention countries. It establishes a framework for the co-ordination of legal systems, and for international judicial and administrative co-operation. General background The Hague Children's Conventions The Hague Conference has, for more than a century, been involved in measures of protection under civil law of children at risk in cross-frontier situations. Three Hague Children's Conventions have been developed over the last twenty-five years, a fundamental purpose being to provide the practical machinery to enable States which share a common interest in protecting children to co-operate together to do so. The 1996 Convention The 1996 Convention is the broadest in scope of those three, covering as it does a very wide range of civil measures of protection concerning children, ranging from public measures of protection or care to matters of representation to the protection of children's property. It also covers: * Unaccompanied minors * Cross-frontier placements of children  Implementation in the European Union  The subject of the Convention is one of the subjects treated in the EU's Brussels II regulations. Between member states this regulation takes precedence over the Hague Convention as it is \\"at least as favourable as the rules laid down in the Convention\\". The subjects of convention furthermore is an area of mixed competence between the European Union and its member states, which means that the European Union has to authorise it member states to sign and to ratify the Convention and state so. The European Union authorised signature and ratification in 2002 and 2008 respectively. The ratification directive was delayed as a result of the Gibraltar dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom. In January 2008 an agreement was reached to resolve the situation to allow progress on this and other treaties. Britain and Spain compromised on a so-called \\"post-boxing\\" system under which communications between Spain and Gibraltar involving the treaties will go through London. After this deal the Convention entered into force for several EU countries, including Spain and the United Kingdom. All EU member states have ratified the Convention.  Implementation in the Russian Federation  The 1996 Convention entered into force in Russia on 1 June 2013. The first use of the Convention in Russia, known as the Neustadt case, concerned the abduction of two minors by their non-custodial father from the United Kingdom to Russia. The case was heard by the Moscow City Court in September 2013, which ruled to recognize and enforce English court orders for a return of the children to their mother in the United Kingdom. The father appealed, but in November 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld their first ruling and the orders to return the children became final. The order was not enforced until the end of June 2014 when Russian law enforcement officials found the children, who had been kept hidden by their father for over seven months since he lost his appeal.

The Book of Prefaces, is a 2000 book \\"edited and glossed\\" by the Scottish artist and novelist Alasdair Gray. It seeks to provide a history of how literature spread and developed through the nations of England, Ireland, Scotland, and the United States. Its subtitle A Short History of Literate Thought in Words by Great Writers of Four Nations from the 7th to the 20th Century outlines its scope. Gray's own preface begins with \\"An Editor's Advertisement\\" which cites William Smellie's preface to The Philosophy of Natural History published in Edinburgh in 1790 stating what every preface should contain, and concluding that \\"If this plan had been universally observed, a collection of prefaces would have exhibited a short, but curious and useful history both of literature and authors.\\" In his postscript Gray recounts how reading this in the early 1980s inspired the plan of the book, and after sixteen years on the project (while also producing his other works) the book was completed. Characteristically, illustrations and design of the typography are by Gray himself, producing a \\"gorgeously realised\\" volume. The body of the book provides the prefaces, prologues, introductions or forewords chronologically, each headed with its title, and the year in very large numerals, with commentary by Gray and thirty other writers (including Angus Calder, Alan Spence, Robert Crawford, Bruce Leeming, and Paul Henderson Scott) in small red italic text in a column to the outer side of the leaf as needed to discuss the document. The effect is rather like an annotated Bible. Reception Of the reviews cited on the back cover of the paperback version, the Palo Alto Daily News comments that \\"The diversity of the selection is staggering. It manages to be serious, accurate and instructive, but is also an amusing text, quixotic and deeply moving\\". Joseph Rosenblum noted some oddities and flaws: Nicholas Lezard begins by remarking on the omission of Thomas Dekker, but continues: Ian Sansom, reviewing the book (like Lezard) for The Guardian, states that its \\"affiliations are with the tradition of the commonplace book, with the 18th-century dictionary makers, with the Victorian encyclopaedists, with the Everymans, the Observers, and with H G Wells's The Outline of History. It is egalitarian in ambition and aristocratic in execution.\\" Sansom adds, \\"Unconsidered trifles include John Clare's unstopped intro to \\"The Parish\\" (1827) - 'THIS POEM was begun & finished under the pressure of heavy distress with embittered feelings under a state of anxiety and oppression almost amounting to slavery'. In addition, there are prefaces to these prefaces, glosses and introductions, and not all of them written by Gray (the book makes strange bedfellows, among others, of James Kelman and Roger Scruton).\\" Peter A. Dollard, in Library Journal, said, \\"This long-anticipated book from a major figure in the Scottish literary revival lives up to expectations. A delightfully original, ironic, and humorous compilation, it aims to include every major introductory essay in the English language from C√¶dmon (seventh century) up to the early 20th century. A red gloss runs down the side of most pages, providing fascinating and often idiosyncratic commentary. The reader learns, for example, that in John Gay's day thieves were likely to hang 'unless, like the most successful thieves, they could hire lawyers.' Gray ... was assisted by some 30 contributors, who wrote about 20 percent of the commentary.\\" See also * Scots language  References  Further reading * Quinn, Mary Ellen. \\"Reference Books in Brief\\".

The former French Catholic Archbishopric of Arles had its episcopal see in the city of Arles, in southern France.\\"Archdiocese of Arles\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved March 29, 2016[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/arle0.htm#22492 \\"Metropolitan Archdiocese of Arles\\"] GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved March 29, 2016  Diocesan history  The bishopric of Arles was founded in 330. It was promoted a metropolitan archdiocese in 460, suppressed a first time to become part of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Aix and restored shortly in 1816. The Archbishopric of Arles was suppressed again, and incorporated into the Archdiocese of Aix in 1822. The latter is since officially called \\"Archdiocese of Aix (-Arles-Embrun)\\" and is no longer a Metropolitan but an archiepiscopal title, within the ecclesiastical province of Marseille.  Councils  The first Council of Arles was held in 314, for the purpose of putting an end to the Donatist controversy. Bishops from the western part of the empire including three from Britain attended. It confirmed the findings of the Council of Rome (313), i.e. it recognized the validity of the election of Caecilian of Carthage and confirmed the excommunication of Donatus of Casae Nigrae. Its twenty-two canons dealing with various abuses that had crept into ecclesiastical life since the persecution of Diocletian (284-305) are among the most important documents of early ecclesiastical legislation. A council held in 353, and attended, among others, by two papal legates, was decidedly Arian in attitude. The legates were tempted into rejecting communion with Athanasius and refused to condemn Arius, an act which filled Pope Liberius with grief. A council was held on New Year's Day of 435, to settle the differences that had arisen between the Abbot of L√©rins and the Bishop of Fr√©jus. In the synod of 443 (452), attended also by bishops of neighbouring provinces, fifty-six canons were formulated, mostly repetitions of earlier disciplinary decrees. Neophytes were excluded from major orders; married men aspiring to the priesthood were required to promise a life of continency, and it was forbidden to consecrate a bishop without the assistance of three other bishops and the consent of the Metropolitan. A council of 451 held after the close of the Council of Chalcedon in that year, sent its adhesion to the \\"Epistola dogmatica\\" of Pope Leo I, written by Flavian of Constantinople (see Eutyches) Apropos of the conflict between the archiepiscopal See of Vienne and Arles a council was held in the latter city in 463, which called forth a famous letter from St. Leo I.Leonis I, Opp., ed. Ballerini, I, 998; Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, II, 590. Between 475 and 480 another council was called, attended by thirty bishops, in which the pre-destinationist teachings of the priest Lucidus were condemned. In 524 a council was held under the presidency of St. Caesarius of Arles; its canons deal chiefly with the conferring of orders. A number of Caesarius of Arles' works have been published in Sources Chr√©tiennes. Little is known of the councils of 554 and 682. The liturgical uses of Arles were recommended by pope Gregory the Great as a model for Augustine of Canterbury. An important council was held in 813, at the instigation of Charlemagne, for the correction of abuses and the reestablishment of ecclesiastical discipline. Its decrees insist on a sufficient ecclesiastical education of bishops and priests, on the duty of both to preach frequently to the people and to instruct them in the Catholic Faith, on the obligation of parents to instruct their children, etc. In 1034 a council was held at Arles for the re-establishment of peace, the restoration of Christian Faith, the awakening in the popular heart of a sense of divine goodness and of salutary fear by the consideration of past evils. From 1080 to 1098, Aicard continued to act as bishop even though he had been deposed. He was followed on the episcopal throne by Ghibbelin of Sabran, who was later Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. In 1236 a council held under the presidency of Jean Baussan, Archbishop of Arles, issued twenty-four canons, mostly against the prevalent Albigensian heresy, and for the observance of the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215 and that of Toulouse in 1229. Close inspection of their dioceses is urged on the bishops, as a remedy against the spread of heresy; testaments are declared invalid unless made in the presence of the parish priest. This measure, met with in other councils, was meant to prevent testamentary dispositions in favour of known heretics. In 1251, Jean, Archbishop of Arles, held a council near Avignon (Concilium Insculanum), among whose thirteen canons is one providing that the sponsor at baptism is bound to give only the white robe in which the infant is baptized. In 1260 a council held by Florentin, Archbishop of Arles, decreed that confirmation must be received fasting, and that on Sundays and feast days the religious should not open their churches to the faithful, nor preach at the hour of the parish Mass. The laity should be instructed by their parish priests. The religious should also frequent the parochial service, for the sake of good example. This council also condemned the doctrines spread abroad under the name of Joachim of Flora. In 1275, twenty-two earlier observances were promulgated anew at a Council of Arles.

She was ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate ruling Japan during the Bakumatsu period from the Netherlands and served as a training vessel, and subsequently served with the nascent Imperial Japanese Navy during the Boshin War. She was lost in combat during the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay. Background Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate ruling Japan pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the Dutch and the Chinese and was conducted exclusively at Nagasaki under a strict government monopoly. No foreigners were allowed to set foot in Japan, and no Japanese was permitted to travel aboard.W. G. Beasley, The Meiji Restoration, p.74-77 In June 1635 a law was proclaimed prohibiting the construction of large, ocean-capable vessels. However, by the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1844, King William II of the Netherlands sent a letter urging Japan to end the isolation policy on its own before change would be forced from the outside.W. G. Beasley, The Meiji Restoration, p.78 Following the July 1853 visit of Commodore Perry, and intense debate erupted within the Japanese government on how to handle the unprecedented threat to the national‚Äôs capital, and the only universal consensus was that steps be taken immediately to bolster Japan‚Äôs coastal defenses. The law forbidding construction of large vessels was repealed, and many of the feudal domains took immediate steps to construct or purchase warships. However, the ships produced within Japan were based on reverse-engineering of designs some decades old, and the ships were already obsolete by the time of their completion. The need for steam-powered warships to match the foreign Black ships was a pressing issue, and the Tokugawa shogunate issued an order to the Dutch for two new warships for the price of 100,000 Mexican dollars each. The first vessel was Japan, later renamed , and the second vessel was Yedo, later renamed Ch≈çy≈ç Maru. Design Ch≈çy≈ç Maru was a three-masted wooden-hulled corvette with a schooner rig, and with an auxiliary one-cylinder coal-fired reciprocating steam engine turning a twin screws. She had an overall length of and a displacement of 600 tons. Her armament consisted of twelve muzzle-loading cannon. Her design was based on HNS Bali, and she was built at the C. Gips & Sons shipyard at Dordrecht. Operational history With the Tokugawa Navy Yedo arrived at Nagasaki in May 1858 and was soon renamed Ch≈çy≈ç Maru. She was assigned to be a training ship to the newly formed Nagasaki Naval Training Center, under Nagai Naoyuki, with Dutch adviser Lieutenant H. van Kattendijke leading a team of Dutch sailors to provide training. Also at the Nagasaki Naval Training Center were Kank≈ç Maru and Kanrin Maru. These ships were joined a month later by Nagasaki (later called Denryu Maru), a sister ship of Ch≈çy≈ç Maru which had been purchased by Saga Domain. On the closure of the Nagasaki Naval Training Center in 1859, she was transferred to the new Tsukiji Naval Training Center in Edo, with Katsu Kaishu as one of her crewmen. In 1861, she was captained by Yatabori Ko and in 1862 participated in a colonization expedition to the Ogasawara Islands to solidify Japanese claims to that archipelago. In 1863, she participated in the First Ch≈çsh≈´ expedition, and much to the embarrassment of the shogunate, was briefly captured by Ch≈çsh≈´ forces. In 1864, she participated in the suppression of the pro-sonn≈ç j≈çi forces in the Mito Rebellion. With the Imperial Japanese Navy Sinking of Ch≈çy≈ç Maru by Banry≈´ Following the Meiji Restoration, Ch≈çy≈ç Maru was taken over by the Meiji government in 1868 and became one of the first ships of the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy. She was captained by Nakamuta Kuranosuke of Hizen Province and a former student of the Nagasaki Naval Training Center. During the Boshin War, she was sent north in pursuit of the remnants of the Tokugawa navy to Ezo (modern Hokkaido). At the Battle of Hakodate, she shelled the Gory≈çkaku, scoring a hit on one of its yagura. During the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay on 26 April 1869, she engaged Kaiten Maru, firing over 40 shots from her cannon. However, on 11 May she was engaged by the Republic of Ezo paddle schooner Banry≈´. A shot from Banry≈´ penetrated Ch≈çy≈ç Maru‚Ä≤s gunpowder magazine, causing a massive explosion. Some 80 of her crewmen went down with the ship, and the bodies of another six were later recovered from the ocean. However, Captain Nakamura survived the sinking.

It is maintained by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, which converted it from a railroad line. The name derives from the Dakota people who lived in the region; \\"Sakatah\\" translates into \\"singing hills\\". It began as a snowmobile trail and is now shared by hikers, joggers and cross-country skiers. There are sections of parallel dirt trail for horseback riders but they are not continuous. The landscape is mostly cultivated land with remnant stands of prairie and Big Woods. The trail passes through Sakatah Lake State Park and runs through city streets in Waterville. History The trail uses segments from two different rail lines that were built into Mankato, one from the Chicago Great Western Railway (CGW), and one from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (C&NW;). The more southern C&NW; rail line was the original Winona and St. Peter Railroad, one of the first railroads in Minnesota. Originally it curved north in the Lime valley away from Mankato towards Kasota to St. Peter in 1871. It branched south at what became Mankato Junction, also known as Burdette.Northwestern Abandons Announced Schedule Of New Trains But Contemplates Changes. New Ulm Review, New Ulm, Minnesota, June 7, 1916, Wed, Page 4 This was the segment of the Winona, Mankato and New Ulm Railway. The more northern CGW rail line was surveyed in the late 1870s between Red Wing and Waterville. Construction did not begin until 1882 by the Central Railway Company of Minnesota under the management of A. B. Stickney. Stickney was head of the Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad which would later become the Chicago Great Western Railway in 1891. The route from Red Wing to Waterville was completed in 1882, and the route from Waterville to Mankato, Minnesota, was completed in 1887. By 1889, the line had been renamed Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific and was under the trusteeship of the Rock Island railroad. The Rock Island sold the WM&P; to the Chicago Great Western in the mid-1890s which operated the line until 1968 when the CGW was merged in to the Chicago & Northwestern. The C&NW; operated the line for a few years after the CGW merger, but abandoned the portion from Lime Siding east in the early 1970s. The C&NW;, working with the State of Minnesota, used the more favorable CGW grade into Mankato. The C&NW; built a link between the two lines where they neared each other on the outskirts of Mankato before they both descended into the Minnesota River Valley. The Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad uses these joined segments as its Tracy Subdivision. The remaining segments became the trail, with a route necessary around a farm that had taken over the abandoned route across from Lime Siding. Area snowmobile riders began using the trail. The State's acquisition of the route, with their view toward creating a rail trail, began in 1974. The Sakatah Singing Hills State Trail was officially dedicated in 1980. It was a dirt trail for its first decade. The entire length was paved in 1995. Extent The section of the Chicago Great Western from Cannon Falls to Red Wing is now the Cannon Valley Trail. The section of the Chicago Great Western Railway between Faribault and Cannon Falls is being developed by the Mill Towns Trail Association which would result in the former route of the entire Chicago Great Western from Mankato to Red Wing being converted to trail use.

It said, \\"If it was possible to the evaluate the loss, which this country annually suffers through the avoidable waste of valuable human material and the lowering of human efficiency through malnutrition and preventable morbidity, we feel that the result would be so startling that the whole country would be aroused and would not rest until a radical change had been brought about.\\" Some of the important recommendations of the Bhore Committee were: 1.Integration of preventive and curative services at all administrative levels. 2\\\\. Development of Primary Health Centres in 2 stages : *a. Short-term measure ‚Äì one Primary Health Centre was suggested for a population of 40,000. Each PHC was to be manned by 2 doctors, one nurse, four public health nurses, four midwives, four trained dais, two sanitary inspectors, two health assistants, one pharmacist and fifteen other class IV employees. The first was established in 1952. Secondary health centres were also envisaged to provide support to PHCs, and to coordinate and supervise their functioning. *b. A long-term programme (also called the 3 million plan) of setting up primary health units with 75 ‚Äì bedded hospitals for each 10,000 to 20,000 population and secondary units with 650 ‚Äì bedded hospital, again regionalised around district hospitals with 2500 beds. 3\\\\.

The village shares borders with Cherukunnu to the north, Kalliasseri to the south, Mattool to the west, Morazha village of Anthoor Municipality and Pattuvam to the east. Kannapuram was within the princely state of Kolathu Nadu under British control till independence. The name Kannapuram originated from the presence of Sri Krishna Temple (Thrikkoth). Kannan= Sri Krishnan. Puram= land (indicating place of Sri Krishnan). Another version is that Kannapuram is the Land of Saint Kannua, who meditated in a cave near Sri Krishna Temple, Thrikkoth.

The diocese, erected in the 4th century as the Diocese of Grenoble, comprises the department of Is√®re and the former canton of Villeurbanne (Rh√¥ne), in the Region of Rh√¥ne-Alpes. In 2006, the name was changed from the diocese of Grenoble to the diocese of Grenoble‚ÄìVienne. The current bishop is Guy Andr√© Marie de K√©rimel, appointed on June 10, 2006. Before the French Revolution it was a suffragan diocese of the Archbishopric of Vienne and included the deanery or see at Savoy, which in 1779, was made a bishopric in its own right, with the episcopal seat at Chamb√©ry. By the Concordat of 1801, the bishop of Grenoble was made a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon. Thirteen archipresbyterates of the former Archdiocese of Vienne were affiliated to the Diocese of Grenoble, and there were annexed to it some parishes from the then Diocese of Belley (now Diocese of Belley-Ars), the Diocese of Gap, the Archdiocese of Lyon, and the Diocese of Valence. Bishops Some historically important bishops of Grenoble were: * Saint Domninus, the first Bishop of Grenoble known to history, attended the Council of Aquileia in 381. * Saint Ceratus (441‚Äì452), celebrated in legend for his controversies against Arianism * Saint Ferreolus (at the end of the seventh century), who, according to tradition, was killed by a pagan while preaching * Saint Hugh of Grenoble (1080‚Äì1132), noted for his zeal in carrying out Pope Gregory VII's orders concerning reform and for his opposition to the Bishop of Vienne, later Pope Callixtus II * Pierre Scarron (1621‚Äì1667), who, with the co-operation of many religious orders, restored Catholicism in Dauphin√© * √âtienne Le Camus (1671‚Äì1707), organizer of charitable loan associations * Jean de Caulet (1726‚Äì1771), who brought about general acceptance of the Bull Unigenitus, whose collection of books was the nucleus of the public library of the city, and during whose episcopate Bridaine, the preacher, after delivering a sermon on almsgiving went through the streets of the city with wagons and was unable to gather all the donations of linen, furniture and clothing that were offered. History The Benedictines and Augustinians founded at an early date numerous priories in the diocese, that of Vizille dating from 994, but during St. Hugh's episcopal administration, monastic life attained a fuller development. The chapter-abbey of Saint-Martin de Mis√©r√©, whence originated many Augustinian priories, and the school of the priory of Villard Beno√Æt at Pontcharra, were important during twelfth and thirteenth centuries. But the peculiar monastic foundation of Dauphin√©, contemporaneous with St. Hugh's regime, was that of the Carthusians under St. Bruno of Cologne in 1084. The Fr√®res du Saint-Esprit, who during the Middle Ages were scattered broadcast through the Diocese of Grenoble, did much to inculcate among the people habits of mutual assistance. The two sojourns at Grenoble in 1598 and 1600 respectively by Cotton, the Jesuit, later confessor to Henry IV of France, were prolific of some notable conversions from Protestantism; in memory of this the Constable de Lesdigui√®res, himself a convert in 1622, favoured the founding at Grenoble of a celebrated Jesuit house. In 1651 a college was established in connexion with the residence, and here Vaucanson, the well-known mechanician, studied. In 1700 the institution included theological courses in its curriculum. From the first half of the thirteenth century the French branch of the Waldenses had its chief seat in Dauphin√©, from which country emanated Guillaume Farel, the most captivating preacher of the French Reformation. Pierre de S√©biville, an apostate Franciscan friar, introduced Protestantism into Grenoble in 1522. The diocese was sorely tried by the wars of religion, especially in 1562, when the cruel Baron des Andrets acted as the Prince de Cond√©'s lieutenant-general in Dauphin√©. Pope Pius VI, when taken a prisoner to France, spent two days at Grenoble in 1799. Pius VII, in turn was kept in close confinement in the prefecture of Grenoble from 21 July until 2 August 1808, Bishop Simon not being permitted even to visit him. The following saints may be mentioned as natives of what constitutes the present Diocese of Grenoble: St. Amatus, the anchorite (sixth century), founder of the Abbey of Remiremont, and St. Peter, Archbishop of Tarantaise (1102‚Äì1174), a Cistercian, born in the ancient Archdiocese of Vienne. Moreover, it was in the chapel of the superior ecclesiastical seminary of Grenoble that J.-B. Vianney, the future Cur√© of Ars, was ordained a priest, 13 August 1815. The Bishopric of Grenoble is in possession of an almost complete account of the pastoral visits made between 1339 and 1970, a pal√¶ographical record perhaps unique of its kind in France. The principal places of pilgrimage in the present Diocese of Grenoble are: Notre-Dame de Parm√©nie, near Rivers, re-established in the seventeenth century at the instance of a shepherdess; Notre-Dame de l'Osier, at Vinay, which dates from 1649, and Our Lady of La Salette, which owes its origin to the apparition of the Virgin, 19 September 1846, to Maximin Giraud and M√©lanie Calvat, the devotion to Notre- Dame de la Salette being authorized by Bishop Bruillard, 1 May 1852. Before the enforcement of the law of 1901 there were in the Diocese of Grenoble Assumptionists, Oliv√©tans, Capuchins, Regular Canons of the Immaculate Conception, Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Fathers of Holy Ghost and the Holy Heart of Mary, Brothers of the Cross of Jesus, Brothers of the Holy Family, Brothers of the Christian Schools and Brothers of the Sacred Heart. The diocesan congregations of women were: the Sisters of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, devoted to hospital work and teaching, and founded by Cathiard, who, after having been an officer under Napoleon, died Archpriest of Pont de Beauvoisin; the Sisters of Providence of Corenc, founded in 1841, devoted to hospital duty and teaching (mother-house at St. Marcellin), and the Sisters of Our Lady of the Cross, likewise devoted to hospital and educational work, founded in 1832 (mother-house at Murinais).

Part of the coast is also known as Hollesley Bay; HM Young Offender Institution, Hollesley Bay Colony, is nearby. Shingle Street was originally a home for fishermen and river pilots for the River Ore. Early in the 19th century a Martello tower was built, which was later a home for coastguards. Many of the original buildings date from this period, although several buildings were destroyed during World War II, including the Lifeboat Inn, the hamlet's only pub. A report from October 2004 suggests that Shingle Street is at risk from the sea and could disappear within 20 years if sea defences are not erected. Shingle Street was the inspiration of the Thomas Dolby song \\"Cloudburst at Shingle Street\\", from the album The Golden Age of Wireless.  World War II  After World War II many strange happenings were reported to have taken place at Shingle Street, including a failed German invasion. Since the civilian population had been evacuated in May 1940, there were no eyewitness reports, although official documents remained classified until questions in the House of Commons led to their early release in 1993. These papers disclosed no German landing. In fact rumours of a failed invasion on the South and East Coasts were commonplace in September 1940 and helped to boost morale. Author James Hayward has proposed that these rumours, which were widely reported in the American press, were a successful example of black propaganda with an aim of ensuring American co- operation and securing lend lease resources by showing that the United Kingdom was capable of successfully resisting the German Army. The Shingle Street Shell Line The Shingle Street Shell Line In 2005 stonecutter Lida Cardozo Kindersley and her childhood friend Els Bottema started to arrange a line of shells on the beach, beginning as a way of coping with their shared experience of cancer treatment. After regular visits to add to the line by 2018 it stretched for more than 275m and was made up of 20,000 individual whelk shells. A short documentary film about the work, entitled 'C Shells', was released in 2017, followed by a book 'The Shingle Street Shell Line' by Bottema and Kindersley in 2018.
