Biography Margaret Gladstone was born on 20 July 1870 in Kensington, London, to John Hall Gladstone, later Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution. She was educated both at home and at Doreck College in Bayswater. Early in adulthood she was involved in voluntary social work, including visits for the Charity Organisation Society in Hoxton. By 1890, she was a keen socialist, influenced by the Christian socialists and the Fabian Society. In 1894, she joined the Women's Industrial Council, serving on several committees and organising the enquiry into home work in London, which was published in 1897. She met Ramsay MacDonald through this work in 1895 and they married in 1896. She was comfortably off, although not wealthy. This allowed them to indulge in foreign travel, visiting Canada and the United States in 1897, South Africa in 1902, Australia and New Zealand in 1906, and India several times. After her marriage she was concerned about the need for skilled work and training for women and played a key part in establishing the first trade schools for girls in 1904. She continued this work until 1910. She was a member of the National Union of Women Workers. She served on the executive of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, and she was opposed to militant action. In 1906 she became involved in the formation of the Women's Labour League, serving as chair until her death in 1911.Cathy Hartley, A Historical Dictionary of British Women, p.316 The marriage to Ramsay MacDonald was a very happy one, and they had six children, including Malcolm MacDonald (1901‚Äì1981), who had a prominent career as a politician, colonial governor, and diplomat; and Ishbel MacDonald (1903‚Äì1982), official hostess to her father. After Margaret MacDonald's death on 8 September 1911, Ramsay MacDonald became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times but did not remarry.

The company was the oldest confectionery manufacturer in Ireland. History =Early years= Oatfield premises in Letterkenny The business began as a wholesale and retail outlet on the Port Road in the town. The McKinney family began to make their own sweets and on 15 August 1927. The first sweets were made on the open coke fire in a shed at the back of the shop. The land on which the factory stood was purchased in November 1929, the first sod was cut in February 1930. Six people were employed at the time. The company at the time was known as Mayfield Confectionery but the name was quickly changed as another company in Manchester traded by this name. The company name was changed to Oatfield. The land on which the factory was built was known as Oatfield. The May was dropped and Oat was substituted and hence the name ‚ÄúOatfield‚Äù. The weekly production of confectionery was about 3 tons. Today the company produces approximately 65 tons a week. Sugar was purchased in the 1930s from Tate & Lyle. Glucose came from Manchester. They were delivered by ship and rail via Derry to Letterkenny railway station. Later, glucose was shipped from the Netherlands to the Letterkenny Port. In later years, only Irish sugar and Irish glucose were used. Butter had always been Irish Creamery Butter. =Recent years= By 1960 Oatfield decided to stop marketing packed sweets made by Cadbury's, Rowntree, Urney's Chocolates, Bassetts Licorice Allsorts, Jacobs Biscuits, William and Wood, Ritchies Mints and Milroy Confectionery. The company now began to focus entirely on selling Oatfield sweets. This was a major decision and proved a major success for the company. Exporting began in August 1964. The first sweets were exported to Northern Ireland. The sweets are exported on a worldwide scale which includes countries as far away as the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Kuwait, Greece and France to name a few. =Today= Donegal Creameries PLC purchased the company in February 1999 for ¬£783,750. In 2007, Zed Candyan Irish confectionery company famous for its Chewing Gumbought the brand from Donegal Creameries. Up until closure, the factory employed approx 15 people and up to 65 tonnes of sugar and chocolate confectionery were produced each week. The main production lines were Emerald, Toffees, Eclairs, Boiled sweets. were biggest sellers are Emerald, Colleen Assortment and Orange Chocolate. The factory was closed by the current operators, Zed Candy, on 27 May 2012. Production was soon after moved to the UK. In May 2014 the factory was demolished.

History Founded in 1853 in New York, the Swan & Finch company started its activity in the sector of high quality lubricants. As of 1920, it turned to the international markets by exporting some of its portfolio brands like Aerul, Textul, Motul. In 1932, Ernst Zaug negotiated the distribution in France of products of the Motul brand with Swan & Finch via his company Supra Penn.Motul Company‚Äôs history In 1953, the Swan & Finch centenary was celebrated with the worldwide launch of Motul Century, which became the first multigrade oil on the European market. However, Swan & Finch suspended its activities in 1957. Supra Penn bought back all title deeds and patents pertaining to the Motul brand, which was renamed for the company's chief product, becoming Motul S.A.. In 1966, Century 2100 appeared on the market. It was the first semi-synthetic car lubricant,First semi-synthetic oil a product that withstands constraints and mechanical loads ten-times higher than usual lubricants. In 1971, Motul innovated again with Century 300V, the first 100% synthetic car oil. Motul strengthened its international presence in the 1980s: in Germany with Motul Deutschland in 1980, Spain in 1988, the USA in 1989, Italy in 1994, Asia-Pacific in 2002, Russia and Brazil in 2005, and India in 2006. Moreover, Motul created a new activity in 2001: Motul Tech, specializing in industrial lubricants. Today, Motul is present in more than 80 countries and designs elaborate and distributes lubricants with higher technical value- added. As a pioneer in many synthetic and semi-synthetic products, Motul has always favored innovation, research and development. The company is also a leader in the motorcycle lubricants market in France. In the motorsports field, many manufacturers trust Motul for its technological developments in car/bike racing. Motul has thus developed close relationships with manufacturers such as Nissan, Yamaha, Subaru, Toyota, Honda and Suzuki etc. Trades and products Motul was the first lubricant manufacturer to use the ester technology for the formulation of its 100% synthetic car oils by capitalizing on an innovation first invented for the aviation industry. The vegetable-based esters benefit from lubricating properties, anti-shear quality and exceptional resistance to high temperatures. \\"300V\\", Motul's flagship range, experienced great development thanks to its presence on the most prestigious car/bike races. Motul's research and development capacity is divided in two entities working respectively on \\"Automotive\\" (automobile, two- wheels, boat) and \\"Industrial\\" lubricants. =Car lubricants= * Motor oil * Automatic transmission oils * Mechanical gear oils * Brake fluids * Coolants =Motorcycle lubricants= * Four-stroke engine * Two-stroke engine * Scooter oil * Fork oil * Shock oil * Brake fluids * Coolants * Maintenance products =Other products= * Diesel motor oil * Gear oils * Greases * Antifreezes * Hydraulic oils * Multifunctional oils =Industrial lubricants= * Soluble oils * Neat oils * Forming products * Tempering oils * Tempering polymers * Special products * Degreasers * Machinery lubrication These products are used in many areas: the steel industry, mechanical engineering, machinery and equipment manufacturing, the cement industry, the food industry, pharmacy and cosmetics, wood, glass and minerals, chemistry, plastics and rubber processing, watchmaking, the textile industry, auto and car parts manufacturers, rail transport, and aeronautics.

The western terminus of the route is at VT 118 in Montgomery. The eastern terminus of VT 58 is at VT 5A north of Westmore and Lake Willoughby. In Orleans, VT 58 runs concurrent to U.S. Route 5 (US 5) for a short distance, interchanging with Interstate 91 (I-91) at exit 26 during that interval. The portion of VT 58 west of VT 100 in Lowell is town-maintained. This section is a dirt road and is closed during the winter months because it goes through Hazens Notch.  Route description  VT 58 through Hazens Notch VT 58 begins at an intersection with VT 118 (South Main Street) just south of the junction with VT 242 in the Franklin County town of Montgomery. VT 58 is town-maintained in Montgomery, running southeast as a two-lane concrete Hazen's Notch Road. The route parallels the Trout River out of the Montgomery Center neighborhood, converting itself to a dirt road as it runs southeast as it enters Hazens Notch, a local mountain in Montgomery. The route crosses through dense woods as a dirt road, turning southeast past residences through the densely wooded mountainside. Soon the residences give way to just woods as VT 58 reaches the Orleans County line along the ridge of Hazens Notch. VT 58 crosses through the town of Westfield, entering Hazen's Notch State Park. Running along the southern ridge of the park, VT 58 bends southeast and leaves the park, but remains in the dense woods as a two-lane dirt road. The route crosses a junction with Monteith Road, which connects to nearby Balance Rock Road. Soon crossing into the town of Lowell, the dense woods around VT 58 begin to break as it leaves Hazens Notch, passing nearby Green Hill Road. Winding southeast, the town-maintained road reaches Buck Hill Road as the route becomes residential. Retaining the Hazens Notch Road name, VT 58 winds southeast at the East Branch of the Missisquoi River, paralleling the river and reaching the residential area of Lowell. In Lowell, the route reaches a junction with VT 100\\\\. At this junction, VT 58 becomes maintained by the Vermont Agency of Transportation rather than the town of Lowell. VT 58 drops the Hazen's Notch Road name, winding east through flat lands of Lowell. Turning northeast, the route becomes rural with no residences left until a few farmhouses near McAllister Road. The route winds northeast until Mitchell Road, where the route bends southeast for a jog. Turning northeast again, VT 58 begins an eastern wind through Lowell, crossing into the town of Irasburg. The route continues southeast through Irasburg, doing the same southeast- northeast jog it made in Lowell, climbing a ridge and past some large farms before reaching VT 14, where it passes a small housing development. At this junction, VT 58 and VT 14 become concurrent, running southeast through Irasburg and crossing the Black River near the junction with Under the Hill Road. Running along the riverside, VT 58 and VT 14 enter the center of Irasburg, where VT 58 turns east and off of VT 14. VT 58 at VT 100 in Lowell Running alongside the Black River, VT 58 passes the eastern end of Under the Hill Road, leaving the center of Irasburg. Now winding east along the riverside, VT 58 quickly turns away from the river in Irasburg, soon reaching a junction with U.S. Route 5\\\\. At this junction, US 5 and VT 58 become concurrent, running southeast as a divided highway as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 91 (exit 26). Remaining a divided highway, VT 58 and US 5 turns northeast and enters the center of Orleans, where US 5 turns south. Paralleling the Barton River, VT 58 runs on Main Street, crossing the nearby railroad tracks. Now known as Church Street, VT 58 merges into East Street, changing to that name before turning southeast on the Willoughby River as Willoughby Avenue. Now in the town of Barton, VT 58 begins winding through some woods along the river, turning away from the river as Willoughby Avenue. Now reaching the hamlet of Evansville, the route enters the town of Brownington. At Hunt Hill Road, VT 58 leaves Evansville and winds southeast along the returned Willoughby River as Evansville Road. Remaining a two-lane road, the route is rural and runs through fields and dense woods until reaching a junction with VT 5A (Willoughby Lake Road). This junction marks the eastern terminus of VT 58.

When it first opened, the plant employed 600 workers and was capable of producing 200 cars per day. At its peak in the early 1970s it employed nearly 9,000. The first car rolled off the assembly line on August 13, 1923, a Chevrolet Superior. Among the cars built at Norwood were the Chevrolet Bel Air, Biscayne, Impala, Nova, Caprice, Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, and the Buick Apollo. The plant grew to cover an area of approximately and had of space under roof. The facility had a number of labor disputes, including a 174-day-long strike in 1972, at the time the longest strike in GM history. As a result of the strike, 1,100 partially completed cars were scrapped or otherwise disposed of because it was not economically feasible to update them to the more stringent 1973 vehicle standards. After the strike GM opted to move Nova production away from Norwood to protect the model from future labor problems. Closing While newer GM plants had a one- story design, the Norwood plant had a less efficient three-story design. Additionally, the plant could not expand outward as it was surrounded by an interstate highway to the north, railroad lines to the east and west, a business district on a State Route to the west and a residential neighborhood to the south. Citing its obsolescence, expense, and high worker absentee rate, GM announced on November 6, 1986, that the Norwood Assembly Plant would be closed along with ten other GM facilities. The plant produced its last vehicle on August 26, 1987, a Chevrolet Camaro. That date came to be known in Norwood as Black Wednesday. At the time of its closing the plant employed approximately 4,200 workers. Most of the plant was demolished in 1989. The main factory building sat vacant for nearly 10 years. The City of Norwood, having relied on the carmaker for nearly 35 percent of its taxbase, faced economic catastrophe and possible bankruptcy. The City wished to re-develop the site due to its unique and attractive location - at the juncture of Ohio State Route 562 (Norwood Lateral Expressway), U.S. Route 22 (Montgomery Road/Ohio State Route 3) and Ohio State Route 561 (Smith Road). Easily accessible from all directions, Norwood saw an opportunity to revitalize itself. Norwood approached GM about demolishing the plant. Initially the carmaker refused. As its finances grew critical, Norwood threatened General Motors with a lawsuit. Apparently, Norwood had not been collecting taxes on earnings paid to workers on sick-leave or injury-leave since the factory opened in 1923. Only regular payroll taxes were collected. Norwood calculated uncollected taxes as being in the millions of dollars. The carmaker and City settled their dispute, with the site being demolished at the carmaker's expense. The property was turned over to the City for development in exchange for the City dropping its demand for back-taxes. The development of the GM Assembly site helped jump-start Norwood's economy. A series of \\"flex\\" businesses were constructed. Where once had stood a single blue-collar car factory, the property was transformed into a mixed-use combination of business - office, light industrial and retail, providing mix-use income to the City. As of spring 2007 the only remnants of former GM buildings were two parking garages. Those were absorbed into a new office complex along Smith Road (State Rte. 561), with additions of an adult gym/workout center, day-care center, restaurants, banking center and several medium and small businesses. One small street, formerly leading into the GM plant from Montgomery Road (U.S. Route 22), was closed and developed into a mixed use complex named after a major tenant Matrixx Marketing and later Convergys Corporation complex. It has been home to those businesses as well as a bank, satellite television provider and medical consulting/MRI/diagnostic laboratory. There was also a railcar holding lot and loading area off Tennessee Ave. where the present day Harley-Davidson dealership is located. The rail spur itself is directly behind and up on the hill behind the Harley-Davidson dealership along the old B&O; line. As of 2012 the loading area is still there complete with the loading ramps. However this area is becoming quickly overgrown with trees and bushes and it is difficult to tell it's even there anymore. Many of the rails still exist as well as the light poles. The driveway up the hill from the holding lot was removed when the Harley dealer was built. As of Fall, 2007, the third and last piece of usable land from the GM plant at the corner of Montgomery Road (U.S. Route 22) and Smith Road (State Route 561) was developed with plans for a medical arts building. The successful development of those former GM Assembly properties spurred interest by other developers to choose Norwood for commercial development. One mile away, two open-air shopping malls were built at the former R. K. LeBlond Machine Tool Company, located where Interstate 71 and Ohio State Rte 561 (Edwards Road) converge. Those properties were named Rookwood Pavilion and Rookwood Commons and have been very successful as well. Economic impact The plant constituted 35% of the City of Norwood's tax base, approximately $2 million annually. As a result, many city services were reduced and eliminated, and property tax rates raised. The plant employed 430 Norwood residents at the time of its closing, with the remaining employees mostly living in and around the Cincinnati area. The City of Norwood quickly moved to rehabilitate the site, and by 1991 the Central Parke office project housed in excess of 1,000 workers using nearly of office space. In 2007 there is approximately of office and retail space in the area once occupied by the factory. References  Cincinnati Enqirer (January 29, 2006).

Boston butt is the most common cut used for pulled pork, a staple of barbecue in the southern United States. In the United Kingdom, Boston butt is known as pork shoulder on the bone, since regular pork shoulder normally has the bone removed and then rolled and tied back into a joint. History of the name and cut Grilled moksal Some suggest that in pre-revolutionary New England and into the American Revolutionary War, New England butchers tended to take less prized cuts of pork like hams and shoulders and pack them into barrels for storage and transport, known as a butt, which comes from the Latin word \\"Buttis\\" meaning cask or barrel. This particular shoulder cut became known around the country as a Boston specialty, and hence it became the \\"Boston butt\\". However, the first known reference to the Boston butt as a cut of meat does not appear in print until 1915 in the publication Hotel Monthly. In the UK it is known as \\"pork hand and spring\\", or simply \\"pork hand\\", or, as noted above, \\"pork shoulder on the bone\\". In Spanish the cut is known as paleta de puerco, and is the main ingredient in the Mexican dish carnitas\\"Carnitas\\". Food Resource, Oregon State University.

The multichannel brand, founded in 1985, specializes in upscale clothing. White House Black Market owns and operates various clothing and accessories boutiques in the United States and Canada, where they sell their tops, dresses, skirts, pants, jackets, outerwear, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. Since 2003, White House Black Market has operated as a subsidiary of Chico's. History The company began in 1985 when cofounders Patricia Smith and Richard Sarmiento opened the first store called The White House, in Baltimore, Maryland. True to its name, The White House only carried women's clothing in shades of white. The boutique performed extremely well, catering to an upscale clientele of women. In 1991, with the help of National Retail Group, a North-Carolina-based consulting firm, The White House began its national expansion. After a decade of selling exclusively white merchandise, the brand launched a new retail format ‚Äî \\"Black Market\\"‚Äî in 1995. A few experiments followed, where Sarmiento the founders housed both White House and Black Market under the same roof. His endeavors were successful, and in 1997, the company began converting existing stores to this White House Black Market combination concept. In 2003, Chico's FAS, Inc. purchased White House Black Market after the privately held firm went public. The purchase price for the specialty retailer was $90M, with $85.6M in cash and about $4.4M in Chico's common stock. Collections White House Black Market's collections include dresses, jackets, pants, shoes, swim, tees, accessories and \\"everyday essentials\\".

The set is made up entirely of Bob Dylan covers, performed live at various dates. The CD was the second release on Hitchcock's own Editions PAF! label. Background Hitchcock is a long-time Dylan fan, and this is the first time he had released an album of covers, giving Dylan an especially privileged place in Hitchcock's oeuvre. Disc details Rather than nominate the two discs as 'one' and 'two', they are labeled 'stripes' and 'dots' respectively, in view of the printed pattern on each. Disc Stripes contains eight recordings including two versions of \\"Visions of Johanna\\", which Hitchcock introduces as \\"the reason I started writing songs\\". His source material here is varied, spanning several decades of Dylan output from the mid-1960s up until 1997's \\"Not Dark Yet\\". Hitchcock's renditions are sensitive and sharp, with the occasional lyric change. (During the track \\"4th Time Around\\", Hitchcock forgets his words and has to request help from the audience.) Disc Dots is a re-creation of the second part of Bob Dylan's 'Royal Albert Hall' concert of 1966, which actually took place in Manchester, and is famous for Dylan's confrontational stance against a heckling audience who objected to his electric instrumentation. Hitchcock runs through the set track for track, culminating with \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Illustration The CD insert features a shot of Hitchcock on the Isle of Wight, at a 1996 gig for which he chartered two vintage open- topped buses, transporting his audience around certain beauty spots on the island, where the entourage would pull over and listen to a few numbers before boarding again and heading off.

Toyota Avensis of the airport section of the Cantonal police of Geneva. Toyota Land Cruiser of the Cantonal police of Geneva. Law enforcement in Switzerland is mainly a responsibility of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, who each operate cantonal police agencies. Some cities also operate municipal police agencies as provided for by cantonal law. The federal government provides specialised services and is responsible for the protection of the Swiss border. Throughout Switzerland, the police may be reached by the emergency telephone number 1-1-7.  Requirements  The requirements to be an officer in Switzerland vary by canton, whose responsibility it is to institute the police service, some of the requirements include a complete high school education or 3 year vocational education, aged approximately 20-30 years of age, absence of a criminal record, completion of military service, a minimum height requirement, a Category B driver's licence, computer and keyboard literacy, foreign language skills, proper health and ocular health status, and Swiss citizenship.https://www.berufsberatung.ch/dyn/show/1900?id=5110 Law enforcement agencies =Federal= The federal government does not run a general purpose law enforcement agency. National-level law enforcement coordination is provided by a board of cantonal police commanders. The Federal Office of Police, an organisation belonging to the Federal Department of Justice and Police, coordinates international operations and may request cantonal police support for criminal investigations conducted under federal jurisdiction (such as with respect to organised crime, money laundering and terrorism). The Office's investigative arm is the Federal Criminal Police, which operates a small special operations unit, Einsatzgruppe TIGRIS, whose existence was not made public until 2009. The Federal Department of Finance is responsible for the Swiss Border Guard Corps. The military of Switzerland, led by the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports, operates a professional military security service and a military police service. These services, as well as the armed forces in general, can be tasked to support the cantonal police forces in situations where civilian police resources are insufficient, such as catastrophes or large-scale unrest. In this case, the military serves under cantonal civilian responsibility and command. An actual Swiss Railway Police did not exist until the late 1990s. Prior to this, a number of train attendants were sworn in, equipped with a sidearm and ordered to provide security services in addition to their main duties. In the early 1990s, internal employees were recruited into a security force called Bahnpolizei (Bapo) or Railway Police, responsible for the safety on the S-Bahn, the public suburban railway network in Zurich. Its officers were equipped with a baton and a pepper spray but were not allowed to carry a firearm and had very limited authority. In the meantime, the Swiss Federal Railways SBB and Securitas AG established the Public Transport Security Services Securitrans AG, where the Bapo was subsequently embedded in. With the passage of the Federal Act on the Security Units of Public Transport Companies in 2010, the Railway Police returned under SBB‚Äôs umbrella and was renamed to Transport Police for legal reasons. In 2012, the Ordinance on the Security Units of Public Transport Companies was issued that extended the Transport Police's authority and allowed its officers to carry a sidearm. Today, the Transport Police and Securitrans coexist with different fields of duty. =Cantonal= The 26 cantonal police agencies and numerous municipal police agencies are the backbone of Swiss law enforcement. They are not subordinate to federal authorities. Their commanding officers report to the head of the respective cantonal or municipal department of police, who is a member of the cantonal or municipal governing council. Police training is conducted in cantonal service academies and at the Interkantonale Polizeischule Hitzkirch, a joint police academy of twelve police agencies established in 2007. =Private = Several private security services such as Securitas AG and Protectas exist in Switzerland. Their agents (except those of the railway police service as noted above) do not have any law enforcement authority, such as the power of arrest, beyond that of ordinary citizens. Prisons Switzerland has 124 detention facilities with a total capacity of up to 6,736 detainees, all operated by the Swiss cantons.

While it was developed by Fairey as a reconnaissance fighter for the Royal Air Force, the only orders placed were for three for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Design and development The Pintail was designed by F. Duncanson of Fairey Aviation to meet the requirements of the RAF Type XXI Specification, which was issued in 1919 for an amphibian reconnaissance fighter, competing with the Parnall Puffin.Taylor 1974, p. 90. The Pintail was a two-bay biplane, fitted with twin floats, and with the upper wing in line with the pilot's eye line. In order to give a clear upwards field of view for the crew, the Pintail was fitted with an unusual tail unit, with the tailplane lying across the top of the rear fuselage and the rudder below the tailplane. The first prototype, the Pintail Mark I, flew on 7 July 1920. The second prototype, the Pintail Mark II had a lengthened fuselage, while the third prototype, the Pintail Mark III had non-retractable wheels within the floats. While the Pintail was more capable as a fighter than the Possum, offering an excellent upwards field of view for the crew, it had poor downwards view for the pilot during landing. Operational history While the Pintail was not adopted by the RAF, three examples, similar to the Mark III, were sold to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These aircraft, known as the Pintail IV had an increased wing gap so the upper wing was situated above the fuselage, improving the downwards view for the pilot.

Yowarsky recovered a fumble at the Oklahoma 22-yard line, leading to Kentucky's first score on the next play. In the third quarter Oklahoma had the ball at the Kentucky three-yard line and Yowarsky tackled Billy Vessels (future Heisman Trophy winner) for a five-yard loss, after which the Sooners were stopped on downs and Kentucky took possession. In the fourth quarter Yowarsky recovered a fumbled punt. Kentucky won the game 13‚Äì7, ending the Sooners' 33-game winning streak and Yowarsky was named the game's MVP.

There are also programs where one can switch positions with a teacher overseas. When picking a program make sure it is a credible program. Three often-used paths for American teachers are teaching at a Department of Defense school, teaching at an international school, or working independently at any school accepting foreign applicants. U.S. Department of Defense Teaching at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) school is much like teaching at a school within the United States. The schools enroll the children of military and DOD civilian employees. There are currently 222 public schools in \\"13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico\\" (DOD). There are 8,785 teachers working in these schools. The DOD works to keep the school atmosphere and level of learning comparable to schools within the U.S.DoDEA: The Department of Defense Education Activity The DOD hires only teachers with bachelor's degrees (which must include some course work in education) and teaching experience. Most placements are for one or two years; teachers are placed at the discretion of the DoD and cannot choose their location. International volunteer programs Numerous volunteer programs exist in which teachers can teach in foreign schools. Costs to participate as a volunteer vary depending on the organization, the country and the length of the program. International volunteer programs usually vary in length from 2 to 12 months. Volunteers most often teach English but other subjects can also be covered, such as computer skills, AIDS/HIV awareness, science, math, etc. Volunteer English teaching programs exist in almost all corners of the world. Some countries with prominent English teaching programs are Chile, Spain, France, and Georgia. Many programs are sponsored by the host nation's ministry of education, such as Chile's English Opens Doors and Korea's EPIK program. International schools International schools are private schools that cater mainly to children who are not nationals of the host country, including the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Teachers are often hired on contracts that typically last two years Savva, M. (2013). International schools as gateways to the intercultural development of North- American teachers. Journal of Research in International Education, 12(3), 214-227. Research has indicated that teaching experiences abroad contribute positively to the intercultural development of teachers (Savva, 2013). TESOL Certification Many teaching positions overseas are for teachers of English and can involve teaching to all ages, including both children and adults. Programs are organized by individual schools, national governments (such as the JET Programme in Japan and English Opens Doors in Chile). The University of Missouri-Saint Louis, like many schools, have required their education majors to either pick TESOL or special education to major in for more specificity. This university, in particular, wants teachers to be more well rounded for future employers. Some programs require teaching credentials and/or TESOL certification. Thousands of people every year choose to do a short course in TESOL or TEFL, and while there is some dispute about the claimed usefulness of brief courses (TEFL, TESOL, etc.) in becoming an effective teacher, after this short course, most employers in almost every countryhttps://azbigmedia.com/lifestyle/adventures/5-ways-to-make-money-while- backpacking/ accept that the teacher has qualified and is able to teach English. There are jobs in almost every country for teachers who have done these short TEFL or TESOL courses, and most countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, and especially China struggle to find teacher to fill teaching positions. Many English language schools and companies in China, in recent years, have moved to a strategy more adaptive to this market pressure, and have started employing thousands of teachers around the globe to teach through online teaching, giving quick rise to the new industry of online teachershttps://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/11/chinese-learn-english- online-us-tutors-remote-jobs-rise/1356821001/.

It has been more narrowly described by some scholars (Amsler, 1980) as the use of computers in the study of machine-readable dictionaries. It is distinguished from computational lexicography, which more properly would be the use of computers in the construction of dictionaries, though some researchers have used computational lexicography as synonymous. History Computational lexicology emerged as a separate discipline within computational linguistics with the appearance of machine-readable dictionaries, starting with the creation of the machine-readable tapes of the Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary in the 1960s by John Olney et al. at System Development Corporation. Today, computational lexicology is best known through the creation and applications of WordNet. As the computational processing of the researchers increased over time, the use of computational lexicology has been applied ubiquitously in the text analysis. In 1987, amongst others Byrd, Calzolari, Chodorow have developed computational tools for text analysis. In particular the model was designed for coordinating the associations involving the senses of polysemous words.Byrd, Roy J., Nicoletta Calzolari, Martin S. Chodorow, Judith L. Klavans, Mary S. Neff, and Omneya A. Rizk. \\"Tools and methods for computational lexicology.\\"Computational Linguistics 13, no. 3-4 (1987): 219-240. = Study of lexicon = Computational lexicology has contributed to the understanding of the content and limitations of print dictionaries for computational purposes (i.e. it clarified that the previous work of lexicography was not sufficient for the needs of computational linguistics). Through the work of computational lexicologists almost every portion of a print dictionary entry has been studied ranging from: # what constitutes a headword - used to generate spelling correction lists; #what variants and inflections the headword forms - used to empirically understand morphology; #how the headword is delimited into syllables; #how the headword is pronounced - used in speech generation systems; #the parts of speech the headword takes on - used for POS taggers; #any special subject or usage codes assigned to the headword - used to identify text document subject matter; #the headword's definitions and their syntax - used as an aid to disambiguation of word in context; #the etymology of the headword and its use to characterize vocabulary by languages of origin - used to characterize text vocabulary as to its languages of origin; #the example sentences; #the run-ons (additional words and multi-word expressions that are formed from the headword); and #related words such as synonyms and antonyms. Many computational linguists were disenchanted with the print dictionaries as a resource for computational linguistics because they lacked sufficient syntactic and semantic information for computer programs. The work on computational lexicology quickly led to efforts in two additional directions. =Successors to Computational Lexicology= First, collaborative activities between computational linguists and lexicographers led to an understanding of the role that corpora played in creating dictionaries. Most computational lexicologists moved on to build large corpora to gather the basic data that lexicographers had used to create dictionaries. The ACL/DCI (Data Collection Initiative) and the LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) went down this path. The advent of markup languages led to the creation of tagged corpora that could be more easily analyzed to create computational linguistic systems. Part-of-speech tagged corpora and semantically tagged corpora were created in order to test and develop POS taggers and word semantic disambiguation technology. The second direction was toward the creation of Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs). A Lexical Knowledge Base was deemed to be what a dictionary should be for computational linguistic purposes, especially for computational lexical semantic purposes. It was to have the same information as in a print dictionary, but totally explicated as to the meanings of the words and the appropriate links between senses. Many began creating the resources they wished dictionaries were, if they had been created for use in computational analysis. WordNet can be considered to be such a development, as can the newer efforts at describing syntactic and semantic information such as the FrameNet work of Fillmore. Outside of computational linguistics, the Ontology work of artificial intelligence can be seen as an evolutionary effort to build a lexical knowledge base for AI applications. Standardization Optimizing the production, maintenance and extension of computational lexicons is one of the crucial aspects impacting NLP. The main problem is the interoperability: various lexicons are frequently incompatible. The most frequent situation is: how to merge two lexicons, or fragments of lexicons? A secondary problem is that a lexicon is usually specifically tailored to a specific NLP program and has difficulties being used within other NLP programs or applications. To this respect, the various data models of Computational lexicons are studied by ISO/TC37 since 2003 within the project lexical markup framework leading to an ISO standard in 2008.

The event was one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the state of Oklahoma. According to National Weather Service data, the cyclone killed 9 missing people were not accounted for or found in the following days and weeks. The tornado was part of a larger, multiple-day tornado outbreak that hit several states across the Midwestern United States, including Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Meteorological synopsis The tornado was caused by a strong low pressure system that developed across the Rocky Mountains, near Denver, Colorado. Another storm was also located across Wyoming on May 9. Tornadoes formed on that day across several Plains states including Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The Colorado storm system then moved toward the Central and Southern Plains on the next day and affected areas slightly to the east of the area affected on May 9. A new trough of low pressure developed in the vicinity of the southern storm. It later moved across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.NWS Norman, Oklahoma - The Snyder, Oklahoma Tornado of 10 May 1905: Weather Synopsis As happened on numerous other occasions, such storms produced a large moist and warm flow from the Gulf of Mexico as well as much instability in the atmosphere. Being in May, storm systems produced large contrasts of temperatures, which added more ingredients for the development of powerful thunderstorms with possible damaging tornadoes. Such was the case on May 10, 1905. Snyder tornado Damage to the Snyder Hotel seen just days after the tornado destroyed much of Snyder, Oklahoma Prior to the Snyder tornado, a first tornado developed at 6:45 PM CST near Carmel in Greer County, which is about one hour northwest of Wichita Falls, Texas. This tornado killed at least 10 people. Numerous homes, farmsteads and a school house sustained heavy damage or were destroyed. The tornado lifted near Lock (in Jackson County). A second and more destructive tornado touched down just after 8:00 PM CST near the Kiowa/Greer County line and merged with the remnants of the first cyclone. It also proceeded northeast across the Red River Valley and Otter Creek region. At around 8:45 PM CST (after dark), it struck the town of Snyder, killing 97 people. Structures in the western and northern part of the town were completely demolished, with some homes being swept away. One hundred homes were leveled and 150 were badly damaged.NWS Norman, Oklahoma - The Snyder, Oklahoma Tornado of 10 May 1905: Aftermath The tornado lifted northeast of Snyder shortly after 9:00 PM CST. Another tornado from a different supercell, which previously killed two in Elk City in Beckham County, killed three more in Quinlan, Oklahoma, which is about two hours northeast of Snyder. Aftermath In 1905, only telephones and telegraphs existed which made recovery efforts difficult, especially since both methods of communications were knocked out by the tornado. People had to walk to surrounding regions in order to get help and assistance. In the coming days, several neighboring towns across southern and central Oklahoma assisted in the recovery efforts, with doctors being assigned and many supplies shipped in by trains towards the devastated region. One of the doctors to respond to the area was Doctor George Fowler Border, of Mangum, Oklahoma, founder of the first hospital in the region.State Doctor Got His Start Watering Circus Elephants Records and similar events The Fujita scale was not established at that time, but due to the heavy damage, the tornado has been retroactively rated F5. In recorded history, the tornado was one of the deadliest in the state of Oklahoma. At the time the event occurred, it was the second deadliest F5 tornado ever, being surpassed by the 1899 New Richmond tornado which killed 117 (and still stands as the deadliest in Wisconsin history and 9th overall in the United States). The Snyder tornado was the deadliest in Oklahoma history until it was surpassed by the Woodward County tornado on April 9, 1947, which killed at least 181. It still stands today as the 2nd deadliest tornado ever in the state. Another tornado, rated F4, was recorded in the immediate area on May 1, 1954. The tornado, which originated from North Texas, did not cause any fatalities in the Snyder area. Other similar outbreaks, which had the same meteorological dynamics, include the 1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak - which killed 102 including 80 in Udall, Kansas, the 1979 Red River Valley tornado outbreak - which killed at least 54, including 42 in Wichita Falls, the Andover tornado outbreak - which killed 21, including 4 in Wichita and 13 in Andover, Kansas, the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak in 1999 - which killed 48 in and around Oklahoma City, Wichita and southern Tennessee, and the Greensburg, Kansas, outbreak in May 2007 - which killed 14, including 10 in Greensburg, Kansas.

The new Augustinian Friary located in the town via the river is connected to the Abbey. History Edmund Butler of Pottlerath, a noted patron of literature, successfully petitioned Pope Pius II for the foundation of the friary in 1461.

After it was closed (dissolved) and its lands confiscated by the order of Henry VIII in his campaign against the church, it passed into the hands of the Earls of Ormonde. A new monastery for the Augustinian friars was founded in the town of Callan in 1766. The friary church is a long, rectangular building with a central bell-tower.

After the war he moved to Scottish junior club Douglas Water Thistle. In 1919, he joined then Southern League club Bristol Rovers playing for them during their first years in the league after they became members of the newly formed Division Three. Herbert Chapman signed Steele in a ¬£2,500 deal to take him to Huddersfield Town in May 1922. Steele spent seven years at Huddersfield, winning a hat-trick of League Championships, two runners-up spot, an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1928, and three caps for Scotland. He joined Preston North End in May 1929 on a free transfer where he finished his playing days in July 1930. Managerial career Steele began his managerial career when he worked at Bury as a coach. Similar roles followed at Danish side Bold Klubben F.C. and Sheffield United. In 1931 he spent some months in Aalborg in northern Denmark as a coach and introduced the WM-formation in Denmark.Jydsk Idr√¶ts Blad, 21-3-1931.

He spent six years at Park Avenue and even turned out as an emergency centre forward against Sheffield Wednesday in October 1942 scoring one goal. He resigned in 1943 to rejoin Huddersfield Town. In the club's first post-war season, Huddersfield finished just one place above the relegation positions in Division One and Steele resigned. He was working on the family's fruit farm when Bradford City tempted him back into football in July 1948. He became the second man, after Peter O'Rourke to manage both Bradford league clubs. He won just one of his first 18 games in charge as City finished bottom of Division Three (North) in 1948‚Äì49. The following season City came 19th, before a 7th- place finish in 1950‚Äì51. Steele left in February 1952 with the club again struggling in the bottom half of the league. He returned to Huddersfield Town for a third time as a scout. His grandson, David Shaw played for Town in the 1970s. He also ran a pub in Stanningley. He died in May 1964 aged 69.

Any child can be considered to be at risk of harm or abuse, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender or religion. The UK government has enacted legislation and published guidance to protect children from maltreatment, prevent the impairment of children's health or development, ensure children grow up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care, and enable children and young people to have the best outcomes. Responsibility for these aims is deemed to lie with everyone who comes into contact with children and families. Adults in need of safeguarding help are generally elderly and frail, and either live alone or in care homes with little support from family members. They may have mental health issues, a physical disability or learning difficulties. Professional carers ideally focus on empowerment, protection, prevention, proportionate responses, partnership and accountability to safeguard vulnerable adults. In Birmingham and the West Midlands, the term 'adults at risk' is preferred over 'vulnerable adults'. Children Safeguarding children is a concept that reaches beyond child protection to incorporate the additional aims of preventing the harm of children's health and development, ensuring children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care.The difference between safeguarding and child protection - The Department for Education. Education.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15. The UK Government has defined the term ‚Äòsafeguarding children‚Äô as: ‚ÄòThe process of protecting children from abuse or neglect, preventing impairment of their health and development, and ensuring they are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care that enables children to have optimum life chances and enter adulthood successfully.‚ÄôSafeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15. This shift from traditional child protection to a more all- encompassing approach was influenced by the first Joint Chief Inspectors‚Äô safeguarding children report (2002) and the Victoria Climbi√© Inquiry (2003).2005 report / Safeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15. The Every Child Matters programme outlined in the Children Act 2004 formalised these changes in approach into a legislative framework. Every Child Matters aimed to improve outcomes for children in 5 key areas; being healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution and achieving economic well- being.2008 report / Safeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk (2008-07-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-15. To help achieve this the Act made a number of institutional changes including the abolition of Area Child Protection Committees that had been deemed to have performed poorly in some areas by the Joint Chief Inspectors‚Äô 2002 report and the formation of the multi-agency Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). These consisted of representatives from local partner agencies such as housing, health, police and probation services. The LSCBs were charged with co-ordinating the functions of all partner agencies in relation to safeguarding children. They carry out this function by, among other things, agreeing the contribution of all member agencies and deciding how these pooled funds should be allocated. In addition they are responsible for commissioning independent Serious Case Reviews and training member agency staff in safeguarding children best practice. The Act also placed a duty on all agencies to make arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children Safeguarding children The third Chief inspectors‚Äô report on arrangements to safeguard children 2008 In 2006 the government released Working Together to Safeguard Children, which set out the ways in which organizations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the wellbeing of children. In 2010 this was superseded by Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010) which expanded the focus on interagency working and took into account the recommendations of Lord Laming's 2008 progress report The Protection of Children in England which suggested it was imperative that frontline professionals get to know children as individuals. Working Together to Safeguard Children has been updated again in 2015 and again in 2018. This latest (Working Together to Safeguard Children 2018) supersedes all former versions.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779401/Working_Together_to_Safeguard- Children.pdf For educational settings, safeguarding responsibilities are subject to statutory guidance set out in Keeping Children Safe in Education, first published 26 March 2015. This guidance was revised with effect from 1 September 2020. Changes made in 2020 include making clear that both mental and physical health are relevant to safeguarding and the welfare of children, and the role of mandatory Relationship Education, Relationship and Sex Education and Health Education in safeguarding.Department for Education, Keeping children safe in education, updated 1 September 2020 In 2014 a High Court judge said that it appeared to be a practice \\"widespread across the country\\" that children were taken into foster care based on social services reports which family courts \\"cut and pasted\\" into their own rulings, without giving the parents the opportunity to view the reports or respond to them. Adults The Care Act 2014 introduced new legislation regarding safeguarding vulnerable adults. The Act sets out a legal framework for how local authorities and other organisations should react to suspicion of abuse or neglect. Assessment A key part of safeguarding work is assessment. Professionals conducting assessments of families where neglect is taking place are said sometimes to make the error of not asking the right questions, such as:Williams, M. (2015) Evidence based decisions in child neglect: An evaluation of an exploratory approach to assessment using the North Carolina Family Assessment Scale, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research- reports/evidence-based-decisions-evaluation-report.pdf * Is neglect occurring? * Why is neglect occurring? * What is the situation like for the child? * Are improvements in the family likely to be sustained? * What needs to be done to ensure the long-term safety of the child?

These events often emphasize children's participation and may be organized by a recognized Pony Club or a 4-H club. In parts of the western United States, this type of competition is usually called an \\"O-Mok-See\\" (also spelled \\"omoksee\\" or without hyphenation as \\"o mok see\\") competition, a term derived from a Native American phrase said to mean \\"games on horseback\\". Very small events with little or no prize money, designed for beginners or riders at a local level, are sometimes called playdays. \\"Gymkhana\\" is the word used in most of the rest of the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom and both the East Coast and the West Coast of the United States.  Types of events  Gymkhana and o-mok-see classes are a collection of timed speed events such as; barrel racing, pole bending, keyhole race, keg race (also known as \\"down and back\\"), flag racing, a hybrid pattern like mountain cow horse, and stake race. Some organizations include ride and run, musical mats, egg stomp, $1 bill race or \\"ride a buck\\", and sack race. Sometimes a goat tying event is included, where the rider will ride up to a goat tied to a stake, jump off, and hog tie the goat. Most of these events are designed to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as flying lead changees, sliding stops and more. Most clubs offer a variety of classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable. O-Mok-See O-Mok-See or omoksee is the most common term used in the Western United States for events in the sport of pattern horse racing. Most events are run with contestants simultaneously running in 4 separate lanes (3 for small arenas), with each contestant riding in a 30 foot wide lane. The origin of the term \\"O-Mok-See\\" is thought to specifically originate with the Blackfeet people where they described a particular style of riding as \\"oh-mak-see pass-kan\\" meaning \\"riding big dance\\". This event was thought to be a war ceremony; before setting out on a mounted expedition against the enemy, the warriors of the camp performed this dance as a part of the prelude of stirring up courage and enthusiasm for battle. The warriors put on their finest dress attire, decorated and painted their best horses, carrying their war bundles, shields, lances and bonnets. They mounted and gathered at some distance out of sight of the camp. They turned and rode together at full speed into the great camp circle, circled around it once and then rode to the center of the camp. In the center were a number of old men and women who sang special songs and beat drums for the horsemen. The horsemen then rode their trained horses to the rhythm of the singers and drummers. From time to time the riders dismounted and danced about on foot beside their horses, shooting in the air and shouting to one another to be brave when the battle came. If anyone fell from his horse during the ceremony it was considered an omen of bad luck. =National Saddle Clubs Association= The National Saddle Clubs Association (NSCA) was established in January 1965 as the first national organization of saddle clubs. The NSCA held its first national championship show in 1966. The NSCA has adopted and promotes the sport of \\"pattern horse racing\\" under the term O-Mok-See. They encourage and allow families to compete together. The NSCA has adopted a set of pattern horse racing events for national competition . some of the events that they run are pole bending, California stake race, polo, key, international flags, Idaho figure-eight and two barrel Flags. There are also 10 or so more events in their rule book. Through standardized rules and regulations for pattern horse racing events, the NSCA's prime purpose and objectives are to promote and cultivate cooperation and friendly relationships between saddle clubs throughout the United States.

Pub Sign The John Brunt V.C. is a public house in Paddock Wood in Kent, England. Originally named The Kent Arms, on 3 September 1947 the pub was formally renamed John Brunt V.C. in honour of an English soldier, John Brunt, who won the Victoria Cross in the Second World War who spent his teenage years in the town. It is the only pub in England to be named after a Victoria Cross holder. The early years The Brunt family settled in Paddock Wood in the 1930s and their son, John, was a frequent visitor to The Kent Arms as a teenager. He was killed fighting in the Second World War, on 10 December 1944, in Italy. On 3 September 1947 a naming ceremony took place, and a new sign (designed by Kathleen M Claxton, and built at Whitbread's Wateringbury brewery), bearing a portrait of John with his name underneath, was unveiled by his father, Thomas Brunt. A miniature replica of the sign painted in oils was presented to Brunt by Sir Sydney Nevile, Managing Director of Whitbread and Co Ltd In May 1949 Whitbread began issuing 2\\" x 3\\" plaques featuring pub signs of Kent and the south-eastern portion of Sussex. Known as Whitbread's Inn Sign Miniatures, five series of 50 each were produced between 1949 and 1955, the first three series in metal, the third series reissued in card, and the last two series issued only in card. Number 43 of the first series was The John Brunt, V.C. The \\"Hooden Horse\\" controversy The John Brunt V.C. By the late 1990s, the pub had gained a reputation for drugs, trouble and after-hours drinking and the Whitbread brewery sold it to the Inn Business pub chain. On Sunday 1 June 1997, after a final night disco, the pub closed. The new owners announced that it was going to be renamed The Hopping Hooden Horse because of the hop cultivation in the area, and that it would have the initials JBVC after the name to retain the history of the town. Within a week work had begun on renovating the pub, and no more than two days after an article in the local newspaper revealed the plans a campaign to retrieve the pub sign, and a petition to retain the original name had been started. The new owners of Hooden Horse Inns ltd, Inn Business PLC, after receiving some letters of complaint announced that: \\"most of our pubs contain the corporate Hooden Horse name and there was simply no way we could have made the place work under the name John Brunt V.C.\\" and the newly renamed pub opened 6 days before the 50 year anniversary of the original naming ceremony on 28 August 1997. Bob Akehurst, a Paddock Wood resident, threatened to stand against the existing Paddock Wood councillors in the local elections if they didn't take appropriate action to ensure that John Brunt's name was remembered. Some former customers refused to enter the pub now that the name had changed and Mr. Akehurst, who remembered John Brunt, said that to \\"call the place The Hopping Hooden Horse is, frankly, ridiculous.\\". John Brunt in the 21st century The new sign, unveiled on 9 November 2008In June 2001 Rita and Terry Dixon took over the pub from Hooden Horse Inns and immediately decided to revert to the old name, which was greeted with enthusiasm by Paddock Wood residents. Several customers who had refused to drink there under the Hooden Horse name now returned (although even during that time, the pub was still known by local residents simply as The Brunt). Unfortunately the original signs had been lost when the pub changed its name, although the \\"John Brunt V.C.\\" brass wording that used to hang on the outside wall was found at the nearby hop farm. On 9 November 2008, a new sign designed by Alex Atkinson, an art student at Mascalls School, was unveiled by Eric Knight, who knew John Brunt when at school. In 2019 the pub was purchased by Star Pubs and Bars and in December that year closed for two months as work began on converting it into a gastropub at a cost of ¬£480,000.

Taxonomy The type species of this genus, P. eigenmanni, was first described in 1946 under the genus Pimelodus. In 2002, the genus Propimelodus was described for this species. Shortly after, in 2006, the species P. caesius was described to this genus and in 2007 another new species, P. araguayae was described. Other species will be described in the future. Propimelodus is classified under the \\"Calophysus-Pimelodus clade\\". Within this clade, it is considered a part of the \\"Pimelodus-group\\" of Pimelodids, which also includes Pimelodus, Exallodontus, Duopalatinus, Cheirocerus, Iheringichthys, Bergiaria, Bagropsis, Parapimelodus, Platysilurus, and Platystomatichthys. Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Propimelodus araguayae Rocha, de Oliveira & Rapp Py-Daniel, 2007 * Propimelodus caesius Parisi, Lundberg & DoNascimiento, 2006 * Propimelodus eigenmanni (van der Stigchel, 1946) Distribution P. eigenmanni originate from the lower Amazon River as well as large tributaries such as the Xingu, Trombetas, Jari River, and lower Madeira River in Brazil, and the Kourou and Oyapock Rivers in French Guiana. P. caesius has the largest range of the genus. P. caesius is also found in many of these regions, with tributary range including Tocantins, Par√°, Jari, Xingu, Trombetas, Madeira, Negro, Pur√∫s, Japur√°, Juru√°, and I√ß√° rivers. P. araguayae is only known from the middle Araguaia River. Appearance and anatomy These fish have three pairs of barbels. As in other pimelodids, these whiskers are extremely long; the maxillary barbels extend past the base of the caudal fin. Propimelodus species have a rather long adipose fin. Unlike its congeners, P. araguayae has a black spot on its dorsal fin. P. eigenmanni grows not much longer than 20 centimetres (8 in). P. eigenmanni is a pale blue-gray to tan. P. caesius also has an attractive blue coloration. Ecology Propimelodus lives in swiftly flowing waters of open channels of the Amazon River and many of its large tributaries; P. caesius is one of the most common fish in these habitats. P. eigenmanni associate with mud or detritus substrates. P. caesius is found in turbid, blackwater habitats over sand, clay, and detritus substrates. P. eigenmanni is nocturnal, found in tidally influenced freshwater habitats on mud substrate and near dense vegetation. P. araguayae has been found near the edge of rivers among macrophytes.

Irving Freese Park Irving Freese Park, named for mayor Irving Freese, which was created at the intersection of Main and Wall Streets in the mid-1960s as part of reconstruction work following the flood of 1955. On the west side of the park a fenced parapet overlooks the walled-in Norwalk River. Park benches shaded by trees also overlook the river. The park contains a monument to the Hungarian uprising of 1956, placed there by a Hungarian association in the city, and a plaque commemorating the embarkation of Nathan Hale from Norwalk Harbor in mid-September 1776 on his fatal spying mission. \\"As Wall Street suffered from recent economic and structural deterioration, so did the park facility which also lacked a defined user group,\\" according to a Norwalk city capital projects report. \\"A goal identified in the Wall Street Redevelopment Plan is the restoration of Wall Street as a traditional center for the Norwalk community which included the development of a downtown residential population. To achieve this goal the Plan outlined a strategy for revitalization of parks and open spaces along the Norwalk River, Freese Park specifically identified as one of these assets.\\" In 2007 the Connecticut Light and Power Company utility helped finance $25,000 of the improvements to the park, including new lighting and landscaping, improved pathways, a new railing along the edge of the river and an irrigation system.Breslow, Matt, \\"CL&P; grant to help 'spruce up' Freese Park\\", article in The Advocate of Stamford, Norwalk edition, March 6, 2007, pp All, A12 Pine Island Cemetery Pine Island Cemetery The Pine Island Cemetery, located behind Mathews Park (around the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum), dates to 1708 and has about 1,000 graves. The oldest identified grave belongs to Elizabeth Bartlet, wife of one of the city's founders, who died in 1723 at the age of 38. One burial in the cemetery was as late as 2000. As of the summer of 2007, the Norwalk Historical Commission, concerned that the West Avenue and Reed Putnam redevelopment projects might harm the cemetery, was attempting to get the cemetery listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a program run by the National Park Service. Widening nearby Crescent Street, for instance, would mean six graves would have to be moved. The cemetery had been the burial site of pillars of the community, with expensive, elegant gravestones, but by the mid-twentieth century it had become a gravesite for paupers.Stelloh, Tim, \\"Development threatens 300-year-old cemetery: Commission wants Pine Island on list of historic places\\", article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, pp A9-A10, Norwalk edition Emergency services The city of Norwalk Fire Department currently operates 2 Fire Stations in close proximity to the Central or Midtown Norwalk area: Fire Station # 1 is located at 90 New Canaan Ave. in the Broad River/Main Avenue area, and Fire Station # 2, or Fire Headquarters is located at 121 Connecticut Ave. Additionally, Norwalk's first volunteer fire companies, Phoenix Hose Co. 1 and Pioneer Hook & Ladder Co. 1 were quartered at 32 Commerce St. in the Wall Street neighborhood.

It launched his career in cartooning and eventually led to his popular The Far Side series in 1980. History Nature's Way began as six comic strips submitted in 1976 to the Pacific Search, a local magazine in Seattle. This was Larson's effort to get away from a retail music store job. He was paid $90 for the strips, which encouraged him to produce more cartoons. He soon began submitting weekly cartoons to a newspaper, The Sumner News- Review, which paid him $3 a cartoon. With such earnings, his enthusiasm began to wane, and he began to revert to his previous situation as a non-cartoonist and worked for the Humane Society. In 1979, a reporter to whom he had shown his work got him published in The Seattle Times. It was published on a weekly basis with a payment of $15 per cartoon. Because they chose to position it right next to a children's crossword puzzle, it began to draw complaints. These were enough to get the strip canceled in 1980, just a few days after Larson got a contract with the San Francisco Chronicle, which jump-started his career. Eventually, the name was changed to The Far Side. In The Prehistory of the Far Side, Larson commented, \\"They could have called it Revenge of the Zucchini People for all I cared\\" as he was so happy to be eagerly accepted into the San Francisco Chronicle. Cartoon style =Artistic= The artistic style of this strip had some similarities to The Far Side. For instance, the people in the strips were often overweight. The facial structures in Nature's Way also tended to resemble those found in Far Side cartoons, as well as having the same one-panel structure as The Far Side. =Humor= The humor in Nature's Way was often based on ironic settings, bizarre mistakes, plays on common phrases, anthropomorphic situations and general oddities of nature.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 369 pupils or 16.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Huntingdon Area School District received a $1,377,297 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 82 or 3.86% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Huntingdon Area School District administration reported there were 4 incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Huntingdon Area School Board has not provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.

Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In July 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board. In 2010, the Board was accused of violating the Pennsylvania Sunshine Act for public meetings with regard to discussion about closing two elementary schools. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= For the 2012-13 school year, Huntingdon Area School District will receive $7,609,271. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. The state will also provide $544.4 million for School Employees‚Äô Social Security and $856 million for School Employees‚Äô Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation.

This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.95% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $7,778,468.

This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.U.S. Census Bureau., Annual Survey of Local Government Finances., 2000U.S. Census Bureau., 2008 Survey of Local Government Finances ‚Äì School Systems, 2010 According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 904 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the Huntingdon Area School District applied for and received $369,905 in addition to all other state and federal funding.

The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, two Huntingdon County School Districts were part of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a full application. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Districts must hire literacy coaches. The coaches work with classroom teachers to enhance their literacy teaching skills. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level. Science It‚Äôs Elementary grant No elementary School In HASD applied to participate and in the Science It's Elementary state grant. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem- solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It‚Äôs Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010 ‚Äì 2011 Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 Districts were required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. They had to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006-07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006-07 school year. This marks an 8-percent increase over 2005-06 public school funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Governor Rendell Commends Teachers for Enhancing Science Education in Pennsylvania, August 10, 2006 The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The grant was discontinued in 2010 by Governor Rendell due to a massive state budget. 21st Century learning grant In July 2012, Huntingdon Area School District did not apply for a 21st Century Learning federal grant which is run by the PDE.

The grant was competitive. Applications for the grants were reviewed and scored by a panel of representatives from the educational field and professional grant writers. The school received $114,061. While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved, including eight charter schools. The funding is for the 2012-13 fiscal year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Education Secretary Announces $19.78 Million Awarded to Enhance Academic Opportunities for At-Risk Students, July 11, 2012 Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Administration did not apply for funding for the high school. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $1,140,363 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Huntingdon Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district nearly one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Huntingdon Area School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The school board set property tax rates in 2011-12 at 76.3000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2010-11 - 74.8800 mills. *2009-10 - 72.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 72.0000 mills. *2007-08 - 68.8000 mills. *2006-07 - 67.3000 mills. *2005-06 - 67.3000 mills. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09. The average yearly property tax paid by Huntingdon County residents amounts to about 2.25% of their yearly income. Huntingdon County is ranked 1206th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Huntingdon County Property Taxes 2012, Tax rates.org, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Huntingdon Area School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011. * 2006-07 - 5.3%, Base 3.9% * 2007-08 - 4.6%, Base 3.4% * 2008-09 - 6.0%, Base 4.4% * 2009-10 - 5.6%, Base 4.1% * 2010-11 - 4.0%, Base 2.9% * 2011-12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% * 2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, Huntingdon Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Huntingdon Area School Board applied for several exception to exceed the Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Selected Revenue, teacher pension costs and Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Huntingdon Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 and 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Huntingdon Area School District was $144 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,660 property owners applied for the tax relief. This was the highest property tax relief allotted in Huntingdon County for 2009. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year they were the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship. In 2014, the United States was added to Reporters Without Borders (RWB)'s list of \\"Enemies of the Internet\\", a group of countries with the highest level of Internet censorship and surveillance. RWB stated that the U.S. has \\"undermined confidence in the Internet and its own standards of security\\" and that \\"U.S. surveillance practices and decryption activities are a direct threat to investigative journalists, especially those who work with sensitive sources for whom confidentiality is paramount and who are already under pressure.\\"\\"Internet Enemies\\" , Enemies of the Internet 2014: Entities at the heart of censorship and surveillance, Reporters Without Borders (Paris), 11 March 2014. Retrieved 24 June 2014. In U.S. government-funded Freedom House's Freedom On the Net 2017 report covering the period from June 2016 to May 2017, the United States was rated the fifth most free of the 65 countries rated. Overview The strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. These protections extend to the Internet and as a result very little government mandated technical filtering occurs in the US. Nevertheless, the Internet in the United States is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.\\"ONI Regional Overview: North America\\" , OpenNet Initiative, 30 March 2010 After more than two decades of ongoing contentious debate over content regulation, the country is still very far from reaching political consensus on the acceptable limits of free speech and the best means of protecting minors and policing illegal activity on the Internet. Gambling, cyber security, and dangers to children who frequent social networking sites are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies have prevented the more extreme measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the U.S. Public dialogue, legislative debate, and judicial review have produced filtering strategies in the United States that are different from those found in most of the rest of the world. Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred on First Amendment grounds, often after lengthy legal battles.\\"Cybersieves\\" , Derek E. Bambauer, Duke Law Journal, vol. 59 (2009) However, the government has been able to exert pressure indirectly where it cannot directly censor. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely more on the removal of content than blocking; most often these controls rely upon the involvement of private parties, backed by state encouragement or the threat of legal action.\\"The Move to the Middle: The Enduring Threat of 'Harmful' Speech to the End-to-End Principle\\" , John Palfrey, Jr. and Robert Rogoyski, Washington University Journal of Law and Policy, vol. 21 (2006), pp.31‚Äì65 In contrast to much of the rest of the world, where ISPs are subject to state mandates, most content regulation in the United States occurs at the private or voluntary level. The first wave of regulatory actions in the 1990s in the United States came about in response to the profusion of sexually explicit material on the Internet within easy reach of minors. Since that time, several legislative attempts at creating a mandatory system of content controls in the United States have failed to produce a comprehensive solution for those pushing for tighter controls. At the same time, the legislative attempts to control the distribution of socially objectionable material on the Internet in the United States have given rise to a robust system that limits liability over content for Internet intermediaries such as Internet service providers (ISPs) and content hosting companies. Proponents of protecting intellectual property online in the United States have been much more successful, producing a system to remove infringing materials that many feel errs on the side of inhibiting legally protected speech.\\"Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA\\" , Electronic Frontier Foundation, March 2010 The US practices forceful seizures of domains and computers, at times without notification, causing the websites to be unable to continue operating.

National security concerns have spurred efforts to expand surveillance of digital communications and fueled proposals for making Internet communication more traceable. Federal laws With a few exceptions, the free speech provisions of the First Amendment bar federal, state, and local governments from directly censoring the Internet. The primary exception has to do with obscenity, including child pornography, which does not enjoy First Amendment protection.\\"The Internet Censorship Controversy\\" , Usman Qazi, Professionalism in Computing (Computer Science 3604), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, spring 1996 =Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)= The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted in 1986 as an amendment to an existing computer fraud law (), which was part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The CFAA prohibits accessing a computer without authorization, or in excess of authorization. Since 1986, the Act has been amended a number of times‚Äîin 1989, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, 2002, and in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act. The CFAA is both a criminal law and a statute that creates a private right of action, allowing private individuals and companies to sue to recover damages caused by violations of this law. Provisions of the CFAA effectively make it a federal crime to violate the terms of service of Internet sites, allowing companies to forbid legitimate activities such as research, or limit or remove protections found elsewhere in law. Terms of service can be changed at any time without notifying users. Tim Wu called the CFAA \\"the worst law in technology\\". Aggressive prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) has fueled growing criticism of the law's scope and application.\\"United States Country Profile: Violations of User Rights\\" , Freedom On the Net 2017, Freedom House. In 2013 a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation (, ; H.R. 2454 at GovTrack; H.R. 2454 at OpenCongress. ; S. 1196 at GovTrack; S. 1196 at OpenCongress.) that would prevent the government from using CFAA to prosecute terms of service violations and stop prosecutors from bringing multiple redundant charges for a single crime. The bill was reintroduced in 2015 (, ), but did not garner enough support to move forward. =Communications Decency Act (CDA)= In 1996, the United States enacted the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which attempted to regulate both indecency (when available to children) and obscenity in cyberspace.\\"Communications Decency Act of 1996\\", a United States federal law, Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, In 1997, in the case of Reno v. ACLU, the United States Supreme Court found the anti-indecency provisions of the Act unconstitutional.\\"CDA\\" , Center for Democracy and Technology Writing for the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that \\"the CDA places an unacceptably heavy burden on protected speech\\".\\"No.96-511, JANET RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, et al., APPELLANTS v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION et al.\\" , 26 June 1997, Supreme Court Decision Index, Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition Section 230¬ß 230. Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material, Title 47, Chapter 5, Subchapter II, Part I of the U.S. Code, Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School is a separate portion of the CDA that remains in effect. Section 230 says that operators of Internet services are not legally liable for the words of third parties who use their services and also protects ISPs from liability for good faith voluntary actions taken to restrict access to certain offensive materialsmaterial that is considered \\"... to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected\\", from ¬ß 230(c)(2)(A) \\"Protection for \\"Good Samaritan\\" blocking and screening of offensive material\\", Title 47, Chapter 5, Subchapter II, Part I of the U.S. Code\\" or giving others the technical means to restrict access to that material. =Child Online Protection Act (COPA)= In 1998, the United States enacted the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) to restrict access by minors to any material defined as harmful to such minors on the Internet. The law was found to be unconstitutional because it would hinder protected speech among adults. It never took effect, as three separate rounds of litigation led to a permanent injunction against the law in 2009. Had the law passed, it would have effectively made it an illegal act to post anything commercial based to the internet that is knowingly harmful to children without some sort of vetting program to confirm the users age. =Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)= Signed into law in 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA, ) criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology that could be used to circumvent copyright protection mechanisms and makes it easier to act against alleged copyright infringement on the Internet.The Digital Mellennium Copyright Act of 1998 , U.S. Copyright Office Summary, December 1998 The Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) is included as Title II of the DMCAOnline Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, and limits the liability of the on-line service providers for copyright infringement by their users.\\"DMCA\\" , Electronic Frontier Foundation =Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)= The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect on 21 April 2000.\\"Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998\\", a United States federal law, located at () It applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction from children under 13 years of age and details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing to those under 13.\\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule\\" , U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 7 October 2008 While children under 13 can legally give out personal information with their parents' permission, many websites disallow underage children from using their services altogether, due to the cost and amount of paperwork necessary for compliance. =Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)= In 2000 the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)\\"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)\\", and - was signed into law. CIPA requires K-12 schools and libraries receiving federal Universal Service Fund (E-rate) discounts or LSTA grants for Internet access or internal connections to:\\"Children's Internet Protection Act\\" , Consumer Publications, Federal Communications Commission, updated/reviewed 22 April 2011 * adopt and implement an Internet safety policy addressing: (a) access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet; (b) the safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms, and other forms of direct electronic communications; (c) unauthorized access, including so-called \\"hacking,\\" and other unlawful activities by minors online; (d) unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and (e) measures restricting minors' access to materials harmful to them; * install internet filters or blocking software that prevents access to pictures that are: (a) obscene, (b) child pornography, or (c) harmful to minors (for computers that are accessed by minors); * to allow the filtering or blocking to be disabled upon the request of an adult; and * adopt and enforce a policy to monitor the online activities of minors. CIPA does not: * require the tracking of Internet use by minors or adults; or * affect E-rate funding for schools and libraries receiving discounts for telecommunications services, such as telephone service, but not for Internet access or internal connections. =Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)= In March 2008, the New York Times reported that a blocklist published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency established under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1917 and other federal legislation, included a number of websites, so that US companies are prohibited from doing business with those websites and must freeze their assets. The blocklist has the effect that domain name registrars based in the US must block those websites. According to the New York Times, eNom, a private domain name registrar and Web hosting company operating in the US, disables domain names which appear on the blocklist. It describes eNom's disabling of a European travel agent's web sites advertising travel to Cuba, which appeared on the list published by OFAC. According to the report, the US government claimed that eNom was \\"legally required\\" to block the websites under US law, even though the websites were not hosted in the US, were not targeted at US persons and were legal under foreign law. =Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)= The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) is designed to \\"improve cybersecurity in the United States through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats, and for other purposes\\".\\"Discussion Draft of the 'Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014' (S.2588)\\" , 113th Congress, 2d Session, June 11, 2014. The law allows the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The text of the bill was incorporated by amendment into a consolidated spending bill in the U.S. House on December 15, 2015, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 18, 2015.\\"Budget bill heads to President Obama's desk with CISA intact\\" , Chris Velazco, Engadget, December 18, 2015.\\"Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015\\" , Thomas F.

Karp, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, March 3, 2016, Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation. Opponents question the CISA's value, believing it will move responsibility from private business to the government, thereby increasing vulnerability of personal private information, as well as dispersing personal private information across seven government agencies, including the NSA and local police. Some felt that the act was more amenable to surveillance than actual security after many of the privacy protections from the original bill were removed. =Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015 (SAVE)= The Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015 (SAVE) is part of the larger Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 which became law in May 2015.The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 , Pub. L 144-22, May 29, 2015. The SAVE Act makes it illegal to knowingly advertise content related to sex trafficking, including online advertising. The law establishes federal criminal liability for third-party content. There is a concern that this will lead companies to over-censor content rather than face criminal penalties, or to limit the practice of monitoring content altogether so as to avoid \\"knowledge\\" of illegal content.\\"United States Country Profile\\" , Freedom On the Net 2017, Freedom House. Retrieved April 8, 2018. =Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)= In 2016, complainants from Gallaudet University brought a lawsuit against UC Berkeley for not adding closed captioning to the recorded lectures it made free to the public. In what many commentators called an unintended consequence of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Department of Justice ruling resulted in Berkeley deleting 20,000 of the freely licensed videos instead of making them more accessible. =Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act - Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (FOSTA- SESTA)= Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) is a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representative by Ann Wagner in April 2017. Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) is a similar U.S. Senate bill introduced by Rob Portman in August 2017. The combined FOSTA-SESTA package passed the House on February 27, 2018 with a vote of 388-25 and the Senate on March 21, 2018 with a vote of 97-2. The bill was signed into law by Donald Trump on April 11, 2018. The bill amended Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to exclude the enforcement of federal and state sex trafficking laws from immunity, and clarified the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act to define participation in a venture as knowingly assisting, facilitating, or supporting sex trafficking. The bills were criticized by pro- free speech and pro-Internet groups as a \\"disguised internet censorship bill\\" that weakens the section 230 safe harbors, places unnecessary burdens on internet companies and intermediaries that handle user-generated content or communications with service providers required to proactively take action against sex trafficking activities, and requiring a \\"team of lawyers\\" to evaluate all possible scenarios under state and federal law (which may be financially unfeasible for smaller companies). Online sex workers argued that the bill would harm their safety, as the platforms they utilize for offering and discussing sexual services (as an alternative to street prostitution) had begun to reduce their services or shut down entirely due to the threat of liability under the bill. Proposed federal legislation that has not become law =Deleting Online Predators Act (DOPA)= The Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006 was introduced, but did not become law.H.R. 5319: Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006 , govtrack.us, 9 May 2006 Two similar bills were introduced in 2007, but neither became law.H.R.1120: Deleting Online Predators Act of 2007 , govtrack.us, 16 February 2007S.1965: Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act , govtrack.us, 2 August 2007 The proposed legislation would have required schools, some businesses, and libraries to block minors' access to social networking websites. The bill was controversial because, according to its critics, it would limit access to a wide range of websites, including many with harmless and educational material. =Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act (PCNAA) = The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act was introduced in 2010, but did not become law.H.R.5548: Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010, govtrack.us, 16 June 2010 The proposed Act caused controversy for what critics perceived as its authorization for the U.S. President to apply a full block of the Internet in the U.S.\\"Myth vs. Reality: The Facts About S. 3480, ‚ÄúProtecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010‚Äù , a fact sheet issued by Senators Joseph I.

The proposed Act would have allowed the U.S. Attorney General to bring an in rem action against an infringing domain name in United States District Court, and seek an order requesting injunctive relief. If granted, such an order would compel the registrar of the domain name in question to suspend operation of, and may lock, the domain name. The U.S. Justice Department would maintain two publicly available lists of domain names. The first list would contain domain names against which the Attorney General has obtained injunctions. The second list would contain domains alleged by the Justice Department to be infringing, but against which no action had been taken. Any service provider who willingly took steps to block access to sites on this second list would immune from prosecution under the bill. =Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)= The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), also known as H.R. 3261, is a bill that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26, 2011, by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and a bipartisan group of 12 initial co-sponsors. The originally proposed bill would allow the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement. Depending on who requests the court orders, the actions could include barring online advertising networks and payment facilitators such as PayPal from doing business with the allegedly infringing website, barring search engines from linking to such sites, and requiring Internet service providers to block access to such sites. Many have argued that since ISP's would be required to block access to certain websites that this is censorship. On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia shut down for 24 hours beginning at 5:00 UTC (12:00 EST) to protest SOPA and PIPA. In the wake of this and many other online protests, Rep. Smith stated, \\"The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution\\". Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and a key opponent of the bills, said lawmakers had collected more than 14 million names ‚Äî more than 10 million of them voters ‚Äî who contacted them to protest the once-obscure legislation. =Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA)= The Protect Intellectual Property Act (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA) was a proposed law with the stated goal of giving the US government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to \\"rogue websites dedicated to infringing or counterfeit goods\\", especially those registered outside the U.S. The bill was introduced on May 12, 2011, by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and 11 bipartisan co-sponsors. PIPA is a re-write of the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), which failed to pass in 2010. In the wake of online protests held on January 18, 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Friday January 20 that a vote on the bill would be postponed until issues raised about the bill were resolved. Reid urged Leahy, the chief sponsor of PIPA, to \\"continue engaging with all stakeholders to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the internet.\\"Stephanie Condon (20 January 2012), \\"PIPA, SOPA put on hold in wake of protests\\" CBS News =Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA)= The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) was a proposed law introduced in November 2011, with the stated goal of giving the U.S. government additional options and resources to ensure the security of networks against attacks. It was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in April 2012, but was not passed by the U.S. Senate. The bill was reintroduced in the House in February 2013\\"CISPA Cybersecurity Bill, Reborn: 6 Key Facts\\" , Mathew J. Schwartz, Information Week, 14 February 2013 and again in January 2015. While this bill never became law, a similar bill from the U.S. Senate, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), was incorporated by amendment into a consolidated spending bill in the U.S. House on December 15, 2015, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 18, 2015. CISPA was supported by several trade groups containing more than eight hundred private companies, including the Business Software Alliance, CTIA ‚Äì The Wireless Association, Information Technology Industry Council, Internet Security Alliance, National Cable & Telecommunications Association, National Defense Industrial Association, TechAmerica and United States Chamber of Commerce, in addition to individual major telecommunications and information technology companies like AT&T;, Facebook, IBM, Intel, Oracle Corporation, Symantec, and Verizon. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern that in the name of the war on cyber crime, it would allow the government and private companies to deploy draconian measures to monitor, even censor, the Web. Other organizations that oppose the bill include the Constitution Project, American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy and Technology, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Sunlight Foundation, and TechFreedom. Google did not take a public position on the bill, but lobbied for it.

And five states require Internet service providers to make a product or service available to subscribers to control use of the Internet. They are: Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. In July 2011 Missouri lawmakers passed the Amy Hestir Student Protection Act which included a provision that barred K-12 teachers from using websites that allow \\"exclusive access\\" in communications with current students or former students who are 18 or younger, such as occurs with private messages on sites such as Facebook.Section 162.069 of SB 54 , signed by the governor 14 July 2011, effective date 28 August 2011 A circuit court order issued before the law went into effect blocked the provision because \\"the breadth of the prohibition is staggering\\" and the law \\"would have a chilling effect\\" on free-speech rights guaranteed under the US Constitution.\\"Order Entering Preliminary Injunction in Missouri State Teachers Association, et al. v.

Lieb, Associated Press in Boston.com, 23 September 2011 In December 2016, Bill Chumley, member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, introduced a bill that would require all computers to be sold with \\"digital blocking capabilities\\" to restrict access to pornographic materials. Users or manufacturers would be required to pay a $20 fee in order to lift the blocks. As of April 2018 the bill had not become law, but remained pending before the House Committee on Judiciary. In March 2018, Frank Ciccone and Hanna Gallo, members of the Rhode Island State Senate, introduced a bill requiring Internet Service Providers to institute a block on pornographic materials, which could be lifted with the payment of a $20 fee. Censorship by institutions The constitutional and other legal protections that prohibit or limit government censorship of the Internet do not generally apply to private corporations. Corporations may voluntarily choose to limit the content they make available or allow others to make available on the Internet. Corporations may be encouraged by government pressure or required by law or court order to remove or limit Internet access to content that is judged to be obscene (including child pornography), harmful to children, defamatory, pose a threat to national security, promote illegal activities such as gambling, prostitution, theft of intellectual property, hate speech, and inciting violence. Public and private institutions that provide Internet access for their employees, customers, students, or members will sometimes limit this access in an attempt to ensure it is used only for the purposes of the organization. This can include content-control software to limit access to entertainment content in business and educational settings and limiting high- bandwidth services in settings where bandwidth is at a premium. Some institutions also block outside e-mail services as a precaution, usually initiated out of concerns for local network security or concerns that e-mail might be used intentionally or unintentionally to allow trade secrets or other confidential information to escape. =Schools and libraries= K-12 schools and libraries that accept funds from the federal E-rate program or Library Services and Technology Act grants for Internet access or internal connections are required by Children's Internet Protection Act to have an \\"Internet safety policy and technology protection measures in place\\". Many K-12 school districts in the United States use Internet filters to block material deemed inappropriate for the school setting.\\"Internet filtering as a form of soft censorship \\" , Mitch Wagner, Computerworld Tool Talk blog, 19 March 2010\\"How Internet censorship harms schools\\" , Mitch Wagner, Computerworld Tool Talk blog, 26 March 2010 The federal government leaves decisions about what to filter or block to local authorities. However, many question this approach, feeling that such decisions should be made by a student's parents or guardian. Some of the fears associated with Internet filtering in schools include: the risk of supporting a predominant ideology, that views held by filter manufacturers are being imposed on students, over blocking of useful information, and under blocking of harmful information.\\"Internet Censorship: Issues for Teacher-Librarians\\" , Alvin Schrader, Teacher Librarian: The journal for school library professionals, May/June 1999 A 2003 study \\"found that blocking software overblocked state-mandated curriculum topics extensively‚Äìfor every web page correctly blocked as advertised, one or more was blocked incorrectly.\\"\\"Study Released on Internet Blocking in Schools\\" , press release, Online Policy Group and Electronic Frontier Foundation, 23 June 2003 Some libraries may also block access to certain web pages, including pornography, advertising, chat, gaming, social networking, and online forum sites,\\"Internet Use in Libraries\\" , Fact Sheet Number 26, American Library Association, July 2010 but there is a long and important tradition among librarians against censorship\\"Library Bill of Rights\\" , American Library Association Council, adopted 19 June 1993, as amended and last reaffirmed 23 January 1996 and the use of filtering and blocking software in libraries remains very controversial.\\"Resolution on the Use of Filtering Software in Libraries\\" , American Library Association, 2 July 1997 =Telecommunications and Internet service companies= In 2007, Verizon attempted to block the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America from using their text messaging services to speak to their supporters.

The result was that WikiLeaks could not be accessed through its web address. This elicited accusations of censorship and resulted in the Electronic Frontier Foundation stepping up to defend WikiLeaks. After a later hearing, the injunction was lifted. In December 2010, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Library of Congress, the U.S. Air Force, and other government agencies began advising their personnel not to read classified documents available from WikiLeaks and some blocked access to WikiLeaks and other news organizations' websites.\\"U.S. agencies warn unauthorized employees not to look at WikiLeaks\\" , David de Sola, CNN, 4 December 2010 This action was intended to reduce the exposure of personnel to classified information released by WikiLeaks and published by those news organizations.

Constitutional lawyers say that this is not a first amendment issue because Amazon, as a private company, is free to make its own decisions. Kevin Bankston, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agreed that this is not a violation of the first amendment, but said it was nevertheless disappointing. \\"This certainly implicates first amendment rights to the extent that web hosts may, based on direct or informal pressure, limit the materials the American public has a first amendment right to access\\".\\"How Lieberman Got Amazon To Drop WikiLeaks\\" , Talking Points Memo, 1 December 2010 The New York Times reported on 14 December\\"Air Force Blocks Sites That Posted Secret Cables\\" , Eric Schmitt, New York Times, December 14, 2010.

For example, social media websites may restrict hate speech to a larger degree than is required by US law (see also hate speech on Facebook), and may restrict harassment and verbal abuse. Restriction of hate speech and harassment on social media is the subject of debate in the US. For example, two perspectives include that online hate speech should be removed because it causes serious intimidation and harm, and that it shouldn't be removed because it's \\"better to know that there are bigots among us\\" than to have an inaccurate picture of the world. The National Religious Broadcasters, an organization that represents American Christian television and radio broadcasters, and the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian, pro-life group, conducted a study that concluded that some social media sites are \\"actively censoring\\" religious content that expresses Christian perspectives, because they forbid \\"hate speech\\" in the form of anti-homosexual viewpoints.\\"Threats to the Open Net: September 24, 2011\\" , Qichen Zhang, OpenNet Initiative, 25 September 2011\\"Report: For Religion, They're Anti-Social Networks\\" , Matt Philbin, Culture and Media Institute, 19 September 2011 =By corporations abroad= :See also: Cisco censorship in China, Google censorship, Microsoft censorship in China, MySpace in China, Skype in China, and Yahoo! censorship in China Several U.S. corporations including Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and MySpace practice greater levels of self-censorship in some international versions of their online services.\\"Policing Content in the Quasi-Public Sphere\\" , Jillian C.

In December 2016 the California Law Revision Commission issued a recommendation on \\"Government Interruption of Communication Service\\".\\"Government Interruption of Communication Service\\" , December 2016, California Law Revision Commission. The Commission concluded that government action to interrupt communications can be constitutional in some circumstances, if the government acts pursuant to procedures that are properly designed to protect constitutional free expression and due process rights. To be constitutional the action will usually need to be approved by a judicial officer who has found (i) probable cause that the communication service is or will be used for an unlawful purpose, (ii) that immediate action is required to protect public health, safety, or welfare and (iii) the affected customer must have a prompt opportunity for adjudication of the government's contentions. For a general interruption of communication service that will affect a large number of people or a large geographic area, judicial approval would also require that the action (iv) is necessary to avoid a serious threat of violence that is both imminent and likely to occur or (v) that the effect on expression is incidental to some other valid government purpose, and (vi) is reasonable, (vii) is content-neutral, (viii) would impair no more speech than is necessary, and (ix) leaves open other ample means of communication. Prior judicial approval is not required in extreme emergencies involving immediate danger of death or great bodily injury where there is insufficient time to obtain a court order. Beyond constitutional law, a state or local government's ability to effect a general interruption of wireless communication service is also subject to the federal \\"Emergency Wireless Protocol (EWP)\\" or \\"Standard Operating Procedure 303\\" which established a process for interrupting and restoring wireless communication service during times of national emergency.The effect of this protocol is that state and local government officials can initiate an interruption of communication service, but they cannot directly order wireless communication service providers to take action. Such orders to private wireless communication providers must come from the National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the federal officials designated by the EWP. If an order authorizing an interruption does not fall within the EWP, it is served directly on the relevant communication service provider.

The novel follows a fictional State Department employee, Florence Farfaletti, as she attempts to bring equal rights to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of \\"Matar.\\" Plot summary The wife of the ambassador of the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Wasabia gets drunk, steals her husband's car and drives out of the compound. When pulled over by police, she desperately phones her friend Florence Farfaletti, the \\"Deputy to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs,\\" begging for asylum to avoid a harsh punishment. Florence is unable to arrange asylum. The wife is taken back to Wasabia and beheaded for her crime. In anger over her friend's execution, Florence drafts a proposal to introduce a women's television network in the relatively liberal Matar. The state department rejects the proposal, and reassigns Florence to an obscure posting outside the country. To Florence's surprise, a mysterious government employee, identified only as \\"Uncle Sam,\\" representing an unknown agency, notifies Florence that her proposal has been accepted and agrees to fund the mission. Florence arrives in Matar and creates a women's television network that is broadcast into neighboring Wasabia. The network airs shows like \\"One Thousand and One Mornings,\\" which feature empowered female characters who nettle their oppressors and make fun of men. The programming is effective, eventually causing the women of Matar to stage an uprising. Florence is thrown in jail, but ultimately is rescued and returns to the United States. Back in the United States, Florence discovers that her operation was not funded by the U.S. government at all, but rather by the Waldorf Group, a private equity firm which wanted to prevent extremism in Wasabia to help secure the flow of profits. Florence is exasperated to have been working for bankers all along, but glad that her work improved the status of women's rights in Wasabia. An ex-president, who is on the board of the Waldorf Group, tells her, \\"One way or the other, Florence, we're all working for investment bankers.\\"  Objects of satire  The novel is set in the fictional state of Matar, a somewhat liberal Middle Eastern sheikdom, similar to the real world Qatar. The neighboring country Wasabia refers to Saudi Arabia, with Wasabia being a play on Wahhabism, one of the most conservative forms of Islam, which is criticized throughout the book for its treatment of women. The Washington Post reviewer wrote, tongue in cheek, of the fictional country of Wasabia : \\"Its oppressive power is guaranteed by optimum connections to the American establishment greased by a suave prince as its longtime ambassador in Washington. Wasabia's medieval legal system, among other things, subjugates, humiliates and violates women, as well as executing them for such vices as flirting. Of course this is a wholly fictional land, too absurd to resemble any in the real family of nations.\\" The firm \\"the Waldorf Group\\" is a reference to the Carlyle Group. The novel was among the first to lampoon terrorism and Islamist extremism, which in the post-9/11 era were not considered laughing matters. The book also portrays U.S. foreign policy as contributing to those problems. Publication The story was first published in two long excerpts in the September and October issues of The Atlantic Monthly. The book was published in hardcover on September 14, 2004. The title of the novel is a play on \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", a popular name for the British Army officer T. E. Lawrence, who became famous for his exploits in the Middle East, particularly as a liaison during the Arab Revolt of 1916-1918. Buckley finished writing the novel on May 19, 2004, the anniversary of Lawrence's death.Florence of Arabia, p. 253. The pun \\"Florence of Arabia\\" was first coined by No√´l Coward, who told the actor Peter O'Toole (who played Lawrence in the film Lawrence of Arabia) that \\"If you'd been any prettier, it would have been Florence of Arabia.\\" The novel is an homage to Fern Holland, whom Buckley describes as a \\"real-life Florence of Arabia.\\" Holland was a 33-year-old lawyer who went to work for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. On March 9, 2004, Holland was murdered for her work involving women's rights. Holland, Robert J. Zangas (another U.S. aid worker) and Salwa Oumashi, were the first civilians working for the occupation authority to be killed.

He rode it three times, coming 11th in 1903 and fourth in 1904. In 1905 he was part of Henri Pepin's experimental team that 'voyaged' rather than 'raced' its way around France. Background Jean Dargassies was a blacksmith in the village of Grisolles, north of Toulouse. The town's main industry was broom-making. The forge was at 4 av√©nue de la R√©publique.Journal du Dimanche, France, 27 July 2003 He was \\"not very tall but well built, with thighs and calves like the pillars of a cathedral.\\"L'Auto, France, 13 July 1903 He had a spreading blond moustache.Journal du Dimanche, France, 13 July 2003, p19 In a picture of the forge, he is posing beside a horse, a broad leather belt round his waist, a hammer in his hand. His mother wears an ankle- length striped dress and a bonnet. Two other men in the family, probably his brothers, are also there. All four are wearing wooden clogs. Dargassies' father was also a blacksmith, his mother a housewife [m√©nag√®re]. Jean was the second son. The oldest brother, J√©rome, was destined to take over the business. Entering the Tour de France Legend says that Dargassies bought a bicycle so that he could ride 25 km to Montauban, as far to the north as Toulouse was to the south. Nobody in the family had left the immediate area. The shop owner had heard of a new race, the Tour de France, to be promoted that summer. He looked him up and down and said: \\"You could ride that, with muscles like yours.\\"Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France Dargassies wrote to L'Auto to say he wanted to take part. By the days before the start, he had heard nothing. He went to Paris anyway to meet the race director, G√©o Lef√®vre. There were few entrants from the south and Lef√®vre, a Parisian, was entranced by Dargassie's country ways and his marked southern accent. He recounted the meeting in L'Auto: :\\"My name is Dargassies and I've come from Grisolles.\\" :\\"Where?\\" :\\"From Grisolles, near Montauban, and I've come to make inquiries.\\" :\\"About?\\" :\\"Inquiries about the Tour de France.\\" :\\"But... You're already entered, I think. :\\"Heavens, yes, [pardi], I've entered! I just wanted to know what's going to happen.\\" :\\"You haven't read L'Auto?\\" :L'Auto? I don't think anyone reads that in Monnetaubanne.'\\" (Lef√®vre took pleasure in reproducing Dargassie's pronounce- every-letter southern accent.) :\\"Where?\\" :\\"Monnetaubanne, Tarn-et-Garonne.\\" :\\"Oh, Montauban!\\" :\\"Yes. The man who sold me my bike told me there was a Tour de France race and he said: 'Dargaties, you're made for that.'\\"Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France, p22Procycling, UK, 2008 Dargaties was the blacksmith's real name. Lef√®vre misheard it. Jean Dargaties became known as Jean Dargassies. Lef√®vre asked: \\"Tell me, have you ever actually ridden a cycle race?\\" Dargassies replied: \\"No, but I've ridden from Grisolles to Montauban and back and I didn't even have to try. I'm a blacksmith; I'm not worried about tiredness.\\" Riding the Tour de France The first Tour de France started at Montgeron, south of Paris. By Toulouse he was one of 30 left in the race. With them he left the city in the night and led the race as it passed through his village.It was the first time a rider had been allowed to lead through his home town. The tradition continued during quiet periods of the race until the end of the 1970s. Lef√®vre reported: \\"The whole of Grisolles is by the side of the road. They're here to see Dargassies, the champion of the region. When he rode by, every voice shouted in encouragement, in a long avenue of people all the way to Montauban.\\" Dargassies was three minutes behind the leaders as he came through Montauban and his front fork had broken. As a blacksmith, he had no trouble finding a colleague to make a repair. In Paris he finished 11th, 13 hours behind the winner, Maurice Garin. His prize: 145 francs. When he got home to Grisolles he sent a telegram to Lef√®vre: \\"Got back home today. All my compatriots are crazy, crazier than me. Everybody at the station, music, flowers, speech. Fame! Fame!\\" He rode the Tour again in 1904 and finished fourth, lifted from 10th by disqualifications of the best riders for cheating. This time he won 1,000 francs. The first domestique Dargassies rode the Tour in 1905. There he met another rider, Henri P√©pin, a prosperous landowner from Gontaud-de-Nogaret, east of Bordeaux.P√©pin is often mistakenly called a baron. The main article explains the misunderstanding. The two made a deal that Dargassies and another rider, Henri Gauban, would pace P√©pin round the 1907 event. Instead of racing, they would take their time, stop at good restaurants, spend the night in the best hotels they could find. In return, P√©pin would pay his helpers what they would have received had they won the race. As hired hands sacrificing their own hopes for their leader's, Dargassies and Gauban became cycling's first domestiques, although the word wasn't coined until later. The three riders never separated. They took 12 hours and 20 minutes longer than √âmile Georget on the stage from Roubaix to Metz and the judges were powerless because the race was decided not on time but points. It mattered not what speed riders managed than the order in which they crossed the line. The judges had to wait for everyone. P√©pin pulled out between Lyon and Grenoble on stage five, paid the money he had promised and set off for the train home. Dargassies joined him. Gauban pulled out on the 11th. It was Dargassies' last Tour. Retirement and death Dargassies retired and ran first a food shop and then a bike shop, at the junction of the rue Faug√®re and the rue de Lumel in Grisolles.Le Journal du Dimanche, France, 20 July 2003 He died 1965, when he was 93. He is buried in the town's cemetery under his original name, Dargaties. Schools are named after him in Eaunes, Haute-Garonne and at nearby Portet-sur-Garonne.

This list includes folk festivals worldwide, except those with only a partial focus on folk music or arts. Folk festivals may also feature folk dance or ethnic foods. Handicrafting has long been exhibited at such events and festival-like gatherings, as it has its roots in the rural crafts. Like folk art, handicraft output often has cultural, political, and/or religious significance. Folk art encompasses art produced from an indigenous culture or by peasants or other laboring tradespeople. In contrast to fine art, folk art is primarily utilitarian and decorative rather than purely aesthetic, and is often sold at festivals by tradespeople or practicing amateurs.West, Shearer (general editor), The Bullfinch Guide to Art History, page 440, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, United Kingdom, 1996.

The Lycurgus Cup is a 4th-century Roman glass cage cup made of a dichroic glass, which shows a different colour depending on whether or not light is passing through it: red when lit from behind and green when lit from in front.British Museum Highlights; Freestone, 270‚Äì273; see also this pdf with good images under both lights It is the only complete Roman glass object made from this type of glass,British Museum ‚Äì The Lycurgus Cup and the one exhibiting the most impressive change in colour;Freestone, 271 it has been described as \\"the most spectacular glass of the period, fittingly decorated, which we know to have existed\\".Harden, 248 The cup is also a very rare example of a complete Roman cage-cup, or diatretum, where the glass has been painstakingly cut and ground back to leave only a decorative \\"cage\\" at the original surface-level. Many parts of the cage have been completely undercut. Most cage-cups have a cage with a geometric abstract design, but here there is a composition with figures,Corning Museum of Glass, Cage cups;Freestone, 270 showing the mythical King Lycurgus, who (depending on the version) tried to kill Ambrosia, a follower of the god Dionysus (Bacchus to the Romans). She was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him. Dionysus and two followers are shown taunting the king. The cup is the \\"only well-preserved figural example\\" of a cage cup.Williams, 342 The dichroic effect is achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of nanoparticles of gold and silver dispersed in colloidal form throughout the glass material. The process used remains unclear, and it is likely that it was not well understood or controlled by the makers, and was probably discovered by accidental \\"contamination\\" with minutely ground gold and silver dust. The glass-makers may not even have known that gold was involved, as the quantities involved are so tiny; they may have come from a small proportion of gold in any silver added (most Roman silver contains small proportions of gold), or from traces of gold or gold leaf left by accident in the workshop, as residue on tools, or from other work. The very few other surviving fragments of Roman dichroic glass vary considerably in their two colours.Freestone, 275; \\"Gold particles for imaging and Radiotherapy\\", 65‚Äì66 The glass It is estimated that to a conventionally composed Roman glass flux 330 parts per million of silver and 40 of gold were added: \\"These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy. When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission. In transmitted light the fine particles scatter the blue end of the spectrum more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed. Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass.\\"Henderson, 63; see also Freestone, 272‚Äì273; originally published in Barber The particles are only about 70 nanometers across,Barber and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a transmission electron microscope is needed instead.Barber, 34; see also Henderson, 63 At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a surface plasmon resonance effect takes place.Ashby, 30 The interior of the cup is mostly smooth, but behind the main figures the glass has been hollowed out, well beyond even the main outer surface, so that they are of similar thickness to the main outer surface, giving an even colour when light passes through. This is a feature unique among surviving cups; Harden suggests they were an \\"afterthought\\".Harden, 248 An area around the torso of Lycurgus is a rather different colour from the rest of the glass; perhaps an accident of manufacture, but one exploited by the glass-cutter \\"so that he could make Lycurgus's rage glow even more strongly\\".Williams, 342; Freestone, 274 After the very lengthy cutting stage the fine polished appearance was achieved by a process called \\"flame polishing\\" that risked the complete loss of the object.Harden, 248; Williams, 342, though Freeman, 274 reports \\"groups of regular fine parallel striations\\", and suggests the polishing was all done mechanically. A suggestion in 1995 that in fact this and other cage cups used a mixture of moulding and cutting has met with little acceptance.By the glass historian Rosalinde Lierke (see also Hedwig glass). Roman glass in the Corning Museum of Glass, David Whitehouse, Corning Museum of Glass; Freestone, 273‚Äì274. The Rubens Vase, an agate hardstone carving of c. A.D. 400 Like the British Museum's other spectacular work in Roman glass, the cameo glass Portland Vase, the cup represents to some extent the extension of skills developed by cutters of engraved gems, or the larger hardstone carving of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome. No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the Coupe des Ptol√©m√©es or the Rubens Vase.Fleming, 92; see also Freestone, 273‚Äì274; for the Rubens Vase, see the Walters Art Museum page Indeed, it was not until the first full studies of the cup in 1950 that it was established for certain that the material was glass and not a gemstone, which had previously been in question.Freestone, 271 It seems likely that as many as three separate workshops or factories were involved in the production of the cup, perhaps not in the same part of the Empire. The glass may have been initially made in a large block of standard clear glass, perhaps in Egypt or Palestine, which both exported great quantities of glass for forming, and sometimes colouring, elsewhere. The thick \\"blank\\" dichroic vessel was probably made by one specialist workshop and passed to another consisting of specialist cutters. This would certainly have been a rare and highly expensive object, and the secrets of its manufacture, possibly not well understood even by its makers, seem only to have been used for about a century.Freestone, 275 There are various small losses, of which the face of the panther is the most significant, and the cup is cracked; the British Museum has never removed the metal rim for this reason. The base or foot of the cup is damaged, and the original form of the base uncertain.Harden, 245 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, has a fragment measuring 2 3/16 √ó 3 in. (56 √ó 76 mm) of a satyr from a dichroic cage cup that turns from olive green to \\"reddish amber\\".Metropolitan Museum of Art =Modern recreations= Corning Glass Works has reproduced a blank of a material of similar chemical composition and internal structure, which displays under reflected and transmitted light the same \\"Lycurgus effect\\" of green to red colour change as the Lycurgus cup material does.Freestone, 273, fig 6 a & 6b Cranberry glass or gold ruby glass is somewhat similar and far more common, manufactured with colloidal gold, but this only ever shows a red colour. Recently, researchers from The Netherlands have been able to reproduce the green/red dichroic effect in a 3D printable nanocomposite material. This effect, like in the original Lycurgus cup is due to small amounts of silver and gold nanoparticles, of the proper size and shapes, embedded in the 3D printable material. Iconography The satyr with the rock, in the new 2014 display The figure of Lycurgus, bound by the vine and naked apart from boots,Harden, 245, for all the iconography. Lycurgus is normally depicted naked, or very nearly so. is flanked on the left by a crouching Ambrosia, at a considerably smaller scale. Behind her one of Dionysus's satyrs (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot as he prepares to hurl a large rock at Lycurgus. In his other hand he holds a pedum or shepherd's crook.photograph here in green and here in red To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of Pan,Freestone, 271; British Museum image of Pan. The Pan figure is only illustrated at Harden, 247, out of the print sources seen. then at his feet a rather canine-looking panther, the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably snapping at the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture. Dionysus carries a thyrsus, the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult. The calf section of one leg has been lost. A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.British Museum database image It has been suggested that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor Constantine I of his co-emperor Licinius, who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard.British Museum Highlights Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine. The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations,Freeman, 275 still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300. A letter supposedly from the Emperor Hadrian (d. 138) to his brother-in-law Servianus, quoted in a biography in the Historia Augusta, records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th-century author had seen: \\"I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you and my sister. I would like you to use them at banquets on feast days.\\"Freestone, 275; the biography was of Julius Saturninus. Other depictions of the story tend to either depict Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, often with a double-headed axe, while her companions rush to her aid, or Lycurgus alone, entangled in the vine. The closest parallel to the scene on the cup is one of the apse mosaics in the triconch triclinium at the Villa del Casale, Piazza Armerina, which may also refer to Licinius.Harden, 248, and those in next note There is also a mosaic at Antioch on the Orontes, and a group on a 2nd-century sarcophagus at the Villa Parisi in Frascati.Freestone, 271; More on the mosaics; see next note for a link to an image. There is also a floor-mosaic from Vienne, now in the museum at Saint-Romain-en-Gal, with Lycurgus alone inside the vine.PDF on classical precedents for Romanesque figures entwined with vines; fig. 7 is the Vienne mosaic, fig. 9 a partial view of the Piazza Armerini mosaic. Four other depictions of Lycurgus can be seen here. The preceding scene of Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, is on a floor-mosaic at Brading Roman Villa on the Isle of Wight.Brading mosaic Of this and similar mosaics, Martin Henig says: \\"In cases such as this, we are not concerned with simple, popular paganism but with recondite knowledge. This is the sort of esoteric religion which the Emperor Julian, Symmachus, Praetextatus, Macrobius and Proclus relished. The religious thought behind these floors is probably deeper and more complex than contemporary Christianity and many of the keys to understanding it have been lost.\\"Henig, 153 The cup was probably designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations,Harden, 248 where the lack of a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may mean it was passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures. Alternatively other cage cups were almost certainly used, suspended, as oil lamps, where the dichroic effect of this cup would show to advantage. History A view showing parts in both colours, and the variation in the red. The cup was \\"perhaps made in Alexandria\\" or Rome in about 290‚Äì325 AD, and measures .Williams, 342; the British Museum Highlights has \\"4th century AD. Probably made in Rome\\". The dimensions are also from Williams and the Highlights; the Collection database has for the height, perhaps a difference arising from the remounting of the foot. From its excellent condition it is probable that, like several other luxury Roman objects, it has always been preserved above ground; most often such objects ended up in the relatively secure environment of a church treasury. Alternatively it might, like several other cage cups, have been recovered from a sarcophagus. The present gilt-bronze rim and foot were added in about 1800,Williams, 342, who says \\"gilt-bronze\\"; The BM database says \\"silver-gilt\\". suggesting it was one of the many objects taken from church treasuries during the period of the French Revolution and French Revolutionary Wars. The foot continues the theme of the cup with open-work vine leaves, and the rim has leaf forms that lengthen and shorten to match the scenes in glass. In 1958 the foot was removed by British Museum conservators, and not rejoined to the cup until 1973.British Museum database, where there are also photographs with the foot removed. There may well have been earlier mounts.Freestone, 271 The early history of the cup is unknown, and it is first mentioned in print in 1845, when a French writer said he had seen it \\"some years ago, in the hands of M. Dubois\\".\\"il y a quelques ann√©es, entre les mains de M. Dubois\\", Harden, 247. This is probably shortly before it was acquired by the Rothschild family.Harden, 247 Certainly Lionel de Rothschild owned it by 1857, when the touring Gustav Friedrich Waagen saw it in his collection and described it as \\"barbaric and debased\\".Reist, Inge (ed.), \\"Le Gout Rothschild\\", in British Models of Art Collecting and the American Response: Reflections Across the Pond The Histories of Material Culture and Collecting, 1700‚Äì1950, p. 104, 2014, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., , 9781472438065, Google books In 1862 Lionel lent it to an exhibition at what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum, after which it virtually fell from scholarly view until 1950. In 1958 Victor, Lord Rothschild, sold it to the British Museum for ¬£20,000, ¬£2,000 of which was donated by the Art Fund (then the NACF).Harden, 246; Art Fund website The cup forms part of the museum's Department of Prehistory and Europe rather than the Greece and Rome Department, and was previously on display, lit from behind, in Room 50. In 2015 it was on display with the new display of the Rothschild donation of the Waddesdon Bequest in Room 2A, with a changing internal lighting source that shows the colour change very effectively, though only one side of the cup can be seen. By October 2015 it was back in the re-opened Room 41. While Room 41, where it was then displayed, was closed for refurbishment, from November 2012 to August 2013 it was on display with other British Museum pieces at The Art Institute of Chicago's Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman and Byzantine Art, where it was very effectively displayed in a free-standing case, lit from above with changing light so that the colour change was clearly visible.See videos on external links It is considered able to travel to important exhibitions and in 2008 was exhibited in \\"Reflecting Antiquity, Modern Glass Inspired by Ancient Rome\\" at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, in 2003 at the Hayward Gallery in London in \\"'Saved! 100 Years of the National Art Collections Fund\\", and in 1987 in \\"Glass of the Caesars\\" in the British Museum, Cologne, Milan, and Rome.British Museum Database; Harden p.

The state highway runs from the terminal of the seasonal Oxford-Bellevue Ferry in Oxford north to Washington Street in Easton within southwestern Talbot County. MD 333 was constructed between Trippe Creek and Easton in the 1910s. The highway was extended to Oxford in the late 1920s. In Easton, MD 333 was assigned to the southern part of Washington Street between 1948 and 1959 after U.S. Route 213 (US 213, later US 50) bypassed the town. Route description MD 333 northbound past intersection with Spring Road southwest of EastonMD 333 begins at the Oxford terminal of the seasonal Oxford-Bellevue Ferry along the Tred Avon River. The state highway heads southeast through the town as two- lane undivided Morris Street. At the southern end of the town at the head of a branch of Town Creek, Morris Street continues straight as a municipal street while MD 333 curves to the east and leaves the town via Oxford Road. The state highway heads east through farmland, beginning a curve to the northeast shortly before Almshouse Road. MD 333 begins to pass residential subdivisions and golf courses as the highway turns north and crosses Trippe Creek and Peach Blossom Creek. North of the latter creek, the state highway enters the town of Easton, then crosses Paper Mill Pond before intersecting MD 322 (Easton Parkway). MD 333 continues northeast as Peach Blossom Road past Easton Middle School to its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with Washington Street, Harrison Street, and Idlewild Avenue. View south along MD 333 at MD 322 in Easton MD 333 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from Peach Blossom Creek to MD 322 in Easton. History The first section of MD 333 was constructed as a state-aid road between Trippe Creek and Peach Blossom Creek in 1913. The state-aid work included bridges over both creeks. The highway was extended as another state-aid project north from Peach Blossom Creek to Easton by 1919. MD 333 was reconstructed as a state highway beginning in 1925. The highway north of Peach Blossom Creek and the portion between Almshouse Road and Trippe Creek were paved or repaved by 1927. MD 333 was completed when the highway was completed between Oxford and Almshouse Road by 1930. At the Easton end, MD 333 was extended south on Washington Street to the new eastern bypass of Easton in 1948 when the town was bypassed by US 213, which became US 50 in 1949. MD 333's northern terminus was returned to Washington Street when MD 565 was assigned to Washington Street in 1958. The bridges over Peach Blossom Creek and Trippe Creek were replaced in 1997 and 1998, respectively.

Dalla Costa served as the Bishop of Padua from 1923 until 1931 when he was transferred to Florence; he was elevated to the cardinalate on 13 March 1933. Dalla Costa was a staunch anti-fascist and anti- communist and was known best for providing refuge for Jewish people during World War II and providing others with fake documentation to flee from persecution. Dalla Costa was noted for his deep faith and holiness and became a revered figure in Florence. He was considered \\"papabile\\" in the conclave in 1939 since he was considered a pastoral and non-political prelate with a strong sense of faith. In 2012 the organization Yad Vashem named him as a \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" due to saving the lives of Jews during the Holocaust at great risk to himself. The cause for his beatification opened two decades after his death in 1981 and he was titled as a Servant of God; he was named as Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue. Life =Education and priesthood= Elia Dalla Costa was born in 1872 in Villaverla as the last of five children to Luigi Dalla Costa and Teresa Dal Balcon; the first three children the couple had all died as infants. Dalla Costa received his baptism as \\"Elia Angelo\\" on 23 June from Father Angelo Rossi and his godparents were Francesco Muraro di Bressanvido and Eugenia Dalla Costa. His mother died in 1877 when Dalla Costa was just five which left him in the care of his father. Dalla Costa completed his high school education in 1886 and set out to commence his ecclesial studies after this. He attended the seminaries in Vicenza and Padua (graduating in literature from the college in Padua) before being ordained to the priesthood in 1895. He underwent further studies in 1895 and finished that later in 1897 before doing pastoral work in Vicenza where he also taught. He served a brief stint as the parish priest at Villaverla as he substituted for an old and ailing pastor. He later served as the curate for Pievebelvicino and from 1902 until 1910 was the parish priest for Pozzoleone. On 10 November 1910 he was made the parish priest for Schio and remained there until 1922. Dalla Costa rendered humanitarian services to the wounded and assumed care for orphaned children throughout World War I and was later decorated with the Croce di Cavaliere della Corona d'Italia for his actions. It was while serving as a bishop in Padua that he would restore 50 parishes that were damaged during the war. =Episcopate= In mid-1923 he was appointed as the Bishop of Padua and he received his episcopal consecration on the following 12 August from Bishop Ferdinando Rodolfi in the Vicenza Cathedral with Bishops Andrea Longhin and Apollonio Maggio serving as the co- consecrators. He was enthroned in his new diocese on the following 7 October at an installation Mass. Dalla Costa was later named as the Archbishop of Florence on 19 December 1931 and for five months in 1932 served as the apostolic administrator for his old Padua diocese. He was enthroned in his new archdiocese in 1932. =Cardinalate= Pope Pius XI created Dalla Costa as the Cardinal-Priest of San Marco on 13 March 1933. He received the red hat and his titular church on 16 March. Dalla Costa was a staunch anti-communist and anti- fascist; when Adolf Hitler visited Florence in 1938 he took the dramatic decision (despite great external pressure) to close all the doors and windows of the episcopal palace and refused to participate in the celebrations. He railed against the Italian Racial Laws deeming them an affront to human rights and dignities. He was one of the cardinal electors in the 1939 papal conclave (at which he received some votes as he was also a \\"papabile\\" candidate) that selected Pope Pius XII. He was considered to be papabile due to his pastoral sensitivities and due to the fact that he was considered a non-political prelate. Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani - who had voted for Pacelli - said Dalla Costa would have been elected as pope if the cardinals had wanted \\"an angel\\" rather than a diplomat. There were some sources suggesting that Pacelli himself had voted for either Dalla Costa or Federico Tedeschini. But others suggested that his candidature did not gain traction since he was deemed too anti-fascist (which could have been problematic) and was deemed to be cold and aloof. During World War II and the Holocaust he became known for helping to save thousands of Italians from execution under the Fascist regime. He encouraged his priests to save Jewish people from persecution knowing all too well the fate that would befall them if arrested and deported. Dalla Costa organized an elaborate rescue network and also wrote to the heads of all the Florentine convents and monasteries asking them to shelter Jews to keep them safe. The cardinal also established a shelter for Jews within the Seminar Minore di Montughi and even sheltered some in the episcopal palace with him. Dalla Costa provided Jews with fake documents for them to flee and received these fake documents from one of the Franciscan monasteries in Assisi. But it soon became too dangerous to accept them from Assisi himself so decided that the Tour de France winner and famed athlete Gino Bartali (he presided over Bartali's 1940 wedding) could do so. Dalla Costa's rationale was that no soldier would dare stop Bartali from training when he was in fact delivering the fake documents. He had given safe haven to over 100 Italian Jews and 220 others from other countries. Dalla Costa was close friends with Giorgio La Pira and the two often dined together and had discussions about the issues of the times. It was Dalla Costa who encouraged La Pira to run in Florentine local elections in 1951. The cardinal held two Catechetical Conferences in the archdiocese in 1933 and in 1940 and held two Diocesan Eucharistic Conferences in 1937 and later in 1946. He made four pastoral visits while serving as the archbishop. In 1951 he offered his resignation to Pope Pius XII though the pope refused it. But a compromise was later reached in 1954: Ermenegildo Florit was made the coadjutor so that he could aid Dalla Costa in his episcopal duties as the aged prelate grew ill. He later participated in the 1958 conclave that resulted in the election of Pope John XXIII. Dalla Costa was close friends with Roncalli and met with him twice prior to the conclave to discuss it. It was alleged that Roncalli had either voted for Valerio Valeri or his friend Dalla Costa. Dalla Costa believed that Roncalli would make a good pope and confided as much to his old friend. But Roncalli objected that he was too old to serve at 76 though the aged cardinal was said to have replied: \\"That's ten years younger than me\\". He attended the coronation for the new pope on 4 November 1958 and returned to Florence that month where he said to people: \\"We have chosen a pope that you will like\\". It had been said that Dalla Costa voted for Roncalli in the conclave. Dalla Costa ordained the two future cardinals Domenico Bartolucci (1939) and Silvano Piovanelli (1947) as priests. =Death= Dalla Costa died from lung complications in Florence during the morning on 22 December 1961 and is buried in the Duomo di Firenze. He was the oldest member of the College of Cardinals at his death. Beatification process Tomb in the Florentine cathedral. The cause for Dalla Costa's canonization opened on 26 January 1981 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the edict of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against the cause) and titled him as a Servant of God. On 22 December 1981 the diocesan phase for the cause opened and closed sometime later. This investigation was held in the Florence archdiocese and the C.C.S. later validated this investigation on 19 November 1993 before receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2007. This dossier was an extensive collation of documents and testimonies collected throughout the diocesan process. The board of theologians assented to the continuation of the cause after investigating the dossier in their meeting held on 29 November 2016 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also approved it later on 2 May 2017. Dalla Costa was named as Venerable on 4 May 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late cardinal had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. Recognition In November 2012 it was announced that Dalla Costa had been named on the previous 29 February as a \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" after Yad Vashem in Jerusalem determined that he had done the most - at risk to himself - to save Jews from the horror of the Nazi Holocaust (or the Shoah) during the period before and during the war.

It is often considered to have been the first community-based bank in Canada. Founded and managed under the leadership of Father Georges-Antoine Belcourt (1803-1874), the Farmer's Bank of Rustico was established on April 21, 1863. The bank received Royal Assent for its act of incorporation at the Court of Windsor on April 7, 1864.\\"Judy K MacDonald. The restoration of the Farmers' Bank of Rustico, Newsletter of the Prince Edward Island Numismatic Association, May‚ÄìJune, 2001 The first president was farmer Jerome Doiron, and the first cashier was Marinus Blanchard, a local school teacher. The Farmers' Bank \\"was the precursor of the North American credit union movement through its influence upon the pioneer credit union organizer, Alphonse Desjardins of Quebec.\\"John T. Croteau, Dalhousie Review, Vol. 36, No. 2, Summer 1956 Like the later credit unions, the Farmers' Bank accepted deposits and provided loans, primarily for less than 1 year. It showed that villagers could successfully operate a financial institution without the assistance of banking experts. However, there are also important differences. The Bank issued its own currency and kept its working funds in specie. But it never built up a substantial reserve fund‚Äîpreferring to return most of its annual profits to shareholders as dividends. The Farmers' Bank was also one of the earliest manifestations of a strong movement of Acadian economic self-determination. Belcourt's innovative ideas also gave rise to dozens of seed grain banks in Acadian communities in the 1860s, including one in Egmont Bay that was a precursor to the later co-operative movement in the Evangeline region of the Island.Paul Wilkinson & Jack Quarter. Building a Community-Controlled Economy: The Evangeline Co-operative Experience. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1996, p. 21 The Bank also anticipated Mouvement des caisses populaires acadiennes, a 200,000 member network of credit unions in New Brunswick. As such, it played an important role in the development of the Acadian community in the Maritimes. In the view of MacDonald, \\"the steady availability of cheap credit for thirty years enabled the predominantly Acadian community to attain economic independence.\\"Judy K MacDonald. op. cit. However, the Canadian Bank Act of 1871 did not envision such small financial institutions, and the Farmers' Bank wound up its operations when its charter was not renewed in 1894.

They disbanded in 1984, but reunited briefly in the late 1980s, and again in 2007, and have been active since. History From a background working in English fringe theatre groups, Punishment Of Luxury formed in December of 1976, in Newcastle. Taking their name from an 1891 painting by Giovanni Segantini in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, the band consisted initially of Brian Bond (born Brian Rapkin - vocals), Neville Luxury (born Neville Atkinson - guitar, vocals), Red Helmet (guitar, vocals), Jimi Giro (bass guitar, vocals), and \\"Liquid\\" Les Denham (drums).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 122-3 They released a single, \\"Puppet Life\\" on the Small Wonder label in July 1978. In 1979 they signed to United Artists and released the singles \\"Engine Of Excess\\" with Mick Avery on drums, then with new drummer Steve Sekrit (born Steven Robson), made \\"Secrets\\", and the album Laughing Academy. In the summer of 1979 they played at the Reading Rock Festival after The Cure and before The Tourists and Mot√∂rhead. 1980 saw the release of the single \\"Laughing Academy\\". An extensive European tour followed and United Artists sent the band into the studio to record another album, a concept album to be called Gigantic Days. However while the recording was still going on, United Artists were taken over by EMI, who dropped the band. A final European tour was followed by Bond's departure. Neville, Sekrit and Giro recruited guitarist Tim Magenta to a new lineup, now going by the name Punilux. They released a further album on the Red Rhino label, 7 in 1983, with Magenta replaced by Rab Aitch, before Neville Luxury went solo, releasing the mini-album Feels Like Dancing Wartime in 1984. The album Gigantic Days was finally released, on CD, in 1998 by Overground Records. Reunion In 2007, they reunited and played a few songs for the bassist Jimi Giro's 50th birthday party. A little more than a year later they landed a gig at a small pub in Gateshead, in the north-east of England called The Three Tuns. The gig was considered a success and was written about in The Guardian newspaper. On 12 June 2009, they played at the Luminaire in Kilburn, North London. They have performed intermittently since. The band released a CD of new material, titled 5, in March/April 2012. A definitive, career-spanning, five-CD box set was released on 8 November 2019, called Puppet Life (The Complete Recordings).

For secondary education he attended Cranbrook School. Field replaced Chris Pokorny on bass guitar in a pop band, King Fox, which had formed in Sydney in 1967. He also provided vocals and guitar alongside Dave King on lead vocals, guitar and harmonica; Paul Radcliffe on flute, vocals, guitar and Mellotron; and Andy Evans on drums. They were later joined by Peter Muller on vocals, organ and piano. King Fox issued a four-track extended play, Unforgotten Dreams, on the Du Monde label in 1969 as well as a single, \\"I Think You're Fine\\", on Festival records in 1972. Field played in various pub bands in Sydney during the 1970s and, in 1979, he established his own recording studio, initially called Canteen Studios, in Woolloomooloo. It was later renamed, Paradise Studios, and was re-established in Gosford by November 2003.  1980s: Solo career  Field's first solo album, Bad Habits, was released in June 1981 via WEA in Australia and Europe and CBS in the United States.

Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' His next single from the same album, \\"You Weren't in Love with Me\\", was released in July 1981 and appeared at No. 1 in Australia, No. 22 in New Zealand, and No. 67 on the UK Singles Chart (in June 1982). The track was written by Field and has also been performed by Beccy Cole and Marina Prior. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' At the APRA Music Awards of 1982 Field won Most Performed Australasian Popular Work for that track. As singles, both the title track to the album and \\"You Weren't in Love With Me\\" were awarded gold discs in Australia for sales of over 50,000 copies. Kent Music Report, No 393, published 4 January 1982, which lists all singles and albums that reached gold or platinum status during 1981 According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"[Field] was one of the most popular acts on the Australian scene\\" in 1981, as a \\"husky voiced singer/piano player.\\" The Australian Women's Weeklys Susan Moore observed, \\"[his] music is conducive to a bright mood. He dared to be a little different and got away with it. His breezy, swing style of music is punctuated with refined blasts of orchestration.\\" Field's second album, Try Biology, appeared in 1982 and provided his third Australian hit single, \\"True Love\\", which reached No. 17. The album was also produced by Price. Lisa Perry of The Canberra Times caught his performance at Queanbeyan in September of that year, \\"he still has what it takes to entertain even the hardest of audiences. If you are in any way interested in some good jazz, interspersed with some driving rock and roll, you would have had to agree that [Field] is a unique talent.\\" Her newspaper colleague, Karen Milliner, described how the single did not reflect his style, \\"[it] is a commercial number which obviously has succeeded, but it's the only one of its ilk on the album. Apart from two slow songs on side two, the rest of the tracks have that jazz and big-band sound which Field loves ‚Äî lots of jazz piano, trumpets, trombones and sax... [his] gravel-edged throaty voice is ideally suited to jazz, and there's some great jazz piano and brass arrangements featured.\\" In November 1985 Field was guest lead vocalist for Warren Daly's band (ex-Daly- Wilson Big Band), The Canberra Times Michael Foster observed, \\"[Daly is] expected to put a tight and exciting band of accomplished musicians on the stage ... and the combination with [Field] makes the prospect even more fascinating... if Field decides to demonstrate, even beyond his undoubted ability as a composer, lyricist and singer, his skills on bass, piano, drums, guitar or woodwinds.\\" In 1989 he issued a third album, Say Yes, on the Agape label. It was produced by Field alone. The Canberra Times Kathryn Whitfield felt, \\"his voice is not one that you would describe as versatile, the music on this album does exhibit an interesting variety ranging from love ballads to the raunchy 'Blue Boogie'... This is a pleasant kind of easy-listening album, tailored for the AM radio market. It may put a smile on mum's face, but it will put the more nubile to sleep.\\" Paradise Studios has been used to record albums by Air Supply, Cold Chisel, INXS, Paul Kelly, Icehouse, the Models, Absent Friends, and the Angels. Field has worked as a record producer. Note: Some credits relate to a different Billy Field  2000s: Renewed interest  Interest in Field's music was re-generated in November 2004 after a contestant, Courtney Murphy, performed \\"You Weren't in Love with Me\\", on TV talent show, Australian Idol. One of the judges, Ian \\"Dicko\\" Dickson, indicated that he liked it but had not heard it before. Murphy was also a guest on ABC TV's Spicks and Specks, a celebrity pop music quiz program, in 2005 and revisited his performance. This interest led to the release of a compilation album, The Best of Billy Field: You Weren't in Love with Me (Aztec Music, 2005) on CD. Murphy's performance of the song is credited on the liner notes as the impetus for an increase in interest in the artist's back catalogue.

His work has been favourably compared to that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Helmut Rellergerd Helmut Rellergerd (born January 25, 1945 in Altena-Dahle, Sauerland) is a German writer, under the pseudonym of Jason Dark. Jason Dark is one of the most read authors in Germany in his genre.Helmut Rellergerd alias Jason Dark - Das Geheimnis von Geisterj√§ger John Sinclair FR-Online, 11. Juli 2013 Helmut Rellergerd was born in 1945 in Dahle, the Sauerland and grew up in Dortmund. He and wrote his first novel after he had finished school and the Bundeswehr. However, this debut release was rejected by the publishers. The first novel published at Bastei Publishing House was Im Kreuzfeuer des Todesdrachen in the crime series Cliff Corner. He wrote the 1973 novel Die Nacht des Hexers and created the fictional character John Sinclair. The Adventures of the English hero appear in the Bastei-Verlag in book and paperback form and developed from the 1970s to the most successful German horror series.Interview with Helmut Rellergerd/Jason Dark Since the 1980s the John Sinclair radio play Since the 1980s, runs the successful radio play runs.John Sinclair radio plays Many novels have been translated into other languages. Beyond the success of the John Sinclair series, Rellergerd invented other horror fiction series like Professor Zamorra and Damona King. Under the pseudonym Red Geller he wrote the youth book series Das Schlo√ü-Trio. Since 2006 he has written under his pseudonym for the Blanvalet Publishing House the crime fiction series Don Harris Psycho-Cop. Rellergerd lives in a district of Bergisch Gladbach.  John Sinclair  From 1973 onwards Jason Dark started publishing horror detective stories of the pulp fiction variety, centred on an English Scotland Yard inspector named John Sinclair. The latter's surname was inspired by the \\"Sinclair\\" character played by Roger Moore in the popular 1970s TV series, The Persuaders. The stories (usually of around 63 pages in length) have mostly been published as pulp magazines and have now reached the astonishing number of nearly 2,000 separate novels. The plots generally entail Inspector Sinclair's fighting against the forces of darkness (vampires, werewolves, sorcerers, zombies, etc.) and vanquishing them at the end of each tale. This positive disposition of the narratives has, Helmut Rellergerd believes, helped explain the popularity of the books, particularly amongst women, who (according to Rellergerd in a recorded radio interview) appear to number the most enthusiastic and largest group of his readers, not least because the stories are not excessively violent, but display a certain humanity. The name of \\"Jason Dark\\" has humorous origins: Rellergerd's wife had a particular dislike for the fictitious English private investigator, Jason King, of the TV series of that name, and as a slightly malicious joke, Rellergerd decided to give his central character precisely the name of \\"Jason\\". The surname, \\"Dark\\", suggested itself quite naturally, as his hero constantly does battle against dark forces. Jason Dark also writes other pulp fiction, focussing on his character \\"Psycho-Cop\\". He continues to write three or four novels a month and shows no sign of losing his inventive vigour‚Äîa creativity that borders on the realms of genius. While unlikely to merit the title of a \\"Dichter\\" (poet, or serious writer), he is perhaps best described in his own words as a \\"kreativer Beamte\\" (creative bureaucrat, clerk or civil servant), producing (on an old- fashioned manual typewriter) novel after novel for his employers, Bastei Verlag (Bastei Publishers). Jason Dark has become, and remains, a pulp-author phenomenon in what the Germans term \\"Trivialliteratur\\", but which less generous commentators might call \\"trash fiction\\". Yet despite the speed with which the novels are written, they are marked by a certain skill in construction, a richness of vocabulary, a facility for devising gripping plot lines, and an eloquence in style which make them of some literary interest in their specific field. Indeed, Jason Dark has been called a 'writer of genius' and a 'remarkable literary phenomenon' by literary scholar, Dr. Tony Page, who also points out how Dark has been favourably compared to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: 'Jason Dark‚Äôs imaginative powers have rightly been praised. Indeed, Godden writes: \\"‚ÄòAs regards imagination, Jason Dark towers houses high in superiority above Sherlock Holmes creator, Conon (sic!) Doyle.‚Äô (Godden, 207: 293). This is eminent praise indeed - and is justly bestowed'.Jason Dark: German Pulp Fiction Writer of Genius, Bangkok University, Executive Journal 2010, http://www.bu.ac.th/knowledgecenter/executive_journal/july_sep_10/pdf/aw33.pdf  Views on writing and politics  Helmut Rellergerd has claimed (in the same recorded interview alluded to above) that many people have found his novels to be psychologically and emotionally beneficial, particularly during times of illness (saying that they have contributed to the recovery process through John Sinclair's \\"optimistic attitude\\" to life). In this, one might link him to Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter, who specifically recommended his novel, Der Nachsommer, as a therapeutic tool for the overcoming of melancholia or depression. When asked in 2006 what caused him, the famed horror writer, the greatest fear and horror, he replied that it was George W. Bush's activities, particularly in Iraq: these called forth veritable goosebumps of fright upon his skin, he said.Radio interview with Helmut Rellergerd, 2006.

Development The BH-6 had wings of unequal span, but unusually, the top wing was the shorter of the two, and while it was braced to the bottom wing with a single I-strut on either side, these sloped inwards from bottom to top. Finally, the top wing was attached to the fuselage not by a set of cabane struts, but by a single large pylon.

Yonakor grew up in Boston, Massachusetts and played college football at the University of Notre Dame, where he was named an All-American on a team that won the national championship in 1943. After two years in the military during World War II, Yonakor was selected in the first round of the 1945 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He instead signed with the Browns of the upstart AAFC. Yonakor spent four seasons playing primarily as a defensive end for the Browns as the team won four league championships between 1946 and 1949. The Browns then sold Yonakor to the NFL's New York Yanks, where he played for a year. He then spent a season with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. Returning to the NFL in 1952, he played a final season for the Redskins before retiring. Yonakor worked in Cleveland's steel industry for several years after leaving pro football. He settled in Euclid, Ohio in the early 1960s and was an assembly- line worker making diesel engines for White Motor Company. His son Rich was a star athlete in Euclid and went on to play one season for the National Basketball Association's San Antonio Spurs. Yonakor died in 2001. Early life and high school Yonakor grew up in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from Lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was too embarrassed to tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened to the point where he could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941. College and military career At Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Yonakor played on the football team as an end beginning in 1942, when he was a sophomore. He was a starter at right end in 1943, when the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team won the national championship under Leahy. The highlight of his college career was catching two touchdown passes from quarterback Angelo Bertelli in a game against Army. Yonakor was known for his strength and large size. While watching track athletes practice at Notre Dame in 1943, he picked up a 16-pound shot putter's weight and returned it to the thrower. Impressed by the distance of the throw, the track coach got Yonakor to compete in the event, and two weeks later Yonakor won the Amateur Athletic Union indoor shot put national competition at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He was named an All-American by news outlets that year. Following the 1943 season, Yonakor spent two years in the U.S. Marines during World War II and played on military football teams. In 1944, he was selected to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players in the country. Professional career Creighton Miller, a teammate of Yonakor's at Notre Dame, took an assistant coaching position after the war with the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). While Yonakor selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 1945 NFL Draft, Miller convinced him to sign with the Browns instead. The Browns won the AAFC championship in each of the four years Yonakor played for the team between 1946 and 1949. He started out as primarily a pass-rushing defensive end in 1946, but was also used as an offensive end when receiver Dante Lavelli was injured in 1947. After watching one of the Browns' early games, Leahy said that the Browns were good, but \\"I don't understand why they don't throw more passes to Yonakor\\". He had just six receptions for 95 yards and two touchdowns in 1947, however, and was shifted back to working mostly on defense in 1948. Yonakor completed coursework at Notre Dame between seasons with the Browns and got his degree in 1948. Yonakor got into contractual disputes three times with Paul Brown, the Browns' head coach and general manager, and frequently held out for raises. His highest salary with the Browns was $9,500 in 1949. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed by the National Football League (NFL). Yonakor, however, was sold before the 1950 season to the NFL's New York Yanks. He played a season for the Yanks before signing with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in the summer of 1951. he played a final season for the NFL's Washington Redskins in 1952 before retiring. He was used by the Redskins as an end and a tackle. Later life Yonakor went back home to Boston after ending his football career and worked in several sales jobs he found unsatisfying. He planned to go to California to find work, but stopped off in Cleveland on the way to make some money for the journey onward. He worked briefly in the structural iron business before getting a job in 1956 at Republic Steel, then one of the country's largest producers of the metal. He was promoted in 1959 to superintendent of Republic's general labor department and oversaw more than 500 workers. He got married and settled down in Cleveland, attending Browns games as he worked at Republic. \\"I learned teamwork and got used to being around men and learning to get along with them,\\" he said in 1960. \\"Out here at Republic we operate on the same theory as the Browns ‚Äì all for one and one for all.\\" In 1961, Yonakor began working for the White Motor Company in Euclid, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland where he lived. He made diesel engines on an assembly line in a White Motors plant there. His son, Rich Yonakor, was a star athlete in Euclid who played basketball in Italy and one season for the San Antonio Spurs in the early 1980s. Yonakor died in Euclid in 2001.

Historically the marshlands, mainly composed of the separate but adjacent Central, Hawizeh and Hammar Marshes, used to be the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia. It is a rare aquatic landscape in the desert, providing habitat for the Marsh Arabs and important populations of wildlife. Draining of portions of the marshes began in the 1950s and continued through the 1970s to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. However, in the late 1980s and 1990s, during the presidency of Saddam Hussein, this work was expanded and accelerated to evict Shia Muslims from the marshes. Before 2003, the marshes were drained to 10% of their original size. After the fall of Hussein's regime in 2003, the marshes have partially recovered but drought along with upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria and Iran have hindered the process. Since 2016 the Mesopotamian marshes have been listed as an UNESCO Heritage Site. Geography Satellite image of the Mesopotamian Marshes, 2000‚Äì2009 Mesopotamian Marshes in 2007 As their name suggests, the Mesopotamian Marshes are located in the larger region which used to be called Mesopotamia. Modern day Mesopotamia is now occupied by Iraq, eastern Syria, south-eastern Turkey, and southwest Iran. The marshes lie mostly within southern Iraq and a portion of southwestern Iran. Originally covering an area of and divided into three major areas, the Central Marshes lie between the Tigris and Euphrates, while the Hammar Marshes lie south of the Euphrates and the Hawizeh Marshes are bound east of the Tigris. Before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, about 90% of the marshes had been drained. The marshes lie on a flat alluvial plain, as the Euphrates decreases only in elevation during its last while the Tigris falls . This delta provides an environment that allows the Tigris and Euphrates to meander, forming distributaries. The Euphrates has often terminated near Nasiriyah into the Hammar Marshes as its flow slows. The Tigris can distribute some of its flow into the Central and Hawizeh marshes as it slows near Amarah. Downstream of Amarah though, several of its tributaries originating in Iran allow the Tigris' flow to increase and maintain a steady course thereafter. The three marshes combined once provided an intertwined environment, particularly during periods of flooding as the rivers overflowed. =Central Marshes= The Central Marshes receive water from influxes of the Tigris's distributaries, namely the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir south of Amarah. The Tigris serves as the marshes' eastern boundary while the Euphrates serves as its southern boundary. Covering an area of , the marshes consist of reed beds and several permanent lakes including Umm al Binni lake. The Al-Zikri and Hawr Umm Al-Binni lakes are two of the notable lakes and are deep. =Hammar Marshes= The Hammar Marshes is primarily fed by the Euphrates and lies south of it with a western extent to Nasiriyah, eastern border of the Shatt al-Arab and southern extent of Basrah. Normally, the marshes are a area of permanent marsh and lake but during period of flooding can extend to . In periods of flooding, water from the Central Marsh, fed by the Tigris can overflow and supply the marshes with water. Hammar Lake is the largest water body within the marsh and has an area of by , with depths ranging between-. In the summer, large portion of the marshes' and lake's shore are exposed, revealing islands that are used for agriculture. =Hawizeh Marshes= The Hawizeh Marshes lie east of the Tigris and a portion lie in Iran. The Iranian side of the marshes, known as Hawr Al-Azim, is fed by the Karkheh River, while the Tigris distributaries Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla supply the Iraqi side, only with much less water than the Karkheh. During spring flooding, the Tigris may directly flow into the marshes. The marshes are drained by the Al-Kassarah. This river plays a critical role in maintaining the Al-Hawizeh marshes as a flow-through system and preventing it from becoming a closed saline basin. The marshes are from north to south and about from east to west, covering a total area of . Permanent portions of the marshes include the northern and central portion while the southern part is generally seasonal. Moderately dense vegetation can be found in the permanent areas along with large -deep lakes in the northern portions. As the Hawizeh Marshes fared the best during the draining, they can facilitate the reproduction of flora, fauna and other species in Central and Hammar marshes. Ecology The marshes constitute a flooded grasslands and savannas ecoregion, also known as the Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh. The seasonal and permanent marshlands are dominated by aquatic plants, including reeds (Phragmites australis), cattail rushes (Typha domingensis), and papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus). Riparian forests of poplar (mainly Populus euphratica), tamarisk (Tamarix pentandra and Tamarix meyeri), and willow (mainly Salix acmophylla) occur on islands and river banks.Naval Intelligence Division (2014) Iraq & The Persian Gulf. Routledge, Sep 3, 2014. The marshes are home to 40 species of bird and several species of fish. It demarcates a range limit for a number of bird species. Flamingos, pelicans and herons inhabit the marshes. The marshes were once home to a large number of birds and the stopover for many other migratory birds as they traveled from Siberia to Africa. At risk are 40% to 60% of the world's marbled teal population that live in the marshes, along with 90% of the world's population of Basra reed- warbler. Also at risk are the sacred ibis and African darter. A subspecies of the hooded crow known as the Mesopotamian crow is found in this part of southern Iraq.\\"Mespotamian Crow\\". kuwaitbirds.org, accessed 8 July 2020. Seven species are now extinct from the marshes, including the Indian crested porcupine, the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat and the marsh gray wolf. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.U.S. National Aeornautics and Space Administration. 2008 Considerable confusion has existed relating to the status of the Eurasian otter and the endemic maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter in the region, but recent surveys have confirmed that both still survive.Al-Sheikhly, O.F.; and Nader, I.A. (2013). The Status of the Iraq Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli Hayman 1956 and Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra Linnaeus 1758 in Iraq. IUCN Otter Spec. Group Bull. 30(1). Marsh Arabs The Marsh Arabs are the primary inhabitants of the Mesopotamian Marshes and are theorized by some to be the descendants of ancient Sumerians, as their civilization dates back 5000 years. They live in secluded villages of elaborate reed houses throughout the marshes, often only reached by boat. Fish, rice cultivation, water buffalo and other resources are also used in their daily lives. In the 1950s, there were an estimated 500,000 Marsh Arabs. This population shrank to about 20,000 following the draining and Saddam's violent reprisals, and between 80,000 and 120,000 fled to neighboring Iran. Following the 2003 Iraq invasion, Marsh Arabs have begun to return to the marshes. History In the 4th millennium BCE, the first literate societies emerged in Southern Mesopotamia, often referred to as the Cradle of Civilization, and the first cities and complex state bureaucracies were developed there during the Uruk period. Due to the geographical location and ecological factors of the Fertile Crescent, a crescent-shape fertile area running from the basins of the Nile in Egypt, northwards along the Mediterranean coast in Palestine and Israel, and southwards again along the Euphrates and the Tigris towards the Persian Gulf, civilizations were able to develop agricultural and technological programmes. The crucial trigger was the availability of wild edible plant species. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent because the area had a large quantity of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the marshes were the site of the state of Batihah founded by 'Imran ibn Shahin. =Draining and subsequent restoration efforts= 1994 map of the Mesopotamian Marshes with draining features The draining of Mesopotamian Marshes began in the 1950s with the Central Marshes and gradually accelerated as it affected the two other main marshes until early in the 21st century with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The draining of the marshes was intended at first to reclaim land for agriculture along with oil exploration but later served as a punishment for Shia Arabs in response to the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The draining of the marshes was largely due to dams, dykes and other diversion structures constructed into Iraq but were exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Syria and Turkey. While the British engineers worked with the Iraqi government, Frank Haigh developed the Haigh Report in 1951. His report recommended a complex of canals, sluices, and dykes on the lower portions of both the Tigris and Euphrates. These water control structures could be used to drain marshes therefore creating profitable farmland. In 1953, construction began on the Third River or Main Outfall Drain and later the Saddam River which would drain water from the Central Marsh under the Euphrates and through a canal eventually into the Persian Gulf. Work on the Third River and other draining projects, particularly for the Hawizeh Marsh, quickly progressed in the 1980s during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in order to afford Iraqis a tactical advantage in the marshes. Part of the Hammar Marshes was also drained in 1985 to clear area for oil exploration. After the 1991 Gulf War, Shia Muslims in southern Iraq rebelled against Saddam Hussein who in turned crushed the rebellion and further accelerated the draining of the Central and Hammar marshes in order to evict Shias that have taken refuge in the marshes. With the exception of the Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station, the Third River was completed in 1992 and two other canals were constructed south and nearly parallel to it. One, the Mother of Battles canal, was constructed to divert the flow of the Euphrates south below the Hammar Marsh. Second, the 240 km Loyalty to Leader Canal also known as the Basrah Sweetwater Canal, which originates in the lower Euphrates region, collected water from the terminus of the Gharraf River and diverted it under the Euphrates, away from the Central Marshes and below the Hammar Marshes towards Basrah. The Glory River was also constructed to divert water from the Tigris's southern-flowing distributaries east and parallel along the Tigris until they reached the Euphrates near its confluence with the Tigris at Qurna. By the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the marshes had lost 90% of their size from the previous decades. The Central and Hammar Marshes were nearly drained and only 35% of the Hawizeh Marshes remained. After the invasion, locals destroyed dikes. The combined efforts of the Iraq government, United Nations, U.S. agencies and record precipitation in Turkey helped begin a restoration of the marshes. As of late 2006, 58% of the original marshes had been reinundated. The Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station was completed in 2009, affording the Third River to be used for agricultural drainage. However, recent drought and continued upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria and Iran have reduced the marshes to around 30% of their original size by 2009. From a high of around 75% restored in 2008, the wetlands receded to 58% of their average pre-drained level by spring 2015. Meanwhile, as the water level fell, salinity increased to 15,000 parts per million in some areas, up from 300 to 500 ppm in the 1980s. \\"When the river water levels were high, the low-saline Tigris washed over the marshes, cleansed them, and pushed the salty residue into the saltier Euphrates, which flows along the western edge. But now the Tigris is so low that the Euphrates provides most of the water in the marshes.\\" See also * Battle of the Marshes * Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system * Shatt al-Arab * Geography of Iraq External links  Mesopotamian Marshes in Basra erea (VIDEO) * Saddam Hussein's Crimes of War * Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty References * U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 2008.

The original settlers were President John S. Higbee, and about 30 families or 150 persons that were sent from Salt Lake City to Provo by President Brigham Young. Several log houses were erected, surrounded by a palisade 20 by 40 rods in size (), with gates in the east and west ends, and a middle deck, for a cannon. The fort was first located west of town, but was moved to Sowiette Park in April, 1850.  Battle at Fort Utah  Fort Utah in 1849 In late 1849, tensions between Ute Indians and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah Valley escalated after a Church member killed a Ute known as Old Bishop, whom he accused of stealing his shirt.Peace and Violence among 19th-Century Latter-day Saints The Mormon and two associates then hid the victim's body in the Provo River. Details of the murder were likely withheld, at least initially, from Brigham Young and other Church leaders. Settlers at Fort Utah did, however, report other difficulties with the Indians, including the firing of weapons at settlers and the theft of livestock and crops. Brigham Young counseled patience, telling them to \\"stockade your fort, to attend to your own affairs and let the Indians take care of theirs.\\"Brigham Young letter to Isaac Higbee, Oct. 18, 1849, Brigham Young Office Files, Church History Library, Salt Lake City. Tensions mounted at Fort Utah after the Utes demanded that the settlers turn over the murderersPeace and Violence among 19th-Century Latter-day Saints because the settlers refused to turn over those involved in the murder of Old Bishop to the Utes or to pay reparations for his death. In the winter of 1849‚Äì1850, a measles epidemic spread from the Mormon settlers to the Ute camps, killing many Indians and heightening tensions. At a council of ecclesiastical leaders in Salt Lake City on January 31, 1850, the leader of Fort Utah reported that the Utes‚Äô actions and intentions were growing increasingly aggressive: \\"they say they mean to hunt our Cattle. & go & get the other Indians to kill us.\\"Historian‚Äôs Office General Church Minutes, Jan. 31, 1850, Church History Library, Salt Lake City. In response, Brigham Young authorized a campaign against the Utes An account of the dialogue of the January 31 meeting can be found in BYC, Microfilm reel 80, box 47, folder 6. Brigham Young is quoted as stating: \\"I say go [and] kill them. . . . Tell Dimick Huntington to go and kill them‚Äîalso Barney Ward‚Äîlet the women and children live if they behave themselves. . . . We have no peace until the men [are] killed off‚Äînever treat the Indian as your equal.\\" Wells's Special Order No. 2 can be found in the Utah State Archives, State Capitol, Salt Lake City, Utah Territorial Militia Correspondence, 1849‚Äì1863, ST-27, Microfilm reel 1, Document No. 5 telling them to kill all the men and take the women and children captive. On February 8, 1850, a militia from Salt Lake surrounded a group of around seventy people at Big Elk. After two days of fighting, the Utes surrendered. The army killed the men and sent the women and children up to Salt Lake as prisoners. A series of battles in February 1850 resulted in the deaths of dozens of Utes and one Mormon.D.

Contemporaneous sources indicate that the number of Indians who died was between 24 and 40, though a much later reminiscence places the death count among the Utes at around 100.

Christy Monuments and replica On August 30, 1937, a monument to commemorate the fort was dedicated at what was believed to be the original site of the 1849 structure. The monument was erected by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers with assistance from the Sons of the Utah Pioneers. Constructed with a concrete base and a center section of native stone, the monument was topped with cement molded into a fluted shape meant to reflect the fort's architecture. Also included in the monument's construction was a metal plaque with a history of the fort. Decades later, Provo City purchased the property surrounding the monument and with the help of the Utah Lake Lions Club began to develop a public park on the land, known as \\"Fort Utah Park.\\" A miniature replica of the 1849 fort was included as part of the park's initial construction. The replica included log construction, embrasures, a cannon situated on a raised center platform, and two block houses in opposite corners of the structure. The replica was completed in August 1972, in time to host that year's annual encampment of the Sons of the Utah Pioneers. Citing safety issues and lack of historical accuracy in the replica, the structure was demolished by Provo City in early 2017. In the late 1990s, a committee tasked with researching the original 1849 structure in preparation for Provo's sesquicentennial celebration determined that the location of the 1937 monument and 1972 fort replica was not at the fort's original site. Rather it was determined that the site of the fort was close where Interstate 15 crosses the Provo River, and that the freeway or a nearby mobile home park, was likely built directly over the location. Subsequently in 1999 the Provo Sesquicentennial Committee dedicated a new monument just east of Interstate 15 along the Provo River Parkway Trail. This new monument is meant to commemorate Fort Utah at a location closer to the site of the 1849 structure. The site of the 1850 fort is located at Provo's North Park, formerly known as Sowiette Park.

Plot  Ted frets about finding a date for his friends Claudia and Stuart's wedding; when Robin breaks up with Derek, Ted invites her to the wedding and she accepts. But when Ted runs into Claudia two days before the wedding and mentions that he is bringing a date, Claudia tells him that he indicated on his RSVP card that he would be coming alone and angrily forbids him from bringing a date. Ted tries to tell Robin that he will not be able to take her to the wedding, but chickens out when he sees Robin in the dress that she bought for the occasion. When he tells Lily his problem, she, against Marshall's advice, suggests that Ted appeal to Stuart, who gives Ted permission without a second thought. Ted is excitedly anticipating his romantic evening with Robin, when Claudia calls to say that the wedding has been canceled. Apparently the issue of Ted's date led to a huge argument and the couple broke up. Concerned about their friend and not wanting to disappoint Robin, who is really looking forward to the wedding, Marshall and Ted go to talk to Stuart and Lily goes to comfort Claudia at MacLaren's. Stuart tells Ted and Marshall that he is glad the wedding is off, and that he missed being single. Ted tries to reassure Stuart that everyone has doubts about commitment, but those doubts should not keep him from getting married; Marshall, however, tells Stuart that he should not marry Claudia unless he is absolutely sure that he wants to. Meanwhile, at MacLaren's, Barney finds Claudia waiting for Lily and immediately tries to seduce her, offering fake sympathy and alcohol. Lily pulls Barney away from Claudia and threatens him just as Stuart arrives with Ted and Marshall. Because of Marshall's words, Stuart apologizes to Claudia and they get back together. After a few more drinks, which were prompted by Ted for asking the question that caused this whole mess again, Claudia finally agrees to allow Ted to bring a date. On the night of the wedding Ted arrives at Robin's apartment to pick her up, but just before they leave Robin receives a phone call from her producer offering her the opportunity to anchor the news that evening. Though disappointed, Ted tells her to go to work. Ted goes to the wedding alone and Claudia shows him his RSVP, on which he did indeed check the \\"coming alone\\" box. Thinking the mistake reveals that he really has given up on finding someone, Ted tells Barney that he is ready to just be single; suddenly he locks eyes with a pretty woman across the room. Reception Victoria (Ashley Williams)'s first appearance on the show occurs at the end of the episode. Ted's first serious girlfriend on the show became popular with fans, defeating Robin Scherbatsky in a 2010 online poll held by the show to determine Ted's most popular ex-girlfriend.

Known as Easton Parkway, the highway runs on the west side of Easton between two junctions with U.S. Route 50 (US 50). MD 322 serves as a bypass of downtown Easton for traffic between US 50 and highways to western Talbot County, including MD 33 toward Saint Michaels and Tilghman Island and MD 333 toward Oxford. Easton Parkway was constructed in the mid to late 1960s. The state highway was originally designated as part of MD 33; MD 322 became the sole designation on the bypass in 1978. Route description MD 322 northbound at MD 33 in Easton MD 322 begins at a directional intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) south of Easton; there is no direct access from southbound MD 322 to westbound US 50\\\\. MD 322 heads north as a four-lane divided highway to MD 565 (Washington Street). Beyond this intersection, the state highway reduces to a two-lane undivided road, curves to the northwest, and crosses Paper Mill Pond. MD 332 parallels the pond through the highway's intersection with MD 333, which heads southwest as Oxford Road and northeast as Peach Blossom Road. After the pond turns west, the state highway intersects Port Street, which heads east toward downtown Easton as MD 334 and west as a county highway into the Easton Point industrial area. View south along MD 322 at Washington Street in Easton MD 322 temporarily expands to a four-lane undivided highway at its intersection with MD 33, which heads east as Bay Street toward downtown Easton and west as St. Michaels Road. The MD 322-MD 33 intersection lies on a crossing of Tanyard Creek just east of its confluence with an unnamed creek to form the North Fork of the Tred Avon River. MD 322 continues northeast past several shopping centers and industrial parks between MD 33 and Glebe Road. Near its northern terminus, the state highway meets the northern end of Washington Street and Airpark Drive, which immediately has an intersection with MD 662 (Centreville Road) before entering an industrial park adjacent to Easton Airport. MD 322 reaches its northern terminus at a directional intersection with US 50. MD 322 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History Easton Parkway was constructed as a way for traffic from Oxford and Saint Michaels to access points north and south via US 50 without having to travel through downtown Easton. The first section of the state highway was completed in 1965 from the present intersection with MD 33 north to US 50\\\\. MD 33 was removed from Bay Street and Washington Street north of downtown Easton and placed on the first section of Easton Parkway. The highway was extended south to MD 333 in 1966. The remainder of the highway south to US 50 was completed in 1970. The MD 322 designation was originally applied to the southern part of the parkway as well as Bay Street. MD 33 and MD 322 were reassigned to their present lengths of highway in 1978. Junction list Auxiliary routes *MD 322A is the designation for the unnamed ramp from eastbound US 50 to northbound MD 322 south of Easton. *MD 322B is the designation for the section of Airpark Drive between MD 322 and MD 662 north of Easton.

The bagel itself is usually made using a standard recipe; but instead of only one topping, it is topped with a mixture of several bagel toppings used in the bakery. Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, garlic flakes, pretzel salt, and pepper are all popular toppings that most vendors use on an everything bagel. The everything bagel inspired other bread creations with similar toppings, such as everything bagel chips, everything croissants, everything rolls, everything roti, everything fusilli, and everything hot dog buns. It is offered by many bakeries and fast casual restaurants.  Origin  Although the official origin of the everything bagel is disputed, David Gussin is typically credited for its invention sometime around 1980. Gussin allegedly developed the idea for the everything bagel one day while sweeping up leftover bagel toppings from the oven. Instead of disposing of the leftover toppings, Gussin claims to have saved them in a bin and convinced the store owner to make bagels with them. Gussin recognizes the possibility that others could have invented the famous bagel topping combination before him, however he is adamant that he was the first to coin the name \\"everything bagel\\".  Nutrition  The everything bagel typically contains anywhere from 210 to 280 calories per serving consisting almost entirely of carbohydrates. Everything bagels contain about 2 grams of fat consisting of mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. In addition, everything bagels are a source of iron and calcium. The amount of sugar in the everything bagel typically ranges from 4 grams to 9 grams.  Controversy  There are a number of people who have claimed to have invented the everything bagel including American restaurateur Joe Bastianich, American entrepreneur Seth Godin, and sports marketer Brandon Steiner. In his blog, Seth Godin claims that he invented the everything bagel in 1977, two years before Gussin, while working at a bagel factory. Though Godin's alleged everything bagel predates Gussin's bagel, Brandon Steiner claims to have invented it before anyone else. In 1973 Steiner was hired as a night baker at a local bakery. During one of his night shifts, he claims to have invented the first ever everything bagel. In a 2016 blog post, Steiner writes: > \\"One night I was screwing around with different combinations of toppings ‚Äì > sesame, salt, poppy, onion and garlic ‚Äì making braids, onion flats, and > other unorthodox concoctions. Then, after a while, I had the thought to > throw all the toppings on a bagel at once. That‚Äôs how I invented the > everything bagel. This was 1973; I was 14.\\" If Steiner's claim is true, then his everything bagel predates Gussin's everything bagel by 7 years and Godin's everything bagel by 4 years. Though the physical invention of the everything bagel is disputed, there is little to no evidence to support that anyone other than David Gussin coined the term \\"everything bagel\\".

As no signed works by the Kanbun Master are known to survive (or to have ever been made), he remains anonymous and known only by the pseudonym assigned him by scholar Richard Lane on account of his having flourished during the Kanbun era (1661‚Äì1673) on the Japanese Imperial calendar. The precise relationship between the Master and Moronobu is unclear, and there are a number of works attributed to each which may have actually been created by the other, or yet another artist. As so little is known about the Master, is it not even clear whether or not he had any direct relationship with Moronobu at all, or if the latter was simply influenced by the Master's work. In fact, scholars are not even sure whether the works attributed to the Kanbun Master were even by a single hand, or if they were created by a greater number of anonymous artists. Roughly fifty illustrated books are attributed to the Kanbun Master, including a number of shunga works, novels, guidebooks, poetry anthologies, j≈çruri plays, and courtesan critiques (y≈´jo hy≈çbanki). The Master also produced a number of paintings, and some of the first single-sheet (i.e. not bound into an illustrated book) woodblock printed images. The majority of these works were in the shunga (erotic pictures) mode, and all except the paintings were done in monochrome black ink, with a minimum of color added by hand. His style is described as \\"powerful, almost primitive, yet features a dramatic intensity of depiction that was to influence and sustain ukiyo-e for many decades to come.\\"Lane. p281. His chief influence was the genre painting popular at the time, consisting primarily of scenes of daily activities in Japan's major cities, particularly Kyoto and Edo.

Olaf Lange is best known for his symbolistic paintings and the multicolored aquatint etchings he made between 1903 and 1912, which are closely linked to the continental art nouveau style. The unique qualities of Lange's fin de si√®cle art are appreciated internationally. Among other prizes, Lange received a gold medal for graphics at the XI International Exhibition in Munich in 1913 and a Medal of Honor at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Early life Olaf Lange was born in Stavanger, Norway in 1875, the son of Emil Lange (1821-1904), a doctor, and Marie Helliesen (1840-1916). The Art Nouveau textile artist Frida Hansen was his cousin and among his relatives were the painter Kitty Lange Kielland and the author Alexander Lange Kielland. Lange started drawing and painting early in life, and among his teachers were both his cousin Frida Hansen (1855‚Äì1931) and Kitty L. Kielland (1843‚Äì1914). His teenage paintings and writings reveal Lange's lifelong interest in literature, including the works of Shakespeare and Goethe. Lange studied at the University of Kristiania (now Oslo) for two years (1895‚Äì1897) and during the same period he attended drawing classes at the Tegneskolen i Kristiania art school. Paris Olaf Lange studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris from 1897 until 1901,per A.J. school records where teachers were Jules Lefebvre and Tony Robert-Fleury. Living close to Montmartre, Lange experienced the fin-de-si√®cle modern life in Paris. He visited Normandy and Brittany to paint landscapes and the local people. His paintings from this period show an affinity to naturalism and social realism. Lange's painting T√®te d'infant was exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1901. Munich ‚Äì colour intaglio etchings After leaving Paris, Lange lived in Norway for two years, mostly in Kristiania (now Oslo). In 1903 he moved to Munich, spending his first two years in the Schwabing area of the city. During this period he made his first multicolored intaglio etchings. His nine etching motifs were made between in the period 1903 to 1912. Lange drew his inspiration from Arnold B√∂cklin, Frida Hansen, Gustav Klimt and Franz von Stuck, and from Italian frescoes and Japanese art. He also found inspiration in literature, including the works of Gustave Flaubert, Anatole France and Goethe. In 1905 Lange moved to Dachau and was based there until 1914, with a stay in Rome in 1909 and some trips back to Norway. Stavanger Art Museum has a complete collection of Lange's colour etchings, comprising: * Salammb√¥ (1905) * Herodias (1905) * Women Impailed on Butterflies (1905) * The Mermaid (1905) * The Queen of Sheba (1906) * Urvasi (1906) * The Cry / Revolution (1908) * The Martyr (1911) * Tang / Seaweed (1912) The First World War and after Lange moved to Copenhagen in 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, also spending time in Norway. Besides stops in Stavanger, he travelled to Ulvik, Hardanger and Sogn to paint mainly landscapes of the western fjords. During this period Lange also painted monumental tempera paintings, and a six meter long triptych called The 11,000 Virgins. Lange contracted tuberculosis and stayed in Copenhagen until the early 1920s. Olaf Lange recovered from the illness after a stay in Baden-Baden, in the fresh air of the Black Forest. He then moved back to Munich and started writing articles for newspapers in Norway and Sweden, besides painting. In his articles in the Stavanger Aftenblad newspaper he wrote about the tense situation building up in Munich during the leading up to the Second World War. In 1936 Lange stayed in Brixen in northern Italy. In 1943 he was expelled from Germany and travelled to Norway where he spent the rest of his life. During the war he lived in Tau, moving back to his hometown Stavanger when the war ended in 1945. Around 1950 Lange lived for some time in Stord. Olaf Lange left a great deal of his work to Stavanger Faste Galleri, now Stavanger Art Museum and to the British Museumcollection.britishmuseum.org Olaf Lange died in Stavanger in 1965.

Early life Jones was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina. By his marriage to Sarah Taylor, daughter of Brig. Gen. Joseph Pannell Taylor, he was an in-law of Zachary Taylor, the 12th US President, and a cousin of Jefferson Davis and Richard Taylor. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1846 and served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Civil War Jones was appointed a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on June 17, 1861, and major general on October 11, 1862. He commanded a brigade in Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard's Confederate Army of the Potomac at the First Battle of Bull Run and then a brigade in the division of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder in the Peninsula Campaign. In the Seven Days Battles, he temporarily led the division when Magruder served as a wing commander. When Magruder departed for the Western Theater in July, Jones got permanent command, leading his troops at Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam, in both cases under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet. At Antietam, his division held the right flank of the Army of Northern Virginia when the Union IX Corps attacked across the Burnside Bridge. The death of Jones' brother-in-law, Union colonel H.W. Kingsbury, in that fight, coupled with the strain of campaigning aggravated a longstanding heart condition and Jones died in Richmond, Virginia the following January. He is buried there in Hollywood Cemetery. After Jones died, his division was broken up and its brigades reassigned to McLaws' and Hood's divisions.

Gary Land incorrectly states Brinsmead's middle name is \\"David\\" (born 9 August 1933, in Victoria, Australia) is a formerly controversial figure within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1960s and 1970s who is known for his diverse theological journey. During the 1960s Brinsmead advocated a form of perfectionism which he described as the \\"[Sanctuary] Awakening\\" message. During the 1970s after examining the controversies of the Protestant Reformation and the writings of Adventist church co-founder and author Ellen G. White, he abandoned this position and went back to the 16th-century Protestant principle of justification by faith alone. His representation of justification by grace through faith alone was substantially from the writings and thinking of Martin Luther. He founded the magazine Present Truth, whose name was later changed to Verdict. In the late 1970s, he again underwent another theological shift and changed his focus from a call to return to Reformation principles to that of systematically questioning and discarding many of the doctrines he had held. A side effect of this activity was the commissioning of an independent study and report on the basis for Christian beliefs on final punishment or hell by Edward Fudge. Brinsmead's Verdict Publications published the first edition of the resulting book The Fire That Consumes subtitled A Biblical and Historical Study of Final Punishment. The book became a major catalyst in the broader Christian evangelical world for a growing acceptance of annihilationism. In the early 1980s Brinsmead's theology shifted to liberal Christianity, and he now rejected the Adventist belief in the Sabbath. He abandoned his belief in many orthodox Christian teachings, including justification through faith in Christ and the divinity of Christ, seeing God's interaction with mankind as not being limited to just the history of the Bible, but as an ongoing and continuous interaction with humanity towards a positive future. In the 1990s he turned from his theological focus, and shifted his attention to politics and his tropical fruit theme park, Tropical Fruit World.  Brinsmead and church tension  There was tension in the 1960s within the Adventist church surrounding Brinsmead's message and influence, but Brinsmead's active promotion of his shifting views 1970s, and 1980s led to fading influence, and saw the rise of Desmond Ford who opposed his perfectionist views. Richard Schwarz wrote in 1979, \\"Although there had been dissident groups in the church from its start, none was more troublesome to Adventist leaders than [Brinsmead's]\\". (This was eclipsed by the controversy and dismissal of Desmond Ford the following year.) According to Larry Pahl, \\"The name of Robert D. Brinsmead was once capable of evoking strong emotion and division in the Adventist circles brave and informed enough to discuss his controversial ideas.\\"Where is Robert Brinsmead? by Larry Pahl; Adventist Today 7:3 (May/June 1999) His lessened influenced is seen in the writings of the Standish brothers, \\"In the 1980s it is difficult to believe the emotive reaction which the name Brinsmead conjured up in the minds of the majority of Seventh-day Adventists in Australia two decades earlier. To have the name Brinsmead associated with a church member was akin to being termed 'pink' in the McCarthy era in the United States\\"Russell and Colin Standish, The Gathering Storm and the Storm Burst. Hartland Publications, p.41‚Äì42 (in other words, akin to being termed pseudo-\\"Communist\\" in an era of Communist paranoia)! His influence was described as \\"The Brinsmead Agitation\\" by the Biblical Research Committee, a precursor to the Biblical Research Institute. Claims of collusion with Brinsmead could have devastating impact, according to the testimony of Desmond Ford. According to one report, towards the close of the Glacier View meeting, \\"a small group of church executives\\" confronted Ford with ultimatums such as \\"Publicly denounce Robert Brinsmead as a troublemaker and heretic or hand in your credentials.\\"Report: Sydney Australia Adventist Forum Remembers Glacier View Twenty-Five Years Later by Dr. Milton Hook, former president of Sydney Adventist Forum, 16 January 2006 Ford would not do so, since Brinsmead had converted from his perfectionist views. According to a reported view of Ford, \\"John Brinsmead, brother of Robert, had evidently spun Parmenter the allegation that Ford and Robert Brinsmead were in cahoots and were determined to bring the SDA church down.\\" Apparently he accepted this \\"allegation without verification.\\" Arthur Patrick described a South New Zealand minister in 1961, who integrated a man known to have a connection with Brinsmead into his church and was asked to affirm the statement, \\"Robert Brinsmead is of the devil,\\" to demonstrate his loyalty. When he refused to do so, he was given 10 months leave-of-absence.\\"The Questions on Doctrine Event: Contrasting Perceptions, Their Impact and Potential\\" by Arthur Patrick One source describes him as \\"intense and driven.\\" In 1999 Raymond Cottrell observed: \\"Robert Brinsmead‚Äôs repeated and mutually contradictory positions over the years, together with his dogmatic public insistence on each of them successively, is clear evidence of immaturity. One cannot help but wonder if the present one is final, or if it is‚Äîlike the others‚Äîephemeral and will be followed by others.\\"  Biography  = Childhood = Brinsmead was born in 1933 in Australia, the youngest of eight children (another died in infancy) to Cedric John Brinsmead (1886‚Äì1980) and Laura Elsie Goullet (1889‚Äì1979).Brinsmead family tree: Descendants of Cedric John Brinsmead. Personal page of Cedric John Brinsmead. Personal page of Laura Elsie Goullet He grew up in the Tweed area.History of Tropical Fruit World During his early childhood his parents were a part of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, a German splinter group that broke away from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the World War I era over military service and conscription. They rejoined the mainstream church when he was 10. According to Schwarz, this background gave him a disposition that was skeptical towards church leadership;Richard Schwarz, Light Bearers to the Remnant. Philip W. Dunham repeats this assertion in Blinded by the Light: The Anatomy of Apostasy with Maylan Schurch. Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2001, p38 although this assertion was removed when Floyd Greenleaf revised Schwarz' work.Schwarz and Greenleaf, Light Bearers As a youth he ran a large family banana plantation (near the location of what would become the tropical fruit theme park), and later sugar cane and banana plantations deep in the Queensland jungle. He spent his personal time doing study and research into theology. = Avondale College (late 1950s) = Brinsmead enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts in theology at Avondale College in 1955 when he was in his mid-twenties. One of his older brothers, John, also enrolled at the college in this year. Robert developed a form of perfectionism after reading the writings of A. T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner\\"Brinsmead, Robert David (1933- )\\" in Gary Land, Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists, p.47 (of 1888 Minneapolis General Conference Session fame). His final year was 1958.\\"Editorial Introduction\\" by Robert Brinsmead. Present Truth Magazine' Volume 36 While still a student, Brinsmead was disfellowshipped from the church in 1961 for his writings on \\"perfectionism\\", which would be his theme for the 1960s. Brinsmead wrote he \\"retained lay membership in the church until 1962.\\" However he would remain closely involved with the church for another two decades. John was also disfellowshipped, and together they formed the \\"Sanctuary Awakening Fellowship\\". While it was based in the United States, it also influenced Africa and Asia. = Perfectionist era (1960s) = Brinsmead's early views were a fanatical expression of \\"historic Adventism\\". His primary opponents were his friend and former classmate Desmond Ford, for sixteen years head of the Department of Religion at Avondale College, Hans LaRondelle of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University, and Edward Heppenstall,.The Shaking of Adventism In the 1960s he advocated a form of perfectionism which he described as the \\"Sanctuary Awakening\\" or \\"Awakening\\" message. The \\"sanctuary\\" element referred to the distinctive Seventh-day Adventist theological understanding of events believed to have begun in the year 1844 in a heavenly sanctuary, of which the earthly sanctuary in the Old Testament was understood to be a figure and \\"type\\". Brinsmead believed that after Jesus concluded his mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary with the \\"blotting out of sins,\\" a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit would perfect and seal believers and render them sinless. Thus he taught a physical transformation of living believers at the end of earth's history, distinct from the moment at the Second Coming of the physical change to immortality described in 1 Corinthians 15 and believed by many Christians. Brinsmead claimed he was led to this position by the pre-advent judgment in Seventh-day Adventist eschatology. He also claimed it was a thoroughly evangelical concept of justification ‚Äì \\"I taught sanctification by atonement, not by attainment.\\" Brinsmead visited the United States throughout the 1960s, holding retreats and seminars to teach his message. The resulting Awakening movement had its own campmeetings, publications and songbook, and the controversy led to Adventist members in Australia and the United States being disfellowshipped. The church in North America became aware of Brinsmead during the early spring of 1961, when he submitted several documents to the General Conference. Raymond Cottrell was asked to evaluate them, presenting critiques of each document about three weeks later, writing that he gave each one \\"careful consideration\\" with a desire to be completely objective (note: more recently Cottrell has criticized the investigative judgment and other Adventist doctrines). A few weeks later Robert and John came to the General Conference offices and requested a hearing, and a committee which included Cottrell met the brothers. The meeting had a \\"cordial atmosphere\\", spent mainly listening to the Brinsmeads express their views, and the groups \\"parted as friends.\\" According to Gary Land, in 1968 the brothers started Present Truth Magazine. However the first edition is dated April 1972. = Evangelical era (1970s) = In the early 1970s, he abandoned this position, and went back to a view more in line with the Protestant Reformer Martin Luther and Luther's understanding of the New Testament gospel message of Paul the Apostle. Desmond Ford convinced him that his perfectionism was incorrect in about 1970.\\"Righteousness by Faith\\" entry in Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists by Gary Land Adventist eschatology was relegated to the background. Brinsmead reversed his ideas on the nature of Christ and perfection, and now believed \\"righteousness by faith\\" was entirely justification by faith. Largely due to the impact of Desmond Ford, Robert embraced righteousness by faith in the mid-1970s, rejecting perfectionism. He began to target Present Truth at Adventists and also other Christians, with a more evangelical message, and a central focus on the Protestant principle of justification by faith alone. A survey of issues of Present Truth throughout the 1970sAn archive of magazine issues in both HTML and PDF format is kept independently at: indicated that he studied a wide range of 16th-century Protestant Reformation scholars, including John Calvin, Philipp Melanchthon, and Martin Chemnitz. Brinsmead wrote A Review of the Awakening Message (Part I first published May 1972, and Part II first published April 1973), which was his own assessment of his earlier \\"historic\\" views. Brinsmead now found himself in substantial agreement with Desmond Ford, as Brinsmead's views on perfection had shifted away from what he had held. In 1972, Brinsmead and his wife Valorie (born 1939, originally from Cootamundra, NSW) purchased the property which they developed into \\"Tropical Fruit World\\" in northern New South Wales. = Rejection of Adventism and Evangelical Christianity (Late 1970s and 1980s) = In the late 1970s Brinsmead began to be influenced by Desmond Ford, and systematically re-examine, and gave up many of his prior beliefs. He rejected the roots of the Adventist movement and its prophetic interpretations, the doctrine of the heavenly sanctuary, and the inspiration of Ellen White, and the Sabbath. His hesitation on discarding Adventist views on death and the afterlife caused him to commission independent research by Edward Fudge that eventually resulted in Fudge's influential book The Fire That Consumes: A Biblical and Historical Study of Final Punishment, which Brinsmead published in 1982. Brinsmead changed the name of Present Truth to Verdict in 1978. The controversy resulting from his publication in July 1979 of his \\"1844\\" Re-Examined Syllabus, Preserved in HTML format at Ford's October 1979 response to it, and the alarmed reaction of church administrators saw some depart from the church over the issues that were raised. In June 1981 he published an issue of Verdict titled Sabbatarianism Re-ExaminedPreserved in HTML format in several places on the web, including: in which he rejected the Sabbath. In 1983 he published a special issue of Verdict titled Justification by Faith Re-Examined. Afterwards, Verdict quickly became a much smaller publication of newsletter size in which Brinsmead began to explore theological topics of more interest to liberal Christianity, before ceasing publication as a regular periodical altogether as he abandoned more orthodox Christian doctrines. = Change of interests (1990s) = During the 1990s Brinsmead did not write anything about theology for almost ten years. Raymond Cottrell wrote in 1999 that Brinsmead \\"seems to be immune to further rational dialogue\\", and that he \\"felt constrained to let him go his own way and do his own thing\\". Brinsmead developed a sort of humanist emphasis. According to Larry Pahl, \\"Brinsmead's journey has led him back, full circle, to raw perfectionism. The new Brinsmead requires that we become 'forgiving, caring and compassionate, doing the right thing', certainly the marks of a perfect man.\\" = Recent views (2000s) = Brinsmead emphasizes the human side in ecology. On 7 August 2007, Robert Brinsmead's wife Valorie died at age 68.Sad News: Valorie Brinsmead 1939‚Äì2007 by Brinsmead, 8 August 2007 Brinsmead has published his more recent views on a personal website, www.bobbrinsmead.com.

Trahair, Utopias and Utopians: An Historical Dictionary (Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1999), pp. 442‚Äì43 Philalethes was designed to serve the needs of those in search of deeper insight into the history, rituals and symbolism of Freemasonry. Publications In the Society's early days, all of its publications appeared in other, established Masonic periodicals‚Äîmany of which were edited by Fellows of the Society. There was no separate Philalethes journal. Soon, the hardships of the Great Depression and World War II caused nearly all Masonic periodicals to cease publication. After the war ended, and paper rationing was lifted, the Philalethes Society was able to release the first issue of Philalethes. The first issue, dated March, 1946, was edited by Walter A. Quincke. Philalethes: The Review of Masonic Research and Letters has long served as the de facto magazine for North American Freemasonry. The journal features original research, Masonic education articles, book reviews, art and poetry by new and established Masonic writers. At the present time, the journal is published quarterly. Origin of the name The Greek word œÜŒπŒªŒ±ŒªŒÆŒ∏Œ∑œÇ (pronounced \\"fill- a-LAY-thayss\\") was used by ancient writers such as Aristotle and Plutarch, and means \\"a lover of truth.\\"H.G. Liddell & R. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 1924, p. 1931 One of the early uses of the word was as part of a \\"nome de plume\\" of Eirenaeus Philalethes (the peaceful lover of truth) who was a 17th-century alchemist and the author of many influential works. The word came into Masonic circles through alchemical mystic Robert Samber (1682‚Äì1745), who used the pseudonym Eugenius Philalethes; Samber's use, in turn, was an homage to Thomas Vaughan, an earlier alchemist who had used the same name. Finally, a Rite of Philal√©thes was founded in Paris in 1772, devoted to the study of esotericism.Kenneth Mackenzie, The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia (London: J.W.

He was also Australia's first environment minister. In his obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald, he was described as \\"a visionary, one of the first to realize what would become vital issues in Australia: the potential of water resources and the limited capacity of the environment to sustain abuse.\\"Malcolm Brown, The Sydney Morning Herald, 16 June 2006 Known as the 'Water Man,' he was quoted as saying: > \\"Australia is the lowest, flattest, hottest and driest continent on the > earth and we have to manage it accordingly.\\"Speech by Ian Armstrong New > South Wales Legislative Assembly proceedings, 19 September 2006 Most of Australia's rivers flow relatively short distances to the sea. As early as 1963, Jack Beale called for water from Australia's rivers to be diverted to the arid inland.John Benson, The Sydney Morning Herald, 15 April 2007 Early life and education Jack Beale was born in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, on 17 July 1917, the second child of Rupert Noel Beale, a stock and station agent whose business failed in a drought. His mother was Esther Anderina Green from New Zealand. He attended state schools in rural Scone and the industrial city of Newcastle, and earned an honors diploma in mechanical engineering from Sydney Technical College. He joined the New South Wales Department of Public Works in 1936, where he saw the irrigation and energy potential of the state's rivers and developed a passion which was to last a lifetime for water conservation and irrigation. At age 48 he earned a Masters of Engineering degree from the University of New South Wales with a thesis on water irrigation efficiency. Political career Jack Beale's father Rupert was elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the New South Wales state parliament in 1941. After Rupert Beale's death in 1942, Jack Beale ran in the by-election for his father's electorate, South Coast, winning as an independent and becoming at the age of 25 the youngest member of the NSW parliament. He served in parliament for 31 years and won three elections as an independent and 8 as a member of the Liberal Party. He was an independent or in opposition for 22 consecutive years of his parliamentary career, and was a cabinet minister in the Askin government for the last nine 9 years. When Askin became Premier in 1965, he offered Jack Beale the Minister of Public Works portfolio,Speech by Andrew Constance, New South Wales Legislative Assembly proceedings, 19 September 2006 which ranked fifth in state protocol. He declined the position and asked for the Minister for Conservation portfolio, which ranked thirteenth, but which was responsible for the state's water, soil and forests and which interested him more. He embarked on a program to develop the state's water resources, initiating comprehensive river valley surveys and an infrastructure program constructing new dams and weirs. While his primary motivation was to support farmers, he also directed water releases from state dams to preserve the ecology of the Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve. 1n 1971 he became NSW Minister for Environmental Control and was Australia's first environment minister. He established the state's Pollution Control Commission, which later became the Environmental Protection Authority.Speech by Andrew Humpherson, New South Wales Legislative Assembly proceedings, 19 September 2006 Making issues such as the water quality of Sydney Harbor a priority, he sponsored early legislation relating to clean air, clean water, air pollution control and waste disposal. He was also Minister assisting the Premier and Treasurer and participated in negotiations with the federal government on revenue sharing. After falling out with Askin, he resigned from parliament in October 1973, one month before a state election. The Liberal Party lost the seat. Post‚Äìpolitical career =In business= After working as a cadet engineer at the NSW Public Works department, Jack Beale worked as an engineer at Shell Australia and later as a consulting engineer. An energetic man who found life as a parliamentary backbencher too quiet, he started during his parliamentary career over 20 small businesses, including Springs Pty. Ltd. which manufactured springs and paperclips and Rain Spray Sprinklers Pty. Ltd. which manufactured irrigation equipment. He also served as non-executive chairman of Talcott Factors Limited, a listed finance company. When he became a cabinet minister he was forced to give up his business interests but after leaving politics he plunged back into his irrigation business, which he later sold it to James Hardie Limited. He also initiated the private power industry in New South Wales. Starting in 1987, in his 70s, he proposed first to the Unsworth and then the Greiner governments that he develop privately owned and operated hydroelectric power stations at 13 state dams. After fighting bureaucratic opposition and the entrenched interest of the monopoly Electricity Commission, he eventually won a public tender to establish power stations at three dams, Burrendong, Copeton and Glenbawn (near Scone where he had lived as a child). He produced his first electricity in 1995 when he was 78. =In non‚Äìprofit activities= In 1955, Jack Beale founded the Water Research Foundation of Australia to fund research into the development and control of Australia's water resources, and was its chairman for 30 years. From 1974 to 1977 he was an adviser to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and undertook advisory missions to Thailand, Venezuela, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. He was a delegate to the Water for Peace Conference in Washington in 1967 and to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972.

The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains. The Gaussian network model is a minimalist, coarse-grained approach to study biological molecules. In the model, proteins are represented by nodes corresponding to Œ±-carbons of the amino acid residues. Similarly, DNA and RNA structures are represented with one to three nodes for each nucleotide. The model uses the harmonic approximation to model interactions. This coarse-grained representation makes the calculations computationally inexpensive. At the molecular level, many biological phenomena, such as catalytic activity of an enzyme, occur within the range of nano- to millisecond timescales. All atom simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics simulations, rarely reach microsecond trajectory length, depending on the size of the system and accessible computational resources. Normal mode analysis in the context of GNM, or elastic network (EN) models in general, provides insights on the longer-scale functional dynamic behaviors of macromolecules. Here, the model captures native state functional motions of a biomolecule at the cost of atomic detail. The inference obtained from this model is complementary to atomic detail simulation techniques. Another model for protein dynamics based on elastic mass-and-spring networks is the Anisotropic Network Model.  Gaussian network model theory  400px The Gaussian network model was proposed by Bahar, Atilgan, Haliloglu and Erman in 1997. The GNM is often analyzed using normal mode analysis, which offers an analytical formulation and unique solution for each structure. The GNM normal mode analysis differs from other normal mode analyses in that it is exclusively based on inter-residue contact topology, influenced by the theory of elasticity of Flory and the Rouse model and does not take the three- dimensional directionality of motions into account. = Representation of structure as an elastic network = Figure 2 shows a schematic view of elastic network studied in GNM. Metal beads represent the nodes in this Gaussian network (residues of a protein) and springs represent the connections between the nodes (covalent and non-covalent interactions between residues). For nodes i and j, equilibrium position vectors, R0i and R0j, equilibrium distance vector, R0ij, instantaneous fluctuation vectors, ŒîRi and ŒîRj, and instantaneous distance vector, Rij, are shown in Figure 2. Instantaneous position vectors of these nodes are defined by Ri and Rj. The difference between equilibrium position vector and instantaneous position vector of residue i gives the instantaneous fluctuation vector, ŒîRi = Ri \\\\- R0i. Hence, the instantaneous fluctuation vector between nodes i and j is expressed as ŒîRij = ŒîRj \\\\- ŒîRi = Rij \\\\- R0ij. = Potential of the Gaussian network = The potential energy of the network in terms of ŒîRi is :V_{GNM} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}\\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i,j}^{N} (\\\\Delta R_j-\\\\Delta R_i)^2 \\\\right]= \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}\\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i,j}^{N} \\\\Delta R_i \\\\Gamma_{ij} \\\\Delta R_j\\\\right] where Œ≥ is a force constant uniform for all springs and Œìij is the ijth element of the Kirchhoff (or connectivity) matrix of inter-residue contacts, Œì, defined by :\\\\Gamma_{ij} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} -1, & \\\\mbox{if } i e j & \\\\mbox{and }R_{ij} \\\\le r_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if } i e j & \\\\mbox{and }R_{ij} > r_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sum_{j,j e i}^{N} \\\\Gamma_{ij}, & \\\\mbox{if } i = j \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. rc is a cutoff distance for spatial interactions and taken to be 7 √Ö for amino acid pairs (represented by their Œ±-carbons). Expressing the X, Y and Z components of the fluctuation vectors ŒîRi as ŒîXT = [ŒîX1 ŒîX2 ..... ŒîXN], ŒîYT = [ŒîY1 ŒîY2 ..... ŒîYN], and ŒîZT = [ŒîZ1 ŒîZ2 ..... ŒîZN], above equation simplifies to :V_{GNM} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} [\\\\Delta X^T\\\\Gamma \\\\Delta X + \\\\Delta Y^T\\\\Gamma \\\\Delta Y + \\\\Delta Z^T\\\\Gamma \\\\Delta Z] = Statistical mechanics foundations = In the GNM, the probability distribution of all fluctuations, P(ŒîR) is isotropic :P(\\\\Delta R)=P(\\\\Delta X,\\\\Delta Y,\\\\Delta Z)=p(\\\\Delta X)p(\\\\Delta Y)p(\\\\Delta Z) and Gaussian :p(\\\\Delta X)\\\\propto \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2 k_B T} \\\\Delta X^T\\\\Gamma \\\\Delta X \\\\right\\\\\\\\}=\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\Delta X^T\\\\left( \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\Delta X \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. p(ŒîY) and p(ŒîZ) are expressed similarly. N-dimensional Gaussian probability density function with random variable vector x, mean vector Œº and covariance matrix Œ£ is :W(x,\\\\mu ,\\\\Sigma ) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi)^N \\\\Sigma}} \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{2} (x - \\\\mu)^T \\\\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\\\mu) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi)^N \\\\Sigma} normalizes the distribution and Œ£ is the determinant of the covariance matrix. Similar to Gaussian distribution, normalized distribution for ŒîXT = [ŒîX1 ŒîX2 ..... ŒîXN] around the equilibrium positions can be expressed as :p(\\\\Delta X ) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi)^N \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1}}} \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\Delta X^T\\\\left( \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\Delta X \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} The normalization constant, also the partition function ZX, is given by :Z_X = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\Delta X^T\\\\left( \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\Delta X \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}d\\\\Delta X where \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1} is the covariance matrix in this case. ZY and ZZ are expressed similarly. This formulation requires inversion of the Kirchhoff matrix. In the GNM, the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix is zero, hence calculation of its inverse requires eigenvalue decomposition. Œì‚àí1 is constructed using the N-1 non-zero eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors. Expressions for p(ŒîY) and p(ŒîZ) are similar to that of p(ŒîX). The probability distribution of all fluctuations in GNM becomes :P(\\\\Delta R) = p(\\\\Delta X) p(\\\\Delta Y) p(\\\\Delta Z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi)^{3N}  \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1}^3}} \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\left(\\\\Delta X^T\\\\left( \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\Delta X \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} For this mass and spring system, the normalization constant in the preceding expression is the overall GNM partition function, ZGNM, :Z_{GNM}=Z_X Z_Y Z_Z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi)^{3N}  \\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma} \\\\Gamma^{-1}^3}} = Expectation values of fluctuations and correlations = The expectation values of residue fluctuations, <ŒîRi2> (also called mean-square fluctuations, MSFs), and their cross-correlations, <ŒîRi ¬∑ ŒîRj> can be organized as the diagonal and off-diagonal terms, respectively, of a covariance matrix. Based on statistical mechanics, the covariance matrix for ŒîX is given by :<\\\\Delta X \\\\cdot \\\\Delta X^T > = \\\\int \\\\Delta X \\\\cdot \\\\Delta X^T p(\\\\Delta X)d\\\\Delta X=\\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Gamma^{-1} The last equality is obtained by inserting the above p(ŒîX) and taking the (generalized Gaussian) integral. Since, :<\\\\Delta X \\\\cdot \\\\Delta X^T > = <\\\\Delta Y \\\\cdot \\\\Delta Y^T > = <\\\\Delta Z \\\\cdot \\\\Delta Z^T > =\\\\frac{1}{3} <\\\\Delta R \\\\cdot \\\\Delta R^T > <ŒîRi2> and <ŒîRi ¬∑ ŒîRj> follows :<\\\\Delta R_i^2 > = \\\\frac{3 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}(\\\\Gamma^{-1})_{ii} :<\\\\Delta R_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta R_j > = \\\\frac{3 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}(\\\\Gamma^{-1})_{ij} = Mode decomposition = The GNM normal modes are found by diagonalization of the Kirchhoff matrix, Œì = UŒõUT. Here, U is a unitary matrix, UT = U‚àí1, of the eigenvectors ui of Œì and Œõ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues Œªi. The frequency and shape of a mode is represented by its eigenvalue and eigenvector, respectively. Since the Kirchhoff matrix is positive semi-definite, the first eigenvalue, Œª1, is zero and the corresponding eigenvector have all its elements equal to 1/. This shows that the network model translationally invariant. Cross-correlations between residue fluctuations can be written as a sum over the N-1 nonzero modes as :<\\\\Delta R_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta R_j> = \\\\frac{3 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}[U\\\\Lambda^{-1}U^T]_{ij}=\\\\frac{3 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\\\\lambda_k^{-1} [u_k u_k^T]_{ij} It follows that, [ŒîRi ¬∑ ŒîRj], the contribution of an individual mode is expressed as :[\\\\Delta R_i \\\\cdot \\\\Delta R_j]_k = \\\\frac{3 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}\\\\lambda_k^{-1} [u_k]_i [u_k]_j where [uk]i is the ith element of uk. = Influence of local packing density = By definition, a diagonal element of the Kirchhoff matrix, Œìii, is equal to the degree of a node in GNM that represents the corresponding residue‚Äôs coordination number. This number is a measure of the local packing density around a given residue. The influence of local packing density can be assessed by series expansion of Œì‚àí1 matrix. Œì can be written as a sum of two matrices, Œì = D + O, containing diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements of Œì. :Œì‚àí1 = (D + O)‚àí1 = [ D (I + D‚àí1O) ]‚àí1 = (I + D‚àí1O)‚àí1D‚àí1 = (I - D‚àí1O + ...)‚àí1D‚àí1 = D‚àí1 \\\\- D‚àí1O D‚àí1 \\\\+ ... This expression shows that local packing density makes a significant contribution to expected fluctuations of residues. The terms that follow inverse of the diagonal matrix, are contributions of positional correlations to expected fluctuations.  GNM applications  400px = Equilibrium fluctuations = Equilibrium fluctuations of biological molecules can be experimentally measured. In X-ray crystallography the B-factor (also called Debye-Waller or temperature factor) of each atom is a measure of its mean-square fluctuation near its equilibrium position in the native structure. In NMR experiments, this measure can be obtained by calculating root-mean- square differences between different models. In many applications and publications, including the original articles, it has been shown that expected residue fluctuations obtained by the GNM are in good agreement with the experimentally measured native state fluctuations. The relation between B-factors, for example, and expected residue fluctuations obtained from GNM is as follows :B_i = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2}{3}< \\\\Delta R_{i} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta R_{i} > = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2 k_B T}{\\\\gamma}(\\\\Gamma^{-1})_{ii} Figure 3 shows an example of GNM calculation for the catalytic domain of the protein Cdc25B, a cell division cycle dual-specificity phosphatase. 400px = Physical meanings of slow and fast modes = Diagonalization of the Kirchhoff matrix decomposes the conformational motions into a spectrum of collective modes. The expected values of fluctuations and cross-correlations are obtained from linear combinations of fluctuations along these normal modes. The contribution of each mode is scaled with the inverse of that modes frequency. Hence, slow (low frequency) modes contribute most to the expected fluctuations. Along the few slowest modes, motions are shown to be collective and global and potentially relevant to functionality of the biomolecules. Fast (high frequency) modes, on the other hand, describe uncorrelated motions not inducing notable changes in the structure. GNM-based methods do not provide real dynamics but only an approximation based on the combination and interpolation of normal modes. Their applicability strongly depends on how collective the motion is. = Other specific applications = There are several major areas in which the Gaussian network model and other elastic network models have proved to be useful. These include: * Spring bead based network model: In spring-bead based network model, the springs and beads are used as components in the crosslinked network. Springs are cross-linked to represent mechanical behavior of the material and bridge molecular dynamics (MD) model and finite element (FE) model (see Figure. 5). The beads represent material mass of cluster bonds. Each spring is used to represent a cluster of polymer chains, instead of part of a single polymer chain. This simplification allows to bridge different models at multiple length scales and improves the simulation efficiency significantly. At each iteration step in the simulation, forces in the springs are applied to the nodes at the center of the beads, and the equilibrated nodal displacements throughout the system are calculated. Different from the traditional FE method for obtaining stress and strain, the spring‚Äìbead model provides the displacements of the nodes and forces in the springs. The equivalent strain and strain energy of spring‚Äìbead based network model can be defined and calculated using the displacements of nodes and the spring characteristics. Furthermore, the results from the network model can be scaled up to obtain the structural response at the macroscale using FE analysis. * Decomposition of flexible/rigid regions and domains of proteins * Characterization of functional motions and functionally important sites/residues of proteins, enzymes and large macromolecular assemblies Temiz NA & Bahar I, Inhibitor binding alters the directions of domain motions in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics 49, 61-70, 2002.Xu, C., Tobi, D. and Bahar, I. 2003 Allosteric changes in protein structure computed by a simple mechanical model: hemoglobin T<-> R2 transition, J.

She is named after the Norwegian island of Hitra. History =Wartime service= Hitra was originally built as a SC-497 class submarine chaser for the United States Navy. She was laid down on 22 September 1942 by the Fisher Boat Works of Detroit and launched on 31 March 1943. She was commissioned into the US Navy as USS SC-718 on 25 May 1943. In August 1943 US Admiral Harold R. Stark, commander of US Naval Forces Europe, ordered SC-718 and two other SC-class subchasers - SC-683 and SC-1061 - to be transferred to Britain. Stationed in Miami at the time, the three subchasers received top secret orders to report to Brooklyn Navy Yard where they were to await further orders. When they arrived at the Naval Yard, the vessels' commanders were ordered to warn their crews to observe strict silence about their movements and were told that the three ships had been picked for a \\"special purpose\\".Treadwell, p.87 The three subchasers were hoisted aboard three Liberty Ships and secured as deck cargo, SC-718 being carried by the Liberty Ship SS Willard Hall, and preparations made to transport them and their crews to an undisclosed location. It was only when the ships were under way that the crews were told that they were bound for Belfast. The ships arrived in Belfast in early October 1943, where the three subchasers were lifted back into the water, and on 14 October the three ships sailed up the Firth of Clyde to the US Naval base at Rosneath naval base, where a group of exiled Norwegian sailors of the Shetland Bus organisation were awaiting the vessels' arrival. It was not until the three ships moored that their US crews finally learned that the purpose of their journey was to train the Norwegians in the operation of the subchasers' equipment, and that upon completion of the training they were to hand their ships over to Norwegian command. The training lasted just a week, then the transfer of command was completed.Treadwell, p.88 After assuming command at Rosneath, the Norwegian crews sailed their new vessels first to Derry, and then to Scalloway in Shetland, where they completed their fitting-out. The subchasers' depth charge racks, Mousetrap anti-submarine rocket launchers, and K-gun depth charge projectors were removed, and an additional set of davits were installed so that each ship could carry two boats, whose motors were equipped with specially muffled exhausts for ultra-quiet running. They also removed one of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon from amidships and installed a 2-pounder gun aft and two cal .50 machine guns on the flying bridge. The ships were christened Hitra (SC-718), Hessa (SC-683), and Vigra (SC-1061). Hitra and her sister vessels superseded the famous fleet of civilian fishing boats that had formerly run naval operations between Shetland and Norway. During the final two years of World War II the three ships performed a total of 114 missions to occupied Norway, and apart from one incident when a Canadian aircraft fired on Hessa, the voyages were uneventful and there were no casualties. For 43 of her 45 trips to Norway Hitra was under the command of Ingvald Eidsheim. Late in the war an observer from Admiral Stark's office wrote:Treadwell, p.89 =Postwar= Hitra in Oslo harbour in 2014 After the war Hitra performed coast guard duties until 1953. All three submarine chasers were mothballed at Marvika and formally decommissioned in 1959. She seemingly ended her days in Karlskrona, Sweden when she sank after someone had opened the bottom valves. It was not until 1981, when the Soviet submarine U 137 (Whiskey on the rocks) ran aground, that S. Moen, the director of the Royal Norwegian Navy Museum in Horten saw the abandoned Hitra in a newspaper image. Subsequently, she was raised and shipped back to Norway, where she was restored to her original condition in 1983-1987. Hitra moored at Scalloway, Shetland, April 2018 Today, while still under naval command, Hitra is a museum ship home ported at Haakonsvern, Bergen, touring the Norwegian coast in the summer months.

Royal Air Force Balderton or more simply RAF Balderton was a former Royal Air Force station located south of Newark-on-Trent, sandwiched between the now extinct Great Northern Railway (GNR) Bottesford-Newark line and the A1 road in Nottinghamshire, England. Balderton airfield opened in June 1941 with a grass surface over stiff clay, it was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). During the Second World War it was used primarily as a troop carrier transport airfield and after for munitions storage before it finally closed. A notice in The Times for 20 May 1957 lists the airfield as one of those no longer needed by the RAF. The airfield was built to a dispersed plan. By 1943 the airfield had tarmac landing areas with three intersecting runways and 50 hard standings suitable for Heavy Bombers. In 1944 it was used by Bomber Command's 5 Group. There were two T-2 aircraft hangars, two Glider hangars and one B1 type hangar by 1944. There were 1510 male and 208 female personnel stationed on the base at that time. Part of the accommodation was temporary, and the officers accommodation was at a nearby hospital, Balderton Hall. (Now the Fernwood development) During the airfields short operational life over two hundred aircrew failed to return and paid the ultimate sacrifice, a little known fact in Nottinghamshire‚Äôs history. Today, the remains of the airfield are located on private property being used as agricultural fields and a gypsum quarry.  History  = Royal Air Force (RAF) use = The following units were here at some point: * No. 1 Equipment Disposal Depot * No. 5 Aircrew School * No. 12 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF * No. 14 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF * No. 25 Operational Training Unit RAF * No. 28 Heavy Glider Maintenance Section * No. 93 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 227 Squadron RAF * No. 254 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 255 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 408 Squadron RCAF * No. 1668 Heavy Conversion Unit RAF The airfield was assigned to No. 5 Group RAF and received No. 408 Squadron RCAF and its Handley Page Hampdens from RAF Syerston on 9 December 1941. 408 Squadron's first operational flight from RAF Balderton was on 10 December 1941 and was a daylight bombing raid on the airfield at Leeuwarden. 408 Squadron remained at RAF Balderton from 9 December 1941 until 20 September 1942 60 operational aircraft and crews sent to RAF North Luffenham from 25 January 1942 to 16 March 1942 due to Baldertons runways becoming unserviceable . 1943 saw the laying of the concrete runways and in August of that year 1668 HCU was formed at RAF Balderton and stayed until moving to RAF Syerston as No. 5 Lancaster Finishing School = United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Use = The airfield was officially taken over by Ninth Air Force on New Year's Day 1944. Balderton was used as a reception center for the 437th and the 439th troop carrier groups arriving from the United States that were subsequently located at other UK airfields. Balderton was known as USAAF Station AAF-482 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its USAAF Station Code was \\"BD\\". It's World War II radio callsign was 'Cheapride'.  Operation Market-Garden  Balderton was retained by IX Troop Carrier Command throughout the summer of 1944, and it was about to be released to the Royal Air Force when, in September, it was required as an advance base for Operation \\"Market\\". Ground units moved in during the first week and the air echelon of the 439th TCG, which had been in the process of moving to France, returned to Balderton to airlift the ground forces into the Netherlands. On 17 September, the 439th despatched two flights of aircraft. The first, with 30 Douglas C-47 Skytrains carrying paratroops of the 82nd Airborne Division to Groesbeek near Nijmegen, successfully completed their mission. The 50 C-47s of the second flight towed Waco CG-4A gliders, losing one but no C-47s were lost The next day, 50 C-47s again towed gliders to Groesbeck. one C47 was lost on 18 September 42-93098c-N12972 and Captain F O Lorimer was killed. On D-plus 2, 25 C-47s took part in an unsuccessful re-supply mission. On D-plus 3, 15 C-47s of the group carried out a re-supply drop to the 101st Airborne Division from RAF Greenham Common.  437th Troop Carrier Group  The first USAAF transport unit to arrive was the 437th Troop Carrier Group during January 1944 from Baer Army Airfield, Indiana. The group's squadrons and fuselage codes were: * 83d Troop Carrier Squadron (T2) * 84th Troop Carrier Squadron (Z8) * 85th Troop Carrier Squadron (90) * 86th Troop Carrier Squadron (5K) The 439th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 53d Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. The first aircraft arrived on 21 January. On 5/6 February 5 it was moved south to RAF Ramsbury in Wiltshire.  439th Troop Carrier Group  In early February 1944 the air echelon of the 439th was ordered to Baer Field, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the aerial port of embarkation, arriving there on the 14th of the month. The ground echelon would follow by ship to England. The advance parties of the 439th and two of its squadrons, the 91st and 92nd, departed Baer Field in their C47 transports o/a 19 February 1944. Flying a circuitous route they arrived at Balderton on 21 February 1944. The remaining two squadrons, the 93rd and 94th, did not arrive at Balderton until 6 March. Skidmore and the ground echelon of the 439th TC Group and its four squadrons left New York aboard the USS George Washington, an Army troop transport, on 28 February 1944. After eleven days at sea the ship arrived at Liverpool, England on 10 March 1944. From there they traveled by rail to Balderton where they would remain until 26 April 1944. On that date the group was relocated to the aerodrome at RAF Upottery, England. The group's squadrons and fuselage codes were: * 91st Troop Carrier Squadron (L4) * 92d Troop Carrier Squadron (J8) * 93d Troop Carrier Squadron (3B) * 94th Troop Carrier Squadron (D8) The 439th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 50th Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. Intensive training with paratroops of the 82nd Airborne Division was conducted until the 439th was moved to RAF Upottery in Devon on 26 April, although all elements did not move until May. = Frank Whittle's jet engine trials at Balderton 1943-1944 = Jet aircraft with Rolls Royce engines were subsequently test flown from Balderton, Nottinghamshire, during 1943-4 (notably Whittle's Meteor and Vickers Wellington W5389/G jet engine trials) and Church Broughton, Derbyshire, where concrete runways were available. This account taken from the book 'Men of Power: The Lives of Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilots Harvey and Jim Heyworth.' It includes the following details; Jan 44 - Returned to Glosters for a complete overhaul. 24 Feb 44 - To Rolls-Royces' aerodrome at Balderton following completion of overhaul. 25-minute flight. To quote from the flight report held by DoRIS; 'due to the landing of an entire American Transport Squadron, the aircraft was flown around Balderton for a few minutes while waiting for the aerodrome to clear'. 28 Apr 44 Following tests, transferred to Church Broughton for further development flying. Whittle is believed to have based himself at Balderton Old Hall on Main Street while working on his prototype jet engine trials at RAF Balderton. = Return to British control = RAF Balderton was returned to No. 5 Group RAF Bomber Command, at the end of September 1944 and the re-formed No. 227 Squadron RAF with Avro Lancaster's. 227's Squadron identification code was 9J. 227 Squadron was based at RAF Balderton between October 1944 and April 1945. The first mission they took part in while at RAF Balderton was on the night of 28 October 1944. 18 aircraft to bomb Bergen, Norway. 227 Squadron moved to RAF Strubby, Lincolnshire on 5 April 1945. Postwar Use Having no operational usefulness to the RAF, from June 1945, bombs were stored on the runways. Like many wartime airfields, it languished unused with a little demolition until gradually disposed of in the 1950s and 1960s. A notice in The Times for 20 May 1957 listed the airfield as one of those no longer needed by the RAF. The airfield was sold by public auction on Wednesday, 9 September 1959. RAF Balderton was then sold by the MOD and returned to agriculture, the runway concrete disappearing as hardcore under the A1 improvements of the mid 1960s. At that time, the developed A1 was routed west of the original road (The Old Great North Road), over the eastern perimeter track of the airfield, before coming back to the east to bypass Balderton village and Newark. Gypsum open- pit mining has also taken its toll where quarrying has completely obliterated the western side of the airfield.

RAF Upottery (also known as Smeatharpe) is a former World War II airfield in East Devon, England. The airfield is located near the village of Upottery, approximately north- northeast of the town of Honiton. Opened in 1944, it was used by the Royal Air Force, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and United States Navy. During the war it was used primarily as a transport airfield and for antisubmarine patrols. It was closed in 1948 after the end of the war and today the remains of the airfield are located on private property being used as agricultural fields. Upottery received much attention in 2001 when it appeared in the first episode of the television mini-series Band of Brothers. It was from Upottery that Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division boarded Douglas C-47 transports and made their first combat jump into Normandy on 6 June 1944.

The group was equipped with about 70 Douglas C-47 Skytrains and was assigned to the 50th Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command, Ninth Air Force. The four squadrons assigned to the group and their squadron fuselage codes were: * 91st Troop Carrier Squadron (L4) * 92d Troop Carrier Squadron (J8) * 93d Troop Carrier Squadron (3B) * 94th Troop Carrier Squadron (D8) The group moved to RAF Upottery on 26 April and trained for the invasion of France. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the four squadrons dropped paratroopers of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and released gliders with reinforcements on the following day. The group received two decorations for these actions, a U.S. Distinguished Unit Citation and a French Croix de Guerre with Palm. After the Normandy invasion the group ferried supplies in the United Kingdom until the air echelons of three squadrons, the 91st, 92d and 94th Troop Carrier Squadrons, began operating from Orbetello Airfield, Italy from 18 July to 24 August. Their mission was to transport cargo to Rome and evacuate wounded personnel. During the invasion of Southern France on 15 August, the three squadron dropped paratroops of the U.S. 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment along the Riviera, and later towed gliders to provide reinforcements. The group was awarded a second French Croix de Guerre for these missions. The 93d Troop Carrier Squadron had remained in England but operated from RAF Ramsbury, England on 7‚Äì16 August, and RAF Membury, England on 16‚Äì22 August. After the air echelon returned to England on 25 August the group resumed its cargo missions until 8 September when the group deployed to Juvincourt Airfield, France, also known as Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) A-68. USN use The airfield had been unoccupied since September 1944, and a detachment of SeaBees made it habitable. Two Patrol Bombing Squadrons (VPBs) flying Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberators (USAAF B-24D, B-24J, B-24L and B-24M aircraft) on antisubmarine warfare patrols were assigned to Naval Air Facility (NAF) Upottery in 1945. The two squadrons were tasked to assist No. 19 Group, RAF Coastal Command in patrols in the English Channel, Irish Sea and Bay of Biscay. NAF Upottery was a satellite field to NAF Dunkeswell, Devon, England and it was returned to RAF control on 31 July 1945. The two squadrons were: * VPB-107: This squadron was deployed at NAF Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil until being ordered to redeploy to NAF Upottery and being assigned to Fleet Air Wing Seven (FAW-7). While operating from NAF Natal, the squadron had sunk five German U-boats operating in the South Atlantic Ocean. Squadron headquarters was established at NAF Upottery on 10 January 1945 and the squadron became operational on 21 January. After the war, the squadron departed England aboard seaplane tender USS Albemarle (AV-5) on 4 June and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 14 June. * VPB-112: This squadron was deployed at NAF Port Lyautey, French Morocco when orders were received to cease operations and prepare to transfer to England. Squadron headquarters were established at NAF Upottery on 9 January 1945 and the squadron was assigned to FAW-7. Operations began from this base on 15 February. With the surrender of Germany the U-boats still at sea began to surrender to the Allies. Three U-boats surrendered to the aircraft of VPB-112: on 9 May U-249 surrendered, on 10 May U-825 surrendered and on 11 May U-516 surrendered. On 5 June, squadron personnel boarded the seaplane tender USS Albemarle (AV-5) which arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 14 June. Civil use Upon its release from military use, the airfield was returned to agriculture. All three runways remain with most of the concreted areas still intact.

Opened in 1942, it was used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). During the war it was used primarily as a troop carrier airfield for paratroopers and as a bomber airfield before closing in 1948. Today the remains of the airfield are located on private property with the technical site being used as an industrial estate. History =RAF Bomber Command use= The airfield was opened as a RAF Bomber Command station in No. 5 Group RAF area during the autumn of 1941, with No. 207 Squadron RAF moving in with its troublesome Avro Manchesters during November. However, because of continual difficulties experienced with their Rolls-Royce Vulture engines operations were frequently curtailed, but in March 1942 the squadron was able to step up its bombing raids on Germany when it became one of the first to receive the new Avro Lancaster in March 1942. No. 207 Sqnn left in September 1942 for RAF Langar and in November a new Australian manned squadron, No. 467 Squadron RAAF, arrived in November 1942 commencing operations on the night of 2/3 January 1943. =USAAF use= It was first occupied by the 50th Troop Carrier Wing Headquarters on 15 November. It was then opened as a reception base for Douglas C-47/C-53 Skytrain groups that were scheduled to fly in from the United States. It was known as USAAF Station AAF-481 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. It's USAAF Station Code was \\"AQ\\". 436th Troop Carrier Group The first USAAF group to arrive at Bottesford was 436th Troop Carrier Group a few days into the New Year from Baer Army Airfield, Indiana. Operational squadrons of the group were: * 79th Troop Carrier Squadron (S6) * 80th Troop Carrier Squadron (7D) * 81st Troop Carrier Squadron (U5) * 82d Troop Carrier Squadron (3D) The 436th TCG was assigned to the 53rd Troop Carrier Wing. On 3 March the 436th Group was moved south to lake up station at RAF Membury 440th Troop Carrier Group Within a week (between 8/11 March), the C-47s of the 440th Troop Carrier Group started to arrive from Baer Army Airfield. Operational squadrons of the group were: * 95th Troop Carrier Squadron (9X) * 96th Troop Carrier Squadron (6Z) * 97th Troop Carrier Squadron (W6) * 98th Troop Carrier Squadron (8Y) After using the airfield during the following two months for glider repair and modification, the USAAF then departed. =Subsequent RAF Wartime use= The USAAF relinquished Bottesford to No. 5 Group Bomber Command in July 1944. After the end of the war, a small holding party remained for a few years until it was sold off in 1948. The following units were here at some point: Current use With the facility released from military control, farmers were using the land for crops. Today, the technical site buildings are operated as an industrial facility. Runways, all of which still exist with just a small amount of concrete (mostly dispersal loops) being removed for hardcore. The perimeter track and two T-2 hangars still exist, being used for unknown purposes, although the condition of the perimeter track is very deteriorated.

Gonium is a genus of colonial algae, a member of the order Chlamydomonadales.

In a colony of 16 cells, four are in the center, and the other 12 are on the four sides, three each. A description by G.M. Smith (1920, p. 94):Smith, GM.

Evolution The genus Gonium represents species closely related to single celled Chlamydomonas and multicellular differentiated Volvox. The order Volvocales has long been a well recognized model system for the study of multicellular evolution. Gonium and the genus Tetrabaenecae contain species representative of colony formation among unicells. Gonium's morphology of colonies of alike cells suggest it is more genetically similar to Chlamydomonas than Volvox, a fact confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The Volvocales have been hypothesized to have evolved in twelve discrete steps. Gonium represents the first six evolutionary steps of multicellularity; (1) incomplete cytokinesis, (2) partial inversion, (3) rotation of the basal bodies, (4) organismal polarity, (5) transformation of the cell wall into extra-cellular matrix (ECM), (6) genetic control of cell number. Although the exact order and progression through David Kirk's twelve steps of multicellular evolution are probably not necessarily linear and each occurs more dynamically than originally thought. Life cycle Gonium being evolutionarily related to Chlamydomonas has a life cycle that is derivative of that of Chlamydomonas. Gonium cells grow asexually as colonies of either 4, 8 or 16 colonial cells. Cell and colony growth of Gonium is uncoupled from cell division just like Chlamydomonas and each cell within the colony divides by multiple-fission. Thus, each cell within the colony will divide 2, 3 or 4 times, thus producing 2\\"n\\" daughter cells, or 4, 8 or 16 cells within the colony. Unlike Chlamydomonas where each of the daughter cells separate from each other, Gonium daughter cells remain attached to each other in their ECM. The sexual cycle of Gonium is also very similar to that of Chlamydomonas. The sexual program of Gonium is induced by nitrogen deprivation where each vegetative cell within the colony differentiates in gametes. Gonium gametes are isogomous, or equal-sized, and unicellular. Thus unicellular Gonium gametes break apart from the multicellular colonies when the sexual program is initiated.

The archaeologist Francis Pryor observes: History Ancient field system of Cornish hedges near Zennor There are about of hedges in Cornwall today, and their development over the centuries is preserved in their structure. The first Cornish hedges enclosed land for cereal crops during the Neolithic Age (4000‚Äì6000 years ago). Prehistoric farms were of about , with fields about for hand cultivation. Some hedges date from the Bronze and Iron Ages, 2000‚Äì4000 years ago, when Cornwall's traditional pattern of landscape became established. Others were built during the Mediaeval field rationalisations; more originated in the tin and copper industrial boom of the 18th and 19th centuries, when heaths and uplands were enclosed.Cornish hedges website, including history and links Cornish planning authorities have frequently made it a condition of approval of new developments that the site is bounded by newly made Cornish hedges. Maintenance St Dominic with high hedgesthumb Cornish hedges suffer from the effects of tree roots, burrowing rabbits, rain, wind, farm animals and people. Eventually the hedge sides lose their batter, bulge outwards and stones fall. How often repairs are needed depends on how well the hedge was built, its stone, and what has happened to it since it was last repaired. Typically a hedge needs a cycle of repair every 150 years or so, or less often if it is fenced. Building new hedges, and repairing existing hedges, is a skilled craft, and there are professional hedgers in Cornwall. The Guild of Cornish Hedgers is the main body promoting the understanding of Cornish hedges in Cornwall.

Wood appeared as \\"Victoria\\" (\\"Miss Wood\\" in episode one), a fictionalised version of herself, in all six episodes ‚Äì in The Library it was said that she \\"worked in TV\\" and in Over To Pam characters appeared to recognise her celebrity (although two confused her with Dawn French) and in the final episode, Staying In, she was taken to a party to perform as a comedian and was expected to go through her stand-up 'routine'. Her character often broke the 'fourth wall' of TV and spoke directly to the camera, but not in every episode. Bored with the sketch format and with a yearning to recapture previous success as a playwright, Wood came up with six individual sitcoms as a compromise. She admitted to finding the writing difficult. Though Wood was written as the central character, other lead parts were written with specific actresses in mind, like Julie Walters and Una Stubbs. \\"I want people to like me and the people who play my friends, and not everybody else\\" she said.Victoria Wood ‚Äì The Biography, Neil Brandwood, Ted Smart, 2002, pp. 151‚Äì152 Screenonline says of the shows \\"Modest in ambition and scale but rich in wit and acuity, the six playlets showcase Wood's eye for human foibles and her distinctively eccentric characters.\\". While the 1992 and 1993 VHS releases of the series were titled Victoria Wood, the 2007 DVD release was called Victoria Wood Presents. Reception The series was met with a mixed critical reception initially. The series started out with an impressive 13 million viewers tuning in, but by the next week had dropped to 11 million. Wood regretted the decision not to record it in front of a studio audience and described the filming as a \\"boring, diabolical and awful\\" experience. The Daily Express described the show as 'tiresome stuff' and the Daily Mirror said her targets were predictable and snobbish.

Born in Vinton, Iowa, he played college football at the University of Iowa. Early life Youel was born in Vinton, Iowa and attended Fort Madison High School, where he participated in football, basketball, and track. His mother was originally hesitant to let him play football because she had lost a brother to a broken neck while he played football. College career Youel attended and played college football at the University of Iowa as a quarterback and punter. In 1942 he helped the Hawkeyes defeat the previously unbeaten Wisconsin Badgers, 6-0. During the game, he had four punts of 50+ yards, which helped stall the Wisconsin offense. After the 1942 season, Youel was chosen to play in the Chicago College All-Star Game, and the All-Stars beat the Washington Redskins 27-7. In 1943 Youel graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. =Navy= After graduating from college, Youel enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. While stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes, he played football and was a boxer. Professional career After finishing his service with the Navy, Youel was signed by Cleveland Rams in January 1945. However, he was traded to the Washington Redskins for guard Al Fiorentino before ever playing with the Rams. In 1946 and 1947 with the Redskins, he served as the backup quarterback for Sammy Baugh. =1948= On June 1, 1948 Youel was traded, along with end Joe Duckworth, to the Boston Yanks for offensive tackle Tom Dean. He started only one game for the Yanks (in early October) and was then waived, after which he was signed by the Detroit Lions. Youel misunderstood the signing, however, and accidentally reported to the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the October 24th game against the Los Angeles Rams. He then took a train to Detroit where he was informed that he had been sent to the Rams. Youel never played for the Rams, however, and was sent back to the Washington Redskins for the end of the 1948 season. Personal life After Youel retired from the NFL, he became a math teacher and football coach for his alma mater, Fort Madison High School. In 2008 Fort Madison renamed their football field \\"Jim Youel Field\\" in his honor. Youel was named to the Iowa Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame. He died on April 9, 2020, in Traer, Iowa at age 98.

Its location is known as Busan Harbor. History The Port of Busan was established in 1876 as a small port with strict trading between Korea, China and Japan. It is situated at the mouth of the Nakdong River () facing the Tsushima Island of Japan. During the Korean War (1950-1953), Busan was among the few places North Korea did not invade, causing war refugees to flee to the city of Busan. At that time Busan's port was crucial to receive war materials and aid, such as fabrics and processed foods to keep the economy stable. In the 1970s, a rise in the footwear and veneer industries caused factory workers to migrate to Busan, bringing Busan's population from 1.8 million to 3 million. The Port of Busan continued to grow and by 2003 the port was the fourth largest container port in the world. South Korea accounted for 0.7% of global trade in 1970, but by 2003 it went up to 2.5%. 50% of the Busan's manufacturing jobs are related to exports, and 83% of the country's exports are containerized, making Busan the country's largest container and general cargo port. Compared to the Port of Busan, Inchon port handles only 7% of containers. Easy access to the Port of Busan between Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong contribute to its vast growth. Currently the Port of Busan is the fifth busiest container port in the world and the tenth busiest port in North- east Asia. It is developed, managed, and operated by the Busan Port Authority (BPA) established in 2004. Today the Port of Busan consists of four ports- North Port, South Port, Gamcheon Port, and Dadaepo Port, an International Passenger Terminal and the Gamman container terminal. The North Port provides passenger handling facilities and cargo, and with Gamcheon Port's help more cargo volumes can be handled (Ship Technology). The South Port is home to the Busan Cooperative Fish Market which is the largest fishing base in Korea, and it handles 30% of the total marine volume. The Dadaepo Port located west of the Busan Port, mainly handles coastal catches. In 2007 the Busan Port handled cargo containing fertilizers, meat, scrap metal, petroleum and other gases, crude petroleum, coal, leather, fats and oils, iron ore, rough wood, natural sand, milling industry products, and sugar. In 2016, South Korea exported a total of $515B and imported $398B. Top exports of South Korea are integrated circuits, cars, refined petroleum, passenger and cargo ships, and vehicle parts. South Korea exports the most to China, the United States, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan. Imports to South Korea mainly come from China, Japan, the United States, Germany, and other Asian countries. In 2017 Busan processed more than 20 million TEUS, twenty-foot equivalents (a measure used to estimate the compacity of container ships).

He was initially a commoner and a guest of the general Chang He (), and after Chang submitted suggestions that Ma drafted, Emperor Taizong was impressed and retained Ma as an imperial official, eventually rising to the post of chancellor.  Background and discovery by Emperor Taizong  Ma Zhou was born in 601, during the reign of Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. He appeared to have been born from a relatively poor household in Qinghe Commandery (Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei) and lost his father early in life. He was studious, particularly concentrating on the Shi Jing and the Spring and Autumn Annals, but was also carefree, not paying attention to details, and because of this, the people of his home region did not view him highly. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu in the Tang dynasty, he served as a teacher in Bo Prefecture (ÂçöÂ∑û, i.e., Qinghe), but was said to spend his days drinking, not concentrating on teaching the students, and was often rebuked by the prefect Daxi Shu (). He thus resigned and went to travel in Cao Prefecture (ÊõπÂ∑û, roughly modern Heze, Shandong) and Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). While there, however, on one occasion he was insulted by Cui Xian (), the county magistrate for Junyi County (ÊµöÂÑÄ, in modern Kaifeng), and in anger, he travelled to the capital Chang'an. Once there, he became a guest of the general Chang He. In 629, Emperor Gaozu's son and successor, Emperor Taizong, ordered his officials to submit suggestions for him. As Chang was unacquainted with historical writings, Ma drafted some 20 suggestions for him. When Emperor Taizong read the suggestions that Chang submitted, he was impressed, but he knew that Chang was not well-studied, he summoned Chang to ask him how he came up with the suggestions. Chang told Emperor Taizong that he did not write the suggestions and that Ma did. He also told Emperor Taizong that whenever he conversed with Ma, Ma was always concerned about faithfulness and filial piety. Emperor Taizong sent messengers to summon Ma into his presence, and once they conversed, he was impressed by Ma and, while initially not giving him an official position, had him serve at the examination bureau of the government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). In 632, he officially made Ma a governmental auditor. He awarded Chang silk for having discovered Ma.  Service under Emperor Taizong  In 632, Ma Zhou submitted a petition to Emperor Taizong that was later included in its entirety in the Old Book of Tang for its importance,Old Book of Tang, vol. 74 . which made several suggestions to Emperor Taizong: * That Emperor Taizong expand Da'an Palace (), the residence of Emperor Gaozu (who was then Taishang Huang (retired emperor)), to show filial piety. * That Emperor Taizong should not spend much time away from Chang'an in the summer, because he would then be unable to attend to Emperor Gaozu. * That Emperor Taizong's plans to create a feudal system of governance, where the contributors to his reign would be given inheritable prefectural posts to be passed to their descendants, were inadvisable, because there would be no guarantees in future generations that the descendants of capable men would also be capable. * That Emperor Taizong should personally offer sacrifices to the imperial ancestors. * That Emperor Taizong should be careful not to bestow honors on people not due them. Emperor Taizong was impressed by Ma's suggestions and promoted him. In 637, Ma submitted another petition considered important enough to be included in its entirety in the Old Book of Tang. He noted that at the time, even though Emperor Taizong had reigned for over a decade, the empire was still, overall, a fraction of the strength of the Sui dynasty at its prime, in terms of population and wealth. He pointed out that the population was therefore ill- equipped to deal with the construction projects that Emperor Taizong was then carrying out for his own palaces and for mansions for his sons and daughters. He advocated frugality, and further pointed out that Emperor Taizong's favors for his sons were creating competition between them, which was not good for the long term, either for his sons or for their descendants. Emperor Taizong praised Ma for his suggestions. Also based on Ma's suggestions, the institution of Chang'an city criers (who would call out at both dawn and dusk) and replaced with drums, greatly reducing the amount of labor necessary. In 638, Ma was made a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). Ma was praised for his alertness and logical thinking, and Emperor Taizong once stated, \\"If I did not see Ma Zhou for a while, I would always miss him.\\" The chancellor Cen Wenben also stated, \\"When Mr. Ma analyzes matters, he took examples from both history and current events. He deletes what is not necessary, and then analyzes thoroughly. Nothing should be added and nothing should be taken away from what he writes. His words are well- written, and one will not get tired of them.\\" In 641, Ma was given three different posts‚Äîassistant auditor, imperial advisor, and secretary to Emperor Taizong's son, Li Zhi (the Prince of Jin). After Li Zhi replaced his elder brother, Li Chengqian, as crown prince, Ma was made an advisor to the new crown prince as well as deputy head of the legislative bureau. In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Ma: :Ma Zhou has quick reactions and is faithful and honest. When he evaluated others, he did so truthfully, and whatever task I give him, he usually performed it to my great satisfaction. Later that year, Ma was made the acting head of the legislative bureau‚Äîa position considered one for a chancellor. In 645, when Emperor Taizong attacked Goguryeo, he left Li Zhi in charge of logistics at Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), assisted by Gao Shilian, Liu Ji, and Ma. Once Emperor Taizong returned from the Goguryeo campaign, he gave Ma the additional post as minister of civil service affairs. Ma was said to suffer from chronic diabetes, and when Emperor Taizong built the Cuiwei Palace (Áø†ÂæÆÂÆÆ, in the Qinling Mountains), he looked for a place near the palace to construct a summer mansion for Ma. He also had the imperial physicians attend to Ma and often supplied Ma with imperial meals. As Ma's illness grew worse, Emperor Taizong personally attended to Ma's medicinal needs, while sending Li Zhi to greet him. As Ma grew gravely ill, he asked his family to bring him the copies of the petitions he had submitted to Emperor Taizong, and he personally burned them, stating, \\"Guan Zhong and Yan Ying [(ÊôèÂ¨∞)] [both great chancellors of the Spring and Autumn period] publicly showed their lords' faults to become famous for posterity. That is something I will not do.\\" He died in 648 and was buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife, Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong himself would eventually be buried. After Emperor Taizong died in 649 and Li Zhi succeeded him (as Emperor Gaozong), Ma was posthumously enfeoffed as the Duke of Gaotang. Later, after Emperor Gaozong's own death in 683, during the time when Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Ruizong was emperor under the regency of his mother Empress Dowager Wu, Ma was worshipped at Emperor Gaozong's temple.

AZUSA was named after the southern California town Azusa, California where the system was devised in the early 1950s. Azusa antenna farm (1954) from US Air Force Eastern Test Range, Florida Radar interferometry Radio interferometry yields very accurate tracking angles when a target emits a radio signal. This angular precision of interferometry led to the development of the Azusa tracking system as part of the Army Air Corps NUL-774 Project, forerunner of the Atlas ICBM program, at the Vultee Field Division of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation (Convair) in Downey, California. Two of the basic patents (2,972,047 and 3,025,520) in the field of interferometer tracking are shared by James W. Crooks, Jr., Robert C. Weaver, and Robert V. Werner, all members of the Azusa design team. By the spring of 1948, the Azusa team had built an interferometer operating at 148.58 MHz. In a strange circle of history, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was working on underwater sound interferometers at the time Convair was developing Azusa. Since the two groups were in close contact, there was considerable interchange of ideas.* The circle was completed in the early 1950s when the Navy picked up the Azusa interferometer work for its Viking Project at White Sands, New Mexico. The Navy wanted to explore the possibility of converting the Viking or some derivative of it into a guided missile and it needed an accurate guidance system. In an early report from this program, NRL's J. Carl Seddon explained how the Viking would determine its position: \\"The Missile will detect its position relative to the hyperbolic guidance path by phase comparison of modulation waveforms derived from signals received from two pairs of stations.\\" In this scheme, the missile would guide itself using onboard electronics and navigational signals received from the ground. This seems a far cry from Minitrack and satellite tracking, but phase comparison, the essence of Minitrack, was there. Within a year, NRL reports from the Viking program were diagramming ground-based tracking interferometers, which relieved the Viking of the burden of signal-processing equipment by computing the missile's position from the ground. Two precursors of Minitrack were evident in the interferometer arrangement. First, only a tiny radio beacon needed to be carried on the Viking itself, an important feature of the Vanguard \\"Minitrack,\\" in which the prefix 'Mini\\" applied to the minimum-weight satellite transmitter. The second precursor was the \\"Lff arrangement of the interferometer antennas which persisted in some early designs of Minitrack, although the final deployed version extended the bars of the \\"L\\" to make a cross.Corliss, William R., 'The Evolution of the Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN)'. Goddard Historical Note No. 3. Greenbelt, MD.: Goddard Space Flight Center, 1967. USAF Atlantic Missile Range, Cape Canaveral, Florida For some scientific satellites \\"achieving orbit\\" is enough, but vehicles carrying men or payloads that must be placed in precise positions, such as geosynchronous satellites, require improved trajectory position and velocity measurement systems. In the early 1960s, the mainstay for obtaining this data at Canaveral was Convair's Azusa Mark I, a c-w cross baseline interferometer operating in the C band, requiring a transponder in the missile. Output data were digitized for use in the IBM 709 computer and measured parameters consist of range, coherent or fine range, and two direction cosines. The Azusa II, intended to replace Azusa I, was installed in 1961. It is nearly identical to the Mark I except that its circuit design was refined and cosine rate was added which provides better direction cosine information. Both Azusas have identical limitations: they will not track cross-polarized signals; missile antenna nulls deeper than 10 dB cause noisy data, ambiguities and, in severe cases, loss of data. Earth-based Electronics in Electronics, vol. 34, no. 46, pp. 108-118, 17 November 1961. Use in Apollo Program The AZUSA tracking radar was used to monitor initial phases of launch for the Saturn S-II by telemetry with transponder frequency of 5,060 MHz (receiver) and 5,000 MHz (transmitter) with 2.5 W of power.F.O. Vonbun, 'Ground Tracking of the Apollo', NASA Report N66-22219, 1966. Robert Weaver Robert Christian Weaver Sr., co-inventor of the AZUSA radar, was a Fresno native, graduated from the University of California Berkeley in 1938 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He joined the Army Air Corps in 1940, rising to major during World War II. He was responsible for radio and radar equipment in the China-Burma-India Theater. After World War II Weaver began his civilian career with what was then Consolidated Vultee Aircraft in 1946. \\"After the war he had a choice of engineering jobs; one in Los Angeles, the other in San Diego with Consolidated,\\" his son said. With Convair, Weaver's assignments took him to Cape Canaveral and several other test sites. His specialty became designing radar, guidance and tracking systems for guided missiles and space vehicles. had a career in the aerospace industry that influenced the future of guided missiles and other space vehicles. In the early 1950s, Weaver and a colleague invented the AZUSA continuous wave tracking system, implemented at the Air Force Missile Test Center, Cape Canaveral. This system was designed to measure the trajectory of missiles, and was instrumental in pioneering military missile tests and the Project Mercury manned space program.The technology that Weaver and his colleague, Jim Crooks, devised flourished during the Cold War. It was applied to the Navy's Polaris Project and the Air Force's Thor, Atlas missiles and Titan Projects. It also was used by NASA in the Saturn IV (Apollo) program. One of the advantages of the Azusa system over its predecessors was that it required fewer radar sites and operating crews. The increased emphasis on ballistic missiles and efforts to improve their accuracy spurred the development of the Azusa system and Mistram, a competing technology developed by GE in the early 1960s. Choosing the San Diego assignment, Weaver made his home in La Jolla. He was familiar with the area from a 1933 visit to La Jolla Shores, where he had camped out with friends in cow fields, per his son. Computers, electronic gadgets and photography occupied much of his leisure time. He also enjoyed sports cars, as well as \\"the green flashes of the La Jolla sunsets and the breathtaking beauty of Yosemite Valley,\\" his son said.Jack Williams.

The writer, critic, and dramatist David Vi√±as was an early mentor and influence. In 1978, she co-founded Punto de Vista which was one of the major dissident voices during the military regime which ended in 1983. Because of the authoritarian nature of the regime, Sarlo and her fellow contributors had to use pseudonyms, and subordinate political questions to aesthetic ones. Paradoxically, this entailed a rethinking of the political which moved Sarlo's thought away from an earlier tendency to Marxism and other forms of radicalism. She has continued to maintain a moderate-left political stance that refrains from promoting euphorias of free-market thought or populist solidarity. Sarlo is a highly laurelled academic who also operates as a public intellectual. She has written both on traditional literary topics‚Äîher book on Jorge Luis Borges, published in 1993, is one of the seminal works on the great Argentine fabulist‚Äîbut she has also worked in more cultural areas, such as feminism, the emergence of the modern Argentine city, and Argentina's divided sense of its place in Latin America. These various interests are linked by an overall concern with the intellectual and how the idea of the intellectual functions in contemporary discursive contexts. Sarlo is not a parochial or regional thinker, but participates in global debates occasioned by critical theory, postmodernity, and the destabilization of set political ideologies after the fall of Communism. She has warned, though, against the naive transnationalism seen in an earlier female Argentine intellectual, Victoria Ocampo. In some ways, Sarlo's project is analogous to the work of thinkers of the previous generation such as Angel Rama in its ability to traverse disciplinary and discursive boundaries, though Rama specifically has not been a huge influence on Sarlo. Sarlo has worked with other major contemporary Argentine thinkers such as Carlos Altamirano and Ricardo Piglia. She held the Chair of Contemporary Literature at the Faculty of Arts and Letters at the University of Buenos Aires.http://estudiosculturales.ucdavis.edu/?page_id=21 In 2001, she was denied a position as the equivalent of distinguished professor, in controversial circumstances.http://www.pagina12.com.ar/2001/01-10/01-10-01/UNIVER01.HTM She has also taught at several US universities, held the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var chair at the University of Cambridge, and been a visiting fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin. She also writes regularly for Argentine newspapers such as La Naci√≥n, Clar√≠n (for which she writes a weekly column), and P√°gina 12.

The group resulted from the merger of local acts Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. With their line-up solidified, the first two songs they wrote together was \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" and \\"Three Cheers for Five Years\\". Soon afterwards, they recorded an EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends, with Lee Dyess. The group followed Warped Tour and sold copies to people in line. By the end of summer, the band had sold 10,000 copies of the EP. This attracted the attention of Fearless Records, who would sign the band in late August. The group went on tour from September to November, before the EP was reissued by Fearless. Told by Dead Friends has received a mixed response from critics. The EP has since sold over 50,000 copies. Several of the tracks would later be re-recorded for future albums/EPs or compilation albums. To celebrate the EP's 10th anniversary in 2016, the group are set to go on an anniversary tour and re-release it with a bonus track. Background and recording Mayday Parade was formed in the winter of 2005 following the merger of two local Tallahassee bands, Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. Kid Named Chicago featured vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster, guitarist Alex Garcia and drummer Jake Bundrick, while Defining Moment featured vocalist Derek Sanders, guitarist Brooks Betts, and bassist Jeremy Lenzo. Both bands previously practiced in the same building, before it occurred to Lenzo that it \\"made more sense if we put them together instead of playing separately.\\" After composing \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" and \\"Three Cheers for Five Years\\", the group realised they had \\"something special\\". Tales Told by Dead Friends was recorded at Earthsound Recording, in Valdosta, Georgia. Recording was handled by Lee Dyess, who also did mixing. Dan Shike mastered the EP at Tone and Volume Mastering in Nashville, Tennessee. The group recorded the EP \\"as fast as we could.\\" Release The EP, originally titled Music to Dance To, was self-released by the band on June 13, 2006. Friends of the artwork's photographer posed for the artwork. On the artwork, the arm and phone were taken in two different locations, because the photographer \\"didn't like the phone he was posing next to.\\" The band followed the 2006 edition of Warped Tour, selling copies of the EP to people in line.Erickson 2007, p. 13 By the end of summer, the group had sold 10,000 copies of the EP. These sales caught the attention of Fearless Records, which signed Mayday Parade on August 29. Fearless label president Bob Becker said the group: \\"were really believable, they were obviously good musicians, and they were really tight sounding. And we already knew they were hard-working.\\" Between late September and early November, the band went on the Text on the Dance Floor tour with M√™l√©e, Wheatus, Brandtson, Lakes, and Fall of Transition. Tales Told by Dead Friends was re-released through Fearless on November 7. Reception =Critical response= AllMusic writer Corey Apar wrote that given the number of members in the band, their sound \\"should be much fuller sounding [...] instead of it being hard to even tell if there's more than one guitarist playing at a time.\\" He explained that if they had better production, \\"this could easily be fixed\\". Despite this, Apar wrote that there is \\"still not a whole lot\\" to separate the group from other bands at the time. He compared Sanders and Lancaster's vocals to \\"sound[ing] pretty similar\\" to that of Fall Out Boy. Apar concluded that the EP was \\"a good starting point with a lot of potential\\". Ariana Rock of Exclaim! opened her review with mentioning the EP's \\"catchy fun sound\\". She noted the \\"layered vocals, clean harmonies and mature musical dynamics\\" could help amass a large fan base. She concluded with calling the EP \\"the start of something big, without a doubt.\\" PopMatters contributor Jason Macneil noted that the EP was \\"ringing with earnest melodies and Emo 101 trademarks\\". He called the band \\"a lighter Fall Out Boy or My Chemical Romance\\". He concluded with calling \\"The Last Something That Meant Anything\\", \\"the closest anyone has come to an emo- powered power ballad.\\" The EP has sold over 50,000 copies to date. =Legacy= \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" would later be re-recorded for their debut album, A Lesson in Romantics (2007). \\"Three Cheers for Five Years\\" was re-recorded acoustically for Punk Goes Acoustic 2. It was later released as a bonus track on the 2008 reissue of A Lesson in Romantics. \\"Your Song\\" was re-recorded acoustically for the band's Valdosta (2011) EP. A vinyl version was released on December 2, 2013, limited to 1,000 copies. To celebrate the EP's 10th anniversary, the band went on tour in November 2016 where they will perform the EP in its entirety. They were supported by Modern Chemistry. A 10th anniversary edition of the EP, featuring new packaging, a book and an additional track \\"The Problem with the Big Picture Is That It's Hard to See\\", was released on November 11.

He is the nephew of former North Melbourne football players Jimmy Krakouer and Phil Krakouer and cousin of former Richmond and Collingwood player Andrew Krakouer. Early life Krakouer began his junior football in Western Australia before playing senior football with the Claremont Football Club at a young age. In 2006 he represented Australia's indigenous youth on tour to South Africa with the \\"Flying Boomerangs\\" to play against the South African national Australian rules team.AFL Record. Round 9, 2008. p. 12 He was invited to 2006 AFL Draft Camp where despite weighing just 61 kilograms he impressed scouts with both acceleration and standing jump for his height. AFL career =Port Adelaide (2007-2010)= The slightly-built rookie teenager was recruited by AFL club Port Adelaide in the 2006 AFL Draft. He was the player the Power was most surprised to be able to pick when it grabbed him at number 39. Krakouer shone at the 2006 AFL Draft camp in Canberra, setting a sizzling time in the 20 metre sprint on the second day of the camp. His time of 2.83 seconds puts his result in the top handful of all time, out of nearly a thirty players over the last 12 or 13 years.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-06/another-krakouer- stands-out-at-draft-camp/1279874 Wearing the number 29 guernsey, he has played 11 games for Port in his debut 2007 AFL season, despite coach Mark Williams earlier predicting that he would not play for at least two years. As at the end of round 7, he had an impressive total of 48 kicks, 24 marks, 18 handballs, 66 disposals and 4 goals. His explosive speed and raw talent has been progressively emerging throughout the season. Notably, he played a crucial role in securing a win over North Melbourne in round 2, with a significant hand in three Port goals in 15 minutes; three such goals being in the last five minutes of the game. Krakouer was also the only Power player to take more than one inside-50 mark in Port's loss to the Crows in Showdown XXII. At the end of round 7, Krakouer was ranked sixth among the AFL Rising Stars in total kicks and total marks, and seventh in total goals.http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/pp-port-adelaide-powernathan- krakouer In 2008, Krakouer managed just three games for the Power due to recurring soft tissue injuries, and was granted permission by the club to return home to Western Australia after suffering a season-ending hamstring strain in round 15. This led to speculation that Krakouer would seek a potential trade to the Fremantle Football Club or West Coast Eagles, two West Australian based clubs. However this never happened, with Krakouer stating: \\"I had a talk to Choco (Williams) and I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I couldn‚Äôt tell him I wanted to go back. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt just walk out and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt.\\"Junior Krakouer's reason to stay In 2009, an improvement in fitness and bulk in Krakouer saw him move to the backlines playing as a \\"sweeper role\\" and essentially replacing Peter Burgoyne who returned to his original position as a midfielder. Krakouer played well in this role, averaging over 20 possessions in the 2009 NAB Cup, and being named in the Power's round 1 game of the season. Season 2010 was forgetful for Krakouer as he was limited to just seven games due to injuries and lack of form. =Gold Coast (2011)= On 1 September 2010, Krakouer signed a three-year deal with the Gold Coast Suns. He was the second uncontracted player to do so following Nathan Bock who left Adelaide. He left despite the disappointment of Port Adelaide who stated that given the commitment our football club has made to Nathan's development and welfare over the last four years, we are very disappointed at the way the matter has been handled in recent weeks. It was alluded to that Krakouer had already made the decision to leave Port Adelaide during the season, further highlighting criticism of the AFL's clause for the expansion teams ability recruit one uncontracted player from each of the 16 existing clubs.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/gold-coast-suns-to-name-nathan- krakouer-nathan-bock/story-e6frf9jf-1225912648441 In December 2011, Krakouer was released by the Suns due to \\"personal reasons\\" despite being contracted to the end of the 2012 season. =Return to Port Adelaide (2015-2017)= On 31 March, Krakouer was signed to play for the Port Adelaide Magpies in hope to re-ignite his AFL career.http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2014-03-31/final-four-maggies- confirmed He polled best and fairest votes in 12 of his 16 games,Krakouer in mix for Port return and was subsequently drafted as a rookie by Port Adelaide's AFL side. Starting on the rookie list in 2015, he impressed in the pre-season trial matches and was quickly promoted from the rookie list to play his first AFL game for the Power since 2010 in round 3 as his accurate kicking and smooth movement off the half back line proved to be valuable. He played 7 games before being returned to the rookie list. He was immediately reinstated to the senior list as a mid season promotion and went on to play another 7 games for a return of 14 on the season. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, Krakouer announced his retirement from AFL football.

Education Schiller was educated at Tyttenhanger Lodge Preparatory School near St. Albans and then at Gresham's School, Holt, from 1909 to 1914. He became head boy there, excelled at sprinting and won a mathematics scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. His education was interrupted by World War I, after which he took up his place at Cambridge University and briefly read Mathematics there from 1919 to 1920. He later studied for a Teachers Diploma at the London Day Training College (1923‚Äì1924). War service Before Schiller's intended arrival at Cambridge, World War I broke out and he volunteered for the army. He was commissioned into the Lincolnshire Regiment and spent most of the war on active service. He took part in the Battle of Mons, and in 1917 after being wounded in action received the Military Cross. Career Leaving Cambridge without a degree, between 1920 and 1923 Schiller taught Maths at the progressive Rendcomb School, a secondary school in Gloucestershire. He joined a committee of the Mathematical Association concerned with the teaching of Geometry. In 1924, after taking his Teacher's Diploma, he was appointed an Assistant Inspector of Schools by the Board of Education and began his career in its Whitehall offices. In 1925, he moved to Liverpool, where he rose to become District Inspector of Schools. From 1937 to 1946 he worked in Worcestershire. In 1946, following the Education Act 1944, he was appointed as the Ministry of Education's first Staff Inspector for Primary Education, based in London. He ran courses for primary teachers, often with Robin Tanner, and promoted progressive ideals and practice. In 1955 he retired from the Ministry and took up a post as senior lecturer at the Institute of Education to teach a course in primary education. This continued from 1956 to 1963, and his students included Leonard Marsh, Arthur Razzell and John Coe. After his formal retirement in 1963, Schiller continued to lecture and advise on education and also acted as an external examiner. He was appointed CBE in the 1955 Birthday Honours. He sat on the Plowden Committee at Goldsmiths' College and in the early 1970s influenced its new Postgraduate Primary Course. Publications Schiller published many articles on education. He also planned a book, but it was unfinished at his death. Family On 19 August 1925, Schiller married Lyndall Handover (born 18 April 1900, Acton, London), who was educated at Godolphin and Latymer School, the Royal Holloway College, University of London, and the London Day Training College for a Teachers' Diploma (1923‚Äì1924), where she met Schiller. She taught English and French, but on her marriage gave up teaching. They had three daughters, Gerda, Meryl and Lyris, and one son, Russell.

The band resulted from the merger of Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. In June 2006 the band released an EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends, which they sold to people by following the 2006 edition of Warped Tour and offering copies; it eventually sold 10,000 copies. The band signed to Fearless Records in August. A Lesson in Romantics was recorded in early 2007 with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount. Vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster left the band in March 2007 citing a lack of writing credit on the band's releases. Prior to the release of A Lesson in Romantics, \\"Black Cat\\", \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\", and \\"Jamie All Over\\" were made available for streaming. After the album's release, the band participated in the 2007 edition of Warped Tour. A Lesson in Romantics was released through Fearless in July. A music video for \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" was released in November, and the song was released as a single a month later. \\"Jamie All Over\\" was released as a single in May 2008 and a music video for the song was released two months later. The band then toured as part of the 2008 edition of Warped Tour. The music video for \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" earned two MTV Video Music Awards nominations in 2008. In January 2009 a music video was released for \\"Miserable at Best\\". A Lesson in Romantics is the band's most commercially successful release, eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was released on vinyl in November 2011. The album was featured on Rock Sounds 2014 list of the 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time. Mayday Parade would later go on to release the Anniversary version of the album called A Lesson in Romantics (Anniversary Edition), along with the commentary version, in 2017. The Anniversary edition of the album includes a previously unreleased song called \\"Coming Back With Winter\\", which includes the chorus from \\"Save Your Heart\\" (on Anywhere But Here). Background Mayday Parade was formed in the winter of 2005 following the merger of two local Tallahassee bands, Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. Kid Named Chicago featured vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster, guitarist Alex Garcia and drummer Jake Bundrick, while Defining Moment featured vocalist Derek Sanders, guitarist Brooks Betts, and bassist Jeremy Lenzo. In June 2006, their EP Tales Told by Dead Friends was released. The band followed the 2006 edition of Warped Tour, selling copies of the EP to people in line.Erickson 2007, p. 13 By the end of summer, the group had sold 10,000 copies of the EP. These sales caught the attention of Fearless Records, which signed Mayday Parade on August 29. Fearless label president Bob Becker said the group: \\"were really believable, they were obviously good musicians, and they were really tight sounding. And we already knew they were hard-working.\\" Between late September and early November, the band went on the Text on the Dance Floor tour with M√™l√©e, Wheatus, Brandtson, Lakes, and Fall of Transition. Tales Told by Dead Friends was re-released through Fearless on November 7. Composition and recording All of the songs on A Lesson in Romantics were written while touring after Warped Tour. The songs are about: \\"being in a relationship while you're on the road, and the different hardships that come with that.\\" Unlike the band's EP, the album was \\"more put together\\" and \\"more organized\\", according to Garcia. Sanders thought it stood up \\"pretty well\\" to the EP, noting that it was \\"just as catchy \\", but \\"more powerful.\\" \\"Jamie All Over\\" was originally recorded by Kid Named Chicago, Lancaster's previous band. Sanders claimed the song was \\"kind of a tough one to choose\\" because the band had a lot of new material to choose from, but felt \\"pretty happy\\" with its inclusion. \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" was one of the first songs the band wrote. According to Garcia, the final track was called \\"You Be the Anchor That Keeps My Feet on the Ground, I'll Be the Wings That Keep Your Heart in the Clouds\\" because the band was \\"trying to be poetic\\". Mayday Parade went into the studio in January 2007. Recording took place at Tree Sound, located in Atlanta, Georgia. The band worked with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount, who also engineered the sessions. \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" from Tales Told by Dead Friends was re-recorded because the song had previously received a big response from fans. Natalie VanLandingham provided additional vocals on \\"Jersey\\", while Daniel Lancaster provided additional vocals on \\"Jamie All Over\\". Mixing was done by Mark Needham, while Steve Hall mastered the album at Future Disc, located in McMinnville, Oregon. According to Mount, Lancaster's vocals for the album were \\"naked\\", implying no post recording editing had been done. Release Lancaster left the band in March 2007 citing a lack of writing credit on the band's releases. Lenzo and Bundrick filled in for Lancaster's vocals, while Garcia and Betts performed Lancaster's guitar parts. Garcia said this change made the guitars \\"sound more clear\\" and not \\"clutter[ed]\\"; on the other hand, the group found it hard working out who should sing Lancaster's parts. Lancaster's departure hurt Sanders personally as \\"he was a good friend\\". Later that month, the band supported Plain White T's on their U.S. tour. On April 4, \\"Black Cat\\" was made available for streaming via Hot Topic's Myspace profile. On April 13, the release of A Lesson in Romantics was announced. Between early May and late June, the band went on tour with support from Bedlight for Blue Eyes, Driver Side Impact, and Sick City. The track listing was revealed on May 18. On June 6, the band made \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" available for streaming via their Myspace profile. \\"Jamie All Over\\" was made available for streaming on June 19 via AbsolutePunk. A Lesson in Romantics was released on July 10 through Fearless Records. Mayday Parade appeared at Dirt Fest in Birch Run, Michigan, before touring as part of the 2007 edition of Warped Tour from mid July to early August. In August, the band went on tour with Olympia and Sound the Alarm. The music video for \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\", directed by Marco de la Torre, was filmed in September. In late September 2007, the band supported Paramore in Japan and Australia. The band went on a co-headlining tour with Madina Lake in October and November. The \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" music video was released on November 14, and the single was released on December 3. The band went on the Manwhores and Open Sores Tour alongside All Time Low, Every Avenue, and Just Surrender in January 2008. Between late January and late March, the band went on a package tour alongside Emery, As Cities Burn, Pierce the Veil and Cry of the Afflicted. In April and May, the band went on the Explosions In Your Pants Tour with support from My American Heart and the Graduate. A music video was filmed for \\"Jamie All Over\\" in May, and the single was released on May 20. Mayday Parade went on the 2008 edition of Warped Tour, playing all summer-long for the first time. Sanders explained that the group \\"finally felt like one of the real bands\\" on Warped Tour; they \\"had a bus for the first time this year\\". Following this, Independent Label Group, who help promote and market Fearless releases, persuaded Target Corporation to sell A Lesson in Romantics in its stores. The video for \\"Jamie All Over\\" was released through MTV on July 21. The song was released to radio on September 2. In October and November, the band supported All Time Low on the Compromising of Integrity, Morality, & Principles in Exchange for Money tour. A music video for \\"Miserable at Best\\", directed by Mark Staubach, was released on January 9, 2009 on the band's Myspace. =Reissues= A Lesson in Romantics was reissued on April 28, 2008, featuring an acoustic version of \\"Three Cheers for Five Years\\", as well as \\"One Man Drinking Games\\". On November 21, 2011, the album was released on vinyl with a different colored cover. A white vinyl edition was released a year later, on August 28, 2012. On January 27, 2017, a new music video was released for \\"Black Cat\\", directed by Max Moore. A 10th anniversary edition of the album featuring demos was released on March 17. To celebrate the anniversary, the band performed the album in full on tour between March and May. A UK leg of the tour is set to take place in September. The band also did commentary for every track on the album. Producer Kenneth Mount criticized the band on Twitter for not giving Lancaster credit in commentary, \\"I'm slightly confused why mayday parades commentary for lesson in romantics never mentions Jason Lancaster at all, voice of 50% of the album... Jason also recorded all his vocals naked for a lesson in romantics , that should totally make the commentary. I've waited ten years for that\\". Reception and legacy A Lesson in Romantics is considered a fan favorite. Daniel Thompson of Music Emissions wrote that: \\"every song is spectacular on this album and is a potential hit.\\" Despite its eventual success and acclaim, A Lesson In Romantics received little attention from professional music critics. Reviewers noted the improved sound from the band's debut EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends. Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk.net wrote that: \\"after their unimpressive release of the EP Tales Told By Dead Friends in November, the band's back with their debut album that will surely become one of your most played of the Summer.\\" Sputnikmusic reviewer Adam Knott gave the album a score of 4.5 out of 5, calling it \\"a hell of a lot better\\" than most pop punk records. A Lesson in Romantics debuted at number 8 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, staying on the chart for six weeks. The album finally dropped off on the chart dated March 1, 2008 before eventually returning on the chart on July 12. It stayed on the chart for 70 consecutive weeks. The album also charted on the Independent Albums chart, peaking at number 31. In January 2009, it was announced that the album had sold over 100,000 copies. The album would later become the band's biggest selling album, selling over 200,000 copies. A Lesson in Romantics and \\"Miserable at Best\\" were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in December 2017. idobi Radio included the album on their best of 2007 list. \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" was ranked at number 194 on the New York Posts 2007 list of best songs to download. In 2008, the music video for \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" was nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video and Video of the Year.

An electronic drum module is an electronic or digital music device in an electronic drum kit that serves as the central processing unit and sound module. The drum module creates or produces the drum kit sounds or other sounds selected by the drummer. By itself, a drum module cannot play or sound drum beats. It only produces drum sounds when a performer strikes electronic drum pads or acoustic drum kit instruments that have electronic \\"triggers\\" (or sensors) attached to them. When the electronic drum pads or trigger-equipped instruments are struck, this sends a signal to the drum module, which produces the corresponding electronic drum sound (or other sound). Even when drum pads and/or triggers are connected to a drum module, the drum module by itself does not make any audible sound. Like other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, the drum module only outputs an electronic signal. The performer can hear this signal by connecting headphones to the drum module (i.e., for individual practice) or by plugging the drum module into an amplifier and loudspeaker or PA system for audible practice or live performances. The drum module's output signal can also be patched into an audio console for concerts or sound recording. The nomenclature varies (see below). For example, electronic drum modules are called \\"percussion sound modules\\" in the case of Roland Corporation, or sometimes simply modules. A common colloquial term for this device is drum brain. (see below). Electronic drum modules are included with most complete electronic drum kits (which include a drum module and a set of drum pads). Electronic drum modules can also be purchased as stand-alone units. In this case, the performer must also purchase drum pads and/or triggers which she can attach to regular acoustic drums. An electronic drum module is a special- purpose electronic device which accepts input from the drummer via external triggers that are hit with regular drum sticks. With an electronic drum kit, the player hits triggering devices as a synthesizer player would strike the keys of the synthesizer keyboard. Triggers may be pads or cymbal-shaped devices or piezo-electric pick-ups similar in function to a guitar pick-up. When the triggers are struck or activated by the vibration of a drum or other instrument, the electronic drum module interprets the signal and outputs the specific voice assigned to that trigger. The sound (or \\"voice\\") may be a sample or synthesized reproduction of any of a wide variety of drum, cymbal, percussion or other instruments, or even vocal sounds. It is similar in concept to modern MIDI musical keyboard workstations or synthesizers especially in that any sound available within a given module can be assigned to any trigger plugged into the module. Most electronic drum modules come with a number of pre-programmed \\"kits\\" or \\"sets\\" - collections of drum kit voices assigned to specific triggers which emulate a traditional drum set (e.g., including drum and cymbal sounds). Many modules allow the player to save their own collections of sounds as additional kits and allow the player to recall them as desired. In effect, a single set of triggers may serve the same function as several traditional drum sets or collections of miscellaneous percussion instruments. Some modules may allow kits to be saved with labels such as: \\"rock kit\\", \\"jazz kit\\", and \\"hip-hop kit.\\" Others simply assign a number to each saved kit. Modules may allow varying degrees of control over individual sounds such as the relative volume of each trigger input or add electronic effects such as reverb or other effects. Most manufacturers also include more eclectic sounds in their modules, such as sounds from well-known drum machines, plus a large variety of ethnic percussion instruments, industrial music sounds, handclaps, and general percussion instruments or even vocal sounds. Manufacturers of electronic drum modules such as Roland Corporation have often built unusual playable sounds into the sound banks of their electronic drum modules to showcase the capabilities of the technology. Electronic drum modules also provide advanced features such as the ability to drive digital samplers. When used in conjunction with an electronic or digital sampler, the sounds that can be played with a drum module are practically unlimited. A drum module could be used to make any type of musical or natural sounds, from a piano or violin to ocean waves or other sound effects. Nomenclature =\\"Drum Brain\\"= While manufacturers such as Roland use \\"Percussion Sound Module,\\" such a term only describes a subset of the device's functions. \\"Drum brain\\" is a term used by drummers, equipment sellers, and other industry professionals to be more descriptive. The term \\"drum brain\\" is used to denote the fact that its primary function is to act as the central logic device within an electronic drum kit. =Electronic drum modules vs. \\"drum machines\\"= Furthermore, an electronic drum module is not to be confused with a drum machine, which is an earlier innovation. Similar to electronic drum modules, drum machines reproduce drum sounds and programmable sequences of drum patterns. However, they are essentially limited to this purpose. \\"Drum machines\\" were introduced in the 1980s as an accompaniment device, essentially, an \\"artificial drummer\\". In contrast, an electronic drum module is designed to be an integral part of an electronic drum kit‚Äîan interactively playable device, played (usually live) by an actual drummer as part of his or her electronic drum kit. =Electronic drum modules vs \\"sound modules\\"= Technically speaking, an electronic drum module typically contains its own \\"sound module\\". Although Roland refers to their electronic drum modules as \\"percussion sound modules\\", the term sound module is misleading in this context. In its purest sense, a sound module is a device that merely contains its own unique variety of sounds. The electronic drum module referred to in this article may be considered to contain a sound module; however the distinction of an electronic drum module is that it contains the logic circuits to serve specifically as a conversion device: its first goal is to \\"read\\" drum play, its second task is to convert that \\"play\\" into audible sounds. It may be considered a combination of two components: an analog-to- digital converter, which converts the drum play (analog) into digital signals, with the latter task alone being the domain of a true \\"sound module\\".

Since being forced into early retirement in 2005 at the age of 29 through injury, he has become a goalkeeping coach; he is currently employed in this capacity at Brighton & Hove Albion, whom he represented as a player between 2003 and 2005. Early Career at Middlesbrough Roberts began his career at Middlesbrough F.C. on the Youth Training Scheme in 1991, aged 16, and quickly graduated through the ranks, making his first team debut aged 19 in the Anglo Italia Cup in Ancona. Loan spells at Hartlepool United in 1994, Wycombe Wanderers during the 1994/1995 season and Bradford City in 1996 preceded his Premier League debut against Sheffield Wednesday in February 1997. Also in 1997, Roberts made one appearance for England at under-21 level.CNN Sports Illustrated After an injury to Mark Schwarzer, Roberts finished the ill-fated 1996/97 season as Middlesbrough's first-choice goalkeeper, notably playing in the 1997 FA Cup Final, League Cup final replay and the club's remaining Premier League games (Schwarzer was cup-tied for the FA Cup run anyway). He is remembered among Middlesbrough supporters for conceding a goal after only 43 seconds by Roberto Di Matteo of Chelsea in the FA Cup Final. Roberts' remaining time with Middlesbrough saw him struggle with fitness and injuries, and between back operations he spent time on loan at Millwall and Luton Town in 1999 and 2000. He helped Millwall reach the 1999 Football League Trophy Final, where they lost to Wigan Athletic. Later career Roberts transferred to Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2000. While with Charlton, he had further loan spells at Reading, Luton and Brighton & Hove Albion, before making a permanent move to Brighton in 2003. His only appearance for Charlton had come on the last day of the 2002/2003 season, Roberts playing as a substitute against Fulham after Dean Kiely was sent off. Roberts contributed to Brighton's promotion-winning season in 2003/2004, making 35 appearances as first-choice goalkeeper, the season culminating in victory in the 2004 League One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium against Bristol City. However, in 2005, a recurrent back injury forced him to retire from playing at the age of 29. After retirement After retiring, Roberts went to university, graduating from Roehampton University with a first class honours degree in sports science and coaching, and won the Adidas 'Pursuit of Excellence' award for his dissertation, which was entitled 'A Biomechanical Analysis of a Football Goalkeeper's Jumping Technique'. Coaching career In June 2009, having briefly come out of retirement to join Derry City in 2007, Roberts was appointed the goalkeeper coach and chief scout at Yeovil Town. During the two seasons he spent at Yeovil Town, he assisted in the development of goalkeepers Alex McCarthy and Stephen Henderson, making a substitute appearance himself in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Swindon Town in October 2010, his first league match in six years.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9096911.stm On 29 December 2010, he left Yeovil Town to return to their League One rivals Charlton Athletic. During his tenure at Charlton, Roberts oversaw the early careers of Rob Elliot, Ben Hamer, Neil Etheridge, Marko Dmitrovic, Dillon Phillips, David Button and Nick Pope. On 23 June 2015, Roberts returned to Brighton & Hove Albion as goalkeeping coach, replacing Antti Niemi, who had left for Finland that summer. During the last four seasons he has played a pivotal role in the careers of the Goalkeepers at the Sussex club. Amongst those that Roberts has coached and developed during this period are Mat Ryan, David Stockdale, Christian Walton and Robert Sanchez. Outside football After retiring from football in 2005, Roberts took a year out before university to backpack around the world, which included a 6-month spell living in Brazil where he closely studied Brazilian training methods. He is also a keen runner, taking part in the London Marathon and Great North Run for the Asthma UK charity.

Tougher cuts such as chuck steak, bottom round, short ribs and 7-bone roast are preferred for this technique. While the toughness of the fibers makes them unsuitable for oven roasting, slow cooking tenderizes the meat as the liquid exchanges some of its flavor with the beef. Browning the roast before adding liquid is an optional step to improve the flavor. Browning can occur at lower temperatures with a longer cooking time, but the result is less intense than a high temperature sear. Either technique can be used when making pot roast. The result is tender, succulent meat and a rich liquid that lends itself to gravy. In North America, where it is also known as \\"Yankee pot roast\\",pot roast Definition in the Food Dictionary at Epicurious.com the dish is often served with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and onions simmered in the cooking liquid. Pot roast is an American variation of the French dish boeuf √† la mode that has been modified by influences from German Americans and American Jews. Origins According to food writer James Beard, French immigrants to New England brought their cooking method called √† l'√©touff√©e for tenderizing meats.

He posed as a tourist himself when committing the murders, for which British tabloids nicknamed him \\"the tourist from Hell\\". He cut up all his victims' bodies, using butchery skills he had acquired in prison, before disposing of them. Martin was arrested in Singapore (where he had killed Lowe) when he returned there after murdering the Damudes. Photographs of decomposed body parts were shown as evidence during his trial, making it \\"one of the most grisly\\" ever heard in Singapore. He defended himself by saying that Lowe's death was an accident and that a friend of his killed the Damudes. The judge did not believe Martin's account of events and sentenced him to death by hanging, making him the first Briton since Singapore's independence from Britain and Malaysia to be given the death penalty. He is also one of the first Westerners to be executed in Singapore since independence, the first one being Johannes Van Damme. Early life John Martin Scripps was born in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, 9 December 1959 to Leonard and Jean Scripps, an East End lorry driver and a Fleet Street barmaid respectively. He travelled often in childhood, occasionally accompanied by his father, with whom he was very close. Leonard Scripps committed suicide when his son was nine.The Times (19 April 1996) mentions John was eight at the time, while Tan in Body Parts (p. 191) says he was 10. After his father's death, Scripps developed problems with reading and writing, which led to him leaving school at the age of 15. After dropping out of school he continued to travel, raising money for his trips by doing odd jobs and selling antiques. Criminal career Scripps was convicted of his first crime in May 1974, when he was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge and fined ¬£10 by Highgate Juvenile Court for burglary. The punishment did nothing to deter him from stealing, and by August 1976 he had stolen again three times. In June 1978, he was fined ¬£40 for indecent assault.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 191‚Äì192. While traveling in Mexico, Scripps met Mar√≠a Pilar Arellanos, of Canc√∫n, and married her in 1980.In Body Parts, p. 192, Tan says that Martin met Mar√≠a in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They travelled together for two years until 1982, when he was sentenced to a three- year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset Mar√≠a, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during home leave in June 1985‚Äîjust months short of completing his term‚Äîand burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on home leave. He was appeased only when she divorced her new husband and returned to her hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to John Martin.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 192‚Äì193. Scripps began trafficking in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered his name in 1987, when he was arrested at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 193‚Äì194. He was in custody at Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight from February 1992 to August 1993, where he became a model prisoner. Initially he did menial jobs such as dishwashing and general cleaning and was later promoted to the position of butcher, under the training of James Quigley, a prison caterer with more than 20 years' experience, and another inmate only identified as \\"Ginger\\", who had been a professional butcher. They taught him how to dismember and remove the bone from animals after slaughtering them. Martin performed his duties with such efficiency that he once told Quigley he wished to open a butcher's shop after his release. On 20 August 1993, Martin was transferred from Albany Prison to The Mount Prison in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, as a result of a change in his security categorisation. In October 1994 he escaped while on home leave, which was granted only two days after being refused parole. His mother, noting that he had sold all his belongings to fellow inmates while in prison (a clear notice of his intention to escape), asked prison authorities not to release him. After Martin was sentenced to death, she reiterated: His mother gave Scripps ¬£200 to go overseas after his arrest. To avoid recapture, he used the birth certificate of another inmate, Simon James Davis, to get a passport in Davis's name.Tan, Body Parts, p. 195. Within a month of his escape, he turned up in Mexico as John Martin. He reported to the British Embassy there that he had lost his passport, and managed to get a replacement. Martin arrived in Singapore from San Francisco at about 2 a.m. SST on 8 March 1995 (6 p.m. UTC on 7 March).Tan, Body Parts, p. 42. Murder of tourists Martin killed at least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and was investigated for other murders in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and converse with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse to be in their rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall. =Gerard Lowe= River View Hotel (now Four Points by Sheraton Singapore). Gerard George Lowe came from Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a chemical engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore to shop for electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: \\"I will call you the moment I check into the hotel to give you the contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March.\\" When Lowe arrived at Singapore Changi Airport on the morning of 8 March, he was approached by Martin (under the assumed name of Simon Davis), who struck up a conversation with him and suggested that they share a room, to which Lowe agreed. They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 57‚Äì59. On 13 March 1995, a pair of legs, severed at the knees, was found in a plastic bag floating off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found. =Sheila and Darin Damude= Sheila Mae Damude and her son Darin Jon Damude came from Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. She was an administrator at the Pacific Christian School in Victoria, while Darin was a college student. They had come to Thailand on holiday, with Darin flying to Asia first before Sheila met him in Bangkok during spring break. They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) who was sitting in the same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11 a.m. THA (5 a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.Tan, Body Parts, p. 67. Martin checked out and returned to Singapore on 19 March. On that day the skulls of the Damudes were found in a disused tin mine in Kathu district.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 79‚Äì80. A torso and a pair each of arms and legs were found along Bahn Nai Trang Road, 9.7 kilometres (6 mi) away, five days later. The body parts were so badly decomposed that visual identification was impossible; Royal Thai Police used dental records to identify the skulls and forensic analysis concluded that the torso, arms, and legs were likely to be Sheila's. The other parts of Darin's body were never found.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 108‚Äì112. =Unconfirmed victims= Scotland Yard suspected Martin of having separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed with his wife about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of ¬£21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall is believed to have been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed.Tan, Body Parts, p. 197. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Canc√∫n, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Canc√∫n the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth ¬£4,000, after which he disappeared. Martin was also wanted in San Francisco in the United States for the murder of sex worker Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house at the time of the murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona. Arrest and remand Passport of Darin Damude with Martin's photo Martin was arrested when he arrived at Changi Airport on the evening of 19 March 1995 and produced a passport with his assumed name, Simon Davis. Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone by that name.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 20‚Äì21. In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and cut his wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 97‚Äì101. The police found five passports on Martin in addition to his own‚Äîtwo British passports issued to Simon Davis, two Canadian passports issued to Sheila and Darin Damude, and a South African passport issued to Gerard Lowe‚Äîeach with Martin's photograph affixed. They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 lb), a battery-operated Z-Force III electroshock weapon, a can of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand foldable knives, an oilstone and two Swiss army knives. Importation of some of these into Singapore is illegal.Tan, Body Parts, pp. 102‚Äì104. On 21 March 1995, Martin was taken to court on an initial charge, naming him as Simon James Davis and accusing him of forging Lowe's signature on a DBS Bank credit card transaction slip to obtain S$6,000 in cash on 9 March. Three days later, he was charged under his real name for the murder of Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (forging Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the glass panel), possession of an offensive weapon (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis at the time of his arrest). On 18 September, a preliminary enquiry in a district court was held to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 photographs that the prosecution had prepared as evidence. Trial Before the trial, Martin made a statement explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe appear to be a homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and \\"hit [Lowe] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor.\\"Tan, Body Parts, p. 134. A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, \\"I am not sure what was the next thing I did ... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days.\\"Tan, Body Parts, p. 139. He refused to identify his friend, saying, \\"I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain.\\"Tan, Body Parts, p. 142. On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met. In court, Martin argued that he was by nature not a violent person. \\"I may have worked in the (prison) butchery, but cutting up a human body is another thing. When I saw the photographs (of Lowe's body parts), it made me feel sick.\\" He maintained that he had killed Lowe after the latter made homosexual advances that caused him to \\"freak out\\"; he had previously fended off homosexual attacks twice while imprisoned: in Israel in 1978, and in England in 1994. When Deputy Public Prosecutors Jennifer Marie and Norul Rashid asked him what he did after killing Lowe, he said that he could not remember anything because he had drunk heavily and consumed Valium after Lowe's death until he was arrested. He repeated that he had not killed the Damudes, and that he had come back to Singapore from Phuket to clear his conscience about Lowe's death. On 7 November, Judge T. S. Sinnathuray adjourned the trial for three days to consider his verdict. (Singapore abolished jury trials in 1969.) When the trial resumed, the judge was satisfied that the prosecution had made its case and dismissed Martin's version of events. In his verdict, he said: Appeal and hanging On 15 November 1995, Martin announced he would appeal against the sentence. He later dropped the appeal without giving an explanation on 4 January 1996, four days before it was to have been heard. He turned down a subsequent chance to petition the President of Singapore for clemency, saying that he was impatient to be executed. In the days before his hanging, Martin wrote of an \\"emptiness\\" inside him and lamented that no one had loved him besides his family and his ex-wife Mar√≠a, in a series of misspelled notes (he was semi-literate): He complained that in prison, \\"You are told every day that you are not a member of the uman rase [a misspelling of 'human race'].\\" The week before he was due to hang, he dreamed that he had avoided the sentence by committing suicide: Martin's mother remarked, \\"Whoever he is now, he's the person the prison service trained him to be. These bastards have no right to take my son's life. I brought him into the world. I am the only person who can take him out of it.\\" However, no one formally protested against the hanging. At dawn on 19 April 1996, after a last meal of pizza and hot chocolate, 36-year-old John Martin Scripps was hanged in Changi Prison together with two Singaporean drug traffickers. On that day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Thai Police closed their files on the murders of Sheila and Darin Damude, declaring the case effectively solved. When Martin's ex-wife Mar√≠a heard that he had been hanged, she said: Post-death coverage The cover of Body Parts In May 1996, Tan Ooi Boon, a reporter from The Straits Times who covered Martin's case from start to finish, wrote a book on the case, titled Body Parts: A British Serial Killer in Singapore. He wrote the book in three months using material he had prepared for the newspaper. It mixed fictional narrative with fact and described how Martin disposed of his victims' bodies. In July 1996, the story of how Martin murdered Gerard Lowe, and the investigation that followed, was featured in an episode of the Singapore Crimewatch, which was shown on Television Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5 and Channel 8. In the episode, the real evidence of the case and actual photographs from the autopsy were shown, causing the series to be the first current affairs programme in Singapore to be given the PG (Parental Guidance) warning tag. Police justified their use of the photographs, saying that they wanted to \\"give an accurate account of the case to the public.\\" The story was also re-enacted in the last episode of the first season of MediaCorp TV's Channel 5 docu-drama True Files on 1 August 2002. On 31 January 1997, eight police officers who made significant contributions towards Martin's conviction were awarded commemorative plaques by the High Commissioner for Canada in Singapore, Barry Carin.

His name is used to describe the non cancerous Campbell de Morgan spot; bright red spots that may appear on the skin in later life and which he was the first to note in medical literature. Life He was born at Clovelly near Bideford, Devon, England in 1811 into a family with a long association with the British East India Company, originally of Huguenot stock. The mathematician Augustus De Morgan was an older brother. He trained at University College Hospital, London and went on to be a house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital where he remained for the rest of his career. He was actively involved in the Middlesex Hospital Medical School from its foundation in 1835 and was a close associate of its founder, Sir Charles Bell. In 1841 he became a lecturer in forensic medicine and in 1845 professor of anatomy. In 1861, on the basis of a paper on the structure and development of bone, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He also pursued an interest in the arts. He was a talented musician who studied the science of music, and was a gifted caricaturist. His death in 1876 was caused by his sitting up throughout the night of 6 April at the bedside of his close friend, the artist John Graham Lough. Lough was critically ill with pneumonia and died the following morning. De Morgan himself then developed pneumonia and pleurisy from which he himself died on 12 April. He was married to Kate Hudson and they had two sons Walter and John. A bust of Campbell De Morgan by John Graham Lough is located at the Middlesex Hospital, London.

He was a member of the British Interplanetary Society and British Astronomical Association,The County Express for Worcestershire and Staffordshire, August 4th 1978 and became president of Bilston Rotary Club,Express and Star Newspaper Friday Jan 15th 1993 and High Chief Ranger of the Ancient Order of Foresters.Express and Star Newspaper, Friday October 11th, 1961. He was also a member of Bilston Tennis Club, was elected a member of Bilston Borough Council and in due course was appointed a magistrate. Writings In 1955 he was asked to talk at Bilston Rotary Club when the scheduled speaker cancelled. He spoke on space and astronomy, and as a result was asked to speak at nearby Coseley library during Science Fiction week. In preparation he read a large number of science fiction books, was not impressed, and thought he could do better. At the age of 47 he wrote his first book in secret under the pseudonym of Hugh Walters. He later said: \\"As I was also a magistrate and a local councillor, I felt [that writing science fiction] left me open to ridicule. People tend to treat science fiction as a bit of a joke, so I juggled with my name and came up with Hugh Walters.\\" Express and Star Newspaper Friday Jan 30th 1984 Of his writing Walters said: \\"I believe a good SF story should (1) entertain, (2) educate painlessly, and (3) inspire the young people of today to be the scientists and technicians of tomorrow\\" His first novels mostly dealt with the exploration of other planets in our solar system. Written for a juvenile audience, they had a scientific foundation, anticipating such advances as ion engines. Walters turned to writing novels concerning alien visits after all the planets had been explored. The main characters in his novels were two British astronauts, an American, and a Russian. Their names were Chris Godfrey, Tony Hale, Morrey Kant and Serge Smyslov, respectively. Later missions used a pair of telepathic twins, Gill and Gail Patrick, for communication. The covers of the first 14 books had cover illustrations by the Faber and Faber illustrator Leslie Wood. His books are still present on the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society recommended reading list for children and young adults.

It is located at 37 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The house was designed by Howell's wife, Elinor Mead, and occupied by the family from 1873-1878. Authors including Mark Twain, Henry James, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Thomas Bailey Aldrich visited the Howells in this house, as did President James Garfield, and Helen Keller lived there afterwards while attending school. History As early as August 1872, William Dean Howells wrote to his brother-in-law that he had purchased land on Concord Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts for 33 cents per square foot.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 184. The family moved into their new home there on July 7, 1873.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 181. Howells and his wife agreed it was \\"the prettiest house in Cambridge\\" and intended to live there for the rest of their lives.Lynn, Kenneth S. William Dean Howells: An American Life. New York: Harcout Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1970: 193. The Howells family left the home in 1878, after which they moved to Redtop in Belmont, Massachusetts. By 1900, they had purchased a home near Gloucester, Massachusetts. After the death of his wife Elinor Mead Howells in May 1910, Howells considered moving back to the Concord Avenue home with his daughter Mildred. Without Mrs. Howells, however, they found it \\"dreadful in its ghostliness and ghastliness\\" and, further, that the area had become noisy since the addition of two trolley lines nearby.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 402. Before moving to the Concord Avenue house, the Howells family had lived, from 1866 to 1872, in a house (built in 1857) a few blocks north of Harvard University, at 41 Sacramento Street in Cambridge. Unlike the Concord Avenue house, the Sacramento Street house is not on the National Register of Historic Places, but does have a city of Cambridge historic landmark designation. =Recent history= In recent times, this house fell into very serious disrepair, but was in 2011 restored by a local historic-restoration-specialist builder, after consultations with the City of Cambridge Historical Commission.

Jody Bleyle first gained public attention in the Pacific Northwest music scene of the 1990s, in the Portland, Oregon‚Äìbased band Hazel. Prior to Hazel, she was in the college band Lovebutt while she was a student at Reed College. Hazel was formed in 1992, released two albums on the Sub Pop label, to critical acclaim. Jody Bleyle played drums and sang for the band. In 1993, Bleyle teamed up with Donna Dresch and Kaia Wilson to create the band Team Dresch, in which she played guitar and sang. The group's first release was a single on the Kill Rock Stars label, which immediately garnered them much attention and they quickly became one of the defining bands of the Queercore scene. Their first LP, Personal Best, was co-released on both Dresch's label Chainsaw Records and Bleyle's label Candy Ass Records. Candy Ass Records went on to issue recordings by a number of bands including Hazel, Cypher in the Snow, and New Bad Things, but is best known for the 1995 release of the double-album compilation Free to Fight. Free To Fight was a multi media project incorporating both recordings by artists such as Lois Maffeo, Excuse 17, Heavens to Betsy, Fifth Column, and Bleyle's own band Team Dresch, as well as a seventy-two-page booklet featuring writers and artists such as bell hooks, Bridget Irish, and Roberta Gregory. The recording and booklet featured self-defense instructions for women, and Team Dresch toured with instructor Alice Stagg, who demonstrated defensive tactics onstage before the band performed. Jody Bleyle was interviewed for the film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane, in which she speaks about her record label and in particular, the Free To Fight project. This recording was later followed by a Free To Fight split single by the bands Sleater-Kinney and Cypher in the Snow. In the late 1990s Team Dresch broke up after releasing a number of singles and another LP, Captain, My Captain. After the breakup, Bleyle joined with Tamala Poljak of Longstocking and Whitney Skillcorn of The Little Deaths to form the band Infinite Xs. In 2002, the group released a recording on Chainsaw Records. Also in the early 2000s, Bleyle began performing with her brother in the group Family Outing. The band played at the Homo-A-GoGo festival in Olympia, Washington in 2002. In 2004 and 2005, Bleyle recorded and toured with Amy Ray for her second solo release, Prom, playing bass. Bleyle didn't play the third leg of the tour because her partner, actress Nina Landey, was pregnant. Their first son Twylo was born in July 2005 and their second son, Lucian, in 2007. In 2004, the group Lesbians on Ecstasy released their first album, Lesbians on Ecstasy featuring a revamped version of the Team Dresch song \\"Screwing Yer Courage\\", retitled \\"Summer Luv\\"; Jody Bleyle remixed this version for the follow-up Lesbians on Ecstasy album entitled Giggles in the Dark, released in 2005. In the summer of 2004, Team Dresch reunited for a concert at the biannual Homo-A-Go-Go festival. Afterwards, the band members decided to reunite for a series of concerts and Team Dresch has been touring and recording again since then.

Scoop. offering affordable, reliable and faster connections between major North Island cities. InterCity and Entrada Travel Group are controlled by Ritchies Transport and Tranzit Group, each owning 46%. History InterCity is the direct successor to New Zealand Railways Road Services long-distance routes. New Zealand Railways' rail and road services were combined in 1985 as the Passenger Business Group of the New Zealand Railways Corporation. InterCity began in 1987 as the brand for long-distance rail and road services. In 1991 the rail-based assets were transferred to New Zealand Rail and the long distance buses and InterCity name were bought by InterCity Management Limited, a group of seven of the country's largest private coach companies - Whangarei Bus Services, Bayline Group, Ritchies Transport, Tranzit Group, Guthreys Coachlines, Nelson SBL and PTL Route Services - as a franchise-based operation. Each of the franchisees is responsible for operating set routes, usually close to their home base. Of the original seven franchisees four remain, with one new franchisee (SDK Ltd) operating services in Northland where Whangarei Bus Services previously held the franchise. Over the years the company name has changed from InterCity Coachlines Ltd to Coachnet NZ Ltd, followed by InterCity Group Ltd and InterCity Holdings Ltd. In 2019, the group name changed from InterCity Group to Entrada Travel Group. Trademark protection In 2014 InterCity Group won a landmark Google Adwords case against competitor Nakedbus in the Auckland High Court for breach of trade mark. High Court Judgement CIV-2012-404-007532 from www.nzherald.co.nz, retrieved 18 February 2014 Justice Raynor Asher ruled that Nakedbus deliberately infringed InterCity Group Limited‚Äôs trade mark ‚ÄòINTERCITY‚Äô, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct that confused consumers, and illegitimately attempted to pass its business off as InterCity‚Äôs. Nakedbus ran advertisements on Google which would respond to searches for InterCity Group‚Äôs trade mark, INTERCITY, and which promoted Nakedbus buses as \\"inter city\\" in both the advertisements and on the corresponding website. The Court has confirmed that this was part of a misleading strategy to \\"hook\\" InterCity customers into travelling to the Nakedbus website, using InterCity‚Äôs trade mark to confuse them into thinking that Nakedbus was some sort of affiliate. Nakedbus argued that the words \\"inter\\" and \\"city\\" were just descriptors for domestic bus services. This argument was emphatically rejected by the Court. It recognised that ‚ÄòInterCity‚Äô is a distinctive and well known New Zealand brand which is entitled to the usual statutory protections. Expansion In 2006 Entrada Travel Group purchased Kings Dolphin Cruises, a Paihia based operator of sightseeing cruises and day tours. This purchase was the group's first foray beyond road passenger transport services. It also increased InterCity's exposure to the tourism market. Entrada Travel Group's footprint in the tourism market increased again in December 2007 when it added the Tourism Holdings Limited Ltd businesses of Great Sights and Fullers Bay of Islands by way of a joint venture. Financial & Investor Information from www.thlnz.co.nz, retrieved 21 December 2007 In December 2008 Tourism Holdings sold its 49% stake in InterCity Holdings Limited to InterCity Group for $9.5m. In August 2016, the company was awarded the license to operate sightseeing services in New Zealand as Gray Line, the world's largest sightseeing brand.http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/83572996/intercity-buys-kiwi-franchise- of-gray-line In 2019, Entrada Travel Group acquired Auckland Whale & Dolphin Safari, which hosts thousands of guests every year aboard the 20 metre catamaran Dolphin Explorer on the daily 4.5hr cruise from Auckland's Viaduct Harbour.

GreatSights New Zealand GreatSights New Zealand logo GreatSights New Zealand is InterCity Group's daily sightseeing subsidiary operating day tours and sightseeing from Auckland, Rotorua, Christchurch and Queenstown to the Bay of Islands, the Waitomo Caves, Hobbiton, Rotorua, Aoraki, Te Anau and Milford Sound. GreatSights was formed in October 1987 following acquisition of the coach assets of Fourways Coachlines by various Newmans Group companies and was subsequently taken over by Corporate Investments Limited (CIL), then in 1993 by The Helicopter Line (later renamed Tourism Holdings Ltd, THL). Glass-roofed double-decker Volvo B12 coaches were introduced onto the Milford Sound route in 1996. In 1998 THL purchased a number of assets from Mount Cook Group including the Gray Line New Zealand franchise, which GreatSights operated until 2006. In 2000 GreatSights opened a visitor information centre at 180 Quay Street, Auckland. This became the departure point for all GreatSights day tours from Auckland. The centre was closed following InterCity's acquisition of GreatSights, as InterCity already operated a similar visitor information centre on Hobson Street. Also as a result of the acquisition, in April 2008 the Newmans Coach Lines brand gradually began to be removed from routes that were operated by GreatSights. In recent years GreatSights has enjoyed strong growth in line with rising visitor arrivals into New Zealand. A number of new routes and tour options have been added to the network including a new Waitomo & Rotorua tour in 2009. Coinciding the complete fleet upgrade in 2016 the brand was refreshed and saw the introduction of diamond device to symbolize the relationship between the company's operations on land and sea. Fullers GreatSights Fullers GreatSights is a sub brand of GreatSights, operating cruise, ferry and land sightseeing tours from the Bay of Islands. The head office is based in the visitor centre in the Maritime Building on Paihia's waterfront, with a visitor centre in Russell and a workshop in Opua.Fullers Contact Details The Fullers business was founded in 1886 when Albert Ernest Fuller started a business delivering coal and other essential supplies to islands in the Bay of Islands in his vessel the Undine. Fuller branched out into tourism in 1927 when he started the Cream Trip service transporting cream from the islands to the mainland. Tourists would pay to ride on the Cream Trip and over time the focus of the service changed from deliveries and transport to one of sightseeing and tourism.History of Fullers The business has expanded substantially over the years and today its primary focus is tourism, although it does also operate passenger and vehicle ferries. The Fullers GreatSights product range includes: *The Cream Trip *Hole in the Rock dolphin-watching cruises *Dolphin swimming cruises *Ninety Mile Beach and Cape Reinga day tours *Excursions in and around Kerikeri and Russell *Discover Hokianga *Vehicle ferries between Opua and Okiato *Passenger ferries between Russell and Paihia In 2009 Fullers Bay of Islands was rebranded Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands, providing connection to InterCity's sightseeing tours in the rest of New Zealand, and a new awesomeNZ brand was introduced. The Kings Dolphin Cruises, Northern Exposure and Awesome Adventures brands were removed. AwesomeNZ branded excursions include Ninety Mile Beach day tours and Milford Sound day tours. In 2016 the rebrand of the main GreatSights brand saw the name shortened to Fullers GreatSights. Newmans Coach Lines 200px Newman Bros. Nelson-Reefton mail coach crossing the Buller River on the Nine Mile Punt circa 1910 displaying Cobb & Co brand Ansair Flxible Clipper as operated by Newman from 1955 Newmans Coach Lines began in Nelson in 1879 with brothers Tom and Harry Newman offering a horse-drawn coach service delivering mail around the Nelson region. The business grew rapidly and expanded to include passenger services, at first throughout the South Island and later into the North Island. In 1911 the first motor vehicle - a four-cylinder Cadillac - was introduced and in 1918 the last horse-drawn carriage was retired from service. Newmans remained a family-owned business until 1972 when it merged with Transport (Nelson) Ltd, a trucking and mining company. There followed a period of expansion where the Newmans brand encompassed tours, rental cars and campervans and a short-lived airline brand Newmans Air which evolved into Ansett New Zealand. In 1988 Corporate Investments Limited took over the business and several routes were withdrawn. In 1991 an agreement was reached where competitor Mount Cook Group ceased operating in the North Island and Newmans ceased operating in the South Island. This step was not enough and in 1992 TTRB Ltd, a consortium of four coach operators (Tranzit Group, Taranaki Coachlines, Ritchies Transport and Bayline Group), took over Newmans Coach Lines. By 1994 two of the consortium members had withdrawn and the remaining two shareholders Tranzit and Ritchies operated it as a separate business until the Auckland power crisis in 1998 when Newmans was integrated into the InterCity Group business. From 1995 to 2007 the Newmans brand was used on both sightseeing day tours and passenger route services. From 2008 the Newmans brand was withdrawn from sightseeing day tours in favour of GreatSights, but Newmans coach services still run between Christchurch, Queenstown, Wanaka and the West Coast glaciers. From 1987 until 1993, operations were operated in the Australian cities of Cairns and Sydney as Newmans Coach Lines. Hauraki Blue Cruises In 2009 Fullers GreatSights launched the cruise catamaran Ipipiri, a 44.5m (146 foot) vessel with four levels including sundeck, restaurant and bar, and 30 ocean view cabins offering accommodation for up to 60. Ipipiri operated in the Bay of Islands for five seasons as an overnight cruise ship and was available for conferences, events and weddings. In 2014 Ipipiri was relocated to Auckland. Trading as Hauraki Blue Cruises under the GreatSights brand, it offered overnight cruises, lunch cruises, and a charter venue for weddings, conferences and events in the Hauraki Gulf. Hauraki Blue Cruises ceased operating in July 2017. Skip Bus Skip Bus is a low cost, express bus company launched by InterCity in November 2018. It offers bus travel between many North Island destinations, including Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua, Taupo, Tauranga and Wellington.

He published his Memoirs (Recorda√ßoens) in 1813 in exile in London, which remain a significant source on Portuguese economic life in the period. Early life This engraving of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake shows the ruins of Lisbon in flames and a tsunami overwhelming the ships in the harbour. His father was Jacques (in Portugal called J√°come) Ratton (died M√¢con, France in 1779), the son of a Conseil du Roi (in effect a public prosecutor) in M√¢con of the same name, and his wife Jeanne Orsel. Soon after the birth of his eldest son by his marriage to Fran√ßoise Bellon (died M√¢con, 1794), daughter of Jacques Bellon and a mother of the Berard family,J√°come Ratton, Recorda√ß√µes de J√°come Ratton, Fenda, 3rd Edition, Lisbon, 1992, p. 19 Jacques emigrated to Portugal, where his brother- in-law Jacques Bellon was already established in Porto, married to Marie Purat. Jacques Ratton emigrated to Portugal soon after the birth of his son J√°come, who was brought up by his grandparents and educated in France, before joining his parents at the age of fourteen in Portugal ‚Äì a pattern typical of the French mercantile community, which J√°come was to repeat with his own children. His Memoirs stress the importance of this ‚Äì he is highly critical of the backwardness of the Portuguese mercantile classes, who he said hardly used double-entry bookkeeping and were generally unbusiness-like in their ways. In 1758, J√°come Ratton married Ana Isabel Clamous, daughter of the French Consul in Porto (again, a son would marry the daughter of another Consul), and in 1762, when France and Portugal were on opposite sides in the Seven Years' War, he was naturalised as Portuguese. However, the Introduction to the 1920 Coimbra edition of his memoirs mentions that, nearly fifty years later, his Portuguese has \\"irregularidades gramaticais\\".Memoirs, Coimbra, p. vii His father had moved to Lisbon and was in business, including a partnership with his brother-in-law in Oporto; after Jacome was established in business he retired to France. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, vividly described in the Memoirs, caused great losses for the business: 300,000 cruzados, according to the Memoirs. Industrialist Jacome was an inventive and successful businessman, whose enterprises included a dye-works, a textile mill in Tomar, a paper mill in Elvas, and factories making felt hats in Elvas and Lisbon, the building for which still exists. The Tomar textile mill was the first in Portugal to use modern machinery, and created what was until recently the main industry of the town. The hats were made under a monopoly, though he criticises these in his Memoirs, saying that businessmen should be rewarded with titles instead. He traded in cloth, cognac, Bohemian window-glass, and other products. He invested in sea-salt making at Alcochete, near his country estate, and was also responsible for introducing the eucalyptus to Portugal (a rather mixed blessing), as well as the Araucaria (\\"monkey-puzzle tree\\"). His memoirs recount how he made designs for a type of water-pump new to Portugal from a Dutch print. Protege of Pombal The Marquis of Pombal, the Portuguese prime minister, was keen to encourage industry in Portugal, and consulted with Ratton, although it was not until after Pombal's death that he was made a member of the Real Junta de Commercio, Agricultura, e Navega√ß√£o, which played an important part in Pombal's efforts to stimulate, and regulate, Portuguese commerce. Ratton was made a Knight of the Order of Christ (who had opposed his mill at their headquarters in Tomar) and ennobled as a nobleman of the royal household. He lived in Lisbon in the neo-classical Ratton Palace, near his hattery, which (partly remodelled by his son Diogo) is now the home of the Portuguese Constitutional Court, with a large country estate at Barroca d‚ÄôAlva on the Tagus estuary as well, where he reclaimed land. War and exile Terceira Island seen from the Space Shuttle The French invasion of 1807 not only destroyed commerce but put the Franco-Portuguese community, of which Jacombe was the most prominent member, in a difficult position. It did not help that General Paul Thi√©bault, the chief-of-staff to Junot, the French commander, had billeted himself at Jacome's house, and they became friends. After they lost the Battle of Vimeiro in 1808, the French negotiated a withdrawal from Portugal with the British (to the fury of British public opinion). In June 1810 the Regency government in Lisbon persuaded the Prince- Regent in Rio de Janeiro to dismiss Jacome from the Junta after twenty-two years, and in September the same year he was arrested along with many \\"radicals\\" and exiled to the small island of Terceira in the Azores. He managed, perhaps through his Freemason connections, to convert this into exile in England, where he remained until ca. 1816, before moving to Paris, where he died. The King had invited him to return to Portugal, but though several of his children were there, he declined.Mahul, Annuaire Necrologique, 1821. Older Portuguese sources had stated that he died in Lisbon in 1821 or 1822 He married Ana Isabel Clamouse, daughter of Bernard Clamouse, from Languedoc, and Genevi√®ve Hartsoeker (she was probably the granddaughter of the scientist Nicolaas Hartsoeker), and they had four sons and four daughters.http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=52192 J√°come Ratton in a Portuguese Genealogical site His son Diogo Ratton was appointed to a commission to improve Portuguese commerce; when no report was published he began to publish his own views in 1821 in a series of short works: Reflex√µes sobre o Commercio, sobre as Alfandegas, sobre os Depositos, e sobre as Pautas with his proposal for a \\"Tribunal do Commercio\\" and other reforms. Diogo's letters to Ant√≥nio Araujo de Azevedo, Comte da Barca (1812‚Äì1817) were published in 1973 (Paris, Fondation C. Gulbenkian, 1973). His memoirs, whose short title was Recorda√ßoens de Jacome Ratton sobre ocurrencias do seu tempo em Portugal de Maio de 1747 Setembro de 1810, were published in Portuguese in London by H. Bryer in 1813. They were probably first written in French and a manuscript fair copy in French, with an inscription recording its presentation by Ratton to General Paul Thi√©bault, was on the English book market in the 2010s. There have been two 20th century Portuguese editions, Coimbra University Press, 1920 and Lisbon: Fenda, 1992. A school and a sports centre in Tomar are named after him.

This species, which may become threatened with the global decline of coral reefs, is a popular coral used in aquariums. Description A. echinata colonies crustlike to very thick and reach up to about a meter across. The thick-walled, circular corallites are cerioid or subplocoid. The septa have large teeth. The skeleton is covered with a folded fleshy tissue. They are usually dull in color, coming in shades of gray, brown, or green, but some can be bright and colorful.

Early years Elizabeth Thomas was born in London, the only child of Elizabeth Osborne (died 1719), aged 16, and lawyer Emmanuel Thomas (d. 1677), aged 60. Her father died when she was an infant, leaving Osborne to take care of her. Osborne and Thomas faced many financial difficulties while living in Surrey, but, after they returned to London to live in Great Russel Street. She was educated at home, was well read, and learned some French and Latin. Career Thomas educated herself by buying books and reading, and by her mid twenties, she was a confident poet, which lead her to sharing her poetry with literary men. As an impoverished gentlewoman, she was dependent on others for patronage, and she was fortunate to be part of an illustrious artistic and literary circle which included Lady Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, Judith Drake, Elizabeth Elstob, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, John Norris, and painter Sarah Hoadly, wife of Benjamin Hoadly. She sent John Dryden, an English poet, two poems not long before his death, and he responded, \\"your Verses were, I thought, too good to be a Woman's.\\"Greer, Germaine. Kissing the Rod: An Anthology of 17th-Century Women's Verse. London: Virago, 1988. 429. Print. Dryden then compared Thomas to Katherine Philips, another female poet. John Dryden was also who gave her her nome de plume, \\"Corinna\\". Her first known publication was an elegy, \\"To the Memory of the Truly Honoured John Dryden, Esq\\", published anonymously in the collection Luctus Britannici (1700). Thomas was engaged for sixteen years to Richard Gwinnett (1675‚Äì1717). The couple was not in a financial position to get married until 1716. Thomas later postponed the marriage in order to nurse her terminally ill mother. Gwinnett died the next year, and although he left Thomas a legacy, his family suppressed his will. After litigation, Thomas could not cover her legal costs. During their engagement they had maintained an extensive correspondence, much of which was published in Pylades and Corinna (1731‚Äì2) and The Honourable Lovers (1732; repr. 1736). Thomas was active and had a reputation in London and Bath literary circles. She experimented with a wide range of literary forms including lyrics, panegyrics, pastorals, polemics, religious meditations, and satires. Much of her poetry dealt with women's issues, particularly women's right to education, as women were in her time \\"still deny'd th'Improvement of our Mind.\\"Virginia Blain, et al., eds, \\"Thomas, Elizabeth,\\" The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1990. 1075). Her work initially circulated in manuscript, but due to financial necessity she published Miscellany Poems on Several Subjects anonymously in 1722, and thereafter sought publication. Her friend Henry Cromwell some time earlier had given Thomas some letters he had received from Alexander Pope. Needing money, Thomas sold these letters to Edmund Curll in 1726. Curll promptly published the letters in Miscellanea in Two Volumes (1726), much to the irritation of Pope. For this infraction he lampooned Thomas in The Dunciad as \\"Curll's Corinna\\" (II 66). A minor revenge was attributed to her by Pope ‚Äî the publication of Codrus, or, 'The Dunciad' Dissected (1728) ‚Äî though she was incarcerated at the time it was published. Her reputation was severely damaged by the notoriety, and she was long believed to have been Cromwell's mistress though there is no reason to believe that she was. Thomas continued to publish through the 1720s, but was unable to meet her debts and was jailed in the Fleet prison in 1727 for three years. Within a year of her release, Thomas died and was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street in 1731.  Themes  Elizabeth uses the theme of sarcasm multiple times throughout her poems to convey the importance of her message. For example, in her poem of \\"On Sir J- S- saying in a Sarcastic Manner, My books would make me Mad. An Ode\\" MS? LION RL (1722) By changing her voice and taking on the role as a man in her poem.

His nephew was the prominent Victorian civil engineer, Sir Joseph William Bazalgette (1819-1891) Bazalgette had previously served with the British army in other colonial posts before arriving in Nova Scotia in 1811. A Lieutenant in the 80th Foot, he was promoted Captain in the 99th Foot (later renumbered 98th Foot) without purchase in 1805. By 1830 he was a Major in the 98th Foot. In 1837 he was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army. He was made administrator of the provincial government for Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Harvey from 30 May to 30 September 1851 and from 22 March to 5 August 1852. This period included the debate on Joseph Howe's railway policy. It appears from correspondence with the Colonial Office that he had a good sense of balance between colonial needs and his responsibility to England. While stationed in Bermuda, he married Sarah Crawford Magdalen Van Norden (1794-1866) and the marriage produced 15 children, 6 girls and 9 boys, of whom seven in turn went into the Army. By 1854 he was a Colonel and Deputy Quartermaster-General of Nova Scotia. In that year he purchased the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the 2nd West India Regiment. He returned to England the same year and retired in 1858. His long tenure in Canada shows an unusual loyalty to a colonial posting by a British officer of that time.

Main characters ; Joel Fleischman : Joel (Rob Morrow) is the central character at the beginning of the series, a young, somewhat uptight Jewish doctor from Flushing, Queens (New York City) who is contractually bound to practice in the remote Alaskan town of Cicely for four years to repay a student loan from the government. The comedy centered originally on the clash between Fleischman's petty and neurotic, almost Woody Allen-like, urban mindset and the easy-going, community-minded people around him. The role receded somewhat in importance by season four, as behind the scenes Morrow was involved in contentious contract negotiations, and Fleischman's character was minimized or even entirely absent for some later episodes. Morrow left the series in the middle of the sixth (and final) season. ; Maurice J. Minnifield : Maurice (Barry Corbin) is a macho, patriotic ex-astronaut and millionaire entrepreneur, owner of the local radio station KBHR and newspaper, as well as fifteen thousand acres (60 km¬≤) of local land. Determined to make tiny Cicely the next boomtown, on \\"the cusp of the new Alaskan Riviera,\\" Maurice arranges to bring Dr. Fleischman to the town, which previously had no permanent physician. In season 3, Maurice is visited by a South Korean man who turns out to be his son that he fathered during his deployment in South Korea in the 1950s as a Marine. ; Chris Stevens / Christopher Danforth : Chris (John Corbett) is the disc jockey at KBHR, conceptual sculptor, and an ex-convict who spent most of his prison time reading, a fact which makes him one of the most well-educated people in Cicely. He intersperses the music of his morning show with philosophical musings on the nature of life and readings from such writers as Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare, Leo Tolstoy, Carl Jung, and Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are). Chris is also Cicely's only clergyman, ordained as a minister in the Universal Life Church through an advertisement in Rolling Stone magazine. As radio host \\"Chris in the Morning\\", he serves as the de facto narrator for the show. ; Mary Margaret \\"Maggie\\" O'Connell : Maggie (Janine Turner) is a professional bush pilot, property agent and Fleischman's landlord. She was a debutante from a wealthy Irish American family in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. She is wary of having relationships with men because all five of her former boyfriends died in bizarre accidents while in the prime of life. However, she falls for Mike Monroe (Anthony Edwards), a lawyer who is hyper-allergic to many man-made substances; in a reversal of her prior track record, he recovers completely and leaves. An ardent feminist, Maggie has a strong love-hate relationship with Fleischman, including the occasional sexual episode. ; Shelly Marie Tambo Vincoeur : Shelly (Cynthia Geary) is a young beauty pageant winner, Miss Northwest Passage, with a somewhat 'surfer dude' shallow-but-sweet personality, who comes from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She is brought to Cicely by Maurice, who had hoped to marry her. Shortly after her arrival, she met and fell in love with the much older (by 44 years) Holling Vincoeur. Shelly nearly becomes a bigamist when she almost marries Holling before divorcing minor league hockey player Wayne Jones (Brandon Douglas), whom she had married solely to get him to stop proposing. ; Holling Gustav Vincoeur : Holling (John Cullum) is a sexagenarian hunter and owner of The Brick bar and restaurant, where he lives upstairs with Shelly. Born in Qu√©bec (or the Yukon; both are mentioned in different seasons) and later becoming a naturalized US citizen, he had been best friends with Maurice until they had a falling out over Shelly. His father and grandfather both lived to be over 100 years old, spending most of their lives as widowers despite marrying much younger women; fearing the same bitter fate, Holling had sworn off love until Shelly appeared. He claims to be a direct descendant of King Louis XIV of France and attempts to distance himself as much as possible from his despotic ancestors, all despicable people. After 23 years as unelected mayor of Cicely, he loses that post to Edna Hancock, who runs against him because of a grudge, in the town's very first election in 1992. ; : Ed (Darren E. Burrows) is a mild- mannered, amiably tactless half-Native Alaskan who was abandoned as a young child and raised by the local Tlingits. He works for Maurice and later part- time at Ruth-Anne's general store. A film buff and would-be director, he is also a shaman-in-training and is occasionally visited by his invisible spirit guide, One-Who-Waits, and by his personal demon, a dwarf who embodies Ed's low self-esteem. Ed writes, directs, and produces his own film about Cicely and another film about a fellow Native American's traditional handicraft. ; Ruth- Anne Miller : Ruth-Anne (Peg Phillips) is the septuagenarian owner of the general store who moved to Cicely thirty years earlier from Portland, Oregon. A widow, she lives alone until late in the series, when she becomes involved with Walt Kupfer (see below). Like Holling, she is one of the more rational/balanced characters and always has an open ear for her customers' personal problems. She too is a film buff and has earnest conversations with Ed on this topic. ; Marilyn Whirlwind : Marilyn (Elaine Miles) is Fleischman's Native Alaskan receptionist. Preternaturally patient and imperturbable, Marilyn speaks sparingly, while her boss rarely stops talking. She occasionally offers up wisdom in the form of a Native American folk legend in response to another Cicelian who is troubled about some issue. ; Phil Capra : Phil (Paul Provenza) is recruited as town physician after Fleischman takes to the wilderness. A refugee from Los Angeles, Capra is more gracious than Fleischman in a small town setting, but even more hapless. The character of Phil Capra was introduced in the show's final season. Provenza was originally hired to take over the role of Dr. Joel Fleischman. The difference in their appearance was to be attributed to a new haircut, with Maggie O'Connell commenting, \\"It suits you.\\" This idea was rejected to avoid alienating Morrow's fans. ; Michelle Schowdowski Capra : Michelle (Teri Polo) is Phil's wife. She is a writer for publications such as in-flight airline magazines. She gets work as a reporter for a newspaper owned by Maurice Minnifield, but when Maurice starts applying editorial pressure, she decides she prefers waitressing at the Brick. For a time, she has visions of Fleischman's rabbi, Schulman. The character of Michelle Schowdowski Capra was introduced in the show's final season. Recurring characters ; Adam : Adam (Adam Arkin) is an abrasive, ungroomed, misanthropic, bilious, cantankerous and colorful \\"genius\\" gourmet chef who may or may not have worked for the CIA in the past, which may explain how he has so much information about everyone. He lives off the grid and in the woods, and was first introduced as a mythic legend figure, something akin to Bigfoot. People in Cicely spoke of him as a tall-tale figure at first. Adam usually has a chip on his shoulder and offers an offensive rebuttal to anyone who compliments him. He is married to Eve. Arkin directed one of the episodes in the fourth season. ; Dave : Dave is the cheerful Native American cook at the Brick. In early episodes, he has few lines, but his role expands in later seasons, particularly in scenes with Holling and Shelly, but also with Joel, who often asks him to explain local Native American customs. Dave and Shelly appear to get along particularly well, likely because of their similarly friendly personalities. He was called Buffalo Child in the episode \\"Sex, Lies, and Ed's Tape\\", and then William J. White. ;Eugene : Eugene (Earl Quewezance) replaced Dave as the cook at the Brick near the end of the fifth season. ; Earl the Barber : Earl is a frequent background extra played by Jerry Morris, the real owner of the barbershop that appears in the show. ; Eve : Eve (Valerie Mahaffey) is the hypochondriacal heiress to a tungsten fortune; she is also Adam's wife and a Christian Scientist. Mahaffey won an Emmy Award in 1992 for her portrayal of Eve. Eve and Adam spend part of each year as jet- setters and part as near-hermits in a cabin near Cicely. She and Adam eventually have a child together, named Aldridge. ; Lester Haines : Lester (Apesanahkwat) is the fourth wealthiest man in the interior (and as a Haida, the first native to crack the top five). He is regarded as a rival by the wealthiest, Maurice. His daughter Heather Haines is briefly Ed Chigliak's love interest. ; Erick Reese Hillman and Ron Bantz : Erick (Don McManus) and Ron (Doug Ballard) are a gay couple who (at the end of season two) buy a house from Maurice in order to open an upscale bed and breakfast called the Sourdough Inn. They are married by Chris late in the fifth season. ; Caldecott \\"Cal\\" E. Ingraham : Cal (Simon Templeman) is a violinist who becomes so obsessed with a valuable antique violin purchased by Maurice that he attempts to kill Maurice. He reappears in several episodes. ; Hayden Keyes : Hayden (James L. Dunn) is Cicely's blacksmith by trade and a firewood salesman, in addition to performing other odd jobs. He is well liked, but has a shady past and is not above stealing and trying an insurance scam. ; Walter \\"Walt\\" Kupfer : Walt (Moultrie Patten) is a rugged but friendly fur trapper, and love interest of Ruth-Anne Miller in later seasons. He was addicted to his work as a stockbroker in New York City and retired to Cicely on the advice of his doctor \\"more than 30 years\\" ago. ; Mike Monroe : Mike (Anthony Edwards) is a hyper-allergic lawyer turned climate activist. He is initially nicknamed \\"The Bubble Man\\" by the citizens of Cicely. Mike comes to Alaska to escape the pollution that gave him multiple chemical sensitivity. Maggie O'Connell, attracted by Mike's show of courage in battling his illness, encourages him to come out of his airtight house more often, and they briefly become a couple. In an apparent inversion of \\"Maggie's Curse,\\" Mike's symptoms suddenly vanish, whereupon he leaves town to join a Greenpeace ship at Murmansk, much to Maggie's disappointment. ; One-Who-Waits : One-Who-Waits (Floyd Westerman) is Ed Chigliak's spirit guide, the ghost of a long-dead chief from Ed's Native American Bear clan. ; Richard \\"Rick\\" Pederson : Rick (Grant Goodeve) is Maggie O'Connell's first-season boyfriend. He dies at the end of the second season when an errant satellite falls on him during a camping trip. After his death, it is revealed that he was a compulsive sex addict who cheated on Maggie with hundreds of other women. In one episode after Rick's death, Maggie encounters one of them face-to-face where they discuss Rick's relational complexities. ; Leonard Quinhagak : Leonard (Graham Greene) is a native medicine man, Marilyn's cousin and Ed's mentor. He is also the local totem pole carver, which is featured in an episode where he creates a totem for the Whirlwind family, which rekindles a long-running feud between the Raven and Bear clans. ; Elaine Schulman : Elaine (Jessica Lundy) is Joel Fleishman's fianc√©e/ex- fianc√©e. She is first heard in an outgoing message on an answering machine, and first appears in the season 1 episode \\"Russian Flu\\", when she visits Joel in Cicely. After breaking up with Joel by letter in order to marry a retired judge, she visits Joel again after the death of her husband in the season 2 episode \\"Roots\\". ; Rabbi Schulman : Schulman (Jerry Adler) is Joel's rabbi from New York City. He inexplicably appears to Joel in \\"visions\\"‚Äîand also once to Michelle Capra. ; Sergeant Barbara Semanski : Barbara (Diane Delano) is a rugged Alaska state trooper and gun enthusiast, and the on-again/off-again love interest of Maurice Minnifield. She is a no-nonsense law enforcement officer who is very particular about enforcing each and every law. When she learns that Maurice cheats on his income tax return, she leaves him. She does the same when she finds he is harboring a fugitive; and even arrests Maurice for a minor offense. ; Bernard Stevens : Bernard (Richard Cummings Jr.) is Chris's \\"half-brother and spiritual doppelg√§nger.\\" Their father was a bigamist \\"travelling man\\" (a reference to the Ricky Nelson song \\"Travelin' Man\\") whose double life was exposed only after his death. Their relationship extends beyond being merely half-brothers, as they also share dreams, emotions, and thoughts. They have the same birthday and birth year, making them \\"twins,\\" despite having different mothers, one white and the other black.

During his life he held several posts, many coinciding with the European Peninsular War: lieutenant general in the military, secretary and councilor of the Conselho Ultramarino (Overseas Council), governor of Algarve and Governor/Captain-General of the Azores. He was also a member of the committee that formed the draft of the constitutional charter in 1823, before returning to academia (becoming a professor of mathematics at the Academia Real de Marinha, a deputy director of the Academia Militar do Rio de Janeiro, secretary of the Academia Real das Ci√™ncias de Lisboa and fellow Royal Society of London, among other honours. He was one of the pioneers in differential calculus and one of the most notable historians of mathematics in Portugal. Biography Stockler was born in Lisbon; son of Cristiano Stockler (a Lisbon merchant) and Margarida Jos√©fa Rita de Orgiens Gar√ß√£o de Carvalho, his grandfather, who was born in Hamburg, traced his roots to the historic cities of the Hanseatic League. =Academia= Stocker destined his career to the military. By 1784 (at the age of 25) he was a captain, enrolled at the University of Coimbra in mathematics. He obtained a bachelor's degree at the Academia Real de Marinha (Royal Marine Academy), where he began his investigation into the limits of differential calculation. While at the Academia Real Stockler was elected member of the Academia Real das Ci√™ncias de Lisboa (Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences) in 1791, beginning a period of academic work resulting in many of publications, including his Mem√≥rias da Academia (Memories From The Academy). He published work essentially on the limits of differential calculus, becoming available in Portugal and published in Europe, gaining sufficient notoriety. On 3 January 1795, Gar√ß√£o Stockler married D. In√™s Gertrudes de Mendon√ßa e Moura, daughter of D. Jo√£o Francisco de Moura (who was the customs notary of Lisbon). He published other works that honoured academics and politics, among them were biographies of Pascoal Jos√© de Melo Freire dos Reis, Jos√© Joaquim Soares de Barros e Vasconcelos, Roberto Nunes da Costa, Martinho de Melo e Castro, Bento Sanches de Orta and Guilherme Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio de Valler√©, publishing his Obras Completas (Complete Works) in two volumes (1805 and 1826, respectively). Further, he eulogize d'Alembert, inspired by writing with the Marquess of Condorcet. His honours rarely coincided with Portuguese scientists at the time; on 1 April 1819, he was elected correspondent member or foreign member of the Royal Society of London and written about by others including John Rowley and S.R. Chapman. =Peninsular Wars= He was adjunct to Field Marshall Jo√£o Carlos de Bragan√ßa Sousa e Ligne, 2nd Duke of Laf√µes, during the 1801 campaigns of the Peninsular War, known as the War of the Oranges. Military secretary of the duke, between 1797 and 1801, he published an important paper on conducting operations. In 1807, following the French invasion, under the command of General Jean-Andoche Junot, the Portuguese Cortes escaped to Brasil, at a time of when Stocker was secretary of the Real Academia das Ci√™ncias (Royal Academy of Sciences). He was one of the dignitaries, in the name of Regency, who travelled to Sacav√©m to receive the invader. This attitude, as well as the election of Junot as a member of the Royal Academy and Stockler's personal presentation of his credentials while secretary of the Academy, resulted in his being labelled as collaborator (while putting him in the confidence of the French). Accepting from Junot the command of the battery of Areia, near Bel√©m, his force impeded the departure of the Portuguese naval shipping for Brazil, thereby proving his alignment with the French. For his actions, and following the retreat of the French, the Portuguese Regency stripped him of his positions and privileges. As part of a requirement for then-Brigader Stocker, to be reintegrated into the Portuguese military, a letter from the Count of Linhares, then-Minister for the Prince Regent in Brazil wrote: :Having received for his respectful presence of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent Our Lord the enclosed letter and more papers from the Brigadier Francisco de Borja Garion Stockler, whose military talents were verified in the campaign of 1801, are still constant to the same gentleman, in whose Royal presence it is, moreover, little credited the mission sent to Junot, and later by his command of the battery of Areia next to the tower of Bel√©m, where he bombarded Portuguese ships, that made sail to leave the Tagus; yet, His Royal Highness, hearing the sentiments of your incomparable justice and piety, it is stated that the governors of the kingdom inform (interposing their opinion and after listening to Marshal General or Marshal General of the Army) if there will be some active place in front of the enemy, where the supplicant may be employed, and in this case propose him to this post, in order to verify whether he has real great military talents, or whether in this matter, as in others, it is overvalued beyond what it is worth... His collaborationism with the French Army and the military incompetency in the Orange War campaigns, were published inHist√≥ria Geral da Invas√£o dos Franceses (General History Of The French Invasion) by Jos√© Ac√∫rsio das Neves, resulting in a public polemic. Stocker responded to this by personally publishing Cartas ao autor da Hist√≥ria Geral da Invas√£o dos Franceses em Portugal, which the Royal Academy refused to publish. The controversy did not subside, and he continued to post various opinions, including his Investigador Portuguez to refute public opinion. However, despite being despised by nobility and public classes, he succeeded in reintegrating into the Portuguese military, being promoted to Field Marshal and restarting his career, against all odds. =Regency= In 1812, he departed for Brazil, to join the Cortes, where he conquered, through his intellectual abilities, the confidence of the government-in-exile and the Prince Regent. Stockler was residing in Rio when, following the death of Queen D . Maria, the Prince Regent was acclaimed as King D. VI. He was commission by the Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences to present a speech in name of the institution during the course o f the kings investiture, which was published in the first tome of Mem√≥rias da Academia. In addition to his academic work in mathematics, Gar√ß√£o Stockler became interested in poetry, writing Poesias Lyricas (Lyrical Poems), that featured Horatian does, traditional stories and the philosophical poem Aves, which was later published by Brazilian poet Ant√≥nio Pereira de Sousa Caldas. Submitted to the Academy, the poem was considered for publication in 1819, but owing to violating the Catholic orthodoxy of the time, he was required to edit his ideas considered paradoxical. Stockler refused to alter his work, and published it in London, resulting in its condemnation by the Vatican, being registered on 23 June 1836 in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. At the same time, though, Stockler elaborated his Ensaio hist√≥rico on the origin and progress of mathematics in Portugal, later published in Paris, that was critically acclaimed by Jos√© Silvestre Ribeir√£o (in Resenha de Litteratura Portugueza) and as an insert in the Annaes das Ciencias. This work, which was reedited, is considered one of the best histories of mathematical thought until the 19th century, one of the first works of its time in Europe. He also became interested in education, authoring a study on the establishment of public instruction in Brazil, and history of education and pedagogical studies. Stockler was a deputy in the Junta de Direc√ß√£o da Academia Militar (Military Academy Junta) of Rio de Janeiro, where, along with Wilhelm Ludwig Freiherr von Eschwege, the Baron of Eschwege, was responsible for restoring the study of mathematics and physics.The military school was created on 4 December 1810 by royal decree, and began functioning on 23 April 1811. It was a predecessor of the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras, one of the first engineering schools in Brazil. =Captaincy-General= Liberalism During his stay in Rio de Janeiro, the Cortes began to receive complaints related to Brigadier Francisco Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo as Governor and Captain-General of the Azores. The populations of the archipelago and insular authorities complained of the military rigor and preferential attitude of the official when conceding lands. In this case, Ara√∫jo e Azevedo conceded land to friends of the Captain- General, over the interests of the people and municipal authorities. This appropriation of the vacant lands gave rise to deep hatreds and disagreements, and later led to the Justi√ßa da Noite riot which, for decades, undermined the island peace. At Corte and having gained notoriety for his academic work and intelligence, Stockler managed to be appointed by D. John VI (12 November 1819) to replace the former-Captain-General, who had fallen in disgrace. Stockler left for Lisbon in August 1820, with the intention of receiving from the Regency the orders necessary to govern the Azores. It was during this time that a constitutional movement was taking form on the continent, resulting in the Liberal Revolution of 1820 when Stockler arrived in Lisbon. Obviously anti-Liberal, his Jacobist fame and French collaboration during the French invasion helped him to obtain an affirmation by the Liberal revolutionaries for his position, permitting his departure for the islands. He arrived on 18 October 1820 and was received by a fervor, owing to his replacing the unpopular Ara√∫jo e Azevedo. Both political groups in the Azores were hopeful for his tenure: the Liberals, expected a confirmation of the Pro- Constitutional ideas, and the Absolutists, convinced that his nomination by King D. John VI before the revolution, would guarantee his support for the dominance of the monarchy. The Absolutists were immediately vindicated when Stockler prohibited political contact with Portugal and requested new members of the administration and judiciary from Rio de Janeiro, ignoring the legitimacy and authority of Lisbon institutions. When the Liberals realized that the new Captain-General was not an ally, the Azoreans began a movement to proclaim, by revolution, a constitutional model in the archipelago. Capitalizing on the discontent with the governance of the Captains-General, on 1 March 1821, a military revolt in Ponta Delgada erupted, cheffed by Noronha and lieutenant Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria, inspired by civil elements angry with the dominance of Terceira (militarily and economically).Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.84 A constitutional regime was installed in S√£o Miguel, proclaiming the independence of the island from the dominion of the government in Angra. This bloodless revolution was supported by members of the nobility, clerics, magistrates and councillors.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.85 On the following day many of the municipal authorities supported to revolt. The interim government did not lose time and revoked many of the laws the subordinated the island of S√£o Miguel to Terceira, abolishing taxes and annulling orders of Stockler. Meanwhile the continental government decided to accept the Interim government administration in S√£o Miguel and Santa Maria, and placing Stockler in charge of the remaining islands. Stockler tried to resist, but on 2 April 1821, a revolution broke out in Angra, inspired by those deported from the Amazon and those loyal to Brigadier Francisco Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo, forcing him to take refuge in Praia.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.86 The municipal council proclaimed the Interim government under Ara√∫jo Azevedo, but the Liberal cause was not as popular as the rebels assumed, he was shot during a counter- revolution and impaled by baionnettes, his body taken in load procession through the streets of Angra. A counter-revolution on 4 April from the Fortress of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista resulted in the death of Ara√∫jo and Stockler to the palace of the Captains-General. During the context of this uprising, Almeida Garrett (who had recently founded the Coimbra masonic lodge Sociedade dos Jardineiros and was interested in firming-up the constitutional legality of the Revolution) encountered strong opposition from Stockler, who threatened to imprison him if he manifested publicly in favour of the Constitution. This period resulted in a heroic/comic poem \\"O X\\" that Garrett wrote, but did not complete, alluding to the Captain-General. On 13 May 1821, the frigate P√©rola arrived on Terceira, commanded by Captain-of-the-Sea and War Marshall, Pedro de Ata√≠de Barahona, who intimated that Stockler should recognize the Liberal government. Stockler countered and resisted the intimidation, but did not find the support he expected from the population. As a result, on 15 May 1821, a solemn ceremony was realized at the Municipal Palace/Hall of Angra where the populous announced their loyalty to the future constitution. Stockler abdicated his position as Governor and Captain-General but, along with bishop of Angra (Friar Manuel Nicolau de Almeida, remained as \\"attache\\" to the government. This \\"solution\\" was not acceptable to the Cortes, and on 19 July 1822, on the brig Flor do Mar came royal orders that Stockler and the bishop should withdraw from Terceira: they accepted on 11 August 1822. Exile Stockler arrived in Lisbon and was immediately arrested, by order of the Cortes, resulting in a long process in the press, debates and ridicule. His actions were refuted by Luiz Manuel de Moura Cabral, of the Casa da Supplica√ß√£o, in letters that described the events on the island of Terceira, in addition to illustrated observations in Campe√£o Lisbonense, Voz da Verdade provada por documentos and the pamphlet Voz da Verdade, as well as an analysis of the libelous Noticia resumida dos acontecimentos da ilha Terceira na installa√ß√£o do seu governo constitucional. Finally, Stockler responded in his own name in some critical notes, published in 1822 by Dr. Vicente Jos√© Ferreira Cardoso da Costa, to the Count of Arcos. All these questions and judicial processes end with the fall of the constitutional government in 1823, resulting from the Vilafrancada, leaving Stockler with an unblemished record in the eyes of the absolutist government. As a result, on 10 June 1823, it was concluded that Stockler provided loyal service to the Crown within the legals bestowed on him, and his career rehabilitated, along with Bishop Manuel Nicolau de Almeida. As one of the politicians liberated in the aftermath, Stockler was seen as a celebrity, and nominated to elaborate the Legal Charter, following the revocation of the former-constitution. But, the commission was extinguished before ever producing a new Charter, and Stockler was re-appointed Captain-General of the Azores and invested with title of Baron of Vila da Praia by decree, on the 29 September 1823. Absolutism He travelled to Angra aboard the Princesa de Portugal arriving on 17 November 1823, where he reassumed his functions two days following his arrival. His reception was apotheosis, with three days of festivities and one day devoted to unceasing honors and oaths of fidelity. Immediately installed in his position the \\"new\\" Captain-General began to persecute the remnants of Liberal government and their sympathizers, with numerous arrests and expulsions of the island, creating a reign of terror that only had parallel in the Castilian invasion of 1583. This was similarly duplicated on the continent, where Miguel of Portugal jailed his political opponents until 14 May 1824, when the situation reversed itself and the Infante Miguel was forced into exile. Consequently, Stockler was fired, apparently influenced by Count of Subserra, a Terceirense who had ascended to the ministry of King D. John IV. On 24 July 1824, Manuel Vieira de Albuquerque Touvar arrived in the Azores to take up his functions as the ninth Captain-General, and a few days later Stockler left again for an uncertain destination. =Later life= At the end of July 1824, Stockler arrived to Lisbon, but abandoned politics, returning to his beginnings in mathematics and political debate. A year later, he submitted to the Academy M√©todo inverso dos limites ou desenvolvimento das fun√ß√µes algor√≠tmicas, but was once again, considered inappropriate for publication: it was the third time that it was rejected by the Academy. Affronted, he submitted his resignation and printed his work on his own. The second volume of his Obras completas was published in 1826, with eulogies to academics D. Tom√°s Caetano do Bem and Pascoal Jos√© de Melo (an appendix on the history of the French invasion and press freedoms, respectively). A larger demonstration of his predecessor in 1807 and 1812 and a project on the establishment of public instruction in Brazil, in addition to a long letter to J√°come Ratton. In 1827, finally, as questions of constitutionality were debated in the country, Stockler wrote Elementos de Direito Social ou Princ√≠pios de Direito Natural, to serve as a base for civil constitutions.¬¥ Following the return of D. Miguel to Portugal, Stockler affirmed his loyalty to the absolutist cause, resulting in his nomination to the post of Governador das Armas to the province of the Algarve. He died on 6 March 1829 in his post. Published works Gar√ß√£o Stockler was the author of volumous works on mathematics, and gained fame and was nominated as a correspondent at the Royal Society in London, the history of politisa. The latest area involves warlike accesses, published numerous auto-justificated texts along with his pseudonym, others in name of his son Ant√≥nio Nicolau de Moura Stockler. The absolutist connotation of Stockler brought an implantation of liberalism on his work and wrote Ensaio hist√≥rico sobre a origem e progressos das matem√°ticas em Portugal *Mathematics: Comp√™ndio da teoria dos limites, ou introdu√ß√£o ao m√©todo das flux√µes, Lisbon, 1794; Mem√≥rias sobre os verdadeiros princ√≠pios do m√©todo das flux√µes Demonstra√ß√£o do teorema de Newton sobre a soma das potencias das ra√≠zes das equa√ß√µes Lettre a Mr. le Redacteur du \\"Monthly Review\\" ou R√©ponse aux objections qu'on a faites dans ce journal √† la methode des limites des fluxions hypoth√©tiques, London, 1800 Carta a Anton Felkel acerca do seu m√©todo para determinar os factores dos n√∫meros naturais Mem√≥ria sobre as equa√ß√µes de condi√ß√£o das fun√ß√µes fluxionais (Memories On The Equations Of The Condition Of Fluctional Functions) Li√ß√£o duod√©cima dos elementos de Geometria, a qual tem por t√≠tulo das correla√ß√µes que existem entre as opera√ß√µes elementares da technia geom√©trica e da technia alg√©brica, Lisboa, 1819 Mem√≥ria sobre algumas propriedades das coeficientes dos termos do bin√≥mio de Newton M√©todo inverso dos limites ou desenvolvimento das fun√ß√µes algor√≠tmicas (Inverse Memories On Limits On Involvement Of Algorithmic Functions), Lisbon, 1825. * Mathematical History: Ensaio hist√≥rico sobre a origem e progressos das matem√°ticas em Portugal (Historic Essay On The Origin And Progress Of Mathematics In Portugal), Paris, 1819 ([VII], 168, [1] p. ; 21 cm). *Poesia e literatura: Breve not√≠cia da vida e obras de Francisco Dias Gomes, inserta como pref√°cio das Obras Po√©ticas de Francisco Dias Gomes, published by the Academia Real das Ci√™ncias de Lisboa Poesias lyricas (Lyric Poems) - a volume that contains 18 Horatian odes, 12 traditional sonts, and a song on philosophical poem Aves by the Brazilian poet Sousa Caldas Anota√ß√µes e aditamentos √†s obras do Padre Ant√≥nio Pereira de Sousa Caldas, published in London. *Warlike And Political Essays: Obras Completas (Completed Works), volume I, Lisboa, 1805; Obras Completas (Completed Works), volume II, Lisboa, 1826; ' (Letters Of The Author On The General History Of The French Invasion Of Portugal), Rio de Janeiro, 1813; Discurso dirigido em nome da Academia Real das Sciencias a S.M. o Senhor D.

(). The noticed density to the west of Shahrani lands is due to the presence of the large city of Abha () in that direction. Through history, tribal wars have been waged between the two neighbors, especially between Shahran and the other major tribe of the area, Qahtan ().

It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The village has a Hungarian ethnic majority (67.56%) and its population numbering 498 people (2011 census).  Location  Lukin Selo is located south of Zrenjanin, its municipal seat, though the southern zone of Zrenjanin, Mu≈ælja, is just to the north. On the northeast and east, the village borders almost connected villages of Eƒçka and Stajiƒáevo. Belo Blato is to the southwest.  Geography  The village is situated at an altitude of , on the bank terraces in the valley of the Bega river, which flows just east of it. Geographically, the entire region is actually an alluvial plain of the Tisza river, which flows west of the village. Village is located on the northeast shore of the Belo jezero, the ending section of the large Eƒçka fish pond. As the elongated atar (village area), is much larger than the settlement itself, it comprises the entire fish pond and reaches the Tisza river of the west. Apart from the Belo, the pond consists of Kopova lakes, several connected lakes (Koƒça, Mika, Joca), which are part of the old riverbed of the Tisza. There are two smaller bodies of water in the village area, outside of the fish pond complex, ≈†uvajka and Novo lakes, to the north. The protected wetland of Carska Bara is south of the village. The special nature reserve is the largest individual bog in Serbia.  History  The village was founded in 1785 when the Hungarian settlers from the neighboring villages, like Eƒçka, began moving in the area. They were noted as the good tobacco farmers. As it was built on the land of the nobleman, count Lazar Lukaƒç, it was named Luk√°csfalva after his surname. Lukaƒç, a count from Transylvania but of Armenian origin, encouraged the settling in the marshland which surrounded the lakes and rivers, as he needed workforce for his estate, especially for the vegetable production, as he was also selling the products. Lukaƒç purchased vast land, tens of thousands of hectares from the Imperial Court in Vienna. He built Ka≈°tel Eƒçka in the neighboring village of the same name, a castle which became cultural and entertainment center of the rich nobility. Lukino Selo, on the other hand, served for the settling of the help, gardeners, farmers, etc. The Belo lake was created by the denizens, and the formation of a lake from a marsh of the same name lasted for a century. The swamp was deepened and cleaned and soon turned into the fish pond, which was the main economic activity for the villagers. There used to be a mill on the shore of the lake. It was connected to the village via two small stone bridges. Original settlers were poor and landless peasants. In 1825, some 200 Bulgarian Catholics were settled in the village, but they were Hungarized in time. They were brought in order to boost the vegetable production.  Characteristics  Lukino Selo is a typical Pannonian village. The administrative area of the settlement is . It consists of three parallel streets, stretched in the northwest-southeast direction, with uneven space between them, which are connected by other three short transversal streets. Over 90% of houses still use individual water sources (water wells, etc.). There are lower grades elementary school and post office in the village.  Population  The population has been experiencing a constant depopulation in the past 7 decades. Lukino Selo remains predominantly settled by the Hungarians. There used to be a Romani inhabited section of the village. Their settlement can be traced back to the original settling of the village, in the Lazar Lukaƒç's lifetime, but it was abandoned and today there is a meadow where the settlement used to be. = Ethnic groups (2002 census) = * Hungarians = 404 (67.56%) * Serbs = 78 (13.04%) * Yugoslavs = 27 (4.52%) * Romani = 21 (3.51%) * others.  Economy  The village is predominantly agricultural. Main agricultural products are corn, wheat, sunflower and tobacco, but the old production of vegetables, namely tomatoes, still survives. For a period, vegetables were the most dominant products. They used to be transported to Belo Blato, where they were loaded onto the boats and transported further by the Bega river. Husbandry was quite developed, but it is also declining today. It includes mostly cattle. The fishery is also important for the village's economy, especially during its history. Most of the facilities of the Eƒçka fish pond are located in Lukino Selo, but the fishery complex is named after the much larger village of Eƒçka, in the vicinity. Still, as of 2018 the overall economy is in a very bad shape. Some of the inhabitants travel to Zrenjanin to work in the Dr√§xlmaier Group factory. The local community estimated that the population shrunk from 500 in 2011 to 200 in 2018 as a result of Hungarian government's policy of approving papers for all Hungarians living abroad. Many took the opportunity and migrated to the European Union.  Notable people  * Janika Bala≈æ, most famous Serbian tamburitza player, of Romani origin.

Containerboard (CCM or corrugated case material) is a type of paperboard specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board. It includes both linerboard and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up corrugated board. Since containerboard is made mainly out of natural unbleached wood fibers, it is generally brown, although its shade may vary depending on the type of wood, pulping process, recycling rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation, white bleached pulp or coating is used on the top ply of the linerboard that goes outside the box. Manufacture Containerboard is made on modified paper machines that can handle higher grammages. The production of containerboard is the highest of all kinds of paper in the world. More than 100 million tons are produced annually. It is made in specialized paper machines from virgin as well as recycled fibers. Linerboard made of virgin pulp is called kraftliner, whereas recycled linerboard is known as testliner. The corrugating medium may be recycled medium, called wellenstoff in Europe, or virgin, which is called semichemical medium for the type of pulp used in its production. The borders of these categories becomes blurred when both virgin and recycled fibers are used in making one product. At the end of the manufacturing process containerboard is cut into rolls comprising a continuous sheet of paper, which will later be unwound in the corrugator machine while making the corrugated board.

T. Wade-Gery, was a classical scholar, historian and epigrapher. From 1939 to 1953, he was Wykeham Professor of Ancient History at the University of Oxford. Life Born into a long-established Bedfordshire family, Wade-Gery was educated at Winchester College, a contemporary of Arnold J. Toynbee and R.M.Y. Gleadowe, and at New College, Oxford, which he left with a First in Classical Moderations in 1911. After a short spell in the Civil Service he was offered a tutorial fellowship in 1914 at Wadham College, Oxford. Almost immediately however he left for military service in the First World War in the army on the Western Front, during which he was awarded the MC. After the end of the war Wade-Gery returned to Wadham, eventually becoming Sub-Warden. He remained at Wadham until 1939, when on his election as Wykeham Professor of Ancient History he became a Fellow of New College. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. He retired from his Chair in 1953 and was offered a five-year Research Fellowship at Merton College, two years of which he spent at Princeton. For the next ten years or so he continued to travel and to write (his last publication was in 1966) until after a few years of declining health he died of a heart attack in 1972. Works In 1915 three of Wade-Gery'ss poems were published in that year's Oxford Poetry volume, in which work by J. R. R. Tolkien also appeared. After his safe return from the war he published \\"Terpsichore and Other Poems\\", a collection of his poetry, in 1922, but future publications were devoted to his academic work and especially to epigraphy. He is often cited by classical scholars for his suggestion that the Greek alphabet was adapted from Phoenician script in the 8th century BC with the express purpose of recording Homer's monumental epics. His writing was mostly in the form of articles in learned journals. His principal publications were: * Pindar: Pythian Odes, 1928 (Nonesuch Press), jointly with Maurice Bowra; * The Athenian Tribute Lists (4 vols), 1939‚Äì53 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), as a joint author with Benjamin D. Meritt and Malcolm F. McGregor; * The Poet of the Iliad, 1952 (CUP), the published form of his J.H. Gray lectures given at Cambridge in 1949; * Essays in Greek History, 1958 (Blackwell). Family Wade-Gery married archaeologist Vivian Whitfield (1897‚Äì1988)in 1928. They had one son, Robert Wade-Gery (later Sir Robert), who was born in 1929. Wade-Gery's earlier polyamorous relationship with the writer Naomi Mitchison ended with his marriage to Whitfield.

Route description SR 48 is routed along two-lane roadways for its entire length.

History The original routing of SR 48 is quite different from the route that it has today. When the route was formed in 1940, it traveled from Pell City to the Georgia state line east, rather than northeast, of Wedowee.

It is largely composed of Smith's writings and interpretations and editorial comments by Smith's secretaries, scribes, and after Smith's death, historians of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). The history was written between 1839 and 1856 . Part of it was published in Times and Seasons and other church periodicals. It was later published in its entirety with extensive annotations and edits by B. H. Roberts as part of a seven-volume series beginning in 1902 as History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Authorship, editorship, and initial publication The body of the work is \\"a narrative of the prophet Joseph Smith\\";See Preface, Volume I, 1902 edition most of the text was written by scribes rather than by Smith. The parts of the work attributed to Smith were either dictated by Smith to a scribe or consist of a secretary or historian independently outlining Smith's activities and statements for a given time period.g Much of the writing occurred after Smith's death in 1844. From handwriting analysis, scholars have identified the following men as the primary scribal authors of the work during the time periods indicated: *Oliver Cowdery (1829‚Äì38) *John Whitmer (1829‚Äì38) *Sidney Rigdon (1830‚Äì38) *Frederick G. Williams (1832‚Äì39) *Orson Hyde (1833‚Äì36) *W. W. Phelps (1831?‚Äì44) *Warren Parrish (1835‚Äì37) *Sylvester Smith (1834‚Äì36) *Warren A. Cowdery (1836‚Äì38) *George W. Robinson (1836‚Äì40) *James Mulholland (1838‚Äì39) *Robert B. Thompson (1839‚Äì41) *Howard Coray (1840‚Äì41) *James Sloan (1840‚Äì43) *Willard Richards (1841‚Äì54) *William Clayton (1842‚Äì44) *Thomas Bullock (1843?‚Äì56) *Robert Lang Campbell (1845‚Äì50, 1854‚Äì56) *Leo Hawkins (1853‚Äì56) *Jonathan Grimshaw (1853‚Äì56) Although Smith died in 1844, the compilation of his actions and words was not completed until 1856. Apostle Willard Richards was the chief editor of the work from 1841 until 1854. Apostle George A. Smith was the chief editor from 1854 until its completion in 1856. After Smith's death, apostle Wilford Woodruff allowed his extensive journal entries to be used to coordinate dates and clarify statements made by Smith. The completed work was read by and revised by church president Brigham Young and was published in 1858 by the LDS Church under the title History of Joseph Smith. Most of the material that resulted in History of Joseph Smith had been originally published in serial form over a 25-year period in the Times and Seasons, the Deseret News, or the Millennial Star. Revision, renaming and republication Beginning in 1902, a general authority of the LDS Church, B. H. Roberts, was commissioned by the First Presidency to work through History of Joseph Smith and correct errors, add corroborative material, improve the narrative, and provide commentary on the events. Roberts's extensive revision of the work resulted in it being republished by church-owned Deseret Book between 1902 and 1912 as the seven-volume History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The work soon became nicknamed the Documentary History of the Church, a usage which has only recently been abandoned by Mormon historians. Today, the work is published in essentially the same form created by Roberts. Deseret Book currently publishes the work in paperback under the shortened title History of the Church. Volumes History of the Church is published in seven volumes. The dates covered by each volume is as follows: *Volume 1: 1805The work begins with Joseph Smith's birth in December 1805 and a brief recitation of his genealogy. The first major event covered by the history is the First Vision, which the work dates to the spring of 1820. ‚Äì December 1833 *Volume 2: January 1834 ‚Äì December 1837 *Volume 3: January 1838 ‚Äì July 1839 *Volume 4: July 1839 ‚Äì May 1842 *Volume 5: May 1842 ‚Äì August 1843 *Volume 6: September 1843 ‚Äì June 1844 *Volume 7:Volume 7 is designated as \\"Part II\\" of the history; it covers material from immediately after Smith's death in June 1844 until the church's first general conference in Salt Lake City. Volume 7 is sometimes referred to as the history of the \\"apostolic interregnum\\" of the church. June 1844 ‚Äì October 1848 Status in the LDS Church History of Joseph Smith was initially published as an official publication of the LDS Church. Although Roberts's History of the Church has never been granted \\"official history\\" status, it nonetheless is widely used in the church and is often cited in the sermons and magazine articles written by general authorities and other church leaders. In 1851, extracts from what would become History of Joseph Smith were published in a church publication entitled Pearl of Great Price. This book was canonized by the LDS Church on October 10, 1880. The portion of History of Joseph Smith that was canonized consists of Smith's recitation of events between his birth in 1805 and May 1829 and is officially entitled Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory. Although History of the Church is no longer an official publication, it is the most-cited source in two histories of the church which are official publications of LDS Church: Our Heritage: A Brief History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Church History in the Fulness of Times. Criticism Jerald and Sandra Tanner have alleged that when History of the Church is compared to the original manuscripts from which it is drawn, \\"more than 62,000 words\\" can be identified that were either added or deleted.Jerald and Sandra Tanner, Changes in Joseph Smith's History, Salt Lake City: Utah Lighthouse Ministry, 1965. One response to these charges points out that the methods used in creating History of the Church‚Äîwhile flawed by today's standards‚Äîwere not uncommon practices in the nineteenth century, even by reputable historians.\\"Jerald and Sandra Tanner's Distorted View of Mormonism: A Response to Mormonism‚ÄîShadow or Reality?\\".

Bishop Moore throughout his ministry has raised support, trained the leadership, given spiritual oversight or personally been involved at the ground level in over 100 church plants. Throughout the years he has preached in 34 countries sowing seeds of the Gospel and building relationships with Christian leaders. Origins & History The Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches (referred to as the CEEC) was birthed as a result of a more general work of the Holy Spirit among the Christian churches which has become known as the ‚ÄúConvergence Movement‚Äù, and sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúConvergence of the Streams‚Äù renewal. This is the spiritual vision, rooted in the New Testament revelation and the experience of the early Christians, that saw the Church as one Body with many diverse and contributing parts. Or, to put it another way: one river with many streams. In the 1940‚Äôs, the well-known mission pioneer of the union Church of South India, Bishop Leslie Newbigin, wrote a seminal work called ‚ÄúThe Household Of God‚Äù, examining the spiritual and functional nature of the Lord‚Äôs one Church from a missions perspective. His prophetic observation at one point in the book was that the revelation of Scripture in Ephesians 4 is that there is one Body, one Faith, one Lord, one Spirit, one Baptism, one hope of our calling, one God and Father of us all. However, through history this one Body of Christ has been fragmented into separated and often competing groups, camps, or streams, all having been originally a part of the one river of God‚Äôs saving grace poured out into the world through the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Newbigin goes on to make a startling statement for his time; that is, that the one Church of Jesus Christ, which has been so fractured by human sin and political/cultural circumstance through history, is by its nature threefold in the spiritual essence of its historical and existential makeup. This threefold nature he describes as being Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox/Pentecostal or charismatic. In describing this threefold reality, he goes on to remark that these three streams represent emphases that are all necessary for the wholeness and fullness of the Church on earth as God has decreed it in Christ and revealed it in the apostolic tradition of Holy Scripture. The Catholic he relates to the emphases of ‚Äúincarnation and creation‚Äù; the Protestant to ‚Äúbiblical proclamation and conversion‚Äù; and the Orthodox/Pentecostal to ‚Äúthe mystical and the Spirit‚Äù. At this point in the 20th century, Bishop Newbigin was a lone voice crying out for a holistic understanding of the nature of the Church of Jesus Christ that was born out of an apostolic missionary activity in the nation of India. This vision eventually led to the formation of the Church of South India, made up of 5 different denominations, receiving apostolic succession through the Anglican tradition from Anglican bishops in India. In turn, this united expression of the Lord‚Äôs one Church, made up of those from differing streams, was recognized by the Anglican Communion and brought into inter-communion with them. Not until the 1970‚Äôs did this vision begin to gain a wider hearing. It was through the fruits of the ecumenical movement, the charismatic renewal of the mainline Churches, and the Liturgical Renewal movement that was trans- denominational in its scope (and included the historic Vatican II Council of the Roman Catholic Church) that this understanding of the Church as one river made up of many streams, all necessary for the fullness of the river and the gladness of God‚Äôs people, began to gain impetus. Dr. Robert Webber, professor of Theology and Bible at Wheaton College in Illinois, began to publicly give voice to this concept in his efforts at ecumenical and evangelical renewal of the unity and fullness of the Church, tied to its ancient roots. His 1978 book, ‚ÄúCommon Roots‚Äù, looked at foundational elements of the Church‚Äôs life, worship, witness, and spirituality that had roots in the second century experience of Christianity. In this work, he urged leaders across the evangelical spectrum of the Church to take serious notice of the models presented in the second century Church for renewal of these aspects of the Church‚Äôs life today. This was followed in the 1980‚Äôs by his landmark book, ‚ÄúEvangelicals on the Canterbury Trail: Why Evangelical Christians Are Attracted to the Liturgical Church‚Äù. He chronicled his own personal spiritual journey from a fundamentalist evangelical background into the Anglican tradition and the six reasons for this attraction. In the epilogue to this work he quotes his pastor at that time who stated that he believed the future of the Church of Jesus Christ might very well lie in the ‚Äúconvergence of the catholic and evangelical‚Äù streams or traditions of the Church. Many pastors since have identified and resonated with this vision. Soon thereafter, it was realized that the one stream or tradition missing was the Charismatic/Pentecostal; not realizing that Bishop Newbigin had made the same prophetic observation some 40 years earlier. Throughout the 1980‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs a series of articles appeared in various publications making the same emphasis that Bishop Newbigin had made in the 1940‚Äôs as well as chronicling the journey of evangelicals and Charismatics toward one of the sacramental and liturgical branches of the church. Among those were \\"Three Streams, One River?\\" by Dr. Richard Lovelace Ph.D, professor of Church History at Gordon Conwell Seminary, appearing the Sept 1984 edition of Charisma Magazine, \\"Back to the Fathers\\", by Christopher Paul which was an interview with Thomas C. Oden, \\"Why the Bishops Went to Valdosta\\", by Randall Balmer, and \\"Ancient Altars, Pentecostal Fire\\", by Paul Thigpen.

On this tour, Ultraman played dates in Leonardtown, Maryland with McRad (Chuck Treece‚Äôs band while he was also in Underdog), Boston, and NYC at the Pyramid Club. After this tour, singer Tim Jamison sent a copy of the band's single and band t-shirts to Jack at Caroline Records, in the hope of getting the band signed. Jack didn't think they were a fit with the label, but passed along their singles to Nicky Garrett who, at the time, ran the Caroline warehouse and was just starting New Red Archives. New Red Archives had already signed the UK Subs, east coast bands Crucial Youth and Kraut, and was looking for a Midwestern band who had both name recognition and had toured. =Freezing Inside= In late 1988, Garrett offered to sign Ultraman to his NRA label and asked the band to record their first album.

Zarins is ethnically Latvian, but was born in Germany at the end of the Second World War. His parents emigrated to the United States soon after he was born. He graduated from high school in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1963 and earned a B.A. in anthropology from the University of Nebraska in 1967. He served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam before completing his Ph.D. in Ancient Near Eastern Languages and Archaeology at the University of Chicago in 1974. He then served as archaeological adviser to the Department of Antiquities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before coming to Missouri State in 1978. He discussed Ubar in a 1996 NOVA interview: In 2007, following further research and excavation, a paper partly authored by him narrowed the meaning of the name \\"Ubar\\". Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that \\"Ubar\\" was more likely to have been a region‚Äîthe \\"Land of the Iobaritae\\" identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to several factors: frankincense trade diminished in importance because of the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals, the climatic changes led to desiccation of the area (desert ground-water levels continued to fall and the oases dried up), while sea transport became a more reliable way of carrying goods. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin. Zarins has published many articles on a number of topics concerning the archaeology of the Near East, which include the domestication of the horse, early pastoral nomadism, and the obsidian, indigo, and frankincense trades. He received an Excellence in Research Award from Missouri State in 1988. He has proposed that the Semitic languages arose as a result of a circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral complex, which developed in the period of the desiccation of climates at the end of the pre-pottery phase in the Ancient Near East. Zarins argued that the Garden of Eden was situated at the head of the Persian Gulf, where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run into the sea, from his research on this area using information from many different sources, including LANDSAT images from space. In this theory, the Bible's Gihon River would correspond with the Karun River in Iran, and the Pishon River would correspond to the Wadi Batin river system that once drained the now dry, but once quite fertile central part of the Arabian Peninsula. His suggestion about the Pishon River is supported by James A. Sauer (1945‚Äì1999) formerly of the American Center of Oriental Research although strongly criticized by the archaeological community.

Later years  Keith was among the Scottish magnateshttp://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/scotland/esnews/es0502a.aspx who in 1320 signed a letter to the Pope vindicating Scottish independence. Afterward, he was given several diplomatic assignments, serving as a peace commissioner to England in 1323. He was also among the dignitaries who ratified the Treaty of Corbeil (1326) with the King of France. He was killed fighting for King David II of Scotland at the Battle of Dupplin Moor.  Ancestors and descendants  Sir Robert Keith was the great-great-great- grandson of Hervey de Keith, the first Marischal of Scotland. Keith's grandson and successor as Marischal, also named Robert Keith, was killed during the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346. Keith's indirect descendants, eventually known as the Earls Marischal, held that title for several centuries to come. During the English Civil War, one of his descendants fought as a Royalist officer, and was imprisoned under Oliver Cromwell's regime.

Other N-terminal residues can also be cleaved, however. LAPs have been found across superkingdoms. Identified LAPs include human LAP, bovine lens LAP, porcine LAP, Escherichia coli (E. coli) LAP (also known as PepA or XerB), and the solanaceous-specific acidic LAP (LAP-A) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Enzyme description, structure, and active site LAP-A active site residues. Two Zn+2 cations are also shown, along with a water and a bicarbonate ion that acts as a general base. The active sites in PepA and in bovine lens LAP have been found to be similar. Shown in the picture below is the proposed model for the active site of LAP-A in tomato based on the work of Strater et al. It is also known that the biochemistry of the LAPs from these three kingdoms is very similar. PepA, bovine lens LAP, and LAP-A preferentially cleave N-terminal leucine, arginine, and methionine residues. These enzymes are all metallopeptidases requiring divalent metal cations for their enzymatic activity Enzymes are active in the presence of Mn+2, Mg+2 and Zn+2. These enzymes are also known to have high pH (pH 8) and temperature optima. At pH 8, the highest enzymatic activity is seen at 60 ¬∞C. PepA, bovine lens LAP and LAP-A are also known to form hexamers in vivo. The Gu et al. from 1999 demonstrated that six 55kDA enzymatically inactive LAP-A protomers come together to form the 353kDa bioactive LAP-A hexamer. Structures of the bovine lens LAP protomer and the biologically active hexamer have been constructed can be found through Protein Data Bank (2J9A). Mechanism(s) Historically, the mechanisms of carboxypeptidases and endoprotease have been much more well-studied and understood by researchers (Ref #6 Lipscomb 1990). Work within the past two decades has provided vital knowledge regarding the mechanisms of aminopeptidases. The mechanism of In this mechanism, the bicarbonate ion acts as a general base. For LAP-A, R1 could be the R group of leucine, methionine, or arginine. bovine lens LAP and PepA have been elucidated (Ref 1 and 2), however, the exact mechanism of tomato LAP-A is unknown at this time. A search of current literature does not indicate that new research is underway to determine the exact mechanism of LAP-A. Based on the biochemical similarities of the LAPs between kingdoms, the mechanism of LAP-A may be similar to bovine lens LAP and PepA. Biological function Once thought of as a housekeeping gene necessary only for protein turnover, studies have demonstrated that LAP-A has a regulatory role in the immune response in tomato. = Background on plant immune response = In order to survive, plants must be able to respond to many biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogen attack, piercing/sucking insects, herbivory, and mechanical wounding. These stresses activate specialized signal transduction pathways, which are specific to the stressor and the amount of tissue damage inflicted. Similar to mechanical wounding, chewing insects, such as the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta, one of the major pests of tomato), cause extensive tissue damage activating the jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated response (Walling 2000). This JA-mediated response revolves around the octadecanoid pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of JA and several other potent signaling molecules, and ends in the regulation of two sets of genes whose expression changes over time. The early genes amplify the wounding signal and can be detected 30 minutes to 2 hours after damage (Ryan 2000). Late gene expression can be seen 4‚Äì24 hours after wounding. Products of late-response genes act as deterrents to chewing-insect feeding, often by decreasing the nutritional value of the food ingested or interfering with insect gut function (Walling 2000). For example, serine proteinase inhibitors (Pins) interfere with digestive proteases in the insect gut and polyphenol oxidases (PPO) act to decrease the nutritive value of plant leaves after ingestion by herbivores (Johnson et al. 1989; Ryan 2000; Orozco-Cardenas 2001). Please see the Picture 3 for a summary of the wound response in tomato. The wounding response pathway as studied in tomato. The plant response in this octadecanoid pathway is similar to mammalian prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways (Ref Walling 2000). This particular pathway is inhibited by salicylic acid. = Octadecanoid pathway = (LAP-A), a product of the octadecanoid pathway in some solanaceous plants, has been shown by Fowler et al. to have a regulatory role in the late wound response of tomato. Experiments were conducted using three genotypes of tomato plants: wildtype (WT), (LapA-SI) plants that were silenced for LAP-A, and LapA-OX that constitutively expressed LAP-A. Late-gene expression was inhibited in wounded LapA-SI plants, and the LapA-SI plants were also more susceptible to tobacco hornworm feeding, relative to wildtype (WT) plants. In comparison, the wounded LapA-OX leaves exhibited heightened levels of late gene RNA accumulation, an increased resistance to herbivory, and extended expression of late wound-response genes. These data suggest that LAP-A functions in regulating both the intensity and the persistence of the late wound response. However, unwounded LapA-OX did not accumulate late gene RNA transcripts, suggesting that presence of LAP-A alone is not sufficient to induce late gene expression. LAP-A is the first plant aminopeptidase shown to have a regulatory role in signal transduction pathway. = Osmoregulation = LAP proteins are expressed in a variety of marine organisms as a method of coping with the osmotic threat high salinity poses to the cell. During bouts of high salinity, LAP begins the catalysis of proteins in order to release amino acids into the cell in an attempt to balance the high ion concentrations in the external environment.

The Lusk Home Vermonter Salmon Lusk was awarded this land for serving in the Battle of Tippecanoe under William Henry Harrison. The Lusks werely largely self-sufficient. Captain Lusk built a log cabin in 1822 and lived there with his spouse and eight children until 1841. Then he and his sons made bricks, carved walnut woodwork, and built the brick house. He dug a coal mine to heat his house. Lusk built a gristmill in 1826 with a foundation of stone-cut stone. A horizontal waterwheel was powered by water diverted by a dam down a race. A settlement grew around Lusk's house and mill, until a Sugar Creek flood on New Year's Day, 1847, washed away every building except Lusk's brick house.

After John Lusk died in 1915, the property was put up for sale. A logging company, Hoosier Veneer, paid US$30,200.00 for the site. Richard Lieber and the State Parks Commission raised $40,000.00 to buy the land from the lumber company after last minute support from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on November 11, 1916.

One tiny church survives from that period. The new Trinity monastery was founded nearby by Bishop Lazar Baranovych in 1649. In the neighbouring city of Novhorod-Siverskyi, Baranovych founded a printing press, which was rare at the time. He later transferred the printing press to the Trinity Monastery. The monastery's adjacent printing press was famed for their production of engravings, and its library ‚Äî for containing more than 11,000 books. The main church, or the katholikon, was constructed between 1679 and 1695 to designs by Johann Baptist Sauer, a master builder from Wilno. This church has seven pear-shaped cupolas. It is considered a high point of Ukrainian Baroque architecture (as practiced under the auspices of Hetman Ivan Mazepa). After the monastery was closed in 1786, the Trinity cathedral was considerably rebuilt, losing four domes and most Baroque details. Its current appearance is the result of a 1980s reconstruction campaign. It has been the seat of a local bishopric since 1991.

Usana products, most of which are manufactured at the company's West Valley City facility, are sold in 24 countries via a network of independent distributors (referred to as \\"associates\\"). Most of Usana's independent distributors make less money than the cost of the initial qualifying purchase. In 2015 Usana was the 24th largest multi-level marketing company in the world by revenue. The company has been subject to criticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other government agencies for its multilevel marketing practices. It has faced class action lawsuits on behalf of low-level distributors and litigation from Barry Minkow, some of which have been settled out of court.  History  In 1992, immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz moved his diagnostic testing company, Gull Laboratories, from Salt Lake City to West Valley City, Utah and spun it into Usana Health Services, a multilevel marketing manufacturer of supplements. Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005. Usana's products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as \\"associates\\") or by direct order through the company. At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active \\"Preferred Customers\\" in its worldwide distribution network. In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates In August 2007, Usana was notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ due to its Form 10-Q, and was determined to be in compliance that October. In December 2010, Usana completed the application process to transfer the listing of its common stock from the NASDAQ National Market System, which it had been trading on since 1996, to the New York Stock Exchange. The transfer became official at the beginning of 2011. It received drug-establishment registration from the Food and Drug Administration to manufacture over-the-counter drugs later that year. Usana has partnered with HealthCorps on health education for children and, in 2019, the Usana Foundation's Kids Eat program opened a facility to pack and distribute food for childhood hunger in the Utah area. It also was announced as the official nutritional partner of the Spartan Race endurance brand in the United States. The company acquired BabyCare Ltd., a China-based prenatal supplement company, in 2013 and announced that it would build a manufacturing facility in the country. By 2018, Usana had reported record revenue due to growth in the Asia Pacific region, though it recorded a 7% drop in net sales during its 2019 annual report. Its sales for the first quarter of 2020 declined by 2.3 percent compared with 2019 numbers. =Reception= From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes \\"200 Best Small Companies\\" list. In 2007, a Forbes article quoted industry experts and government officials who had raised questions about the cost of Usana's supplements as well as its business practices. Radio-Canada later aired an investigative report that examined the company's products, pricing and \\"misleading income claims\\" made to potential associates concerning revenue. It included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, which found one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies and distributor agreements. This contrasted the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing companies to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant. In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using Usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia. John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions‚Äîa phenomenon referred to as the \\"licensing effect\\".  Products  Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Cellsentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sens√© & Celavive personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test, which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements. As of 2019, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Philippines, France, China, Spain, Italy, Germany, Romania, Denmark, Colombia and Indonesia.https://www.dsa.org/forms/CompanyFormPublicMembers/view?id=7F3000008D9 Business model Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales \\"associates\\" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a \\"downline\\"). Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110‚Äì$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid. According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates. According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the \\"top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually\\". The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines \\"associates\\" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors. The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers. Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers. New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating \\"you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme.\\" When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith's opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company's significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit. Leadership In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after members of its board of directors, medical advisory board and several of its executives had made false statements regarding their qualifications including education and licenses. Founder Myron Wentz was the company's chief executive officer from 1992 until 2008 when his son, Dave Wentz, succeeded him after working in positions such as president, executive vice president and senior vice president of strategic development. In 2015, Usana announced that the chief executive officer role would be divided between Wentz and Kevin Guest with the former taking global operations and for the latter, field development and sales. Guest was appointed the sole chief executive officer in November 2016.USANA Board of Directors Appoints Dave Wentz and Kevin Guest as Co-Chief Executive OfficersCEO Cites Success from Experiences, Relationships, Lessons Sponsorships Usana has been a paid sponsor of various athletic organizations. Usana offers an \\"Athlete Guarantee Program\\" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD. In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011. As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season. In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000. In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018. Lawsuits On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. The SEC conducted an investigation of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended. Minkow acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price. Usana filed suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation. Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims. The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again. In April 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed that alleged Usana common stock had artificially inflated prices. In January 2008, a shareholder suit was filed with allegations that Usana had mislead investors about the sustainability of its growth and business model. The cases were dismissed and the company was cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after an informal inquiry into the allegations, stating that it did \\"not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the Commission.\\" Later that year, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures. In February 2019, the Ministry of Commerce in China suspended operations for all multi-level marketing companies and participants to conduct a 100-day review of the health foods industry in the country due to exaggerated product advertising claims and questionable health products in the unregulated industry. Chinese departments initiated \\"Hundred Days of Action\\" to clean up the health market where 49 products from various companies were revoked, 54 food business licenses of various companies were revoked, 90 business licenses of various companies were revoked and 465 counterfeit and fake dens were destroyed. 85 companies, including BabyCare Ltd., a Usana subsidiary, signed a declaration to self-discipline and regulate operations with BabyCare speaking at an event hosted by the Chinese government.

It runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction from a junction with U.S. Highway 190 (US 190) and LA 411 in Livonia to LA 1 in Parlange. The route connects the town of Livonia with New Roads, the parish seat, and other points along the False River via LA 1\\\\. Though it largely serves a north‚Äìsouth function, the signage for LA 78 does not carry directional banners. Route description From the south, LA 78 begins at an intersection with US 190 (Airline Highway) and LA 411 (Maringouin Road East) in Livonia. US 190 connects to Baton Rouge on the east and Opelousas on the west, while LA 411 heads southward along Bayou Grosse Tete toward Maringouin. LA 78 proceeds to the north, acting as the main north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare of Livonia. After a short distance, it curves to the northeast and continues through a largely residential area. later, LA 78 exits Livonia and turns further toward the east into an area known as Frisco. In Frisco, LA 78 curves to the north to cross a bridge over Bayou Grosse Tete. Immediately afterward, it intersects LA 979, a short connector to the nearby LA 978\\\\. From this intersection, LA 78 turns to the northwest and quickly begins a long curve back to the northeast through an area of mixed rural and residential development. later, the route reaches its end at LA 1 in Parlange, located on the west bank of the False River. LA 1 connects to Baton Rouge via US 190 to the southeast and follows the False River northward into New Roads. The route is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 4,200 within Livonia; 4,100 between Livonia and LA 979; and 3,500 from there to LA 1. The posted speed limit is initially in Livonia, increasing to at Bergeron Street. Upon reaching LA 979, the speed limit returns to , increasing to and finally to north of Frisco. LA 78 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 136 was designated as State Route 136. Route 136 was created in 1928 by an act of the state legislature. At the time, US 190 had not yet been constructed through the area. Livonia was located just north of the junction of Route 1 (the Jefferson Highway) and Route 7 (the Evangeline Highway). These were the main highways connecting Baton Rouge with Alexandria and Opelousas, respectively. US 71 had been designated in 1926 and duplicated Route 1 through central Louisiana. Route 136 began at US 71/State Route 1 (the present LA 77) and proceeded east across Bayou Grosse Tete on Bridge Road. It then turned north to follow the present route of LA 78 to Parlange, where Route 93 continued toward New Roads. In 1933, a new highway was constructed along the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway (now the Union Pacific Railroad) through Livonia, essentially replacing Route 7 between Baton Rouge and Krotz Springs. Two years later, this became part of US 190, which was extended from its original western terminus in Baton Rouge. Sometime before the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, Route 136 was re-routed to begin at US 190 (the southern terminus of the present LA 78) and proceed north through Livonia. This section of the route was formerly part of Route 981, which followed the present LA 411 along the east bank of Bayou Grosse Tete. =Post-1955 route history= LA 78 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of State Route 136. Its route has remained the same to the present day.

Early years Born near Masbrough, Rotherham, Ironside grew up in Sheffield, the son of Samuel Ironside, a Wesleyan lay preacher, and Mary Bradbury. On both sides of the family there were roots in the Independent Church in Masbrough - Mary's grandfather Isaac Bradbury was well known as an \\"Old Jacobin\\". Isaac's younger brother Samuel Ironside travelled as a Methodist missionary to New Zealand, where he became a supporter and signatory of the Treaty of Waitangi.\\"Samuel Ironside in New Zealand\\", W.

However, the colony was not a success, and the couple returned to Sheffield. In 1833, he joined his father's new accountancy business, and by the 1840s came to run it. Chartism A supporter of Chartism, Ironside joined the Sheffield Political Union in 1831 and worked as the campaign secretary for the Radical candidate Thomas Asline Ward, who stood for Sheffield in the 1832 general election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1833, he became a founder member of Sheffield's Mechanics Institute. He increasingly became a leading figure in Sheffield Chartism, and spoke alongside Ebenezer Elliott at a mass meeting in Paradise Square in 1838.Chartism in South Yorkshire However, with the defeat of the first Chartist petition, the local movement was split between supporters of and opponents of violence, and he increasingly stayed away from meetings. During the late 1830s, Ironside took up phrenology, but soon abandoned it, as it was \\"not capable of rigid demonstration\\", and because many of its practitioners made implausible claims about it.Roger Cooter, The Cultural Meaning of Popular Science Conflict In 1839, poet James Montgomery had Ironside removed from his post as honorary secretary of the Institute after Ironside placed eight books dealing with socialism on the shelves. Montgomery also claimed that Ironside had encouraged subversion by opening a coffee room.Friends of Sheffield General Cemetery, \\"Montgomery James\\" Instead, Ironside worked with Owen, proposing agrarian communities, and opening a Hall of Science in Sheffield. He wrote a polemic attacking John Brindley and despite moving away from Owen, founded a Workers' Educational Institute at the Hall of Science in 1848. Power In 1846, Ironside was elected to Sheffield Town Council representing Ecclesall, where he founded the Central Democratic Association to raise socialist and Chartist demands. By 1849, this grouping had grown to 22 members and was able to force the creation of a health committee and the construction of a model farm on broadly Owenite principles at Hollow Meadows. Utilising Joshua Toulmin Smith's localist ideas, he set up a system of \\"wardmote\\" committees where any local citizen could influence council policy. With their support, he ensured that Sheffield's streets were paved and underground sewers were laid during the 1850s. He also supported women's suffrage, and encouraged Anne Knight to found the Sheffield Female Political Association.Jane Rendall, \\"Glossary \\", Women's Politics in Britain 1780-1870: Claiming Citizenship. Later years In 1851, Ironside founded the Sheffield Free Press, becoming an outspoken supporter of David Urquhart, and leading support for Toulmin Smith's candidature for Sheffield at the 1852 general election. In 1856, he corresponded with Karl Marx.Letters of Marx and Engels: 1856 He retained his seat on the council until 1868. He died in 1870 and was buried in Sheffield General Cemetery. Isaac and his wife Elizabeth had five daughters:General Register Office, Indexes of Births (for the younger four daughters) and of Marriages (for Emma) Emma (1835), Frances (1841), Una (1845), Kate (1850), and Lilian (1852).

The program consists of two main components: a \\"Specified Persons List\\" which includes the name, birth date, and gender of individuals believed to pose a security threat, and a set of \\"Identity Screening Regulations\\" requiring all passengers who appear to be 18 years of age or older to present valid government-issued ID before they are allowed to board a flight. But in reality infants have been flagged by the system and had to wait at least one feeding and two diaper changes before being cleared. The list itself contains 1250 ¬± 750 names. Individuals who are denied boarding because their name appears on the list can submit an appeal to the Office of Reconsideration, which is a part of Transport Canada. The Passenger Protect Program's implementation date was June 18, 2007 for Canadian domestic flights and international flights to and from Canada. How the program works Airlines compare the names of individuals intending to board flights with the names on the specified persons list, and verify with the individual‚Äôs government-issued identification when there is a name match. Identification is verified in person at the airport check-in counter. Transport Canada works with air carriers to provide training for agents and staff who are involved in implementing the ID verification requirement, and establish procedures that respect the rights of passengers. When the airline verifies that an individual matches in name, date of birth and gender with someone on the list, the airline is required to inform Transport Canada. A Transport Canada officer is on duty 24 hours a day, every day, to receive calls from airlines when they have a potential match with a specified person on the list. The Transport Canada officer verifies information with the airline and makes a decision based on all the information whether to issue an emergency direction that the individual poses an immediate threat to aviation security and should not be permitted to board the flight.Security and Emergency Preparedness Controversy A number of civil society organizations have raised objections to the Passenger Protect program, citing concerns about civil liberties, privacy, racial profiling, and the perceived failure of the US no-fly list. In addition, Canada's official federal and provincial privacy commissioners have criticized various aspects of the program. Lawyer Faisal Kutty filed submissions against the initiative on behalf of more than two dozen groups titled \\"Too Guilty to Fly, Too Innocent to Charge?\\" He also wrote an op-ed about the ineffectiveness of the no-fly list. In March 2016, Belgian lawyer, Human Rights defender, and civil servant of the European Parliament Paul-Emile Dupret was not allowed to fly from Paris to Montreal with an official delegation of the European Parliament focused on the EU-Canada trade negotiations (CETA). The reason given was that Mr Dupret's name is included in the US No-Fly-List, even if the airplane was even not crossing the US airspace.

Gang members Paulie McGonagle (died November 1974) was a Boston mobster and onetime leader of the Mullen Gang, a South Boston street gang involved in burglary, auto theft, and armed robbery. During the war against Donald Killeen and his brothers, McGonagle successfully led the Mullens in a string of shootings which finally ended with Killeen's murder in 1972. After a truce was arranged with Whitey Bulger and the remnants of the Killeen organization, McGonagle remained angry about Bulger's accidental murder of his fraternal twin brother, Donald McGonagle. It is believed that this was one of the reasons for his disappearance in November 1974. His body was later excavated from a shallow grave on Boston's Tenean Beach. Tommy King (died 1975) was a Boston mobster and member of the Mullens during their gang war against Donald Killeen and his lieutenants Billy O'Sullivan and James J. Bulger during the early 1970s. Following Killeen's murder in 1972, he became an associate of Bulger and the Winter Hill Gang after his alleged involvement in the death of Paul McGonagle. In 1975, he disappeared following an altercation with Bulger in a Southie watering hole. He was suspected of having been killed by hitman John Martorano. Patrick Nee was born to an Irish-speaking family in Rosmuc, Ireland in 1943. He was brought to the US by his parents in 1952 and became a member of the Mullen Gang at the age of 14. He fought in several turf battles before joining the US Marine Corps. He arrived in Vietnam in 1965 and saw combat at Phu Bai. After his return to South Boston in October 1966, he rejoined the Mullens and became one of their leaders in the war against the Killeen brothers. Nee arranged the truce that ended the war by arranging a sit-down in Boston's South End. After being supplanted by Bulger, he moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts and switched increasingly to smuggling arms to the Provisional IRA. He currently resides in South Boston and is the author of the memoir, A Criminal and an Irishman. Feud with the Killeen Gang The Killeen brothers - Donald, Kenneth, George and Edward - were an Irish-American crime family which ran the bookmaking and loansharking in South Boston, Massachusetts. They used muscle to make collections, and to make examples of those who didn‚Äôt pay in a timely fashion. The Mullens, by contrast, were a loosely organized crew of thieves. But being in Southie, it was just a matter of time before they butted heads with the Killeens. The Mullens Gang were mostly thieves who stole from the ships that brought goods into Boston Harbor and from the warehouses where they were stored. The crew was particularly talented and opportunistic, as likely to steal a truckload of Easter hams as one of televisions. They also had strength in numbers; the Boston Police Department at one time estimated there were as many as sixty members. In 1971, Donald Killeen's younger brother, Kenneth, bit off the nose of Mickie Dwyer, a member of the rival Mullen Gang, at The Transit, a local watering hole. Paulie McGonagle, Francis (Buddy) Leonard, Thomas King, and Dennis (Buddy) Roche went to The Transit (the Killeen Gang‚Äôs main base of operations) looking to confront the Killeens who had already left the bar. The presence of the Mullens at the Killeens headquarters was viewed as a direct challenge by Donald Killeen. A gangland war soon resulted, leading to a string of slayings throughout Boston and the surrounding suburbs. Several weeks following the Transit incident, Killeen enforcers Billy O'Sullivan and \\"Whitey\\" Bulger encountered Mullen member \\"Buddy\\" Roache, brother of future Police Commissioner Francis \\"Mickey\\" Roache, in a bar on Broadway in South Boston. After a heated argument, Roache was shot and left paralyzed for life. A short time later, Bulger and O'Sullivan killed Donald McGonagle. Donald was not a member of the Mullens and was killed by mistake. His brother, Paulie McGonagle vowed revenge and according to Patrick Nee personally murdered O‚ÄôSullivan near his house at Savin Hill. The killing of O‚ÄôSullivan revitalized the Mullens and the Killeens quickly found themselves outgunned and outmaneuvered. On May 13, 1972, South Boston mob boss Donald Killeen was shot to death by Mullen gang enforcer Jimmy Mantville outside his home in suburban Framingham, Massachusetts. The leadership of the Killeen faction then devolved on Bulger, who was in hiding on Cape Cod. Rather than murdering Bulger as some Mullens, including Paulie McGonagle desired, Patrick Nee arranged for their dispute to be mediated by Howie Winter, the godfather of the Irish-American Winter Hill Gang of Somerville and Joe Russo of the Patriarca crime family. After a sit- down at Chandler's restaurant in the South End, Boston, the two gangs joined forces with Winter as overall boss. By 1973 Bulger was in control of the rackets in South Boston. He began to use his influence to remove opposition, by persuading Winter to sanction the murders of those rivals whom he viewed as having stepped out of line. These included former Mullens Spike O'Toole and Paulie McGonagle, who was murdered by Bulger and buried in a shallow grave in Boston's Tenean Beach. It is also alleged that Bulger had direct involvement in the murders of Eddie Connors in January 1975 and Mullens Tommy King and Buddy Leonard in November 1975. Further reading *English, T.J.

Most scientists in the field now refer to this enzyme as CPA1, and to a related pancreatic carboxypeptidase as CPA2.  Types  In addition, there are 4 other mammalian enzymes named CPA-3 through CPA-6, and none of these are expressed in the pancreas. Instead, these other CPA-like enzymes have diverse functions. * CPA3 (also known as mast-cell CPA) is involved in the digestion of proteins by mast cells. * CPA4 (previously known as CPA-3, but renumbered when mast-cell CPA was designated CPA-3) may be involved in tumor progression, but this enzyme has not been well studied. * CPA5 has not been well studied. * CPA6 is expressed in many tissues during mouse development, and in adult shows a more limited distribution in brain and several other tissues. CPA6 is present in the extracellular matrix where it is enzymatically active. A human mutation of CPA-6 has been linked to Duane's syndrome (abnormal eye movement). Recently, mutations in CPA6 were found to be linked to epilepsy.  Function  CPA-1 and CPA-2 (and, it is presumed, all other CPAs) employ a zinc ion within the protein for hydrolysis of the peptide bond at the C-terminal end of an amino acid residue. Loss of the zinc leads to loss of activity, which can be replaced easily by zinc, and also by some other divalent metals (cobalt, nickel). Carboxypeptidase A is produced in the pancreas and is crucial to many processes in the human body to include digestion, post-translational modification of proteins, blood clotting, and reproduction.  Applications  This vast scope of functionality for a single protein makes it the ideal model for research regarding other zinc proteases of unknown structure. Recent biomedical research on collagenase, enkephlinase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme used carboxypeptidase A for inhibitor synthesis and kinetic testing. For example, a drug that treats high blood pressure, Captopril, was designed based on a carboxypeptidase A inhibitor. Carboxypeptidase A and the target enzyme of Captopril, angiotensin-converting enzyme, have very similar structures, as they both contain a zinc ion within the active site. This allowed for a potent carboxypeptidase A inhibitor to be used to inhibit the enzyme and, thus, lower blood pressure through the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Structure  Carboxypeptidase A (CPA) contains a zinc (Zn2+) metal center in a tetrahedral geometry with amino acid residues in close proximity around zinc to facilitate catalysis and binding. Out of the 307 amino acids bonded in a peptide chain, the following amino acid residues are important for catalysis and binding; Glu-270, Arg-71, Arg-127, Asn-144, Arg-145, and Tyr-248. Figure 1 illustrates the tetrahedral zinc complex active site with the important amino acid residues that surround the complex.Christianson, D., W., and Lipscomb, W., N. (1989) Carboxypeptidase A. American Chemical Society, Vol (22): 62-69. The zinc metal is a strong electrophilic Lewis acid catalyst which stabilizes a coordinated water molecule as well as stabilizes the negative intermediates that occur throughout the hydrolytic reaction. Stabilization of both the coordinated water molecule and negative intermediates are assisted by polar residues in the active site which are in close proximity to facilitate hydrogen bonding. Figure 1. CPA Active Site The active site can be characterized into two sub- sites denoted as S1‚Äô and S1. The S1‚Äô sub-site is the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme, and Tyr-248 acts to ‚Äòcap‚Äô the hydrophobic pocket after substrate or inhibitor is bound (SITE). The hydrogen bonding from the hydroxyl group in Tyr-248 facilitates this conformation due to interaction with the terminal carboxylates of substrates that bind. Substantial movement is required for this enzyme and induced fit model explains how this interaction occurs. A triad of residues interact to the C-terminal carboxylate through hydrogen bonding: * Salt linkage with positively charged Arg-145 * Hydrogen bond from Tyr-248 * Hydrogen bond from the nitrogen of the Asn-144 amide  Mechanism  Classified as a metalloexopeptidase, carboxypeptidase A consists of a single polypeptide chain bound to a zinc ion. This characteristic metal ion is located within the active site of the enzyme, along with five amino acid residues that are involved in substrate binding: Arg-71, Arg-127, Asn-144, Arg-145, Tyr-248, and Glu-270. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed five subsites on the protein. These allosteric sites are involved in creating the ligand-enzyme specificity seen in most bioactive enzymes. One of these subsites induces a conformational change at Tyr-248 upon binding of a substrate molecule at the primary active site. The phenolic hydroxyl of tyrosine forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal carboxylate of the ligand. In addition, a second hydrogen bond is formed between the tyrosine and a peptide linkage of longer peptide substrates. These changes make the bond between the enzyme and ligand, whether it is substrate or inhibitor, much stronger. This property of carboxypeptidase A led to the first clause of Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.‚Äôs ‚Äúinduced fit‚Äù hypothesis. The S1 sub-site is where catalysis occurs in CPA, and the zinc ion is coordinated by Glu-72, His-69, and His-196 enzyme residues. A plane exists that bisects the active-site groove where residues Glu-270 and Arg-127 are on opposite sides of the zinc-water coupled complex. The zinc is electron rich due to glutamine ligands coordinating the zinc because before substrate binds, Glu-72 coordinates bidentate but shifts to monodentate after substrate binds. As a result, the zinc metal is not able to deprotonate the coordinated water molecule to make a hydroxyl nucleophile. Figure 2. CPA-Catalyzed proteolysis promoted by coordinated water molecule. Glu-270 and Arg-127 play an important role in catalysis shown in Figure 2. Arg-127 acts to stabilize the carbonyl of the substrate that is bound to amino group of phenylalanine. Simultaneously, the water molecule coordinated to zinc is deprotonated by Glu-270 and interacts with the carbonyl stabilized by Arg-127. This creates an intermediate, shown in Figure 2, where the negatively charged oxygen is coordinated to zinc, and through unfavorable electrostatic interactions between Glu-270 and the ionized product facilitates the release of the product at the end of catalysis. In recent computational studies, the mechanism of catalysis is similar but the difference in mechanism is that deprotonated water molecule binds to the carbon of the carbonyl, whereas Figure 2 shows the hydroxyl group stays coordinated to zinc. Then proteolysis occurs and the water molecule is then introduced back into the active site to coordinate to zinc. Several studies have been conducted exploring the details of the bond between carboxypeptidase A and substrate and how this affects the rate of hydrolysis. In 1934, it was first discovered through kinetic experiments that, in order for substrate to bind, the peptide that is to be hydrolyzed must be adjacent to a terminal free hydroxyl group. Also, the rate of hydrolysis can be enhanced if the C-terminal residue is branched aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the substrate is a dipeptide with a free amino group, it undergoes hydrolysis slowly; this, however, can be avoided if the amino group is blocked by N-acylation It is quite clear that the structure of the enzyme, to be specific the active site, is very important in understanding the mechanism of reaction. For this reason, Rees and colleagues studied the enzyme-ligand complex to get a clear answer for the role of the zinc ion. These studies found that, in free enzyme, the zinc coordination number is five; the metal center is coordinated with two imidazole NŒ¥1 nitrogens, the two carboxylate oxygens of glutamate-72, and a water molecule to form a distorted tetrahedral. However, once ligand binds at the active site of carboxypeptidase A, this coordination number can vary from five to six. When bound to dipeptide glycyl-L-tyrosine, the amino nitrogen of the dipeptide and the carbonyl oxygen replaced the water ligand. This would yield a coordination number of six for the zinc in the carboxypeptidase A- dipeptide glycyl-L- tyrosine complex. Electron density maps gave evidence that the amino nitrogen occupies a second position near glutamate-270. The closeness of these two residues would result in a steric hindrance preventing the water ligand from coordinating with zinc. This would result in a coordination number of five. Data for both are substantial, indicating that both situations occur naturally There are two proposed mechanisms for the catalytic function of carboxypeptidase A. The first is a nucleophilic pathway involving a covalent acyl enzyme intermediate containing active site base Glu-270. Evidence for this anhydride intermediate is mixed; Suh and colleagues isolated what is assumed to by the acyl intermediate. However, confirmation of the acyl enzyme was done without trapping experiments, making the conclusions weak. The second proposed mechanism is a promoted water pathway. This mechanism involves attack of a water molecule at the scissile peptide linkage of the substrate. This process is promoted by the zinc ion and assisted by residue Glu-270.

Like the book, the film recounts the experiences of Roy Hobbs, an individual with great \\"natural\\" baseball talent, spanning the decades of Roy's career. It was the first film produced by TriStar Pictures. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. All-High Stadium, also in Buffalo, stood in for Chicago's Wrigley Field in a key scene. Plot In 1910s Nebraska, young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father, who suffers an early fatal heart attack near an oak tree. When lightning strikes that same tree, splintering it, Hobbs makes a baseball bat from the wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name ‚ÄúWonderboy‚Äù into the barrel. Now 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the Chicago Cubs, leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. En route on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer the ‚ÄúWhammer‚Äù and sportswriter Max Mercy. On a stopover at a carnival, Hobbs wins a bet to strike out Whammer on three pitches. The feat catches the attention of Harriet Bird, a mysterious woman also traveling on the train who was previously fawning over Whammer. In Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. She asks if Hobbs's claim that he can be ‚Äúthe best there ever was,‚Äù is true, and he confidently answers ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù Harriet aims a handgun at Hobbs and shoots him in the abdomen. It is learned that Harriet, who commits suicide, previously targeted other top athletes. Sixteen years later, in 1939, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the Knights, a struggling ball club sitting in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was recruited, believing him too old. He initially refuses to play Hobbs but finally relents. At his first batting practice, Hobbs amazes the entire team with his powerful hitting. The following game, Pop benches star outfielder Bump Bailey after a reckless play. Pop pinch hits with Hobbs, who literally knocks the baseball's cover off. Shortly after, Bailey tragically dies crashing through an outfield wall, resulting in Hobbs being made starting outfielder. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights‚Äô fortunes turn around. Mercy finds Hobbs to be familiar but fails to recognize him as the pitcher who once struck out the Whammer. Assistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, then his Knights ownership share will revert to the team's majority owner, the Judge. Pop will permanently be out of the sport. Hobbs privately meets with the Judge who offers him $5,000 to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe. During a practice session, Mercy watches Hobbs pitching and suddenly remembers him. Mercy introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie whom Hobbs learns places large bets against him. He also meets Pop's niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding relationship results in a distracted Hobbs‚Äô game slumping. Pop privately cautions Hobbs about Memo, who appears to be working for the Judge, though Hobbs dismisses his concerns. Hobbs' slump continues until a game against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, during which a woman in white stands up in the bleachers, catching Hobbs‚Äô attention. He then hits a home run, shattering the clock on the scoreboard. He realizes the woman is Iris, and the two later meet at a diner. They discuss their respective lives, though Hobbs avoids mentioning what happened to him. When they meet the next day, Hobbs tells Iris the truth. Iris, who is unmarried and works in Chicago, shares that she has a son whose father lives in New York City. The reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. At a team party, Hobbs is poisoned by Memo, collapses in pain and awakens in the maternity ward of a local hospital. A silver bullet removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage that could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball. He learns the Knights have since lost three games in a row, which sets up a one-game playoff against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Memo visits Hobbs in the hospital and urges him to accept the Judge's bribe, which has been quadrupled, and to walk away. The Judge tells Hobbs to consider his offer and threatens to publicly expose Hobbs' past and reveals that another team member is being bribed. Hobbs again rejects the Judge's offer. When Iris visits Hobbs, she assures him he has not wasted his potential and is a great ballplayer. Hobbs, still recovering, returns to the team wanting to play. Pop tells Hobbs that he is the best player he has ever seen and says to suit up. As the game progresses, Hobbs realizes that Knights pitcher Al Fowler is the bribed player. Hobbs confronts Fowler on the field, warning him not to throw the game. Fowler starts pitching competitively and the Knights stay in the game. Watching from the stands with her son, Iris begs an usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout, telling him that she has brought their son to watch him play. In the ninth inning, the Knights trail the Pirates when the latter brings in a young, hard-throwing pitcher. Seeing that Hobbs is hampered by his old wound, the pitcher throws inside trying to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul but has struck the ball so hard that his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. Hobbs asks Bobby Savoy, the bat boy, to pick a replacement. Bobby brings him his own bat, the ‚ÄúSavoy Special‚Äù, that Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, hits the ball, smashing it into the stadium lights, winning the game and the National League pennant. The Knights advance to the World Series, though the outcome is not revealed. The victory secures Pop's share of the team and his place on it. At the end, Hobbs is seen playing catch with his son in the same field that he and his father played in many years earlier, while Iris looks on.

Phil Dusenberry wrote the first adaption. In October 1981, Roger Towne, a Columbia Pictures story editor and brother of Robert Towne, quit to produce and write the screenplay, with Bean set to direct and Kahn co-producing. In 1983, newly- formed Tri-Star Pictures acquired the rights to the film adaptation, its first production. It was Robert Redford's first acting role in three years. The film's producers stated in the DVD extras that the film was not intended to be a literal adaptation of the novel, but was merely \\"based on\\" the novel. Malamud's daughter said on one of the DVD extras that her father had seen the film, and his take on it was that it had \\"legitimized him as a writer.\\" Darren McGavin was cast late in the process as gambler Gus Sands and was uncredited in the film. Due to a disagreement, he chose not to be credited, though later Levinson wanted to credit him and McGavin said no. Levinson stated on the DVD extras for the 2007 edition that because there had been too little time during post-production to find a professional announcer willing and able to provide voice-over services, Levinson recorded that part of the audio track himself. Two-thirds of the scenes were filmed in Buffalo, New York, mostly at War Memorial Stadium, built in 1937 and demolished a few years after the film was produced. Buffalo's All-High Stadium, with post-production alterations, stood in for Chicago's Wrigley Field in a key scene in the film. Additional filming took place at the New York and Lake Erie Railroad depot in South Dayton, New York. Release =Reception= Variety called it an \\"impeccably made ... fable about success and failure in America.\\" James Berardinelli praised The Natural as \\"[a]rguably the best baseball movie ever made\\". ESPN's Page 2 selected it as the 6th best sports movie of all time. Sports writer Bill Simmons has argued, \\"Any 'Best Sports Movies' list that doesn't feature either Hoosiers or The Natural as the No. 1 pick shouldn't even count.\\" Director Barry Levinson said on MLB Network's \\"Costas at the Movies\\" in 2013 that while the film is based in fantasy, \\"through the years, these things which are outlandish actually [happen] ... like Kirk Gibson hitting the home run and limping around the bases ... Curt Schilling with the blood on the sock in the World Series.\\"Barry Levinson, Costas at the Movies, MLB Network, February 11, 2013 Leonard Maltin's 18th annual Movie Guide edition called it \\"too long and inconsistent.\\" Dan Craft, longtime critic for the Bloomington, Illinois paper, The Pantagraph,(May 19, 1984) wrote, \\"The storybook ending is so preposterous you don't know whether to cheer or jeer.\\" In Sports Illustrated, Frank Deford had faint praise for it: \\"The Natural almost manages to be a John Simon of National Review and Richard Schickel of Time were disappointed with the adaptation. Simon contrasted Malamud's story about the \\"failure of American innocence\\" with Levinson's \\"fable of success ... [and] the ultimate triumph of semi-doltish purity,\\" declaring \\"you have, not Malamud's novel, but a sorry illustration of its theme\\". Schickel lamented that \\"Malamud's intricate ending (it is a victory that looks like a defeat) is vulgarized (the victory is now an unambiguous triumph, fireworks included),\\" and that \\"watching this movie is all too often like reading about The Natural in the College Outline Roger Ebert called it \\"idolatry on behalf of Robert Redford.\\" Ebert's television collaborator Gene Siskel praised it, giving it four stars, also putting down other critics that he suggested might have just recently read the novel for the In a lengthy article on baseball movies in The New Yorker, Roger Angell pointed out that Malamud had intentionally treated Hobbs' story as a baseball version of the King Arthur legend, which came across in the film as a bit heavy-handed, \\"portentous and stuffy,\\" and that the book's ending should have been kept. He also cited a number of excellent visuals and funny bits, and noted that Robert Redford had prepared so carefully for the role, modeling his swing on that of Ted Williams, that \\"you want to sign At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, retrospectively compiled reviews from 43 critics give the film a score of 81%, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \\"Though heavy with sentiment, The Natural is an irresistible classic, and a sincere testament to America's =Awards and honors= The Natural was nominated for four Academy Awards: Actress in a Supporting Role (Glenn Close), Cinematography (Caleb Deschanel), Art Direction (Mel Bourne, Angelo P. Graham, Bruce Weintraub), and Music (Randy Newman). Kim Basinger was also nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Home video The initial DVD edition, with copyright year on the box reading \\"2001\\", contained the theatrical version of the film, along with a few specials and commentaries. The \\"director's cut\\" was released on April 3, 2007. A two-disc edition, it contains the featurette \\"The Heart of the Natural,\\" a 44-minute documentary featuring comments from Cal Ripken, Jr. and Levinson; it is the only extra released originally with the 2001 DVD. Sony added a number of other extras, however, including: \\"When Lightning Strikes: Creating The Natural,\\" a 50-minute documentary discussing the origins of the original novel and the production of the film; \\"Knights in Shining Armor,\\" which addresses the mythological parallels between The Natural, King Arthur and the Odyssey; and \\"A Natural Gunned Down\\" which tells the story of Eddie Waitkus, a baseball player who was shot by Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a female stalker, in an incident which inspired the fictionalized shooting of Roy Hobbs. The film itself has been re-edited, restoring deleted footage to the early chapters of the story. These scenes expand on the sadness of Hobbs, focusing on his visits to his childhood home as an adult and his childhood memories. The \\"gift set\\" version of the release also included some souvenirs: a baseball \\"signed\\" by Roy Hobbs; some baseball cards of Roy Hobbs and teammates; and a New York Knights cap. Soundtrack The film score of The Natural was composed and conducted by Randy Newman. The score has often been compared to the style of Aaron Copland and sometimes Elmer Bernstein. Scott Montgomery, writing for Goldmine music magazine, referenced the influence, and David Ansen, reviewing the film for Newsweek, called the score \\"Coplandesque.\\" The score also has certain Wagnerian features of orchestration and use of Leitmotif. Adnan Tezer of Monsters and Critics noted the theme is often played for film and television previews and in \\"baseball stadiums when introducing home teams and players.\\" Levinson also described to Bob Costas in MLB Network's \\"Costas at the Movies\\" how he heard Newman develop the movie's iconic theme: \\"We were racing to try to get this movie out in time and we were in one room and then there was a wall and Randy's in the other room. One of the great thrilling moments is I heard him figuring out that theme...You could hear it through the wall as he was working out that theme and I'll never forget that.\\" The soundtrack album was released May 11 on the Warner Bros. label, with the logo for Tri-Star Pictures also appearing on the label to commemorate this as their first production. The soundtrack is also the home run song for Major League Baseball‚Äôs Texas Rangers.  In popular culture  In Season 4, Episode 8 of Better Call Saul, Jimmy McGill refers to Kim Wexler's legal strategy as \\"watching Roy Hobbs smash out stadium light\\". In The Simpsons episode \\"Homer at the Bat\\", the origin story of Homer's \\"Wonder Bat\\" parodies this movie. In the Season 4 Episode 6 of Archer titled \\"Once Bitten\\", Archer's venom-inspired dream sequence is a parody of this film with Archer in the role of Hobbs, and substituting lacrosse for baseball.

This combination is commonly seen in patients who have sustained severe traumatic injuries and results in a significant rise in the mortality rate. Commonly, when someone presents with these signs, damage control surgery is employed to reverse the effects. The three conditions share a complex relationship; each factor can compound the others, resulting in high mortality if this positive feedback loop continues uninterrupted. Severe bleeding in trauma diminishes oxygen delivery, and may lead to hypothermia. This in turn can halt the coagulation cascade, preventing blood from clotting. In the absence of blood-bound oxygen and nutrients (hypoperfusion), the body's cells burn glucose anaerobically for energy, causing the release of lactic acid, ketone bodies, and other acidic compounds into the blood stream, which lower the blood's pH, leading to metabolic acidosis. Such an increase in acidity damages the tissues and organs of the body and can reduce myocardial performance, further reducing the oxygen delivery.

The manuscript contains one further medical text, called Leechbook III, which is also included herein. Structure and content Both of the books of Bald's Leechbook are organised in a head-to-foot order, but the first book deals with external maladies and the second with internal disorders. Cameron notes, \\"this separation of external and internal diseases may be unique in medieval medical texts\\".Cameron, M. L., Anglo-Saxon Medicine, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p 42. Cameron notes, \\"in Bald's Leechbook is the only plastic surgery mentioned in Anglo-Saxon records\\".Cameron, M. L., Anglo-Saxon Medicine, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 169. The recipe in question prescribes surgery for a cleft lip and palate.Leechbook i, chapter 13 (Cockayne p. 56). Cameron also notes that of the Old English Medical compilations \\"Leechbook III reflects most closely the medical practice of the Anglo-Saxons while they were still relatively free of Mediterranean influences,\\" in contrast to Bald's Leechbook, which \\"shows a conscious effort to transfer to Anglo-Saxon practice what one physician considered most useful in native and Mediterranean medicine,\\" and the Lacnunga, which is \\"a sort of commonplace book with no other apparent aim than to record whatever items of medical interest came to the scribe's attention\\".Cameron, M. L., Anglo-Saxon Medicine, Cambridge Studies in Anglo- Saxon England 7, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 35. Rev. Oswald Cockayne, editor and translator of an 1865 edition of the Leechbook, made note in his introduction of what he termed 'a Norse element' in the text, and gave, as example, words such as torbegate, rudniolin, ons worm, and Fornets palm. Cures One cure for headache was to bind a stalk of crosswort to the head with a red kerchief. Chilblains were treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root. Agrimony was cited as a cure for male impotence - when boiled in milk, it could excite a man who was \\"insufficiently virile\\"; when boiled in Welsh beer, it would have the opposite effect. The remedy for shingles comprised a potion using the bark of 15 trees: aspen, apple, maple, elder, willow, sallow, myrtle, wych elm, oak, blackthorn, birch, olive, dogwood, ash, and quickbeam.Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium Little, Brown, 2000 A remedy for aching feet called for leaves of elder, waybroad and mugwort to be pounded together, applied to the feet, then the feet bound. In another, after offering a ritualistic cure for a horse in pain requiring the words \\"Bless all the works of the Lord of lords\\" to be inscribed on the handle of a dagger, the author adds that the pain may have been caused by an elf. In March 2015, the Leechbook made the news when one of its recipes, Bald's eyesalve - which includes garlic, leeks, wine, and the bile from a cow's stomach left in a brass bowl for nine days - was tested as a potential antibiotic treatment against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

He is best remembered for developing the Shoney's restaurant chain in the southeastern United States, most of which were originally franchised Big Boy locations.  Childhood and college football career  Schoenbaum grew up in West Virginia where as a boy he worked in his father's bowling establishments in Charleston and Huntington. He played tackle at Ohio State University from 1936 to 1938. He received an honorable mention as AP All-Western Conference in 1936 and as Grantland Rice All-America honorable mention and AP All-Western Conference second team in 1937 and 1938. He was a 7th round selection (55th overall pick) of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1939 NFL Draft.  Hospitality industry  Following his sporting career, Schoenbaum went on to found the Shoney's restaurant chain, a regional organization which is one of the largest businesses to have originated in West Virginia and was at one time one of the largest family owned restaurant chains in the United States. In 1947 Schoenbaum opened his first drive-in restaurant, Parkette, in Charleston. In 1952, Schoenbaum obtained the regional marketing rights to the Big Boy trademark, two years later Parkette being renamed Shoney's. Besides being an operator, Schoenbaum also aggressively subfranchised to others, many as Shoney's and some in the 1950s using their own name. In this list, the Rochester franchise is Becker's, the Wheeling franchise is Elby's, the Philadelphia franchise is Tune's and the Chattanooga franchise is Shap's. In 1971, Nashville‚Äìbased Shoney's operator Raymond L. Danner acquired Shoenbaum's company to form Shoney's Big Boy Enterprises, Inc., a publicly held company. With Danner as president and CEO, Schoenbaum became chairman of the board of directors. When Shoney's original franchise agreement with Big Boy expired in 1976, Big Boy Enterprises was dropped from the name. In 1982, Shoney's opened two non‚ÄìBig Boy restaurants (called Shoney's Towne and Country) in Tallahassee, Florida, Big Boy territory assigned to Frisch's Restaurants, causing Frisch's to sue for unfair competition. In 1984, Shoney's‚Äìnow the largest regional franchisee‚Äìleft the Big Boy system removing over a third of the American units. Shoney's prevailed in the Frisch's lawsuit, the final appeal adjudicated after separation from Big Boy. With Schoenbaum as chairman, the Shoney's organization also developed and operated the Captain D's fast food seafood chain, Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken fast-food chain, now part of Mrs. Winner's and three casual dining chains, The Sailmaker, Pargo's, and the Fifth Quarter Steakhouses. In 1976, the company started a lodging chain, with properties branded as \\"Shoney's Inn\\" motels. By the 1990s, the company operated over 1,000 restaurants.  Legacy  Alex Schoenbaum died on December 6, 1996, almost 50 years after he began what became his hospitality empire. He was survived by wife Betty, (who became active in civic matters and philanthropy in West Virginia, and her winter hometown of Sarasota, Florida) and their two daughters and two sons together. Betty died on July 31, 2018, at the age of 100. In Charleston, West Virginia, where the business began, the Schoenbaum Family Enrichment Center and the Schoenbaum Soccer Stadium were family contributions to the community. In addition, at the Max M. Fisher College of Business in Columbus, the undergraduate business program is housed in Schoenbaum Hall named in his memory. In 2018 the Alex Schoenbaum scholarship and the Alex Schoenbaum Jewish Scholarship Fund was established through the Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans and Alex's daughter Emily to bolster African American Jewish relations in New Orleans.https://crescentcitysports.com/alex-schoenbaum-scholarship- fund-to-make-first-presentations-next-month/  References   External links  * Video: Alex Schoenbaum at Shoney's No. 1 Parkette in Charleston, 1971 at West Virginia State Archives, wmv format, 0:45 minutes.

His religious beliefs led him to participate in civil disobedience actions at peace demonstrations and acts of religious witness over forty years. In the name of peace, Vitale has been arrested more than 400 times. Vitale stated that St. Francis, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., provide him with inspiration.  Early life and education  Louis Vitale was born on June 1, 1932, in San Gabriel, California. After graduating in 1954 from Loyola University, now Loyola Marymount University, Vitale enlisted in the US Air Force. Vitale's main role in the Air Force was that of an intercept officer, in charge of radio communications. Vitale took his vows as a Franciscan friar in 1960 when he was 28 years old. He was awarded a PhD for original research in sociology, September 1972, from University of California, Los Angeles. From 1979 to 1988, Vitale served as the provincial superior of the Franciscan Friars of the Province of St. Barbara. He served as the pastor at St. Boniface Catholic Church for twelve years in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, California.  Pace e Bene  Louis Vitale was one of the founders of Pace e Bene, a nonviolence service, in 1989. The name means Peace and all good. Other founders included: Sr. Rosemary Lynch, Alain Richard, Peter Ediger and Julia Occhiogrosso, who were all experienced peace activists. Pace e bene developed educational programs for nonviolent living with an emphasis on spirituality. In 2005 Pace e Bene published a book Engage, which described Pace e Bene's programs. The programs, as described in the book, were designed to encourage: the discovery, internalization and use of the power of nonviolence for personal and social change. Hundreds of nonviolence study groups wee organized by Pace e Bene between 1989 and 2010.  Nevada Desert Experience  In 1981 Vitale received a letter from Rome asking Franciscans to do something creative in 1982 to honor the 800th anniversary of the birth of St. Francis. Vitale took this to heart. The First Nevada Lenten Experience was held at the Nevada test site, a series of witness and protest actions held at the atomic bomb test site near Las Vegas, Nevada. This was the precursor to the Nevada Desert Experience. Louis Vitale with Anne Bucher, Michael Affleck, Duncan MacMurdy, and two Franciscan friars, Ed Dunn and Terry Symens, founded the Nevada Desert Experience in 1984. Over the years Corbin Harvey and the Shundahai Network worked with NDE holding many protests of the government's continued nuclear weapons work. NDE worked with Corbin Harvey in protests against establishing a repository for radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, 100 mi (160 km) from Las Vegas.

She then died during the descent. Early life, education and career Francys Yarbro Distefano-Arsentiev was born Francys Yarbro, on January 18, 1958, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to John Yarbro and his wife Marina Garrett. At age six, her father took her to the Colorado mountains. Growing up, she attended The American School in Switzerland and schools in the United States. Arsentiev attended Stephens College before ultimately graduating from the University of Louisville. She then received a Master's degree from the International School of Business Management in Phoenix. Arsentiev worked as an accountant in Telluride, Colorado during the 1980s. Climbing In 1992, Yarbro married Sergei Arsentiev. Together, they climbed many Russian Peaks, including the first ascent of Peak 5800m, which they named Peak Goodwill, as well as Denali via the West Buttress. Arsentiev became the first U.S. woman to ski down Elbrus, and she summitted its east and west peaks. By this time, she had developed an interest in becoming the first U.S. woman to summit Everest without the use of supplemental oxygen. Everest =Initial attempts= In May 1998, Francys and Sergei Arsentiev arrived at base camp, Mount Everest. On May 17, they ascended from Advance Base Camp to the North Col, and the following day they reached 7700m (25,262 ft) as 21 other climbers reached the summit of Everest from the North. On May 19, they climbed to 8,200 meters (Camp 6). Sergei reported by radio that they were in good shape and were going to start their summit attempt on May 20 at 1:00am. On May 20, after spending the night at Camp 6, they started their summit attempt but turned around at the First Step when their headlamps failed. On May 21, they again stayed at Camp 6, after ascending only 50‚Äì100 meters before turning around. =Summit and aftermath= After these two aborted attempts on the summit, they began their final ascent on May 22. Due to the absence of oxygen supplementation at such high altitude, the two moved slowly and summitted dangerously late in the day. As a result, they were forced to spend yet another night above 8000 meters. During the course of the evening, the two became separated. Sergei made his way down to camp the following morning, only to find that his wife had not yet arrived. Realizing she had to be somewhere dangerously high upon the mountain, he set off to find her, carrying oxygen and medicine. Details of what happened next are uncertain, but the most plausible accounts suggest that on the morning of May 23, Francys Arsentiev was encountered by an Uzbek team who were climbing the final few hundred meters to the summit. She appeared to be half-conscious, affected by oxygen deprivation and frostbite. As she was unable to move on her own, they attended to her with oxygen and carried her down as far as they could, until, depleted of their own oxygen, they became too fatigued to continue the effort. Francys was still alive. As the Uzbek climbers made their way down to camp that evening, they encountered Sergei Arsentiev on his way back up to her. This is the last time he was seen alive. =Death= On the morning of May 24, Briton Ian Woodall, South African Cathy O'Dowd, and several more Uzbeks encountered Francys Arsentiev while on their way to the summit. She was found where she had been left the evening before. Sergei Arsentiev's ice axe and rope were identified nearby, but he was nowhere to be found. Both Woodall and O'Dowd called off their own summit attempts and tried to help Francys for more than an hour, but because of her poor condition, the perilous location, and freezing weather, they were forced to abandon her and descend to camp. She died as they found her, lying on her side, still clipped onto the guide rope. She was aged 40, with one son. Her corpse had the nickname \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". The mysterious disappearance of her husband was solved the following year when Jake Norton, a member of the 1999 \\"Mallory and Irvine\\" expedition, discovered Sergei's body lower on the mountain face, apparently dead from a fall while attempting to rescue his wife. =\\"The Tao of Everest\\"= Woodall initiated and led an expedition in 2007, \\"The Tao of Everest\\", with the purpose of returning to the mountain to bury the bodies of Francys Arsentiev and an unidentified climber (\\"Green Boots\\"), both of whom were plainly visible from the nearby climbing route. Francys Arsentiev's body was visible to climbers for nine years, from her death, May 24, 1998, to May 23, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Woodall was able to locate Arsentiev's body, and after a brief ritual, dropped her to a lower location on the face, removing the body from view. \\"Green Boots\\" was not seen between 2014 and 2017, and was presumed to have been removed or buried. A body was discovered hanging alongside a tent and other debris on the side of a cliff-face in 2017, which some have speculated to be the transported body of \\"Green Boots\\".

Biography Bartlett studied metallurgy and worked in that field for several years. At age 23, he enrolled in the Royal Academy in London, where he studied painting and etching. After three years of study in London, he entered the private studio school Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, where he studied under Jules Joseph Lefebvre (1836‚Äì1911) and Gustave Boulanger (1824‚Äì1888).Miles, Richard, 2001, p. 14 In 1889, he returned to England and married Emily Tate, but shortly thereafter, his wife and infant son died in childbirth. Bartlett then traveled to Europe, spending several productive years in the Netherlands, Brittany and Venice with his friend and fellow artist Frank Brangwyn (1867‚Äì1956). Brangwyn is believed to have introduced Bartlett to Japanese prints.Miles, Richard, 2001, p. 37 Bartlett produced some of his most important early works on the Continent, especially studies of peasants painted in broad areas of colour. He was invited to join the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in France in 1897. In 1898, he returned to England and married Catherine \\"Kate\\" Main. Bartlett returned to the Continent with his second wife, and in 1908, he helped found the Soci√©t√© de la Peinture a l'Eau in Paris. Several Continental museums acquired his paintings at the Paris exhibitions of the Soci√©t√© de la Peinture a l'Eau.Miles, Richard, 2001, p. 40 Bartlett made several trips to Brittany and the Netherlands with the Dutch painter Nico Wilhelm Jungmann (1872‚Äì1935), which provided the former with material for future paintings of peasants, whose dignity derived from the simple placement of shapes. In 1913, with financial backing from his wife's well-to-do family, the Bartletts traveled to India, Ceylon, Indonesia, China, and Japan. He arrived in Japan in 1915, where he met woodblock print publisher Watanabe Sh≈çzabur≈ç (1885‚Äì1962), who was a major force in early 20th-century Japanese art (shin-hanga). In 1916 Watanabe published 21 woodblocks from Bartlett's designs, including six prints of Japanese landscapes. In 1917, Bartlett and his second wife left Japan for England; however, they stopped off in Hawaii, where they remained‚Äînever returning to England. He did visit Japan in 1919, where he created sixteen shin-hanga prints for Watanabe. Anna Rice Cooke (1853‚Äì1934), who founded the Honolulu Museum of Art, became Bartlett's advocate and patron.Miles, Richard, 2001, p. 19 In 1928, Bartlett helped to found the Honolulu Printmakers along with local artists Alexander Samuel MacLeod, John Melville Kelly, and Huc-Mazelet Luquiens.Miles, Richard, 2001, p. 22 Charles Bartlett died in Hawaii at the age of 79 on 16 April 1940.

Delano Ellis, (December 11, 1944 ‚Äì September 19, 2020) was a leader in African American Pentecostalism in the United States and founding president/chairman and Archbishop Metropolitan of the Joint College of Bishops. Ellis also established and was presiding prelate of the Apostolic/Oneness United Pentecostal Churches of Christ (today the United Covenant Churches of Christ) and Pentecostal Churches of Christ. He was the senior pastor of the Pentecostal Church of Christ in Cleveland, Ohio, a ministry to which he was called on May 14, 1989. Ellis is widely known as a progenitor of unity among African American Pentecostals. He worked to introduce order and identity among Pentecostal churches.Banks, Adelle (1995) \\"Pentecostals dress like Catholic bishops\\", National Catholic Reporter, 31 (17)(1995) \\"Blacks Discover High Church\\", Christianity Today, 39 (5) As a promoter of ecumenism, Ellis had put the Pentecostal movement as it is manifested among African Americans in conversation with the broader Christian community around the world.(2000) \\"Signs of the Times\\", America, 182 (6) Through Ellis, many Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostal denominations claim to derive \\"western and eastern streams of apostolic succession\\" as described in his book, The Bishopric ‚Äì A Handbook on Creating Episcopacy in the African- American Pentecostal Church. The Apostolic Pastoral Congress, a British organization, claims to derive a line of succession from Ellis through Archbishop Doye Agama. J. Delano Ellis is the son of Lucy and Jesse Delano Ellis Sr. At age 13 or 14, Lucy became pregnant with Jesse Delano Ellis II. His mother, Lucy Ellis, was a Christian and his father rejected Christianity for Moorish Science and then the Nation of Islam. During Ellis's childhood, his mother was placed in a mental health institution; he then lived with his grandmother and great aunt. During his teen years, Ellis attempted to establish a relationship with his father by attending a Nation of Islam mosque. His father told them Jesus was the \\"white man's god and Christianity was a trick designed to enslave black people\\". Ellis began attending the Christian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ under the pastorate of Bishop R.T. Jones, Sr. One night at the church, Ellis professed Christianity and his father physically abused him for rejecting Islam.  Career  Ellis joined the United States Air Force in his early adulthood and attended the Church of the Nazarene. Due to racial segregation, he then joined the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and developed an appreciation of high church liturgy and ecclesiology. He soon returned to the Church of God in Christ. J. Delano Ellis was ordained by Bishop Ozro Thurston Jones, Sr. in 1963 within the Church of God in Christ and elevated to the episcopacy in 1970 by Bishop Brumfield Johnson of the United Holy Church of America. In the Church of God in Christ, Ellis organized the Adjutant's Corp. He served as the third Chief Adjutant of the National Adjutancy of the Church of God in Christ. In 1989, Ellis was asked to lead a Oneness Pentecostal congregation outside of the Church of God in Christ. He determined Oneness Pentecostalism and Trinitarianism weren't entirely different conceptions, yet rejected distinctions between the persons of the Trinity. He came to believe there was no scriptural support for the doctrine of Trinitarian Christianity. Ellis soon after founded the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ (now the United Covenant Churches of Christ). During his tenure as presiding prelate of the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ he co-founded the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops. The Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops (JCAAPB), more commonly the Joint College of Bishops (JCOB), is an ecumenical synod established by J. Delano Ellis, Wilbert Sterling McKinley, Roy Edward Brown, and Paul S. Morton in November 1993. The Joint College of Bishops originally functioned as a High Church Pentecostal body, later expanding into other Protestant traditions and the Convergence Movement. Unique among adherents of paleo-orthodoxy, members of the Joint College of Bishops are noted for redefining the history and original meaning of Western Christian vestments in contrast with historical documents (e.g., Roman Catholic and Anglican vestments granted new definitions).Bishop Joseph P. Bowens, \\"The Meaning of the Priestly Garments\\" The Joint College of Bishops also teaches a five-fold ministry. J. Delano Ellis and the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops denounced Carlton Pearson as a heretic for teaching Christian universalism. Under Ellis's administration, the Joint College of Bishops also admitted and certified gay bishop O.C. Allen of the Vision Church of Atlanta in 2012. In 1995, Ellis was fired as a city police chaplain for his comments toward Muslims, stating Islam was \\"bloody and dangerous\\" at worst; in 2001, Ellis resigned from a local faith committee over antisemitic controversy. As late as the 21st century, Ellis served as a member of Eureka Lodge #52 of the Prince Hall Freemasons. He was a grand prior and 33rd degree mason. After 30 years of leadership at the Pentecostal Church of Christ in Cleveland, J. Delano Ellis abdicated his pastorate in 2019; his wife, Dr. Sabrina Ellis, was appointed the new senior pastor. On September 19, 2020, Ellis was pronounced deceased in a public statement by his wife. His death almost immediately follows a street being named in his honor. The Potter's House Church founder Thomas Dexter Jakes preached at Ellis's funeral. Apostolic succession In an appendix to his book The Bishopric ‚Äì A Handbook on Creating Episcopacy in the African-American Pentecostal Church, Ellis claimed both western and eastern streams of \\"apostolic succession\\" for himself and for United Pentecostal Churches of Christ. He claims \\"western streams of succession\\" via the Church of England, John Wesley, Thomas Coke, Francis Asbury, the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Church of God in Christ. The claimed succession from the Methodist Episcopal Church is stated as being via three Church of God in Christ bishops (David Charles Williams, Carl Edward Williams and Reuben Timothy Jones), all of whom held \\"Holy Orders\\" from the Methodist Episcopal Church. In his book, he made no claim or comment at all as to whether the line of succession via Wesley, Coke, Asbury and the Methodist Episcopal Church carries unbroken apostolic succession as distinct from presbyteral succession only. He also didn't indicate that Williams, Williams and Jones possessed episcopal consecration from the Methodist Episcopal Church, nor does he cite any episcopal apostolic lineage for their status as bishops of the Church of God in Christ. The question as to whether there can be apostolic succession via Wesley is a moot point. Wesley was a Church of England clergyman but he was not a Church of England bishop. Some believe that Wesley was secretly consecrated bishop by Greek Orthodox bishop Erasmus of Arcadia in 1763. Ellis also noted that in 1964 he had been ordained presbyter by Bishop Ozro Thurston Jones of the Church of God in Christ, and he notes his episcopal consecration in 1970 by Bishop Brumfield Johnson of the Mount Calvary Holy Church of America. His book cites no episcopal apostolic lineage for this 1970 consecration. \\"Eastern streams of succession\\" are traced from the Syro-Chaldean Church in the East, via Archbishop Bertram S. Schlossberg (Mar Uzziah), Archbishop-Metropolitan of the Syro-Chaldean Church of North America, now known as the Evangelical Apostolic Church of North America. In 1995, Ellis stated, the Evangelical Apostolic Church of North America entered into collegial fellowship with the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ. At a holy convocation of the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ, Bishop Robert Woodward Burgess II (representing Archbishop Schlossberg, who was living in Jerusalem) assisted at the consecration of a number of additional bishops. Archbishop Schlossberg and Bishop Burgess claim to possess lineages from bishops Prazsky (Slavonic Orthodox lineage) and Gaines (Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox lineage). They also claim this succession converges in Schlossberg and Burgess, as well as numerous lineages deriving via Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius). In his book, Ellis mentions the Slavonic and Russian/Ukrainian lineages via Prazsky and Gaines, but the only one of Newman's many lineages that he cites is the Syro-Chaldean.

It was discovered nearly intact, while its twin had broken into pieces in antiquity. Both were soon afterwards obtained by William John Bankes, an acquisition which included an important bilingual inscription. He noted two inscriptions on it, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the other in ancient Greek.The Greek inscription has been referred to by scholars as \\"OGI 137‚Äì139; SB 8396; Lenger, C. Ord. Ptol., 51 f.; A. Bern., 19\\". According to C.W. Ceram, \\"This obelisk...was in effect a second Rosetta Stone. The names of Ptolemy and Cleopatra were framed in a cartouche, and when Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion placed them one above the other, he noticed equivalent signs, \\"which put Champollion on the road leading to the decipherment of the hieroglyphics. The inscriptions record a petition by the Egyptian priests at Philae and the favourable response by Ptolemy VIII Euergetes and queens Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III. The obelisk has been dated to approximately 118 or 117 BC. During the 1820s, Bankes acquired the obelisk and a single, large broken piece of its twin found at Philae and had them transported to his estate at Kingston Lacy in Dorset, England. The operation was carried out by the adventurer Giovanni Belzoni. The obelisk was set up as a central feature of the gardens; nearby the broken piece of the twin was set into the lawn as a romantic ruin. The house and estate were bequeathed to the National Trust and the obelisk is located in the gardens. The obelisk is a Grade II* listed building. In October and November 2014, Ben Altshuler of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, in association with Alan Bowman and Charles Crowther of Oxford's Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents (CSAD), made RTI scans of the obelisk. They observed significant, previously illegible Egyptian and Greek inscriptions. The obelisk, in keeping with its bilingual nature and the \\"translation\\" metaphor of the Rosetta space mission, gives its name to the mission Philae robotic lander, which arrived at the comet 67P/Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko on 6 August 2014 and landed on 12 November 2014.

Nora May French (1881 ‚Äì November 13, 1907) was an American poet and member of the bohemian literary circles of the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club which flourished after the Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906. French was born in 1881 in Aurora, New York to Edward French, a professor at Wells College and Mary Wells French, the sister of the founder of Wells Fargo Henry Wells. When she was seven years old, her wealthy family moved to a ranch outside of Los Angeles, but within a few years they lost that property as a result of a devastating house fire and a failed fruit crop. Her writing career began in her teens, when she was published in local newspapers and magazines. In her early twenties she became engaged, off and on again, to Alan Hiley, a prosperous timber farmer. Her ambivalence about conventional marriage poured into The Spanish Girl, her best known lyrics, a twenty-two poem chronicle of doomed love. After their final break-up, French joined the Charles Lummis Arroyo Seco, a group of Los Angeles writers and poets who encouraged her to publish in Lummis' Out West magazine. Although her work won praise, notably from the feminist and environmentalist poet Mary Austin, recognition did not translate to financial security. French became involved with Henry Anderson Lafler, an assistant editor on The Argonaut, and moved to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. She quickly made her place within bohemian intellectual circles and endured several unhappy affairs. In 1907 she joined George Sterling and his wife at their home in Carmel, but was unable to overcome her problems. French grew more depressed and on Monday November 11, tried to kill herself unsuccessfully with a gunshot to the head. The bullet took off a lock of her hair, but Nora missed her mark due to her shaky hand. Two days later, during the night of November 13‚Äì14, Nora ended her life in Sterling's home (he was absent in San Francisco\\"Poet Kills Himself\\", Washington Post, 15 Nov 1907, p. 3.) by ingesting cyanide while Mrs. Sterling slept beside her.\\"Girl Writer Tires of Life\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, Nov 16th, 1907, pg 1. Nora was twenty-six years old. Newspapers in the San Francisco Bay Area sensationalized the tragedy with glaring headlines and reports of Bohemian dissipations as well as recent and frequent visits by prominent married men, including the artists Charles Dickman, Xavier Martinez, and Charles Rollo Peters. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). Three of her friends posthumously published French‚Äôs Poems in 1910, the only compilation of her work ever widely distributed until the recent (2009) release of Hippocampus Press's The Outer Gate: The Collected Poems Of Nora May French. Although many of her poems celebrate the serenity of coastal landscape, others are less sanguine: they offer glimpses into the mind of a young woman torn between pressure to submit to social roles and longing to live creatively.Williams, Michael. \\"A Book of Beauty.\\" The New Age: A Weekly Review Of Politics, Literature And Art.

It consists of group initiative games, trust events, and high and low ropes course. Some activities involve a group challenge, while others develop individual skills and agility. Participants climb, swing, balance, jump, rappel, and devise solutions to a variety of problems. History In 1920, Kurt Hahn established the Salem School, based on principles personal responsibility, kindness, and justice towards developing the fitness and confidence of participants. After being imprisoned in Germany then exiled to Great Britain in 1933, in 1941 Hahn established the Outward Bound program to train people for life by using the challenges of the sea and mountains. The program includes rescue technique and service to people with the motto being, \\"Training through the body, not of the body.\\" In 1970, Project Adventure began as a curriculum program in Massachusetts, since becoming a clearinghouse for adventure-based programs. In 1975, Scouts from the Pony Express Council experienced NORJAM, the Ropes Course at the 14th World Scout Jamboree in Norway, including Scout executive Parvin Bishop. In 1981, the Pony Express Council built the BSA's first COPE course at the council's Camp Geiger near St. Joseph, Missouri. When Bishop became Director of Program at the BSA National Office, he took the program national and in 1983, the BSA National Council made Project COPE part of the BSA camping program and began offering training through the National Camping School. In 1980 a team of staff and volunteers in Pony Express Council developed a Rope Course and Orienteering program under then Scout Executive Parvin Bishop as part of the council's long range planning. Bishop named the new program Project COPE. The following professionals worked with Bishop on building and marketing the Project COPE program in its first few years: Al Vasey, Rich Cole, Curt Palmer, Bill Pennistion and Warren Wenner. The first two years of the Pony Express Council's Project COPE program had two days of ropes course programs and low course events and one day of Orienteering programs. After two years the Project COPE program cut the day of orienteering program. Warren Wenner then a staff member served as the 1st Project COPE Director for the Council's Project program from 1980 to 1983 and also served as the 1st Course Director for National Camp School Camp Project COPE section held at Camp Jayhawk in Kansas. Wenner moved to Heart of America Council and was also the 1st Project COPE director for the Council at Camp Naish in 1984. Bill Penniston another staff member wrote the 1st Program COPE handbook that was edited by both Penniston and Wenner. Both helped national write the 1st national camping standards and national guide book as Project COPE became a national program. Council Staff member Rich Cole served as the Summer Camp COPE in 1980 which was the 1st summer that Project COPE was a program at Camp Gieger. Wenner worked with Rich that first summer serving as Camp Gieger Camp Director. Curt Palmer Council staff member worked across the central region working with councils on building Project COPE courses.

She worked in the fields of painting, miniatures, textile arts, and costume and set design. She worked with Martha Graham and Alice D. Laughlin to create the first woman-produced Broadway theatre production. Early life Natalie Hays Hammond was born in Lakewood, New Jersey in 1904. Her parents were millionaires. Her father was John Hays Hammond and her mother was Natalie Harris. John Hays Hammond, Jr., her brother, was the eventual founder of Hammond Castle. As a 10-year-old child, she inspired her mother to start the War Children's Christmas Fund in support of European orphans in World War I. Hammond chose to work and stay active, instead of becoming a socialite, like some other rich young people. Mid-life and career Hammond was a costume and set designer. At the age of 22, she won a competition held at the American Laboratory Theatre to design the sets and costumes for a play starring Alla Nazimova. Hammond was an art collector. She collected works by Carl Van Vechten. She also collected hand fans. In 1926, Cecil Thomas created a bust of Hammond, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts the same year. Hammond was friends with Martha Graham and met photographer Soichi Sunami through Graham. Sunami would photograph Hammond during their friendship. In 1931, Hammond invented and patented a form of appliqu√© which allowed metal to be applied to fabrics. By 1940 she was living in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her Gloucester home was designed by Eleanor Raymond. The home consisted of four buildings: one for Hammond, two for her friends, and one for servants and dining. Hammond set up a program, called Civic Patrol, to teach young girls emergency communication and transportation skills. The mission was to train the girls in case they had to serve in World War II. During her lifetime, she was engaged seven times. She never married. She designed her own needlepoint patterns, and published a book about her work in 1949. Later life and legacy Hammond with her father, John Hays Hammond, Sr. Hammond moved to North Salem, New York. Her home and Japanese garden became the Hammond Museum and Japanese Stroll Garden. In 1979, she was awarded the Medallion Award of the Westchester Community College Foundation for founding the Hammond Museum and her art.

It was the successor to the previous YZ426F which was discontinued in 2003. It is credited by Cycle World and Dirt Rider magazines as the bike that started the four-stroke dirt bike revolution. The 2006 YZ250F and YZ450F were the first production motorcycles equipped with titanium suspension springs. The WR450F is the enduro version of the YZ450F. Introduction For many years, the motocross world almost exclusively used two-stroke engines. AMA racing classes had two classes: 125 cc and 250 cc two- strokes, with no provision for four strokes. Most riders considered four- stroke engine technology to be largely utilitarian and uncompetitive, relegated solely for trail riding. In 1996, the AMA changed racing rules to allow 450 cc four strokes to compete in the same racing class as 250 cc two- strokes. Yamaha engineer Yoshiharu Nakayama first came up with the idea of creating the first competitive four-stroke race motocross bike. The Yamaha YZ400F was developed to fit into this category. It solved the power dilemma by borrowing superbike technology and giving the YZ a five-valve head, liquid cooling and a 12.5-1 compression ratio. In 1997, Yamaha rocked the motocross world with the introduction of the YZ400M prototype, a concept motorcycle which borrowed much technology from road racing. The YZM was far ahead of all competition among four-stroke motocross bikes. Doug Henry piloted the YZ400M to its first victory in 1997 at the Las Vegas Supercross. This was the first time any four-stroke had won an AMA event.Motorcycle Hall of Fame: Doug Henry The YZ400M was the predecessor of the production YZ400F, which was released the next year. First generation: YZ400F 1998‚Äì2000 Yamaha introduced the YZ400F in production in 1998 after a successful AMA season in 1997. It was \\"the first modern production four-stroke motocrosser that was directly competitive against two-strokes.\\" Initially, Yamaha targeted a dry weight of 233 pounds (106 kg) (on par with the 250 two-strokes of the time), but by production, the bike weighed 250 pounds. The bike had an 11,600 rpm redlineGT Thunder Test Bench power and torque close to its 250 cc two-stroke rivals. It benefited from engine compression braking, which allowed the engine to slow the bike down during deceleration, giving the brakes a rest. The 1998 YZ400F was the first bike to come stock with a Keihin FCR carburetor. In 1998, Doug Henry won the AMA National Motocross Championship aboard the YZF, becoming the first rider to win a championship on a four-stroke motorcycle. This victory is considered by some to be the major turning point in the motocross world‚Äîfor the first time, four strokes were considered a competitive racing machine. Second generation: YZ426F 2001‚Äì2002 In 2000, Yamaha updated the YZ400F, increasing the displacement to 426 cc for greater power and throttle response. In addition, the carburetor and jets were updated to ease the YZ400F's starting woes. The next year, in 2001, Yamaha replaced the previous steel valves with titanium ones. The new valves were more than forty percent lighter than the previous valves, allowing for lighter and softer valve springs, in turn allowing a quicker revving engine, improved throttle response, higher rev ceilings, and more power. The crankshaft was also reshaped and the whole assembly was redesigned for quicker throttle response and, Yamaha claimed, \\"less high-end horsepower loss.\\" In addition to motor modifications, a few changes were made to the transmission to help contain the power and ensure longevity. The suspension also received a bit of an overhaul with the goal being reduced weight and smoother action throughout the stroke. Yamaha also designed a new exhaust pipe design so that exhaust header removal would no longer be required when replacing the oil filter. Carburetor tuning was modified to deal with starting and off-idle take off difficulties. Also in 2001 the subframe was changed from a steel to a blue painted aluminum style. In 2002 the blue painting was stopped and left to a bare aluminum look. Motorcycle.com says that \\"The gas tank is reasonably thin and allows good forward and backward movement while providing something nicely shaped to hold onto with your knees. In fact, the entire ergonomic package on this YZF is well thought out. The handlebars have a nice bend to them and are well-placed for good rider control and legroom. The footpegs are well-made units with a wide platform and sit in a position that keeps them from dragging in ruts without cramping a rider's legs.\\" In 2002 Yamaha remapped the digital CD ignition system which delivers a more precise spark and optimal timing for faster, stronger response during hard acceleration, and less kickback during starting. Also an all-new swing-arm which is lighter and stronger for reduced weight, greater rigidity and more compliant rear suspension action. While an anodized finish gives the bike a tricked out look. The 426 also includes a larger pivot shift for increased durability. A larger rear brake disc was also added which means greater stopping power. Third generation YZ450F 2003‚Äì2005 For 2003, the YZF received the biggest update in its history. First, the engine displacement was increased with 449 cc in compliance to the new AMA Motocross maximum displacement rule, the engine now produced over . Next, the frame and plastic were updated for a new, sleeker look. Additionally, the YZF's weight was decreased from its original to . The bike made tremendous power; however, many thought that the bike had too much power for a motocross track. The 2005 YZ450F was the first YZ450F to feature KYB twin chamber cartridge forks. Fourth generation YZ450F 2006‚Äì2009 The YZ450F received a major update in 2006, with over 300 parts changed and improved. The power was smoothed out, and the bike was made easier to ride, putting to rest the complaint that the YZ had too much power. The transmission was returned to a more traditional five-speed. An all-new aluminum single backbone frame shaved another 10 pounds off the weight. The 2006 saw KYB SSS forks. 2007 saw camshaft and exhaust changes, moving power from low-RPMs to mid-RPMs. 2008-2009 furthered pushed the powerband to mid-RPMs.  Fifth generation YZ450F 2010-2013  September 8, 2009, Yamaha introduced its all- new YZ450F with fuel injection. The engine cylinder is rearward slanted, the crank rod angle has been changed to provide a more complete combustion, the 5-valve head is now a 4-valve head, the gas tank is located under the seat, the exhaust pipe exits the rear of the cylinder, and the air intake is now in the front of the bike. They have a new bi-lateral frame which allows for new improved steering and the new engine components. The entire package comes together to create a bike that is mass-centralized. The bike was introduced by Yamaha Factory Motocross rider James Stewart.The top speed has been recorded at 80 mph stock.  Sixth generation YZ450F 2014-2017  The 2014 YZ450f was a new design the retained the backwards slant engine. The 2014 model has a wet- sump engine and an easy access air filter.  Seventh generation YZ450F 2018-Present  The 2018 YZ450f features electric start and a Mikuni fuel injection system. The kickstarter was removed for this generation.

History and mandate By authority of the Defense Production Act of 1950, President Harry S. Truman established the Office of Defense Mobilization (ODM) by Executive Order 10193, issued December 16, 1950. ODM's charge was to regulate the economy so that defense production needs could be met, even if this meant restricting the flow of goods and services to the civilian sector of the economy. The Defense Production Administration was established by Executive Order 10200 on January 3, 1951. Its mandate was to oversee the federal government's defense production program, which included materials production, manufacturing conversion, setting of production quotas, and establishing the mix of defense and civilian production. It was placed under the Office of Defense Mobilization, along with the Wage Stabilization Board, the Office of Price Administration, and other wartime agencies. The National Production Authority (NPA) was placed under the control of the Defense Production Administration. Although most of the NPA's functions were transferred to the Defense Production Administration, the agency re-delegated them back to NPA. Indeed, most of the agencies which fell under authority of the DPA remained, organizationally, within their respective cabinet departments.Pierpaoli, Truman and Korea: The Political Culture of the Early Cold War, 1999. The Defense Production Administration was abolished after the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 4, 1953 in Executive Order 10433.

He is well known as the $1 million winner on the reality television series Survivor: Fiji. Survivor Cole was originally recruited for The Amazing Race with his girlfriend; however, after she dropped out, he was transferred to Survivor three days before filming, having only seen a single episode of the show. Upon arriving in Fiji, he identified Yau-Man Chan as a person similar to himself with the best combination of intelligence and integrity and formed an alliance with Chan that lasted until the Final Four. Cole became the strategic leader of the core Ravu Alliance, where he targeted weak links Jessica deBen and Sylvia Kwan (he was not there for the Tribal Council where Erica Durousseau was voted out). His tribe was granted a reprieve, when the rival Moto tribe chose to go to Tribal Council. His alliance returned to Tribal Council in the next episode where Rita Verreos was voted off. In a tribal swap, he, Chan, and Michelle Yi were moved to Moto with Stacy Kimball, Kenward \\"Boo\\" Bernis, and Cassandra Franklin. He lost Yi at the merge, when she was at Tribal Council without her alliance. At the Final Nine, Cole was able to recruit the original Moto outsiders, Franklin and Andria \\"Dreamz\\" Herd, and New Moto outsiders, Kimball and Bernis. The Alliance of Six picked off the Horsemen: Edgardo Rivera, Mookie Lee, and finally Alex Angarita. A coup started by Herd to evict Chan failed, and Kimball was voted out (via Immunity Idol). Chan won Immunity on Day 37, and Bernis was voted off. Cole and Chan cooperated over the course of the game to discover two hidden immunity idols from information that they discovered on several independent visits to Exile Island. Cole visited Exile Island more than anyone that season (four times). When Herd reneged on a deal with Chan for immunity at the penultimate Tribal Council, Chan was eliminated; Cole allowed Chan to be voted out, recognizing that Chan would be very hard to beat at the Final Tribal Council. At the Final Tribal Council, Cole became the jury's unanimous vote to become the 14th Sole Survivor. He made it through the entire season having never won an individual immunity and having had only one Tribal Council vote cast against him. He became the first unanimous winner of Survivor, with a vote of 9‚Äì0‚Äì0. After Survivor: Fiji Cole has hosted or appeared on several talk shows, including CBS's The Early Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, BET's 106 & Park and MTV Fuse. He was also voted as one of People's Sexiest Bachelors in 2007, and also hosted shows on the TV Guide Channel, a Canadian reality show in 2009 and the Style Network in 2010 (where his luxurious, beach wedding, at the St. Regis Princeville, in Kauai, Hawaii, was featured on Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?). He has traveled to more than 40 countries and has been featured in various domestic and international magazines from Australia to South Africa. Cole has also been interviewed by the foreign press, appearing on television in Hong Kong, China, South Africa, Singapore, The Bahamas and Australia. Cole founded a creative management company that has booked various reality television participants and artists to participate in worldwide military tours with Armed Forces Entertainment (Asia, South Pacific, Europe and Diego Garcia). He has worked with celebrities from Survivor, The Amazing Race, American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance and Big Brother. Cole, who is also a musician/composer/songwriter, served as tour manager for a multi-city concert tour of Japan, in 2011, which featured a cast from various seasons of American Idol. He helped arrange a private show for the children of Misawa Air Base in Japan, the closest base to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster epicenter. Cole has an endowment with the University of Kansas Medical Center, where he established the Perthes Kids Foundation (Earl Cole Fund), a global charitable foundation for children with Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease, a rare hip bone disease Cole suffered from as a child. Cole serves as Executive Director. Cole was considered to return for Survivor: Micronesia, Heroes vs. Villains, Blood vs. Water, and Game Changers. He was also recently considered for Winners at War, but had to decline due to family matters.

It often deals with the development of caves through limestone, caused by the presence of water with carbon dioxide dissolved within it, producing carbonic acid which permits the dissociation of the calcium carbonate in the limestone.  Limestone  The majority of limestone caves are created by calcium carbonate dissolution by the solvent action of meteoric waters circulating through the rock. In the presence of carbon dioxide saturated water, calcium carbonate reacts to form the soluble calcium bicarbonate. CaCO3 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí Ca(HCO3)2 As meteoric waters precipitate they dissolve atmospheric carbon dioxide to form a dilute carbonic acid solution, which builds up in permeable fissures, bedding planes, joints, and faults within limestone rocks. The exposed limestone then reacts to become calcium bicarbonate which dissolves in the water and is removed from the fault as the solution flows away. Phreatic passages develop in conditions of complete water-fill meaning that ceilings and walls may be eroded as readily as floors. The form is generally that of an ellipse along the host fissure, whilst more circular forms generally indicate faster solvent flow and deep pockets are often indicative of slower flow. Vadose passages develop where the water has a free surface (i.e., in the vadose zone), and are varieties of entrenched, canyon-like channels as found with surface rivers. It is common to see a younger canyon entrenched in the floor of a phreatic passage, signifying a lowering of the water table.

The Battle of Yellow Bayou took place on May 18, 1864 in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana between Union and Confederate forces. After learning of Confederate forces in Yellow Bayou, Brig. Gen. Joseph A. Mower was ordered to halt their advance. Union forces subsequently attacked the Confederates and drove them back to their main line. The Confederates then counter-attacked, forcing the Union forces to retreat, until they eventually repulsed the Confederate attack. This ‚Äúsee-saw‚Äù action lasted a few hours, until the ground cover caught fire and both sides were forced to retreat. Background Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks during his retreat in the Red River Campaign, following the Battle of Mansfield and Battle of Pleasant Hill, reached the Atchafalaya River on May 17. Once on the other side of the river, he would be shielded from the continuous Confederate harassment. But, he had to wait to cross the river until the army engineers constructed a bridge. The battle On May 18, Banks learned that Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor‚Äôs force was near Yellow Bayou, so he ordered Brig. Gen. A.J. Smith to stop them. Since Smith could not comply himself, he ordered Brig. Gen. Joseph A. Mower to meet Taylor. The Yankees attacked and drove the Rebels to their main line. The Confederates counterattacked, forcing the Federals to give ground. The Union force finally repulsed the Confederates. This see-saw action continued for several hours until the ground cover caught fire forcing both sides to retire.

The company was founded in 1929, originally located in Baudette, Minnesota, and later included facilities in Marietta, Georgia, and Orlando, Florida. Rowell Laboratories, Inc. was incorporated again in 2008 in Florida and manufactures and sells the NatureCare brand of skin care products. Commercial fishing and blue foxes Joseph C.N. Rowell feeding foxes at the Northern Blue Fox Farm. In 1920, Joseph C.N. Rowell had settled with his family on the shores of Lake of the Woods in northern Minnesota to fish commercially. Joseph C.N. Rowell was the grandson of John Samuel Rowell (1825-1907), a noted Wisconsin farm implement inventor and industrialist. He had recently returned from France as a 1st Lieutenant in the US Army, being in charge of an aircraft maintenance facility during World War I. Joe had become knowledgeable about commercial fishing, canning, and wholesale distribution business from his experience in a previous venture, the Chetlo Harbor Packing Company, a commercial salmon fishing and canning operation Joe founded in 1912 located at Chetlo Harbor, Washington. Joe founded the Rowell Fishery on Lake of the Woods, and although the enterprise was a successful commercial fishing business, the nets were consistently filled with a rough fish called a burbot, the only fresh water relative of the salt water Cod fish. The burbot had no commercial value, and was an aggressive predator of young walleyes and northern pike. Net fishing on Lake of the Woods, cold difficult work. Joseph C.N. Rowell in front of nets drying at the Rowell Fishery. Joseph C.N. Rowell feeding foxes at the Northern Blue Fox Farm. Joe Rowell also founded another venture with a Doctor Osborne from International Falls, Minnesota, the Northern Blue Fox Farm, which commercially raised blue foxes for the fur industry, a very lucrative business at the time. Joe had been in the practice of feeding the foxes with the burbot that filled his nets, resulting in very healthy foxes. At annual fur buying time, the fur buyers who came around each year during fur buying season would comment on the superiority of the Rowell foxs' coats, stating that these were the finest pelts they had seen. On May 24, 1930, the Baudette Region reported that about 100 fox pups had been born in the past week with another 50 to 60 more expected. Several mother cats were rounded up to help nurse many of the pups whose mothers had no milk. One mother fox had given birth to 16 babies - thought to be a record. At this time, market price for blue fox furs was $290 per pelt. Theodore H. Rowell Sr. and Burbot Liver Oil Ted Rowell Sr. with a 15 lb. burbot, which will yield a 1 lb. liver. This led Joe and son Theodore H. Rowell to believe that the burbot was the reason for the rich pelts, and suspected that oil from the burbot contained something of great value to modern medicine. Ted had just finished pharmacy school at the University of Minnesota and opened a drug store in nearby Baudette. On Christmas Eve, 1929, a devastating fire destroyed the drug store. Immediate rebuilding was impossible, but the burbot transformed a disaster into an opportunity. After the fire, Ted Rowell devoted full-time for a year to researching the ugly eel- like fish. His studies ultimately demonstrated that burbot liver oil was exceptionally high in vitamin A and D ‚Äì 6 to 8 times more potent than Cod liver oil, which was in very wide use at the time. Ted's assays on the vitamin content were done for him by the Parke-Davis and Eli Lilly companies. Furthermore, Ted developed a method to extract pure oil from the burbot's liver, worked on dosage forms and dosage amounts, packaging, labeling, and finally marketing and distribution channels. Most of the marketing was done through correspondence and sending out samples. A very large early order was from the Pepsodent Company for 36 million bottles of Burbot Liver Oil, an order impossible for Ted to fill at that time. The Burbot Liver Products Company In 1935, Joe and son Ted incorporated the company as the Burbot Liver Products Company, with Joe as President and Ted as Secretary, with a capitalization of $10,000. By 1937, Rowell Burbot Liver Oil was accepted by the AMA, the American Medical Association. Initially, burbot liver oil was available only in 8 oz. bottles, but due to its potency, it eventually became available in a dropper bottle. This was significant because with Cod liver oil, you needed to take it by the spoonful, but because of Burbot Liver Oil's high A&D; potency, you only needed a few drops. Burbot Liver Products Company began developing salves, and offered the oil in soft gel capsules filled under contract by the R.P. Scherer Company in Sarasota, Florida. Product volume continued to increase so by 1940‚Äì41, Burbot Liver Products Company purchased of burbot livers annually. Rowell was buying burbot livers from all 30 commercial fisherman on Lake of the Woods, and from other fisherman throughout northern Minnesota. With the start of World War II, the supply of Cod liver oil in the U.S. had been reduced when Germany invaded Norway, and this resulted in a strong boost in Burbot Liver Oil sales. Throughout the 1940s, starting with a calcium supplement Vio-Cal, the company began manufacturing and selling its own line of multi-vitamins and multi-minerals, and further expanding its sales and distribution network throughout the mid-west, eventually manufacturing as many as 200 different products, including prescription drugs. Rowell Laboratories as it appeared in the late 1940s. Ted Rowell Sr. at his desk about 1950. Rowell Laboratories, Inc. and Theodore H. Rowell Jr. In 1949, the name of the company was changed to Rowell Laboratories, Inc. to better represent the company after focus was moved away from Burbot liver-based products. In the 1960s, the company began to specialize in gastro-enterology products. The company grew to sales of about $1.2 million in 1962, the year Theodore H. Rowell Jr. became president. When Ted Rowell Sr. retired from Rowell Laboratories in 1965, the business had revenues of approximately $1.5 million. He had spent most of his life building the company, so with the early days of struggling behind them, and the company's future promising, Ted Sr. decided to retire. Ted Rowell Jr. at his desk in the mid-1980s With Ted Rowell Jr., a new style of management was introduced to Rowell Laboratories, Inc. His father, and company founder, Ted Sr. managed through a \\"classic entrepreneurial\\" style of management, where Ted Sr. was involved in every decision of any significance. Because of the company's growth over the years, the company had eventually outgrown this style of management, and Ted Jr. brought in a classic \\"management through delegation of authority\\" style of management. This allowed Ted to concentrate on company direction, growth, and profitability, while the management team of vice-presidents ran their respective departments while contributing to the direction and growth of the company. Ted credits the success of the company to the outstanding team of officers in his management team during the growth years: Thomas Dinndorf, Cyril \\"Pep\\" Pepera, Dr. Ben Greenwell, PhD, George Cherekos, Robert Solheim, Jesse Cohn, and Dr. Dave Powell, PhD. Members of the Board of Directors during these years were Ted Jr., William H. Ramsey, Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Weaver, Raymond C. Schwiegert, and Daniel J. Haggerty. Over the years, company sales typically doubled every 5‚Äì6 years. Ultimately, the company grew because of its people, its quality products, marketing, and commitment to service. By the mid-1980s, under Ted's guidance, the company had grown to be a national manufacturer of prescription drugs specializing in digestive diseases, and by 1984 had revenues of $15 million, with net profit before taxes of approx. 10%. Reid-Rowell, Inc. in the mid-1980s. Marietta, GA location. Manufacturing and R&D; were done at Baudette, and Administration in Marietta. Rowell merger with Reid-Provident Laboratories, Inc. In 1985, Ted and Ferrell S. Ryan of Reid Provident Labs in Atlanta, Georgia decided to merge their two similar sized and complementary companies, calling the new company Reid-Rowell, Inc. Ted Rowell Jr. was made Chairman of the Board, and Ferrell was made CEO. The combined company employed 380 people, which included a 140-man sales force. Due to management's dedication to the employees, no jobs were lost through the merger process. Reid-Provident was a publicly traded company, but traded on the pink sheets. Now due to the new company's revenues and assets, its stock now qualified it to be traded on the NASDAQ exchange. Since this was late in the 1985 fiscal year, only a portion of the Rowell revenues, from the date of the merger onto the end of the fiscal year, would contribute to the revenues of the overall company for the fiscal year, but the combined annual revenue for the two companies for fiscal 1985 was $32 million. The first quarter of fiscal year 1986 resulted in revenue for Reid- Rowell, Inc. of $10 million for the quarter, and revenue estimates for fiscal 1986 were upwards of $50 million. Sale to Solvay & Cie In 1986, Solvay & Cie of Belgium tendered an offer to purchase the stock of Reid-Rowell, Inc., which was accepted by its Board of Directors. The company was then purchased by Solvay, became a wholly owned subsidiary, and is today known as Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ted Rowell served on the board of directors of Reid- Rowell, the Solvay subsidiary, until 1991. Today, the company reports revenues in excess of $1 billion. More recently, Ted Jr. has been an advisor to the University of Florida School of Pharmacy, and sits on the Board of Directors of Astralis Group. He continues his involvement in pharmaceutical and entrepreneurial activities as an advisor to Rowell Capital Partners, an investment banking group specializing in opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry and acquisitions in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Rowell Laboratories, Inc., a Florida corporation, was incorporated in 2008 in Orlando, Florida as a separate and new company, and manufactures and sells natural antifungal and natural antibiotic skin care products under the NatureCare brand. Although founded by members of the Rowell family, it is not part of the original Rowell Laboratories, Inc. or Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Marietta, GA or Brussels, Belgium. On or around Sept. 28, 2009, the global chemical giant Solvay SA of Brussels, Belgium announced that it has agreed to sell its global pharmaceutical division Solvay Pharmaceuticals Global to Abbott Laboratories, Inc. of Abbott Park, IL for approximately $6.6 billion cash. Solvay Pharmaceuticals Global reports annual revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion is generated by Solvay Pharmaceuticals US, and employs 9,600 people. This acquisition by Abbott will return the US division of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, plus the European division, to American management and an American Board of Directors. Theodore H. Rowell Graduate Fellowship at the University of Minnesota School of Pharmacy After Ted Sr's death, the Rowell family set up the Theodore H. Rowell Graduate Fellowship at the University of Minnesota for graduate students in the College of Pharmacy. Grants range from $3,000 to $6,000 with preference to Minnesota residents who are US citizens.  Rowell Laboratories, Inc. Today Rowell Laboratories, Inc. was re-incorporated in 2008 as a Florida corporation and has returned to its natural product roots, manufacturing natural and homeopathic health care products under the NatureCare brand.

Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women. Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in Education, History, English, Humanities and the like to be seen as ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù careers and areas of study. Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women‚Äôs low participation rates in engineering over time. Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's childhoods that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields. Negative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field. According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs. Two forms of activism tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large. History In the early 1960s, a President‚Äôs Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in teaching, science, and engineering. In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men. Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women‚Äôs roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers. Despite changing political views towards women and minorities during the civil rights movement, college women‚Äôs enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's. For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971‚Äì72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.Montinelli, 1976 This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system. Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968‚Äì78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the United States. However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period. Despite women‚Äôs increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, affirmative action and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates. It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue. In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields.Freckman, 1975 Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition. Statistics and relevant data Percentage of Engineering Bachelor‚ÄôsDegrees Awarded to Womenby School According to the National Science Foundation, overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men. However, men disproportionately outnumber women in the number of Science and Engineering (STEM) degrees received.https://nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/report/sections/science-and- engineering-labor-force/women-and-minorities-in-the-s-e-workforce Between 1989 and 2008, the approximate percentages of women receiving their Bachelor‚Äôs degree in any engineering field were 17% and 19.6%, respectively. The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008. Concerning minority (African American, Hispanic, Native American) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor‚Äôs recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008. The percentages of minority women with engineering doctoral degrees were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. Asian women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women‚Äôs. According to the National Society of Professional Engineers in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004 Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were software engineers (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in environmental engineering (9% to 4%) and chemical engineering (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in mechanical engineering (8% to 17%) and electrical engineering (12% to 18%). In 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades. According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990‚Äì2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000). According to the ASEE, the top 10 colleges producing women engineers:ASEE Engineering by the Numbers Report, 2016 https://ira.asee.org/by-the-numbers/ # Georgia Institute of Technology # Massachusetts Institute of Technology # University of Michigan # Purdue University # Univ. of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign # Ohio State University # Pennsylvania State University # University of Florida # Texas A&M; University # Cornell University Explanations for low participation rates Numerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.Corell, 2001 One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional \\"male breadwinner\\" household model when it comes to organizing families today. Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary wage earners in households where men were present. Even if this is the case women represent close to 60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. IES: What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex? Recently, greater emphasis has been given to women‚Äôs socialization throughout their childhood and adolescence years. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematical fields are largely promoted as being ‚Äúmale professions‚Äù. The media has also been criticized for giving little representation of females within the industry. Instead, some scholars feel that the media is guilty of perpetuating gender stereotypes by representing women in traditional ‚Äúfemale occupations‚Äù such as nurses, school teachers, and housewives. Men help feed into this because they feel as if women aren't cut out for traditional engineering roles but rather one's where they don't have as much responsibility associated directly with the job itself. This idea is supported by a study where STEM field applicants were given a first and second choice on their majors. The results showed that women were more likely to pick male dominated fields in their second choice rather than in their first. This study found that orientations toward certain fields of study were less segregated than actual behaviors, suggesting that cultural perception toward certain fields curbs the aspirations of women that are the most competent. One of the many reasons behind this is that it stems from the treatment that women face from their male peers during collaboration. Women have reported that the males in their groups assign the women routine managerial and secretarial work to complete, leaving the women to be excluded from the hands on engineering work. The overall idea that women are underrepresented in the field has paved a way for these barrier to be raised against women becoming successful members within the field themselves. Christina Hoff Sommers has suggested that subjects such as engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests with the interaction between living beings being one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with Lawrence Summers, that women are incapable or less fundamentally capable than men at engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject in general.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&list;=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&index;=19 The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination. The presence of role models, and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women‚Äôs numbers in engineering. Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves. Women also choose to look up to women who are already in the field as role models and mentors for their future career aspirations because they begin to think that they too can accomplish what they had once done themselves. Additionally, encouragement from teachers, counselors, and administrators. are all said to have a positive impact on a women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, biology, and chemistry were also said to better a women's success in an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages. Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely discriminated against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial social changes are made to society. Socialization and societal outcomes =Educational outcomes= It has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, high school and college women tend to have lower confidence levels in their mathematical ability compared to men. Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, longitudinal studies on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level calculus. Goldman later discovered that positive math assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering. However, other studies have before and since emphasized women‚Äôs early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a self-fulfilling prophecy. If at all, differences in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S labor force, there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.[citation needed] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women. Further studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's dropout rates later in college. Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult. Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male peers, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under. A phenomenon called \\"stereotype threat\\" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed. =Workplace outcomes= According to Hersch, a significant number of corporations have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to political and social pressures. In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique caring and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light manufacturing; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women‚Äôs status on the job. Overall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation. Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and management positions than females, whose promotion prospects are usually more limited. This reason, family and child obligations, and layoffs combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990‚Äîa statistic over twice of that of men. It has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually decreasing on the whole. Moreover, they suggest that equal-opportunities legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate human capital are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions. Statistically, gender pay gaps in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men‚Äôs, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs. Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as ‚Äúdirty‚Äù, ‚Äúrugged‚Äù, or ‚Äúmanly‚Äù jobs are gradually being eroded‚Äîopening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide. However, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women‚Äôs confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with sexist men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called ‚Äúsocial identity threat‚Äù in women. Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren't exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-stress environments reported higher levels of confidence and self-fulfillment, discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced. Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist. Initiatives to promote engineering to women As science and engineering have become more pervasive in society, women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase. According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's talent in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed. Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: extracurricular accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and communication skills. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.Milgrim, 2011 Research has revealed that high school- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a \\"chilly, male- dominated\\" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs. \\"Social coping\\" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and stress associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers. Multiple regression analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be more likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school teachers, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping. An increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates. surveys collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional gender roles. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized \\"nuclear family\\" model is crucial. The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established on May 27, 1950 by Elsie Eaves as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates. SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ. With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.

Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version, a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by Square Co./NTT Publishing in 1991, and subsequently re-released by NTT Publishing in 1994 and 2004. The soundtrack to the remake of Final Fantasy III for the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack was released by NTT Publishing in 2006, with revamped versions of the tracks and additional tracks. A vocal arrangement album entitled Final Fantasy III Y≈´ky≈´ no Kaze Densetsu, or literally Final Fantasy III Legend of the Eternal Wind, contained a selection of musical tracks from the game. The tracks were performed by Nobuo Uematsu and Dido, a duo composed of Michiaki Kato and Shizuru Ohtaka. The album was released by Data M in 1990 and by Polystar in 1994. The music received positive reviews from critics, and is lauded as one of the best soundtracks of any NES game. Several pieces from the soundtrack remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in Final Fantasy orchestral concert series such as the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy concert series and the Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy series. Music from the game has also been published in arranged albums and compilations by Square as well as outside groups. Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version is a soundtrack album of video game music from Final Fantasy III. The album contains the musical tracks from the game, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. It spans 44 tracks and covers a duration of 54:24. It was released on July 15, 1991, by Square and NTT Publishing. Final Fantasy III has been described as the game in which Uematsu's musical style \\"began to take a more definite form\\". Many of the tracks in the soundtrack use \\"cascading rhythms\\" in both the foreground and background sounds, as well as a bass rhythm, pushing the limited sound hardware of the Nintendo Entertainment System further than in Final Fantasy II. The tunes range in style, including \\"jazzy\\" and \\"new age\\", and in tempo from slow, somber pieces to more upbeat rhythms. Including the smaller pieces not included in the original soundtrack, Final Fantasy III contained twice as many pieces as the soundtrack to Final Fantasy II. The original release bears the catalog number N23D-002. It was re- released on November 26, 1994 and again on October 1, 2004 by NTT Publishing under the catalog numbers PSCN-5013 and NTCP-5013, respectively. Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version sold over 5,300 copies, and was well received by critics. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan felt that it was \\"one of the strongest soundtracks\\" of any NES game, a sentiment that Patrick Gann of RPGFan agreed with. Gann further declared the main theme \\"Eternal Wind\\" to \\"quite possibly be the best world map music\\" in a video game. Jon Turner of Soundtrack Central felt that, although the sound limitations of the album detracted it in the eyes of many listeners, the album was still well worth the purchase. Dave of Square Enix Music Online, however, disagreed, feeling that, although it was \\"charming\\", it was \\"one of the weaker Final Fantasy albums\\". Final Fantasy III Y≈´ky≈´ no Kaze Densetsu is an arranged album containing a selection of vocal and arranged musical tracks from the game interspersed with English narration of a story similar to Final Fantasy III. The songs were performed by Nobuo Uematsu and sung by Dido, a duo composed of Michiaki Kato and Shizuru Ohtaka. The tunes have been described as being in the Romantic music style, with a slow feeling to them. The seven tracks of the album spans several genres, including orchestral tracks, tribal themes, and vocal tracks, and cover a duration of 52:32. The album was first released on May 25, 1990 by Data M and subsequently re-released on March 25, 1994 by Polystar. The original release bears the catalog number PSCX-1005, and the re-release bears the catalog number PSCR-5252. Final Fantasy III Yuukyuu no Kaze Densetsu sold over 32,000 copies, and was received positively by critics, with Patrick Gann declaring that it was worth \\"searching long and hard\\" for the album. Ben Martin, Jason Strohmaier, and Aaron Lau of Soundtrack Central all agreed, finding the songs to be varied and interesting, though each added that the narration seriously detracted from the album. Dave of Square Enix Music Online also found the narration to be a flaw of the album, but termed it overall to be \\"a great effort from Nobuo Uematsu\\". Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack released for the remake of Final Fantasy III for the Nintendo DS. The album contains the original tracks from the game rearranged by Tsuyoshi Sekito and Keiji Kawamori for the DS system, as well as two remixes, one from The Black Mages and the other by Yasuhiro Yamanaka, the synth operator for the soundtrack. The album also included a DVD containing the opening full motion video sequence of the game, a promotional video, and an interview with the game's staff. It was released on September 20, 2006 by Square Enix and bears the catalog numbers SQEX-10076~7. The soundtrack disc contains 61 tracks and covers a duration of 70:56., while the DVD's three tracks have a length of 28:24. Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack sold over 17,800 copies. It received mixed reviews from critics, with Patrick Gann declaring that \\"even if you own the original Famicom version's soundtrack, there is plenty of reason to own this soundtrack alongside it,\\" while Richard of Square Enix Music Online found it to be a \\"passable\\" album, but \\"mostly forgettable\\". Track listing Legacy The Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from Final Fantasy video games into a rock music style, have arranged two pieces from Final Fantasy III. These are \\"The Rocking Grounds\\" from the album The Skies Above, published in 2004, and \\"KURAYAMINOKUMO\\", a remix of \\"The Final Struggle\\", from Darkness and Starlight, published in 2008. Lyrical versions of \\"The Boundless Ocean\\" and \\"Elia, the Maiden of Water\\", sung by Risa Ohki, appeared on Final Fantasy: Pray, a compilation album produced by Square. Additionally, lyrical versions of \\"Eternal Wind\\" and \\"Cute Little Tozas\\", sung by Risa Ohki and Ikuko Noguchi, appeared on Final Fantasy: Love Will Grow. The music of Final Fantasy III has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as 20020220 music from FINAL FANTASY, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. Additionally, \\"Elia, the Water Maiden\\" was performed as part of a medley by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy concert tour, while \\"Eternal Wind\\" and \\"Cute Little Tozas\\" were performed in a medley by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy concert series. The Black Mages performed \\"The Final Battle\\" at the Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo on July 7, 2007. Independent but officially licensed releases of Final Fantasy III music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.

The term \\"cant deficiency\\" is defined in the context of travel of a rail vehicle at constant speed on a constant radius curve. Cant itself is a British synonym for the superelevation of the curve, that is, the elevation of the outside rail minus the elevation of the inside rail. Cant deficiency is present when a vehicle's speed on a curve is greater than the speed at which the components of wheel to rail force are normal to the plane of the track. In that case, the resultant force (aggregated force of gravitational force and centrifugal force) exerts the outside rail more than the inside rails, in which it creates lateral acceleration toward outside of the curve. In order to reduce cant deficiency, the speed can be reduced or the superelevation can be increased. The amount of cant deficiency is expressed in term of required superelevation to be added in order to bring the resultant force into balance between the two rails. In the contrary, it is said to be \\"cant excess\\" if the resultant force exerts more against the inside rail than the outside rail, for instance, a high superelevation curve with a train traveling at a low speed.  Forces  The forces that bear on the vehicle in this context are illustrated in the following figure. A vehicle's motion at speed v along a circular path embodies centripetal acceleration of magnitude v2/R toward the center of the circle, the curvature of that path being 1/R where R is the radius of the circle. This centripetal acceleration is produced by horizontal forces applied by the rails to the wheels of the vehicle, directed toward the center, and having sum equal to Mv2/R where M is the mass of the vehicle. The net horizontal force producing the centripetal acceleration is generally separated into components that are respectively in the plane of the superelevated (i.e., banked) track and normal thereto. 300px The component normal to the track acts together with the much larger component of gravitational force normal to the track and is generally neglected. It can slightly increase the vertical load seen by the vehicle suspension but it does not create lateral acceleration as perceived by passengers or and does not cause lateral deflection of the vehicle suspension. The track is superelevated so that the component of the acceleration of gravity in the plane of the track will provide some fraction of the horizontal acceleration in the plane of the track due to the circular motion. Referring to the figure above, it can be seen that the components of gravitational and centripetal acceleration in the plane of the track will be equal when the following balance equation is satisfied, where Œ± is the bank angle. :{v^2\\\\over R} \\\\cos \\\\alpha = g \\\\sin \\\\alpha For a given curve radius and bank angle (i.e., superelevation) the speed V that satisfies the balance equation is called the balancing speed and is given by :V_{bal} = \\\\left ( {R g \\\\tan \\\\alpha} \\\\right ) ^ \\\\tfrac{1}{2} For reasons that will be mentioned below, passenger vehicles usually traverse a curve at a speed higher than the balance speed. The amount by which the actual speed exceeds the balance speed is conveniently expressed via the so-called cant deficiency, i.e., by the amount by which the superelevation would need to be increased to raise the balance speed to the speed at which the vehicles actually travel. Letting gaugese denote the rail gauge from low rail gauge side corner to high rail field side corner, letting super_el denote the actual superelevation, and letting Vact denote the actual speed, it follows from the definition that the cant deficiency, CD, is given by the formula :CD = { gauge_{se} \\\\over { \\\\left (1 + {R^2 g^2 \\\\over {V_{act}^4} } \\\\right ) ^ \\\\tfrac{1}{2} } } - super\\\\\\\\_el = Example = Taking an example, a curve with curvature 1.0 degree per 100 ft chord (radius 1,746.40 m = 5,729.65 ft), gauge_se = 1511.3 mm (59.5 inches), and super_el = 152.4 mm (6.0 inches) will have : V_{bal} = \\\\sqrt{1746.4 \\\\cdot 9.80665 \\\\cdot \\\\tan( \\\\arcsin( 152.4 / 1511.3 ) )}: : = 41.6638\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m/s} = 149.99\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km/h} = 93.20\\\\,\\\\mathrm{miles/h} If a vehicle traverses that curve at a speed of 55.880 m/s (= 201.17 km/h = 125 mph), then the cant deficiency will be : CD = \\\\frac{1511.3}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (1746.4^2 \\\\cdot 9.8066^2 / 55.8^4)}}- 152.4 : = 118.7\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm} (= 4.67\\\\,\\\\mathrm{inches}) On routes that carry freight traffic in cars with the maximum allowed axle loads it will be desirable to set superelevations so that the balancing speed of each curve is close to the speed at which most such traffic runs. This is to lessen the tendency of heavy wheel loads to crush the head of either rail.  Limit values  Allowed CD is set below the value that would be allowed based on safety in order to reduce wheel and rail wear and to reduce the rate of degradation of geometry of ballasted track. Choice of design CD will be less constrained by passenger comfort in the case of vehicles that have tilting capability. One historical approach to determining safe cant deficiency was the requirement that the projection to the plane of the track of the resultant of the inertial and gravitational forces acting on a vehicle fall within the middle third of the track gauge. Contemporary engineering studies would likely use vehicle motion simulation including cross wind conditions to determine margins relative to derailment and rollover. If the superelevation determined for a dedicated passenger route curve on regulatory and safety bases is below it may be desirable to increase the superelevation and reduced the cant deficiency. However, if on such a curve some trains regularly travel at low speeds, then raising the superelevation may be inadvisable for passenger comfort reasons. On a mixed traffic route owned by a freight rail company, freight considerations are likely to prevail. On a mixed traffic route owned by a passenger rail company some kind of compromise may be needed. Cant deficiency is generally looked at with respect to ideal track geometry. As geometry of real track is never perfect it may be desirable to supplement the static considerations laid out above with simulations of vehicle motion over measured geometries of actual tracks. Simulations are also desirable for understanding vehicle behaviour traversing spirals, turnouts, and other track segments where curvature changes with distance by design. Where simulations or measurements show non-ideal behaviour traversing traditional linear spirals, results can be improved by using advanced spirals. Good track geometry including advanced spirals is likely to foster passenger acceptance of higher CD values. =United States= For passenger traffic superelevations and authorized speeds can be set so that trains run with as much cant deficiency as is allowed, based on safety, on relevant regulations and on passenger comfort. As of 2007 the US Federal Railroad Administration regulations limit CD to for tilting passenger vehicles, for conventional vehicles. This FRA regulation is based on AAR standards based on a single study in the 1950s on a rail line in Connecticut. In Germany, where axle loads are typically lower than those in the USA, tilting trains are allowed to operate with CD in some cases. CD above can be considered too uncomfortable for passengers (e.g. things on tables might slide off), except for tilting trains. The FRA issued new information on cant deficiency in 2009 under FRA-2009-0036-0003. Due to the circumstances outlined, the federal regulations on cant deficiency were amended such that any rail vehicle may operate with up to 3 inches of cant deficiency and any vehicle that is to be operated above this number must be approved by the FRA for such operations. Approval is governed by conditions outlined in CFR chapter 49 section 213.329 part (d) and based on the idea that the car cannot unload the inside wheel on a curve by more than 60% of static loading. =Europe= France and Germany allow trains on conventional lines to operate at up to cant deficiency. TGV has limit on cant deficiency of .

Plot summary Set in an unspecified year, but probably a few years after 1956, the story centers on Szabo Tibor, an expatriate Hungarian, working as a pearl diver on a pearling boat between Queensland's Great Barrier Reef and Thursday Island. When an off-course Russian space capsule crashlands in the sea nearby, Tibor is the first to reach it. He makes contact with the still-alive cosmonaut inside, who can hear him talking but cannot respond except by knocking on the hull. Tibor, who escaped from Hungary during the 1956 uprising and whose brother was killed by invading Russians, takes revenge by delaying the salvage attempts until the capsule's air has run out and the cosmonaut is dead. When they get the capsule to land and open the hatch, they find that the dead cosmonaut, a beautiful young girl, has managed to record Tibor's words on a tape recorder, thus branding him as a murderer.

The garden consists of a long stretch of grass, lower than the surrounding area, that runs west from the rear of the Wren Building to Crim Dell pond. The area is very popular for students wanting to study outside or play games like Ultimate. Functionally, it is similar to a university quadrangle. The Sunken Garden was first designed by College Architect Charles M. Robinson, who was working closely with J.A.C. Chandler on the project from 1919 to 1923. The design was reportedly based on the works of Christopher Wren seen in England, especially his work at Chelsea Hospital. The plan for a sunken garden on the campus was first mentioned in correspondence between J.A.C. Chandler and Charles F. Gillette in October 1923. The plan to omit the construction of the Sunken Garden as included in building plans drawn by landscape artist Charles F. Gillette was first mentioned in the Board of Visitors minutes on February 12, 1924. The Board of Visitors was concerned that Gillette's landscape plan would call for an expenditure of $25,000 to $30,000. In 1933, Dr. J.A.C Chandler reported that a Civilian Conservation Corps camp had been assigned to the College for the purpose of beautifying and improving the grounds. He recommended that the Board again consider the idea of the Sunken Garden. This recommendation was adopted and the President was authorized to employ Gillette to supervise the landscape work. Upon motion duly made and seconded, Gillette's bill for $1,400 for services rendered as architect for the Sunken Garden was approved and ordered to be paid. It was constructed by A.L Phillips Sons between 1935 and 1936. References * University Archives Buildings File (2007). Sunken Gardens.

Education Of Czech and Appalachian descent, he was raised in Texas' lower Rio Grande valley. An early interest in topology was strongly encouraged by his parents. He enrolled at Rice University in 1962 as a physics major, but (with the help of Jim Douglas) entered the graduate mathematics program in 1964. His advisor Eldon Dyer arranged, with the support of Michael Atiyah, a one-year fellowship at the University of Oxford, followed by a year in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. Work Morava brought ideas from arithmetic geometry into the realm of algebraic topology. Under Atiyah's tutelage Morava concentrated on the relation between K-theory and cobordism, and when Daniel Quillen's work on that subject appeared he saw that ideas of Sergei Novikov implied close connections between the stable homotopy category and the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves on the moduli stack of one-dimensional formal groups; in particular, that the category of spectra is naturally stratified by height. Using work of Dennis Sullivan, he focused attention on certain ring-spectra parametrized by one-dimensional formal group laws over a field, which generalize classical topological K-theory. From a modern point of view [i.e., since Michael J. Hopkins, Smith, and Devinatz's proof of Douglas Ravenel's nilpotence conjecture] it is natural to think of these cohomology theories as the geometric points associated to the prime ideals of the stable homotopy category. Their groups of multiplicative automorphisms are essentially the units in certain p-adic division algebras, and thus have deep connections to local class field theory. He joined the Johns Hopkins University faculty in 1979, and was involved in organizing the Japan-US Mathematics Institute there. Much of his later work involves the application of cobordism categories to mathematical physics, as well as Tannakian descent theory in homotopy categories (posted mostly on the ArXiv). From roughly 2006 to 2010 he was active in DARPA's fundamental questions of biology initiative. Personal life In 1970 he and the linguistic anthropologist Ellen Lee Contini married; they have two children, Aili and Michael. They spent a year at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Moscow on a US National Academy of Sciences fellowship, where he was influenced by contact with Vladimir Arnold, Israel Gelfand, Yuri I. Manin, and Novikov.  See also  * Morava K-theory  References  * Michael J. Hopkins, Global methods in homotopy theory, in Homotopy theory (Durham, 1985), 73-96, London Math. Soc.

Early life Horatio Bruce was born February 22, 1830 about one mile south of Vanceburg in Lewis County, Kentucky.Levin, p. 191 He was the son of Alexander and Amanda (Bragg) Bruce and named for two of his uncles, Horatio and Washington Bruce.History of the Ohio Falls, p. 499 His paternal grandfather was a soldier in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, and his father was a wealthy landowner who served as a Whig in the Kentucky General Assembly in 1825 and 1826.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 395 His maternal grandfather also served in the Revolutionary War. He was of Scottish ancestry on his father's side and English ancestry on his mother's side. Bruce was educated in private schools in his native Lewis County, as well as Manchester, Ohio. At age sixteen, he began work as a salesman in a general store, a job he held until 1849.Connelly, p. 625 Concurrently, he was postmaster of the post office in Vanceburg. In 1849, Bruce taught at a school in Vanceburg for a five-month term. The following year, he taught for five months in another school in Lewis County. In December 1850, he relocated to Flemingsburg, where he read law in the office of Leander M. Cox. He was admitted to the bar in July 1851 and opened his practice in Flemingsburg. Later that year, he was appointed examiner by the circuit court of Fleming county, and soon after was elected to the Flemingsburg Board of School Trustees. Antebellum political career Bruce first became active in politics in 1852, making campaign speeches for the Whig presidential ticket of Winfield Scott and William Alexander Graham in the 1852 election. When the Whig Party collapsed, Bruce associated with the Know Nothing Party, and was elected to represent Fleming County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1855 and 1856. On June 12, 1856, Bruce married Elizabeth Hardin Helm, daughter of two-time Kentucky Governor John L. Helm, at \\"Helm Place\\", the bride's home in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The couple had five children: Helm Bruce, Elizabeth Barber Bruce, Maria Preston Pope Bruce, Mary (Bruce) Smith, and V. Alexander Bruce.Van Meter, p. 123 In August 1856, Bruce was elected Commonwealth's Attorney for the Tenth District, comprising Mason, Lewis, Greenup, Rowan, Fleming and Nicholas counties. He held this position until 1858. In late 1858, he resigned his position as Commonwealth's Attorney and moved to Louisville. There, he formed the law firm of Helm and Bruce with his brother-in-law, Benjamin Hardin Helm. During the 1860 presidential election, Bruce actively supported the Constitutional Union ticket of John Bell and Edward Everett. In 1861, he adopted a states' rights platform and unsuccessfully sought a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing to Robert Mallory. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Bruce sided with the Confederacy and left Louisville for Bowling Green, the headquarters of the state's Confederates, on August 17, 1861. He was a delegate to Kentucky's first Confederate sovereignty convention, held at Russellville from October 29‚Äì31, 1861. This self- constituted convention laid the groundwork for Kentucky's secession from the Union, and called for a second convention to be held in Russellville November 18 and 19, 1861. This second convention passed an ordinance of secession, declaring Kentucky to have withdrawn from the Union. The convention also established a provisional Confederate state government, and Bruce was elected a member of its legislature. Shortly thereafter, Kentucky was admitted to the Confederate States of America. On January 22, 1862, Bruce was elected as a Representative in the First Confederate Congress. He was chosen to represent Kentucky on a committee to arrange and conduct the inaugural ceremonies of Jefferson Davis and Alexander H. Stephens as Confederate President and Vice- President, respectively. He was also named to the Foreign Relations Committee and the Committee on Patents.\\"Kentucky Members of the Confederate Congress\\" On January 10, 1864, he was re-elected to the Second Confederate Congress, serving until the end of the war.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 396 Records of his service in the Confederate Congresses have been lost to history. Bruce and the other members of the Confederate Congress - along with President Davis - remained in Richmond, Virginia until April 2, 1865. They then fled to Danville, Virginia, where they remained until Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Afterward, Bruce traveled first to Greensboro, North Carolina and Augusta, Georgia before returning to Richmond after President Andrew Johnson declared amnesty for ex-Confederates. Bruce then traveled to Washington, D.C. where he arranged a meeting with his close friend and fellow Kentuckian, Attorney General James Speed. Speed informed Bruce that he had been granted a pardon for any actions of disloyalty during the war. Post-war life Bruce returned to Louisville June 19, 1865 and in August 1865, formed the law firm of Bruce and Russell with Samuel Russell, his former pupil.History of the Ohio Falls, p. 500 They dissolved the partnership in 1868 when Bruce was elected to the circuit court in Kentucky's ninth district, comprising Jefferson, Oldham, Shelby, Spencer, and Bullitt counties. He was elected by the overwhelming majority of 10,611 votes in a contest where only 14,817 votes were cast. Bruce was among the first Kentuckians to call for courts to recognize negros' testimony as competent and valid, writing a letter to the Chicago Evening Post in support of this cause on February 20, 1869. Beginning in 1872, despite never having attended college, he served as a law professor at the University of Louisville, holding the chair of history and science of law, law of real property, and contracts and criminal law. He also served as president of the Louisville Medical College. In 1873, Governor Preston Leslie appointed Bruce as a chancellor of the Louisville Chancery Court to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Chancellor Cochran. At a special election held in February 1874, he was elected to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. In August 1874, he was re-elected to a full, six-year term. He resigned from the chancery court on March 10, 1880 to accept the position of attorney for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Shortly after taking this position, he also resigned his professorship at the University of Louisville.History of the Ohio Falls, p. 501 Bruce died on January 22, 1903 in Louisville.

The Popular Front of Estonia (), introduced to the public by the Estonian politician Edgar Savisaar under the short-lived name Popular Front for the Support of Perestroika, was a political organisation in Estonia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Edgar Savisaar introduced the idea of popular front during a TV show on 13 April 1988. The idea was developed through the year and finally The Estonian Popular Front was established on 1 October 1988 with a massively crowded congress which turned to a culmination of the first phase of the Singing Revolution. It was to a significant degree the precursor to the current Estonian Centre Party, although with a much broader base of popularity at the beginning. History The Popular Front of Estonia was a major force in the Estonian independence movement that led to the re-establishment of the Republic of Estonia as a country independent from the Soviet Union. It was similar to the Popular Front of Latvia and the SƒÖj≈´dis movement in Lithuania and a number of Popular Fronts that were created almost simultaneously in many parts of the USSR. The Baltic States were in a unique category among the constituent parts of the USSR in that they had been European parliamentary democracies in the interbellum and had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The Popular Front of Estonia was founded in 1988 by Marju Lauristin and Edgar Savisaar. Savisaar initiated the founding in April 1988 in a live broadcast (M√µtleme veel) on Estonian TV, advocating support of Gorbachevian perestroika. Popular Front organised series of much-crowded and well-published events and actions which stressed on Estonian national pride but on democratic values as well. Huge amount of prints and newspapers were produced to popularise PF movement. The top-leaders and sub-leaders of PF were everyday guests in every kind of media to talk about several kind of problems and ideas. Popular Front of Estonia made ideas of independent Estonia acceptable and possible for masses. The idea of independence had become a somewhat impossible and unbelievable dream for the majority of Estonians during decades under the Soviet Union. At one point someway problematic character of Edgar Savisaar created growing opposition against PF among Estonians too. Those people formed their own smaller organisations which grew into important element of politics of independent Estonia next decade. The Popular Front of Estonia together with the Popular Front of Latvia and the SƒÖj≈´dis organised the Baltic Way mass \\"arm-in-arm\\" manifestation extending through three Baltic states on 23 August 1989 that marked 50th anniversary of 23 August 1939, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which resulted in the forcible incorporation of these three states into the Soviet Union and the loss of their independence. The front was opposed by the Intermovement that represented the pro-Soviet part of Estonia's population including most of the country's Russian minority and other ethnic groups that had been settled in Estonia during the Soviet era. The Popular Front was a supporter of perestroika, while the Intermovement was seen as opposed to Gorbachev's reforms. As time went by, an ever-greater chasm developed between the initial thrust of the Popular Front, leading members of which at first advocated mere autonomy within a Soviet system that Gorbachev was trying to reform in a cautious way, and the eventual context of the Estonian Popular Front, which came to stand for true independence, an idea supported by the rank and file. Consequently, the Estonian Popular Front changed a great deal over time, until political parties came to replace such movements in Estonia during the early nineties. This rendered the Popular Front of Estonia an anachronism, and Popular Front was dissolved in 1993.

Geography The village is situated on the east hillside of Kalbenberg, right of the river Blies. The church (its origins date back to the 14th century) is the center of the village. In front of the church is one of the many fountains that can be found throughout the village, all beautifully decorated with stone sculptures. The village has many chestnut and walnut trees and well as mixed orchard grasslands. History On the mountain ridge close to Wolfersheim a group of graves were found that date back from the Hallstatt culture (800 - 500 AD). Wolfersheim was first documented in 1274 and was a settlement of a Frankish man Wolfhari. The main road of the village is still named after Wolfhari. In the late Middle Ages, the village belonged to the monasteries of Hornbach, Gr√§finthal and Wadgassen. Since 1453 the duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken was the regent. In 1777 baron Christian Cathcart von Carbiston received the village from Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr√ºcken. But only one year later, the village was sold to countess Marianne von der Leyen in Blieskastel due to financial straits. The village has a rural character. Many of the old farmhouses from the 19th and 20th century were restored in the last years and therefore the original character of the village could be maintained. The many clubs and the engagement of the resident give Wolfersheim its special character. In 2004, Wolfersheim won the gold medal in a competition called \\"Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden\\" (Our village shall become more beautiful) on national level. During World War II, the Protestant (Lutheran) church in Wolfersheim was heavily damaged. After the war, there have been several restorations of the church in 1958‚Äì1960, 1974, and most recently in 1996‚Äì1997.:de:Protestantische Kirche (Wolfersheim) References Category:Saarpfalz-Kreis ","title":"Wolfersheim"},{"id":"11214973","text":"\\"Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.\\" is the 18th episode in the first season of the television series How I Met Your Mother. It originally aired on April 10, 2006.  Plot  Future Ted tells his children of a saying his mother used and which he agrees with: \\"Nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m.\\" He then picks up his narrative from where the previous episode left off, having just returned home from a karaoke club and receiving a call from Robin. Earlier that day, Robin does a presentation on her career with Lily's class but gets defensive when the children ask about her romantic life instead. Robin's feelings of loneliness are amplified when her co-anchor, Sandy Rivers (Alexis Denisof), tells her that they should have sex. When she returns home, she drinks a large glass of wine and calls Ted, who has been waiting for a phone call from Victoria. Ted believes the phone call will be about breaking up, but Victoria does not call when expected and Ted is left feeling anxious. When Robin's phone call comes, he agrees to go to her apartment, but his attempts to rationalize his decision are undermined when he begins conversing with his conscience, which appears personified as Victoria. When Ted consults Marshall and Lily, they both attempt to dissuade him, but Lily unwittingly encourages him when she says that Robin has feelings for Ted. When Ted arrives at Robin's apartment, he lies about breaking up with Victoria and they begin kissing. Ted goes to the bathroom, to think about his situation. Just when he convinces himself that it is all right to have sex with Robin, he realizes he has Robin's phone. He emerges from the bathroom just as Robin is getting off his phone with Victoria, who has called at last. Robin asks him to leave. Meanwhile, Barney attempts to prove to Lily and Marshall that good things can happen after 2 a.m. when they try to leave a karaoke bar early. Barney invites a Korean Elvis impersonator to come with the group to MacLaren's. When Korean Elvis tries to convince them to stay, he whispers something in Lily's ear, which causes her to knee him in the groin. Future Ted claims that Barney was right and that the night was \\"legendary\\". As Ted heads back to his apartment, he calls Victoria and the two break up. Future Ted reminds his kids that nothing good happens after 2 a.m., and says that lying to Robin was the stupidest thing he ever did. Critical response The TV Critic rated the episode 66 out of 100, describing the episode as \\"a very traditional mid season will they-won‚Äôt they romance story\\", but stating that it was \\"effective nonetheless\\".

The Raiders moved to the Big 12 for the 1996‚Äì97 season, and appeared to pick up right where they left off with a solid 19‚Äì9 season. It was discovered during the inaugural Big 12 basketball tournament, however, that two players had played the entire season while academically ineligible. Hours after the team's first-round game, Texas Tech announced that it was withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won. A subsequent investigation revealed massive violations dating back to 1990 in men's basketball and nine other sports (though Dickey himself was not personally implicated). As a result, the NCAA stripped Tech of its two NCAA tournament wins in 1996 and docked it nine scholarships over four years. The lost scholarships were too much for Dickey to overcome, and he tallied four straight losing seasons before being fired in 2001.

In June 2018, The Tablet was named Newspaper of the Year by the Catholic Press Association in its category of diocesan newspapers with circulations above 25,000. In 1972, it won the Catholic Press Association Journalism Award for General Excellence. In May 2018, longtime Editor in Chief Ed Wilkinson was awarded the St. Francis de Sales Distinguished Communicator Award at the Diocese of Brooklyn's 27th annual World Communications Day Catholic Media Conference.  History  In 1901, James Rooney of the Brooklyn Eagle made a proposal to Bishop Charles McDonnell for a diocesan paper, but the bishop wasn't ready. Seven years later, William P. Lawler, who published The Monitor for the Newark Archdiocese, made a similar proposal. By then, McDonnell was ready and suggested the paper's name, in honor of The London Tablet, the preeminent Catholic journal in the English-speaking world at the time. The first issue of The Tablet appeared on April 4, 1908. Rev. James J. Coan was appointed editor and Joseph J. Timmes was appointed managing editor. In 1909, by the end of The Tablet‚Äôs first year, its subscription base reached 13,000, and Bishop McDonnell purchased the paper. He saw The Tablet as an ‚Äúinfluential means of spreading religious information and instruction and forming a link for the closer welding-together of the far-flung centers of Long Island.‚Äù In 1931, the paper's name was changed to Brooklyn Tablet, but it was changed back to The Tablet in 1939. From 1933 to 1973, there was a separate Italian paper, Il Crociato. In 1940, The Tablet Home Delivery Service begun. In June 1972, The Tablet added a monthly Spanish supplement. A separate Spanish paper, El Nuevo Amanacer (The New Dawn), was published from 1981 to 1994. Manuel Gonzalez served as its first editor, followed by Sister Eve Gillcrist, O.P. In December 1972, Ms. Tablet, an annual women's issue, made its first appearance. The paper featured women writers more prominently than it had previously, especially Sister Camille D‚ÄôArienzo, R.S.M. From 1989 to 2007, Tablet Week in Review aired on The Prayer Channel. In 2001, The Tablet launched its website, thetablet.org. In October 2003, Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio's ‚ÄúPut Out Into the Deep‚Äù column first appeared. This was the first time in the paper's history that a diocesan bishop wrote a weekly column. Since then, Bishop DiMarzio has used his column as a way to speak directly to the people on local, national, and international issues. On April 23, 2011, The Tablet published a Spanish-language insert, ‚ÄúLa Reconciliacion‚Äù (The Reconciliation), which went on to become The Tablet‚Äôs Spanish-language sister publication, Nuestra Voz, which has become a monthly newspaper and daily digital news operation.

It is a commentary on the community rules (Patimokkha). The general form of the commentary is that each rule is preceded by a story telling how the Buddha came to lay it down, and followed by explanations. Sometimes this includes further stories acting as \\"judicial precedents\\". It is divided into two parts, covering the rules for monks and nuns, respectively. The monks' rules are divided as follows: * 4 rules whose breach entails expulsion from the community; the traditional understanding is that the offender cannot be a monk again in this life, though he can in most cases become a novice  sexual intercourse; the introductory narrative includes some unrelated material, including a story of how Sariputta asks the Buddha which previous Buddhas' teachings lasted a long time and why; the Buddha's answer is that the teaching of those Buddhas who taught scriptures and rules of discipline lasted (cf. Max Weber's doctrine of routinization); the rule makes provision for a monk to leave the order and return to lay life, during which \\"breaches\\" of this rule would not count and he could be reordained later (customs on this vary; in Southeast Asia reordination is common, but in Sri Lanka it is not; the permission to leave the order does not apply to nuns)  stealing, as defined by the authorities; according to the Suttavibhanga, this includes tax evasion; it also gives stories of monks who, motivated by compassion, released animals from hunters' traps, the Buddha declaring them not guilty  killing a human being, or encouraging one to die; according to the Suttavibhanga this includes abortion  fraudulent claims to spiritual attainments * 13 rules whose breach requires a meeting of the community; the offender must serve first probation for as many days as elapsed between offence and confession, then five days of manatta discipline (Miss Horner leaves the term untranslated); he may then be rehabilitated, but only by a quorum of 20 monks * 2 rules for dealing with matters that might fall into different categories * 30 rules whose breach entails expiation and forfeiture of an improperly acquired or retained possession; the Suttavibhanga says in the first one that the forfeited item must be returned to the offending monk; the tradition holds that this applies to most of these rules; an exception is the rule against accepting gold and silver, which the Suttavibhanga interprets as applying to anything accepted in society as money * 92 rules whose breach entails expiation; it is worth noting here that for some minor rules ignorance is not a defence, according to the Suttavibhanga; for example, in the rule forbidding eating after noon, it is no defence if the monk thought it was before noon; likewise, in the rule against drinking alcohol, it is no defence if the monk thought the drink was non-alcoholic * 4 rules whose breach entails confession * 75 rules for training * 7 rules for settling disputes The nuns' section has the same sections apart from the third. Since many of the nuns' rules apply to monks too and these are not usually repeated in the Suttavibhanga, the numbers of rules actually appearing in some sections of the nuns' analysis are less than the totals given at the beginning and end. * 4 of 8 rules entailing expulsion * 10 of 17 rules requiring a meeting; nuns must serve manatta for a half month * 12 of 30 rules entailing forfeiture * 96 of 166 rules entailing expiation * 8 rules entailing confession * the same 75 rules of training, with only the first and last written out * the same 7 rules for settling disputes  Translation  The Book of the Discipline, tr I.

Began career as a teenager with Marion (Interstate League) in 1891. Abbot played with independent Ohio teams Springfield and Dayton in 1892 and 1893 respectively before joining the San Antonio Missionaries of the Texas- Southern League in 1895. In 1897 he was playing with the Cairo Egyptians in the Central League. By 1898, he was with the Southern League's New Orleans Pelicans, where he batted .265 in 15 games, while playing mostly in the outfield. Abbott joined Danville of the Indiana‚ÄìIllinois League the following season, and remained with them when they joined the Central League the next year. Abbott batted a very respectable .318 with three home runs and stole 14 bases over 83 games. He rejoined the New Orleans Pelicans, batting .296 for them in 1901, and .289 in 1902, playing over 100 each season. Abbott made his major league baseball debut with the Cleveland Naps a week into the 1903 season, on April 29 against the St. Louis Browns. He would go on to play a total of 77 games as a backup catcher behind Harry Bemis, batting .235 with a single home run to go with 25 RBI and eight stolen bases. 1904 found Abbott's playing time diminished, along with his batting average. Splitting his time in the backup role this time, with Fritz Buelow and rookie Harry Ostdiek Abbott batted a meager .169 with no homers and only a dozen RBI before being sent down to the Columbus Senators of the American Association where he finished the season going .222 over 34 games.

Life His life has not yet been thoroughly studied. The earliest information available shows that he may have lived and worked on Chios, an island in the Aegean, in the service of the Genoese Giustiniani family; the connection can be made from the dedication to one of his 1560 books of madrigals. In 1560 he assisted at the wedding of Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy and Marguerite of Valois, which took place in Nice.Haar, Grove online In 1566 at the latest he went to Florence, where he served Ferdinando I de' Medici as a composer, alongside Alessandro Striggio, and Francesco Corteccia, whose career by then had begun to wane. By 1579 he was in the employ of either Albrecht V, or William V (Albrecht died in 1579). The intermedio performed in Florence in 1583 alongside Fedini's play Le due Persile may have been his work. Connections between the Medici and Bavarian courts were close through the period, and composers often passed between them. Nothing certain is yet known of Rossetto's career after 1580. Music All of his surviving music is vocal, and includes madrigals and motets, some of which were probably intended for performance as intermedii, musical interludes between acts of plays. Along with the other Medici composers, taking part in a trend of the time, he wrote gigantic polychoral compositions. One of the largest polychoral works ever composed, at least prior to modern times, was his huge 50-voice motet Consolamini popule meus. The date of the composition is unknown, but the manuscript is at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich, suggesting he wrote it while in the service of the Bavarian court. Only a handful of larger compositions are known: Alessandro Striggio's colossal 40 and 60 voice Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno, and the 17th century 53-voice Missa Salisburgensis attributed to Heinrich Ignaz Biber.Moroney, p. 5-7 Rossetto also composed three books of madrigals, for four, five, and six voices, respectively (all published in Venice in 1560 and 1566), and an ambitious setting of the Lamento d'Olimpia, in seventeen parts, for from four to ten voices, which he published in Venice in 1567. (Florence, for all its opulence, lacked publishing houses, and most of the Medici composers published their works in Venice, a city with a long publishing history.) In addition to his secular music, he published a book of motets in Nuremberg in 1573, Novae quaedam sacrae cantiones, quas vulgo motetas vocant, for five and six voices. In his madrigals he uses chromaticism creatively, and he liked to write both madrigals and motets in groups, as did the other Medici composers (such as Corteccia and Striggio). Much of his music is intended to be accompanied by instruments, another characteristic of Florentine polyphony of the period.

Jaramillo started working primarily in the Urab√° Antioquia region until 1987 when he assumed the presidency of the Patriotic Union Party (UP) after the assassination of Jaime Pardo.  Youth  Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa was born into a poor working family in Manizales. He was the son of Nydia Ossa Escobar and Bernardo Jaramillo R√≠os. He had a sister, Clemencia. He finished his baccalaureate at the Instituto Manizales. Where he actively performed important works for the improvement of student conditions. He graduated as a lawyer at the University of Caldas in June 1981 but he did graduate with degrees in law and political science. . His parents commented that from his youth, he understood the problems of poverty that several people lived around him, he founded a popular restaurant when he was in high school, a restaurant that currently has your name. Being a high school student and in the midst of a protest, he met the legendary trade union leader Rub√©n Dar√≠o Casta√±o whom he considered his political mentor and shortly after, joined the ranks of the Colombian Communist Youth (JUCO) where he reached positions of leadership. Years later, Casta√±o would also be killed by paramilitaries in November 1985 at the door of his house. In 1977, she married Ana Luc√≠a Zapata Hincapi√©, a teacher born in Ap√≠a Risaralda with whom they had a daughter, Paula Tatiana (1978-2014), and a son, Bernardo Jaramillo Zapata.  In the Patriotic Union  Jaramillo joined the Patriotic Union Party (UP) once it was founded in 1985, and later in the 1988 election won the seat of Senator of the Republic. Following the murder of Pardo Leal he took the chair as president of the party. He tried to give greater breadth to the UP, accused by its critics of being a political arm of the FARC. Jaramillo Ossa made efforts to link the movement with the Socialist International, which earned him the nickname \\"perestroika\\". Jaramillo intended to separate the suspected relationship between his party and the FARC by approaching the Socialist International. Jaramillo then ran for the presidency of Colombia. He was planning an alliance with Carlos Pizarro Leong√≥mez, demobilized leader of the 19th of April Movement (M-19) and also a candidate for the Presidency.  Murder  Jaramillo had been very vocal in denouncing the systematic assassination of members of UP, attributing them to the rise of right-wing paramilitary forces in allegiance with drug trafficking cartels, and approved and even supported by the military and other political forces. He specifically blamed president Barco of ignoring the evidence of the collaboration between drug cartels and Colombia's military to create and fund the paramilitary forces responsible for the assassinations. Two days before his assassination, Carlos Lemos, who was the Minister of Government at the time, dismissed Jaramillo's accusations and in turn suggested that UP was the political branch of FARC. Jaramillo responded by saying that such accusation was both unfair and baseless, and that it meant essentially a death sentence for him and UP members, which proved true just two days later. Jaramillo was murdered while campaigning in Bogot√° on March 22, 1990. He was in Bogot√°'s Puente A√©reo terminal of El Dorado airport with his wife Mariela Barragan and several bodyguards provided to him by DAS. Despite having received death threats, he refused to wear a protective vest. Once he was in the terminal, he was waiting for his flight to Santa Marta, where he would go on vacation after the exhausting presidential campaign. A young paramilitary hitman, named Andr√©s Arturo Guti√©rrez Maya, waited for him while he and his wife were in front of a pharmacy, then pulled out a Mini Ingram 380 machine gun and fired on the candidate. A guard pushed the wife away to prevent her being shot as well, while other bodyguards chased after the murderer, whom they shot and captured. Jaramillo fell wounded in the arms of his wife and uttered three sentences: \\"Mi amor, no siento las piernas. Estos hijueputas me dieron, me voy a morir. Abrazame y protegeme. [My love, I don't feel my legs. These motherfuckers got me, I am going to die. Hug me and protect me.]\\" He was put in a car by his wife and few other bodyguards, where he lost consciousness, and then taken to the hospital of the National Police. He died before he could be put in the surgery room, after a delay in the elevator at the clinic. After his assassination more than 3000 members in or related to his party were also killed.  Investigations  Since his murderer, Guti√©rrez Maya, was 16 at the time of the assassination, he didn't go to jail, but to a minors facility. He was killed about a year later, with his father, as he had been allowed to be out of the correction facility temporarily. Guti√©rrez Maya was a friend and coworker of Gerardo Guti√©rrez Uribe, killer of Carlos Pizarro. The crime was originally attributed to Pablo Escobar, but the drug lord denied his involvement and even argued he had asked against it. An anonymous call to a radio station in Medellin attributed the murder to the paramilitary organization of Fidel Casta√±o, who apparently had inherited the criminal structure of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who had been killed months before. No one has been officially condemned by the assassination, but current consensus supports the hypothesis that the paramilitary organization of the Casta√±o brothers was behind the crime, even acknowledged by Carlos Casta√±o. On February 11, 2010, Alberto Romero, an ex director of the DAS (Colombian Security Service), was charged as being linked to the murder, together with Carlos Casta√±o, the chief of the AUC (paramilitary forces). Popular culture Bernardo Jaramillo is portrayed by the Venezuelan actor Orlando Valenzuela in the Colombian TV series Pablo Escobar: El Patr√≥n del Mal.

It was created and debuted on May 14, 2007 at the taping of then-TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!. It was officially introduced worldwide on the May 17, 2007 edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today. Like most professional wrestling championships, the title is won as a result of a pre-determined match. History Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) The Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion formed in May 2002. Later that same year, TNA were granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body, subsequently becoming an official NWA territory as NWA‚ÄìTNA. On June 19, 2002, NWA‚ÄìTNA held its first show: a weekly pay-per-view (PPV) event. The main event of the telecast was a twenty‚Äìman Gauntlet for the Gold match‚Äîinvolving all twenty men trying to throw each other over the top rope and down to the floor in order to eliminate them, until there are two men left who wrestle a standard match‚Äîto become the first ever TNA‚Äìera NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Ken Shamrock defeated Malice to win the vacant championship with Ricky Steamboat as Special Guest Referee at the event. TNA crowned the first TNA‚Äìera NWA World Tag Team Champions at their third weekly PPV event on July 3, 2002, when the team of A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn defeated The Rainbow Express (Bruce and Lenny Lane) in a tournament final to win the championship. =Creation= The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA until the morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich announced that the NWA were ending their five‚Äìyear agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on to state that effective that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and the Team 3D pairing of Brother Devon and Brother Ray, then-NWA World Tag Team Champions, were stripped of their respective championships. The motivation behind these actions was that Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to produce their Sacrifice 2007 PPV event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the card, Cage was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a three-way match. Team 3D were set to defend the NWA World Tag Team Championship against the team of Scott Steiner and Tomko and the team made up of Hernandez and Homicide, who were known as The Latin American Xchange (LAX), in another three-way match. That night before each contest, the on-screen graphic used to refer to the champions and their respective championships, credited both Cage and Team 3D as still being NWA Champions. However, the ring announcers for the encounters proclaimed the matches as being strictly for the \\"World Heavyweight Championship\\" or the \\"World Tag Team Championship\\". Team 3D defeated Steiner and Tomko and LAX in the three-way tag team match to retain the \\"World Tag Team Championship\\", while Angle defeated Cage and Sting to win the \\"World Heavyweight Championship\\". On May 17, 2007, Jeremy Borash and TNA's primary authority figure at the time, Jim Cornette, unveiled the TNA World Tag Team Championship belt on that day's edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today and awarded it to Team 3D as a result of them being the NWA Tag Team Champions before the NWA/TNA split; in the process making them the first official champions. =Belt designs= During the championship's entire history, it has had three designs. Until Destination X (2017), it had a leather strap covered with four small gold plates that has an imprint of the earth centered in the middle with TNA's official logo at the top of each. The center golden plate of the belt also has an imprint of a globe, with TNA's official logo engraved over it. The words \\"World Tag Team\\" are placed above the globe, while the words \\"Wrestling Champion\\" are placed below it. At Destination X 2017, a recoloured version of the GFW Tag Team Championships from the original promotion was revealed as the new tag team championships. The main plate had the Global Force Wrestling logo to the left and the words \\"Tag Team Champions\\" centered on the bottom of the belt. The top of the main plate had a globe, with a bird below it. The sideplates had the words \\"Tag Team\\" on the top and \\"Champions\\" on the bottom, with the GFW Impact! logo on the left sideplate and the GFW logo on the right sideplate. After Jeff Jarrett left the company and took the GFW name with him, all championships have been updated with an Impact Wrestling logo to cover the GFW logo. At Redemption on April 22, 2018, Impact revealed new championships. The main plate is oblong, similar to the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. It has the Impact logo at a diagonal angle centered between the words \\"Tag Team\\" on the top and \\"Champion\\" on the bottom. It features two designs of an owl above and below the words. Reigns Two- time and current champions The Motor City Machine Guns - Chris Sabin (left) and Alex Shelley The inaugural champions were Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), who were awarded the championship on the May 17, 2007 edition of TNA Today. At days, The North's (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) reign is the longest in the title's history. Eric Young/Super Eric and Kaz's only reign holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history at a half day. Individually, James Storm holds the record with seven reigns, while Beer Money and The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) share the record of five reigns as a team. The current champions are The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin), who are in their second reign both as a team and individually. They defeated The North Ethan Page and Josh Alexander on July 19, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee during the Impact Wrestling tapings to win the titles (aired July 21). Although the title is a World Tag Team Championship, three wrestlers have held the championship by themselves ‚Äî Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Joe held the championship during his entire reign alone; however, Angle held the championship alone for 15 days until Sting won a match involving three other competitors to become Angle's partner, and Morgan held the title after turning on and (kayfabe) injuring his tag team championship partner Hernandez. Overall, there have been 51 reigns shared between 53 wrestlers and 36 teams.

The club currently competes in the North West Football League (NWFL). Club history The Burnie Dockers were formed as a result of a merger between former TFL Statewide League club Burnie Hawks (formerly known as Cooee) and NTFL club the Burnie Tigers. After several years of bitter hatred in the city between the two rival clubs, both clubs were struggling both on-field and financially by the early 1990s. In late 1993 the Burnie Hawks absorbed the Burnie Tigers and merged, however the club still played as the Burnie Hawks until, with the arrival of former North Melbourne champion Peter German, the club adopted a new emblem, colours and jumper designed to appease both sides of the divide. From 1995 the Burnie Dockers were successful, making the 1996 and 1997 Grand Finals, but ultimately losing both to Southern powerhouse, Clarence. Shortly after, the Dockers found themselves (like many TFL clubs during the 1990s) in serious financial trouble and facing extinction until a late bailout by the Burnie City Council saved them. The Dockers participated in the Tasmanian Football League until 2000 when it announced it would be pulling out of the fledgling competition, the League therefore folding and the Dockers joined the Northern Tasmanian Football League in 2001. Success was never far away and the Dockers became arguably Tasmanian football's most powerful domestic club during the early part of the 2000s, winning five consecutive NTFL premierships from 2001‚Äì2005. After two lean years, the Dockers bounced back in 2008. Playing in a thrilling NTFL grand final, the Dockers fought tenaciously against the all-conquering Launceston Blues, but fell short by 13 points in front of 5,274 fans at Latrobe. Burnie rejoined the newly re-established Tasmanian State League (TSL) competition in 2009, and has played there since. Since 2015, its reserves team has competed in the North West Football League seniors, and it has also fielded teams in the junior grades of that competition. Burnie Dockers first fielded a women's team in 2013 in the Tasmanian Women's League. The Dockers competed in 3 consecutive grand finals taking out the TWL premierships in 2014 and 2016.

It is the prototype of a type of cataclysmic variable star known as symbiotic variable stars or simply Z Andromedae variables. The brightness of those stars vary over time, showing a quiescent, more stable phase and than an active one with a more pronounced variability and stronger brightening and/or dimming. Binary system Z Andromedae is a binary star. The two components have a circular orbit that takes 759 days to complete. The red giant is around twice the mass of the sun and 880 times its luminosity, but its effective temperature is only 2,800 K. The white dwarf is around a thousand times the luminosity of the sun during the quiescent phase, but up to 10 times more luminous during the active phases. Its temperature is as high as 150,000 K when quiescent, but drops below 100,000 K when active. It also spins around its rotation axis every 1682 seconds and displays a strong magnetic field. The evolved red giant star is losing mass, since radiation pressure overcomes the low gravity on the surface. The outflow of matter is captured by the gravitational field of the white dwarf and falls on its surface in the end. At least during the active phase an accretion disk forms around the white dwarf. Variability Light curve of Z Andromedae, showing a typical outburst in 1986 and the abnormally long active period from 2000 onwards During the quiescent phase, most of the white dwarf luminosity comes from stable hydrogen burning on its surface, and photons emitted this way ionize the wind of the red giant which causes nebular emission. The giant star, however, follows a quasi-periodic activity cycle (similar to the solar cycle) roughly every 7,550 days; when the activity of the star is enhanced, the stellar wind becomes stronger, and in response the white dwarf increases in size and cools, triggering the active phase. In the quiescent phase, the brightness of Z Andromedae is modulated by the orbital period of the system, and can reach a magnitude of mv = 11.3 at minimum. During the active phase Z Andromedae makes luminosity outbursts and can increase its brightness up to a magnitude of mv = 7.7. Eclipses from the red giant are still visible in this phase. During this phase, a shorter periodicity of 685 days is observed; this could be a beat period between the unknown rotation period of the giant star and the orbital period, which arise from the non-spherical outflow of matter from the atmosphere of the giant star. Z Andromedae started an unusually long active phase in September 2000, brightening by several magnitudes multiple times over at least a decade. During the outbursts, irregular brightness variations (up to 0.065 magnitudes) were observed at timescales shorter than a day, interpreted as warping in the accretion disk. If models for this source are correct, it should enter a quiescent phase again in 2020. Spectrum =Optical= The spectrum of Z Andromedae has been recognised as extremely peculiar since the early 20th century. Early spectra during a bright period, showing only emission lines against a red continuum, were interpreted as a star embedded in dense nebulosity. As the star's brightness faded, the spectrum lost the high excitation \\"nebular\\" lines and developed absorption lines with P Cygni profiles. These spectra were readily identified as being due to a hot nova-like star with a cool companion. Emission lines identified included low ionization states of hydrogen and helium with high ionization states of oxygen and iron. The MK spectral classification is typical of a cool giant, for example M4.5. The exact spectral type has been shown to vary, for example between M5 in 1987 and M3.5 in 1989. Infrared observations gave a combination spectral type of M2III + B1eq. Here the luminosity class of III is for a normal giant star, and the peculiarity codes eq indicate emission lines with P Cygni profiles. =Ultraviolet= Z Andromedae shows also a strong ultraviolet emission, which follows the optical behaviour; absorption lines identified during the quiescent phase becomes emission lines during outbursts. Elements identified in this region of the spectrum are carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon in their ionized states. =Radio= The radio flux from Z Andromedae at the beginning of outbursts is lower than the usual quiescent level, and has a maximum after the optical one. After the outbursts, radio jets can be seen flowing out of this system, in a direction perpendicular to the orbital plane. =X-ray= Z Andromedae is much fainter in X-ray, and has not been detected when in the quiescent phase. During outbursts, X-ray emission comes from shock-heated plasma, where the kinetic energy of the outflowing material is converted in X-ray radiation. This emission \\"mimics\\" a blackbody radiation with a temperature different from the one of the white dwarf, but its real nature can be identified because it shows absorption edges (which shows also the presence of neon) and an excess at high frequencies. Bipolar jets Following the 2006 outburst, the hydrogen Balmer emission lines included faint wings at a velocity of ¬±1,150 km/s. Since extended radio outflows had previously been seen during the long 2000-2002 outbursts, collimated jets along the axis of the system were the most likely explanation for this phenomenon. It is thought that the jets are only present during bright outbursts. The jets were observed again during subsequent outbursts; their velocity is highly variable at the beginning but settles on a constant velocity after roughly 1 month. A single jet can also occur. The jets could be formed by material that cannot accrete on the white dwarf that reaches the Eddington limit.

Brunner II (born December 8, 1978) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. Brunner played college basketball for the Georgetown Hoyas and the Southern Idaho Golden Eagles. Early life Bruner was born on December 8, 1978, in Los Angeles California. His father was an alcoholic and his mother was a drug addict so Bruner was raised primarily by his grandmother in Inglewood, California. He first played football but transitioned to basketball at the encouragement of his grandmother. To further develop his potential, Brunner was encouraged to attend Dominguez High School in Compton, California ‚Äì an hour-long bus ride away from his home but where he created a reputation by playing streetball. Bruner was considered the nation's top point guard during his senior season. He committed to play college basketball for the Fresno State Bulldogs but rescinded his offer when the Bulldogs received point shaving allegations in March 1997. College career Brunner began his college career at Georgetown University during the 1997‚Äì98 season. He started all 19 games he played for the Hoyas and averaged 11.2 points, 3.2 rebounds and 7.3 assists; his assist count would have ranked seventh nationally if had played in enough games to qualify. He still holds the Hoyas' career assist average record. In early February 1998, Brunner was held out of the line-up for \\"personal reasons\\". On February 8, 1998, Brunner met with Hoyas head coach John Thompson and quit the team. Brunner flew to Fresno State University and enrolled on the last day of registration for the spring semester. Five weeks after his registration, he was sitting out the semester as a transfer when he and teammate Avondre Jones were indefinitely suspended from the team for the robbery and assault of a Fresno State student with the use of a samurai sword. Brunner denied he was involved; a judge dismissed the charges as an escalation of \\"horsing around\\". On May 24, 1998, Brunner was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery when he allegedly held up Los Angeles City College basketball coach Mike Miller at gunpoint inside the school's gymnasium. Brunner was held in the LA County Jail for four months until the charges were dropped two days before the trial. He enrolled at Santa Monica Junior College but left without playing a game. Brunner transferred to play for the Southern Idaho Golden Eagles for the 1999‚Äì2000 season, where he averaged 14.2 points a game. He signed a letter of intent to play for the Georgia Bulldogs under coach Jim Harrick, but his scholarship offer was overruled by the school's president when his official academic transcripts were not submitted by the deadline. Brunner instead enrolled at Salem International University for the 2000‚Äì01 season but did not play and left to pursue a professional career. Professional career Brunner began his professional career with the San Diego Wildfire of the American Basketball Association and averaged 15.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game. He broke his leg and injured his knee which led to him playing exhibition basketball while he recovered. Brunner toured with the AND1 Live Tour across Europe and Asia in 2003 and 2004 as he earned the nicknames \\"Bad Santa\\" and \\"The Bad One\\". Brunner played professionally in Europe, Mexico and Australia. His final stint was in Australia in 2009 when he tore a ligament in his bone and forced his retirement. Coaching career Brunner served as the Director of Coaching for the Western Port Steelers from 2011 to 2013. He left the team due to family reasons in 2013 but returned as head coach on a three-year deal in 2014. Brunner runs coaching clinics at primary schools in Melbourne, Victoria. Personal life Brunner has three sons.

The movement was aligned with the conservative (that is, pro-Soviet) wing of Estonian Communist Party, and opposed the Estonian independence movement led by the nationalistic Popular Front of Estonia and the liberal wing of the CPE.Employee Ownership and the Political Debate in Estonia 1987-1994. THE ANATOMY OF INDEPENDENCE, Kripta, Tartu, Sankt Petersburg 2004, here The Intermovement was not perceived as an organisation built on nationalist principles but it gathered almost exclusively supporters from ethnic non- Estonians. The main leader of the movement was Jevgeni Kogan (, sometimes transliterated as Evgeny Kogan).Suri endine Interrinde liider Jevgeni Kogan , Postimees 29 March 2007 Kogan was also one of the leaders of the hardline Soyuz faction in the USSR legislature. Other leaders of the Intermovement included Vladimir Jarovoi (, also transliterated as Vladimir Yarovoi), Arnold Sai, Vladimir Lebedev () and economist Konstantin KiknadzeEstonia - Time magazine - November 28, 1988 The Intermovement functioned at factories, mainly, at military plants and those factories that had an all-union importance. A large part of Estonian heavy industry was part of the integrated production chain providing their production to the industries in other Soviet regions. These included e.g. the engine factory Dvigatel, Kalinin's and P√∂√∂gelmann's electrotechnical plant Tondi Elektroonika, and the (especially but not only phosphorite) mining industry in Northern Estonia. It was feared that Estonian independence would lead to the loss of jobs. In fact, after independence the industries were forced to restructure their production and re-orient to new markets, which in most of cases drastically reduced production and forced lay off many people, a large number of whom were Soviet- era immigrants. According to critics, the movement's aim was to protect the conservative Soviet values and make everything possible to block the actions of the Popular Front. According to the former KGB general Oleg Kalugin () it was established in Estonia as also in other parts of the USSR on the initiative of the KGB, as a counterbalance to the Popular Fronts, perceived as nationalist organizations. Despite the stereotyping of the Russophones as an elitist force opposing an Estonian independence movement, the Interfront organizations were mass movements and their membership was made up of people from all walks of life.Estonia: Nation Building And Integration.

Under the new law, former Soviet citizens who had neither held Estonian citizenship nor were descended from citizens (including approximately 500,000 ethnic Russians) were to be regarded foreigners. Some raised concerns that the new foreigners would face possible expulsion from Estonian territory; however, these concerns were not based in fact and in general, Soviet-era non-citizen immigrants were furnished with long-term residence permits. Ostensibly in response to the government's actions, Juri Mi≈°in , also transliterated as Yury Mishin, and a few other former activists of the Intermovement made demands of regional autonomy for Estonia's Russian minority, seeking autonomy of the ethnic Russian dominated areas in North-East Estonia.Aliens in a Land They Call Home - Time magazine - July 19, 1993 Activists held an unconstitutional plebiscite on this matter in the Narva region.Kansalaisuuskiistojen ei uskota viev√§n sijoittajia Virosta - Kauppalehti July 9, 1993 Some raised concerns that the central government might use force to prevent the plebiscite, but these concerns were not based in fact, and it tookplace on July 16‚ÄìJuly 17, 1993.

However, the central government determined the majority of the population did not participate, and demanded the Narva city council, which had provided material support to separatists, to disband. The Intermovement was not built on ethnic principles and had some ethnic Estonian supporters. However, of the 742 delegates attending the first congress on March 5, 1989, only 11 were ethnic Estonian.Toivo Miljan, Historical Dictionary of Estonia, Scarecrow Press, 2004, It was supported by Gustav Naan and Vladimir H√ºtt; Intermovements ranks also included Arnold Sai, Lembit Annus and Valter Toots.The Anatomy of Independence Similar organisations existed in Latvia, Lithuania (called 'Yedinstvo' - 'Unity') and Moldavia.

The Tree of physiology is a Tibetan Thangka depicting human physiology and certain pathological transformations. Epistemology Tibetan medicine had developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and physiology, which was acquired from their long- standing experience with human dissection. Tibetans out of necessity, had long ago adopted the practice of celestial burial (also Sky burial) because of Tibet's harsh terrain in most of the year and deficit of wood for cremation. This form of Sky burial, still practiced, begins with a ritual dissection of the deceased, and then followed by the feeding of the parts to Vultures on the hill tops. Both the location of the ritual dissection and the place of feeding is understood as the charnel ground. Over time, anatomical knowledge found its way into AyurvedaThe Roots of Ayurveda (Penguin Classics) by Various and Dominik Wujastyk (2003) and to an Iesser extent into China.

After the invention of the halftone screen in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch plates. Presensitized plates appeared in the 1950s, and wipe‚Äìon plates appeared in the 1960s. By the mid-1960s research on screenless lithography had successfully developed in Europe to the stage where continuous-tone plates could be manufactured for use with positive film images. Researchers discovered that under certain conditions the combination of fine plate grain and the newly developed plate coatings produced a plate capable of holding nearly all of the tones from a continuous-tone positive. Commercial use of this plate has not flourished; today it is still in limited use, primarily because the continuous‚Äìtone printing plate technology is expensive and necessitates stringent quality control. Since the late 1960s artists and printers have been experimenting with these new plates, using photomechanical film and handmade positives made from thin translucent or transparent plastic sheets and a variety of drawing and painting materials. Screenless lithography has been incorrectly referred to as diazo plate lithography and Mylar lithography.

Kennedy assassination.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"John K. Lattimer, Urologist of Varied Expertise, Dies at 92\\", The New York Times, May 13, 2007. Accessed May 13, 2007. Dr. Lattimer studied at Columbia University and became the urologist-in-chief of Presbyterian Hospital and chairman of the urology department at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University for 25 years.AP Obituary, published in the International Herald Tribune He wrote 375 papers helping to establish pediatric urology as a field and is credited with developing a cure for renal tuberculosis. US Army doctor, World War II During World War II, Dr. Lattimer served as an army physician and treated D-Day casualties in the field. Lattimer was attached to General George Smith Patton's Third Army and participated in Patton's drive across France. Lattimer frequently related a story where, on the occasion of Patton's first crossing of the Rhine River, he observed the General stop in the middle of a bridge and urinate over the side into the river. Lattimer was assigned to the prisoner's barracks at Nuremberg in the spring of 1945, where notorious inmates like Hermann G√∂ring were housed during their war crimes trial. Lattimer served as general medical officer during the Nuremberg Trials, attending to the medical needs of the war crimes defendants. Lattimer was on hand at Nuremberg prison to view G√∂ring's body just after G√∂ring had committed suicide in his prison cell by biting a cyanide capsule that he had kept concealed in a jar of medicinal cream. Lattimer retired having attained the rank of colonelhttp://columbiaurology.org/about-us/our-history-0 Biography of Nazi leaders In 1999, Lattimer wrote Hitler's Fatal Sickness and Other Secrets of the Nazi LeadersHitlers Fatal Sickness and Other Secrets of the Nazi Leaders by John K. Lattimer at Amazon.com based largely on this experience. In this book he theorized that Hitler exhibited the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which he demonstrates with examples of his deteriorating signature and photographs of Hitler clutching objects to prevent his hand from trembling. Lattimer further proposed that Hitler's discovery of his illness was a factor in postponing Germany's attack on Britain in late 1940 and directing his attention towards Russia. Innovator in Urology at Columbia- Presbyterian After the war, Lattimer spent most of the rest of his life teaching at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he was a professor and became chairman of the urology department of Presbyterian Hospital from 1955 to 1980. At the Hospital, which in 1998 became NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian, the head of the Department is known as the John K. Lattimer Professor of Urology. His patients included Katharine Hepburn, Charles Lindbergh, Dmitri Shostakovich, Itzhak Perlman and Greta Garbo. Investigator into Kennedy assassination The Kennedy family chose him in 1972 as the first nongovernmental expert to examine evidence taken at Kennedy's autopsy. Lattimer performed ballistic tests and other research to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald was likely the sniper who shot and killed President John F. Kennedy from the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas. Lattimer frequently performed a demonstration of Oswald's shooting, firing three well-aimed shots within 8.3 seconds with a 6.5√ó52mm Italian Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle, the same as Oswald's actual weapon and under the same firing conditions. By doing so Lattimer intended to prove that Oswald could have performed such a feat. He continued to perform this demonstration well into his late 80s. Lattimer owned Oswald's Marine shooting record which he said showed that Oswald was an excellent shot. In 1980, Dr. Lattimer wrote a book: Kennedy and Lincoln: Medical & Ballistic Comparisons of Their AssassinationsKennedy and Lincoln: Medical and Ballistic Comparisons of Their Assassinations by John K. Lattimer at Amazon.com in which he did an investigation of both the Lincoln and the Kennedy assassinations, and supported the findings of the Warren Commission. In his book, Lattimer theorized that President Kennedy's arms exhibited the \\"Thorburn Position\\" with elbows extended and arms folded inward, as a neurological reaction to the bullet wound to his spine. Collector of military artifacts Lattimer resided in Englewood, New Jersey.Davis, Tom. \\"Dr. John K. Lattimer, at 92; 'ambassador for medicine'\\", The Record (Bergen County), May 13, 2007. Accessed May 13, 2007. His 30-room Englewood home contained an extensive collection of military paraphernalia, including \\"medieval armor, Revolutionary and Civil War rifles and swords, a pile of cannonballs, World War II machine guns, German Lugers, and drawings by Adolf Hitler. Lattimer stole personal items from several of the Nuremberg defendants, such as Hermann G√∂ring's underwear and his Luftwaffe ring. Lattimer was the owner of several grisly historical artifacts including one of the two cyanide capsules that G√∂ring smuggled into his Nuremberg prison (G√∂ring used the other capsule to commit suicide minutes before he was to be executed), a blood-stained collar that President Lincoln wore to Ford's Theater the night he was shot, and a medically preserved section of penile tissue which Lattimer said belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte.

Its premiere was on Monday, July 23, 2007. Wendi Nix serves as the lead host, and it also features ESPN college football analysts Kirk Herbstreit, Paul Finebaum, David Pollack, Trevor Matich and others. College Football Live also features Live interviews with college coaches and players. Format As previous host Rece Davis mentioned in the opening of the debut, College Football Live aims to be the most fan- interactive show on television, featuring email questions and video segments sent in by fans on every show. After the opening music and graphics, the show shifts into the ESPN side studio and Davis and the analysts open the show debating a top story of the day. After their segment has completed, they send it to Joe Schad or another insider on the situation who gives their take on it and breaks other information. Then, the segment \\"Live Feedback\\" takes place and questions sent in by viewers are answered by the personalities. After this segment, there are two rotating blocks, which on some days are two interviews but on other days, could be debate, highlights or breaking news. At some point during the broadcast, the segment \\"EA Sports Simulator\\" is shown. In this segment, a key game is simulated on the video game NCAA Football 08 and highlights and score are shown. After this, a short debate segment is held before the closing segment \\"Extra Points\\" which is the same as \\"Live feedback\\" except done with a timer. As Rece Davis' trademark opening line he says \\"and here's (random college mascot) to give me the new questions\\". The show is supposed to be the college version of NFL Live, but is actually more similar to NASCAR Now in that it focuses more on guests and debate than breaking news.

It stretches from Tarpon Springs in the north to St. Petersburg in the south, passing through the towns of Palm Harbor, Dunedin, Belleair, Clearwater, Largo, Seminole, South Pasadena, and Gulfport. It is utilized for walking, jogging, and cycling. Some trail users are able to commute to work using the Pinellas Trail instead of a motor vehicle. The distance that the main trail currently covers is . The Pinellas Trail was named after Fred Marquis, a former Pinellas County Administrator who served from 1979 until 2000. History Street crossing with signage View of Boca Ciega Bay The Atlantic Coast Line (ACL) and the Seaboard Air Line (SAL) railroads both served St. Petersburg and Clearwater for many years. They merged in 1967 to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL), which consolidated the existing infrastructure. After the SCL joined CSX Transportation in the 1980s, of trackage in Pinellas County was abandoned, and purchased by the Florida Department of Transportation. After voter approval, the County acquired the property and began construction of the Pinellas Trail. The first opened in December 1990, linking John S. Taylor Park in Largo to Seminole City Park in Seminole. With the passage of the first Penny for Pinellas one-cent local option sales tax, plans were made to construct additional segments along the former railroad corridor. The Pinellas Trail is composed of the following railroad segments: *Former Orange Belt Railway (later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) from Tarpon Springs to Clearwater *Former Tampa and Gulf Coast Railroad (later Seaboard Air Line Railroad) from Clearwater to St. Petersburg Future As of June 2022, the Pinellas Trail Loop will extend to in length. Currently (October 2020) of the eventual of the Pinellas Trail Loop (including the Pinellas Trail itself and connecting trails) circling Pinellas County are complete. Hazards Unlike most rail trails that traverse rural countrysides, the Pinellas Trail travels through several very urban areas. When traveling through some of the neighborhoods in sections of St. Petersburg and Tarpon Springs, trail users are encouraged to be cautious. In Clearwater, the same warning applies; trail users may have the right-of-way in areas with minimal vehicular traffic, but they do not when the trail crosses a major artery such as State Road 60.

English Pouters, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants from the rock pigeon. A breed with an enlarged crop, their distinctiveness was described by Charles Darwin in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication (1868). History William Bernhardt Tegetmeier proposed that the English Pouter originated from cross breeding the old pigeon breeds the Dutch Cropper, Uploper and the Parisian Pouter. Each of these breeds is described in works dating from the 17th century. However, in an earlier account, John Moore suggested that the breed was the result of cross breeding between a type of cropper and horseman (both 18th century pigeon types). Historically, the English Pouter was also called the Pouting Horseman, due to the links with the Horseman breed. The modern breeds of croppers, such as the Norwich Cropper, originate from the English Pouter. Charles Darwin described the English Pouter in his 1868 work The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, saying that the breed was \\"perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons\\". Description As with all breeds of domesticated pigeons, the English Pouter is descended from the rock pigeon (Columba livia), and has been developed over years through selective breeding of individuals with specific characteristics. It is a breed of fancy pigeon, that being a type of pigeon kept by pigeon fanciers as part of the fancy pigeon group as opposed to Flying/Sporting Pigeons or Utility pigeons. The Pouter is long limbed with an enlarged crop, and overall a large body.

Carriers, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants of the rock pigeon (Columba livia). They have a long slender body, with a long neck in proportion to the rest of the body, and distinctive features including a rounded hard wattle. History The breed was developed in England from a combination of non- European breeds, including the Persian and Baghdad carriers, and the pouter. The largest of the flying pigeon breeds, the Old English Carrier was originally used for sending messages. By the mid 19th century, the points in the standard of the English Carrier were deemed to have been achieved, and the breed was praised for its \\"perfectness to which all the points most admired have been brought\\". At this point the colors of the breed were limited to black, white and dun (a brownish grey color). Today, the English Carrier is strictly a show pigeon, and is not the modern homing pigeon. This modern homing pigeon is a breed known as a Racing Homer, a breed which was bred from eight different pigeon breeds including the English Carrier. Description The skull of the English Carrier (c) compared with other types of pigeon Charles Darwin wrote of the Carrier in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, \\"This is a fine bird, of large size, close feathered, generally dark-coloured, with an elongated neck\\". Darwin compared the dimensions of the breed to the rock pigeon, showing the length of the Carrier to be nearly double that of the rock pigeon. It was also found that the English Carrier could open its mouth wider than the rock pigeon, as compared to . The English Carrier is typically about in height, with a long, slender body. The breast bone should be straight and long, as should the back which should slope towards the rump. They have a slender neck which should appear long in proportion to the rest of the bird and the legs should be solid, with no feathering below the knees. The English Carrier has typically deep red eyes, and a distinctive wattle which should be large but firm with a rounded shape and a powdery white finish on the surface. The beak is long and thick, and is of the type known as a box beak. The National English Carrier Club standard states that ideally the distance from the pupil of the eye to the tip of the beak should be not less than in females, and in males of the breed.

Kae was 6 feet 2 inches tall. Early years and career Kae was born Katherine Ruth Sumner on May 19, 1916, as the only child of Roy Calvin Sumner and Ada (Frasier) Sumner in Oakland, California. The family moved a number of times, living in Riverside, Pasadena, and San Diego. An accomplished artist, by 1938 Kae was employed by Walt Disney Studio in the Ink & Paint and Special Effects departments. Her work included painting dwarfs for the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film). During her lifetime she worked in six studios, including the Popeye studio, and also worked with the War Department during World War II. The tall club movement Kae had long had trouble with knocking her knees under desks, and in cafeterias and buses. By 1938 she had had enough. Friends recall Kae uttering, \\"There ought to be a club for tall people.\\" On impulse she approached E.V. Durling, a columnist at the Los Angeles Times, with an article about the problems of being tall. She then spoke to Editor-in-Chief Robert White, who was very receptive to her and suggested she proceed with the article. On March 20, 1938 a two-page article penned and illustrated by Kae appeared in the Times Sunday Magazine under the name Kae Krysler. Kae ended the article asking area tall people to contact her, and perhaps get together to discuss the problems of being tall. On May 1, 1938, Kae met with eight other tall people who responded to the article, and by the end of the evening, they had formed the \\"Longfellows Club\\", which later became the California Tip Toppers Club (CTTC), North America's first club for tall people. It is the oldest still existing Tall Club in the world (see above). Subsequent publicity spread the idea of tall clubs; in 1939 the Greater Kansas City Skyliners club was formed. In the June 24, 1940 issue of Life Magazine, an article entitled Life Goes to a Tip Toppers Party appeared, and tall clubs started appearing from coast to coast. Kae was invited to appear on the November 8, 1940 broadcast of Ripley's Believe It Or Not! show. Mr. Ripley challenged Kae to produce a New York Tip Toppers club; three days later, Ripley's audience included two rows of tip toppers (later called the New York Stratoliners). The New York Tip Toppers Club was formed in April 1939 by George Mann (6'4\\") of the Barto and Mann comedic dance act then performing with Hellzapoppin. The Club was patterned on the California Tip Toppers Club. The clubs 'grew' rapidly following World War II. In 1945 there were 60 clubs in the United States and Canada. Beginning July 17, 1947 the first convention of tall clubs was held in Hollywood, California hosted by CTTC; fifteen clubs from around the United States and Canada were in attendance: * California Tip Toppers Club * Greater Kansas City Skyliners * Pittsburgh Tip Toppers * New York Stratoliners * Paramount Tall Club of Chicago * Tall Girl's Club of Chicago * Tower Club of Philadelphia * New Jersey Tip Topper Club * Texas Tip Toppers of Dallas * Golden Gate Tip Toppers * Skyscrapers Club of Cleveland * Vancouver Tip Toppers Club * St. Louis Tip Toppers * Houston Higher Ups * Seattle Timberliners Miss Tip Topper of 1947 was also crowned from among the various club queens in attendance. This became the initial basis for the American Affiliation of Tall Clubs (AATC). By 1966 the affiliation had grown to the point where a new name was needed; the name \\"Tall Clubs International and Miss Tall Universe\\" was unanimously adopted by the delegates; incorporation occurred by 1967. The name was amended in 1974 to become \\"Tall Clubs International and Miss Tall International, Incorporated\\". The development of tall furnishings was one major goal of the members. They wrote letters, made many phone calls, and visited business to encourage them to lower the cost of custom-made items. From that goal, the King Size Mattress was created. Kae stayed active in the tall clubs and TCI from their inception, and attended most of the conventions through the rest of her life. As of 1989 more than 200 tall clubs were in operation in the US and Canada, though not all at the same time. Tall Club International (TCI) consists of 54 member clubs. There are tall clubs in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland which have not affiliated with TCI because their minimum height requirements vary from TCI's standards of 5'10\\" for women and 6'2\\" for men measured in stocking feet. Later years George W. Einfeldt met Kae via the California Tip Toppers Club; they were married in 1948, and later adopted a daughter Sherri-Lynn. George died in 1968. In the night of September 27, 1996, Kae died in her sleep at the Pacific Coast Manor nursing home in Capitola, California. Kae is survived by a granddaughter, Brandi.

Despite having experienced success early in life, Nichols' writing career did not flourish. Her last published novel was historical fiction, \\"What Dangers Deep\\", set in the Elizabethan era and was poorly received as it was outside her genre of children's literature.

They originated in Tunisia (Africa), and were imported into England during the 19th century. The breed is known for its short beak, which gives the breed the \\"Owl\\" name due to the size and shape. Description An African Owl, as published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication by Charles Darwin in 1868 A breed of fancy pigeon developed by selective breeding, it has descended from the rock dove as with other types of domesticated pigeons; it is thought to have first been brought into Europe from Tunis, Africa, where the type originated and were first imported into England in the late 19th century. They were originally referred to as \\"Foreign Owls\\", as a similar type of pigeon had already been known in England, which upon the importation of the African Owl became known as the \\"English Owl\\". The main difference between the two types of owl was that the African or \\"Foreign\\" variety was noticeably smaller. As with other types of \\"owl\\" pigeons, the African Owl has a crest of feathers running down the front of its breast, which is called the jabot, also known as a tie or cravat. The body of an African Owl is short and plump, and the head is smooth and unadorned with rough feathers. The beak of this breed is short and stout, and it is this beak which gives the Owl type their name, being turned down in shape. Lewis Wright wrote in The Practical Pigeon Keeper of the delicate nature of these types of pigeons; \\"Foreign Owls require to have their lofts well ventilated, yet perfectly free from damp and draught, else they die by dozens: in fact, they are at the best exceedingly delicate birds.\\"  See also  *List of pigeon breeds References External links *American Owl Club African Owl Category:Birds of North Africa Category:Animal breeds originating in Tunisia ","title":"African Owl pigeon"},{"id":"11215874","text":"The English Short-faced TumblerEE-List of the breeds of fancy pigeons (ELFP) by the Section for Fancy pigeons of the European Association of Poultry-, Pigeon- and Rabbit-breeders, Revision 11; June 2012 is a breed of fancy pigeon developed over many years of selective breeding.

Pielsticker in Tulsa, Oklahoma. J. Paul Getty acquired control of the company during the 1930s. It became defunct when fully absorbed by Getty Oil Company in 1974, and the disused Skelly brand logo was revived by Nimmons-Joliet Development Corp. in 2012. History =Founding= Bill Skelly (1878‚Äì1957) came to Oklahoma from Pennsylvania in about 1913 where he worked as a mule skinner and tool dresser in the oil fields around Ardmore and Duncan, Oklahoma, prior to partnering with Jack Sanky to form Skelly Sanky Oil Company in Duncan, Oklahoma in 1915. An advertisement in The Pittsburgh Press on January 4, 1922, stated that Skelly Oil Company was formed to take over the oil properties of Skelly and of the Skelly Sanky company. Chesley Coleman Herndon was a practicing attorney in Tulsa when he won several court victories against William Skelly involving oil leases on Osage Indian land. Skelly summoned Herndon to his office for a meeting after his final loss in court, and shortly thereafter, the two unlikely allies, along with Fred Pielsticker, the son of German immigrants who was orphaned at age twelve and became a renowned engineer, would form Skelly Oil Company. Herndon was the son of Captain Thomas Herndon, a Civil War veteran who oversaw a family fortune in real estate, tobacco and banking in Tennessee. Captain Herndon's cousin William Herndon was Abraham Lincoln's law partner in Illinois. For the next 37 years, Skelly and Herndon held the number one and two positions in the company, and are buried 25 feet apart in Tulsa's Rose Hill Mausoleum, the same distance as their desks for almost half a century. A 1932 Fortune Magazine article stated that \\"Skelly Oil Company is a great success because of the different temperaments of its top executives... in this company, William Skelly is the accelerator and Chesley Herndon is the brake.\\" =Growth= The company entered into the refining business by purchasing the Midland Refining Company in El Dorado, Kansas, in 1922. Throughout much of its history, Skelly was a popular gasoline marketer throughout the Midwestern United States and was a market leader in several cities throughout its marketing area including Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Wichita, Topeka, Omaha, Des Moines, Minneapolis/Saint Paul and other cities. Skelly's branded products included Skelly Skeltane, Regular, 50-50, Special, Keotane and Powermax gasolines; Skelly Supreme, Tagolene, Skelmark and Ranger motor oils; and Skelgas propane products through Skelgas franchised stores. What may have been unique to Skelly, beginning in the late 1950s it offered its female customers a Ladies Credit Card in a shade of light blue. Skelly Oil Company grew to become a major oil company known for its exploration and production expertise as well as the capabilities of its refineries and manufacturing facilities in conjunction with its well- established marketing and distribution network. Skelly Oil Company was an early leader in offshore drilling and production ranging from Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico to the Persian Gulf with a foreign presence in Canada, Argentina, Australia, Korea, Libya, Iran, and Mozambique. In addition to its E&P; and refining divisions, Skelly Oil Company also had well-established chemical, manufacturing, engineering, and research divisions. It was an early pioneer of LPG products and building upon its base of substantial uranium ore reserves, established a role in conversion and fuel fabrication and in recovery and reprocessing for the fledgling nuclear power industry. Skelly was among the leading oil companies to develop a network of truck stops along major highways including the interstate during the 1950s and 1960s. Skelly also had a contract to sell gasoline at most locations of the now-defunct Nickerson Farms restaurant chain during the 1960s and 1970s, which was similar to Texaco's arrangement with Stuckey's.  Arts sponsorship  The company was well known as a sponsor of the radio drama series The Air Adventures of Jimmie Allen and Captain Midnight. Skelly also sponsored Alex Dreier news broadcasts on ABC radio from Chicago in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Getty takeover  Skelly Building in Tulsa, OK. Demolished by Tulsa World for a parking lot.William Skelly lost control of the company to J. Paul Getty in the 1930s, and the Great Depression put Skelly in a financial strain. To reduce the payroll, the company transferred some of its employees to Tidewater Associated Oil Company, which was controlled by J. Paul Getty and his mother, Sarah C. Getty. In the late 1930s these employees were transferred back to Skelly. The Gettys made a cash loan to Skelly Oil, and the company treasury held stock, and some of Mr. Skelly's stock was given as collateral for the loan. When the company was unable to repay the loan when it became due, the stock was transferred to Mission Corporation, a holding company of the Getty's that also controlled Tidewater. Skelly remained as CEO until his death in 1957, and Herndon remained executive vice president until his own death. Thereafter, Skelly executives remained as CEOs for another two decades. In the late 1960s Tidewater became Getty Oil Company. Skelly Oil was eventually merged into Getty Oil in 1977 and the Skelly brand (and associated brands) were discontinued. Many former Skelly gas stations were rebranded to Getty, then to Texaco after Getty was acquired by Texaco in 1984.  Revival  In 2012, Nimmons-Joliet Development Corp. acquired the rights to the Skelly brand logo and commenced operation of a new company utilizing the Skelly brand logo as a privately held company based in Texas.

Smith's Castle is one of the oldest houses in the state. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 as Cocumscussoc Archeological Site, due to the artifacts and information digs in the vicinity have yielded. It is located just off U.S. 1. History Smith's Castle was built in 1678 as a replacement for an earlier structure which was destroyed by the Narragansett Tribe during King Philip's War. The land on which the house was built was known as Cocumscussoc (or Cocumscossoc) and near the original site of Roger Williams' trading post. Williams was the founder of Rhode Island and a prominent Baptist theologian. He built the trading post on the site in 1637 to trade with the Narragansetts after receiving the land from the tribe. Eventually, Williams sold the trading post to Richard Smith to finance his trip to Great Britain to secure a charter for Rhode Island. Smith bought the trading post and surrounding lands from Williams and constructed a large house which was fortified, giving the house its nickname as a castle. His son Richard Smith Jr. inherited the plantation in 1666 and invited militias from Massachusetts and Connecticut to use the property during King Philip's War. The house was burned in retaliation for the Great Swamp Fight, and the present structure was built in its place, originally as a saltbox house, and later modified into its current form. Approximately 40 soldiers were buried on the property during King Philip's War. Additionally, the only incident of an individual being hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason on American soil took place at Smith's Castle in 1676. Joshua Tefft, an English colonist found guilty of having fought on the side of the Narragansetts during the Great Swamp Fight, was executed by this method. Eventually, the property was transferred to the Updike, Congdon, and Fox families. Among the Updikes who lived there were Lodowick and Abigail Updike,Geake, Robert A. \\"The Narragansett at Cocumscussoc\\".

In the early twentieth century, preservationists Norman Isham and John Hutchins Cady stabilized the house and performed several minor restorations. A slab table belonging to Lodowick Updike is currently in the Newport Restoration Foundation in Newport, Rhode Island. The table was possibly made by John Goddard in the 1760s at Goddard and Townsend.

Three years later, in 1682, the 5th Dalai Lama died. However, his demise was kept secret until 1696-97, and the desi governed Tibet. From 1679 to 1684, the Ganden Phodrang fought in the Tibet‚ÄìLadakh‚ÄìMughal War against the Namgyal dynasty of neighboring Ladakh. Desi Sangye Gyatso and the King Delek Namgyal of Ladakh agreed on the Treaty of Tingmosgang in the fortress of Tingmosgang at the conclusion of the war in 1684. The original text of the Treaty of Tingmosgang no longer survives, but its contents are summarized in the Ladakh Chronicles. He entertained close contacts with Galdan Boshugtu Khan, the ruler of the emerging Dzungar Khanate of Inner Asia, with the aim of countering the role of the Khoshut Mongols in Tibetan affairs. The Khoshut khans had functioned as protector-rulers of Tibet since 1642 but their influence had been on the wane since 1655. The supposed reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was born in 1683 and discovered two years later. He was secretly educated in Nankhartse while Sangye Gyatso proceeded to hide the death of his master. It was only in 1697 that the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was installed.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A political history. Yale 1967, pp. 125-8. This evoked great irritation from the Qing Kangxi Emperor who had been kept in the dark about the matter, and furthermore was an enemy of the Dzungar rulers. Meanwhile, a new and ambitious Khoshut ruler came to power, Lha-bzang Khan. The murder of the desi The Sixth Dalai Lama turned out to be a talented but boisterous young man who preferred poetry-writing and the company of young women to monastic life. In 1702 he renounced his monastic vows and returned to lay status but retained his temporal authority. In the next year, Sangye Gyatso formally turned over the regent title to his son, Ngawang Rinchen, but in fact kept the executive powers. Now, a rift emerged within the Tibetan elite. Lha-bzang Khan was a man of character and energy who was not content with the effaced state in which the Khoshut royal power had sunk. He set about to change this, probably after an attempt by Sangye Gyatso to poison the king and his chief minister. Matters came to their head during the Monlam Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1705, which followed the Losar (New Year). During a grand meeting with the clergy, Sangye Gyatso proposed to seize and execute Lha-bzang Khan. This was opposed by the cleric Jamyang Zh√©pa from Drepung Monastery, the personal guru of Lha-bzang. Rather, the khan was strongly recommended to leave for Amdo, the usual abode of the Khoshut elite. He pretended to comply and started his journey to the north. However, when Lha- bzang Khan reached the banks of the Nagchu River northeast of √ú-Tsang, he halted and began to gather the Khoshut tribesmen. In the summer of 1705 he marched on Lhasa and divided his troops in three columns, one under his wife Tsering Tashi. When Sangye Gyatso heard about this he gathered the troops of √ú-Tsang, Ngari and Kham close to Lhasa. He offered battle but was badly defeated with the loss of 400 men. The Lobsang Yeshe, 5th Panchen Lama tried to mediate. Realizing that his situation was hopeless, Sangye Gyatso gave up resistance on condition that he was spared and was sent to Gonggar Dzong west of Lhasa. However, the vengeful Queen Tsering Tashi arrested the ex-desi and brought him to the T√∂lung Valley, where he was killed, probably on 6 September 1705.Luciano Petech, China and Tibet in the early 18th century.

It is one of the first volume-produced low-profile tires. Although technologically advanced, and reasonably successful, the tire's requirement for a non-standard rim ultimately condemned it to a relatively short commercial life. It has thus been called the \\"Betamax of the tire industry.\\" Background and development As passenger car performance increased during the 1970s, the need arose for improved tire capability. One of the possibilities was to reduce sidewall height, low sidewalls being common at the time on crossply racing tires, but not usual for the better-performing radial tire.Pirelli 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure. The problem was that reducing sidewall height compromised tire comfort, in part due to the roadwheel rim profile used. Michelin therefore decided to introduce the world's first tire and roadwheel system, where the two were designed together.For the first time, the tyre and its rim complemented one another perfectly, working as a single unit. The rim underwent a fundamental transformation, the essential characteristic of which was a flatter, lower flange. This new design of the rim and tyre bead resulted in a gradual curvature of the casing, without the \\"5\\" shaped flexing inherent in traditional designs. This would enable both lower sidewall height, (for better roadholding) whilst retaining comfort due to better stress distribution within the tire, enabled by the redesigned wheel rim and tire bead. The \\"TR\\" was for \\"tension r√©partie\\", since tire stresses were better balanced in the new design, whilst the \\"X\\" was a reference to previous Michelin products such as the famous \\"X\\" radial. TRX tires thus require the use of wheels that were specially designed for them; standard tires do not fit TRX wheels and vice versa. To avoid potentially dangerous confusion, Michelin used metric sizes for TRX roadwheels instead of the standard imperial wheel size (normally stated in inches). Usage Renault Alpine A310 V6 with TRX tires 1995 BMW 525i Sport with TRX tires TRX tires were available either as standard or optional equipment on certain models of European makes such as BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Citro√´n, Peugeot, Ford, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Renault, and SAAB. They were also available on certain models of the Ford Mustang, Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Capri, Mercury Cougar, and Mercury Lynx during the 1980s. Although most TRX tires were produced by Michelin, a few sizes were made by Avon, Continental, Goodyear (mainly for the American market) and Dunlop. Dunlop fitted their version of the TRX tire as standard equipment on Austin Montegos and Austin Mini Metros.

Does not include North American vehicles. Other sizes were available, for instance 160/65 R 315. Decline Although the tire gave good performance, and thus as noted above gained favour with some OEMs, its non-standard dimensions proved problematic in the aftermarket. It was also a notoriously hard tire to remove when using basic tools, a consequence of the deliberately designed strong fit between tire bead and rim. Rival manufacturers, such as Dunlop, thus produced replacement wheels and tires for popular cars, specifically for high- performance or winter conditions. In due course advances in tire technology caught up with the TRX line, enabling similar performance and greater convenience at lower cost. TRX tires are now produced only as ‚Äúyoung-timer‚Äù replacements for vehicles which were originally fitted with them. Michelin Classic still has these tires in catalogue. Also, Coker Tire is the USA dealer for Michelin classic and currently (February 2014) sells 14 sizes of TRX tires. New TRX tyres are being produced by Michelin and can be bought through Longstone Tyres in the UK.

Born in Motherwell, he signed for London club Chelsea as a 15-year-old whilst on holiday in the city. Boyle was one of the lesser-known, but nevertheless important, members of the successful Chelsea side of the period, usually playing in the midfield ball-winner role. He made his Chelsea debut in a League Cup semi-final against Aston Villa and ultimately picked up a winners' medal in that competition the same year after playing in Chelsea's two-legged final victory over Leicester City. He played in Chelsea's FA Cup final loss to Tottenham Hotspur two years later but missed out due to injury when they won their FA Cup final against Leeds United in 1970. He made amends the following season, playing in both matches of Chelsea's successful Cup Winners' Cup final against Real Madrid in Athens. Boyle spent two months on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion before leaving Chelsea in December 1973 to sign for Orient. He then joined the North American Soccer League expansion side Tampa Bay Rowdies in February 1975 just ahead of their indoor campaign. He captained Tampa Bay to a runner-up finish in the 1975 NASL Indoor tournament in March, and in August to victory in Soccer Bowl '75. Boyle retired in late 1975 and later had a brief spell coaching the Rowdies in 1977 after Eddie Firmani abruptly resigned from the post. In 1980‚Äì81 he appeared in five additional matches for Phoenix Inferno of the MISL.

Formed as Ogdensburg Aeroway Corp in 1920 in Ogdensburg, New York by Thomas Huff and Elliot Daland, its name was quickly changed to Huff-Daland Aero Corp and then in 1925 it was changed again to Huff-Daland Aero Company with its main headquarters in Bristol, Pennsylvania. Huff-Daland produced a series of biplanes as trainers, observation planes, and light bombers for the U.S. Army and Navy. From 1923-1924, Huff-Daland developed the first aircraft designed for crop dusting and began selling and promoting the new service through a subsidiary Huff Daland Dusters founded on March 2, 1925. Though acquisitions beginning in 1928, the dusting subsidiary became a founding component of Delta Air Lines. In 1927, the corporation was taken over by Hayden, Stone & Company, a New York City brokerage firm and in the course of the merger it became the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Aircraft Corporation. A single example of the Huff- Daland XB-1 bomber became the Keystone XB-1B, after its original Packard 2A-1500 engines were replaced with Curtiss V-1570-5 \\"Conqueror\\" engines. The Improved -B aircraft had better performance than the original, but still didn't compare favorably to the other aircraft of the period and never entered production.

After starting his musical career in New Orleans, he had a successful career in music in New York City for decades. Biography Parenti was a childhood musical prodigy, first on violin, then on clarinet. As a child he substituted for Alcide Nunez in Papa Jack Laine's band. In New Orleans he also worked with Johnny Dedroit. During his early teens Parenti worked with the Nick LaRocca band, among other local acts. Parenti led his own band in New Orleans in the mid-1920s, making his first recordings there, before moving to New York City at the end of the decade. In the late 1920s, Parenti worked with Benny Goodman and Fred Rich, and later in the decade moved to New York City full-time where he worked through the 1930s as a CBS staffman and as a member of the Radio City Symphony Orchestra. From 1939-1945 Parenti, with Ted Lewis's band, played alongside Muggsy Spanier. In 1944, he recorded and appeared in concert with Sidney Bechet and Max Miller in Chicago. In the 1940s and still in New York City, Parenti formed a Dixieland jazz band called Tony Parenti and His New Orleanians, and which featured Wild Bill Davison, Art Hodes and Jimmy Archey, among others. He often appeared at such New York jazz spots as Nick's and Jimmy Ryan‚Äôs, and also worked with Eddie Condon.

It was fought near the villages of Kingston and West Kingston in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The combined force of the New England militia included 150 Pequots, and they inflicted a huge number of Narragansett casualties, including many hundred women and children. The battle has been described as \\"one of the most brutal and lopsided military encounters in all of New England's history.\\" Since the 1930s, Narragansett and Wampanoag people commemorate the battle annually in a ceremony initiated by Narragansett- Wampanoag scholar Princess Red Wing. Historical context The Pokanoket Indians had helped the original pilgrim settlers to survive,Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick under the leadership of Massasoit. His sons Wamsutta and Metacom took on the English names of Alexander and Philip, respectively. Alexander became sachem of the Pokanokets on the death of his father, but he died within a year and Philip succeeded him in 1662. Philip began laying plans to attack the colonists in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and he slowly built a confederation of neighboring Indian tribes. He also gathered muskets and gunpowder for the eventual attack, but only in small numbers in order that the colonists would not be alarmed.http://burnpit.us/2012/12/great- swamp-fight-colonial-militia-assault-indian-stronghold Several Wampanoag men attacked and killed colonists in Swansea, Massachusetts, on June 20, 1675, and that began King Philip's War. The Indians laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. A full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area on June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See Old Style and New Style dates),Moon Eclipse calculation Accessed December 22, 2011 and various tribes looked at it as a good omen for attacking the colonists.Leach, Douglas Edward; Flintlock and Tomahawk; p. 46; Parnassus Imprints, East Orleans, Massachusetts; 1954; Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition which destroyed the Wampanoag town at Mount Hope in Bristol, Rhode Island. The Indians waged attacks on settlements in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but Rhode Island was spared at the beginning, as the Narragansetts remained officially neutral.http://minerdescent.com/2011/11/19/great-swamp-fight/ In October, the Indians struck again with raids on the towns of Hatfield, Northampton, and Springfield, where almost the entire settlement was burned to the ground. As winter set in, the attacks diminished. On November 2, 1675, Josiah Winslow led a combined force of over 1,000 colonial militia, including about 150 Pequot and Mohegan Indians, against the Narragansetts living around Narragansett Bay. The Narragansett tribe had not yet been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of King Philip's men, women, and children, and several of their warriors had participated in Indian raiding parties.David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (St. Martins Press, New York, 2002) p. 205-206 The colonists distrusted the Narragansetts and feared that the tribe would join King Philip's cause in the spring, which caused great concern due to the tribe's location. The militia burned several abandoned Narragansett villages as they marched around Narragansett Bay, as the tribe had retreated to a large fort in the center of the Great Swamp near Kingston, Rhode Island. \\"Philip. King of Mount Hope\\", caricature by Paul Revere, illustration from the 1772 edition of Benjamin Church's \\"The Entertaining History of King Philip's War\\" There was one colonist who fought on the Indian side of the battle. Records indicate that Joshua Tefft wounded Captain Nathaniel Seely of Connecticut (son of Captain Robert Seeley), who subsequently died. An Indian spy reported that Tefft \\"did them good service & killed & wounded 5 or 6 English in that fight & before they would trust him he had killed a miller an English man at Narragansett and brought his scalpe to them.\\" http://www.westernrihistory.org/uploads/6/5/0/9/6509445/western_ri_newsletter_8-11.pdf  Battle  On December 15, 1675, Narraganset warriors attacked the Jireh Bull Blockhouse and killed at least 15 people. 15-year-old James Eldred escaped from the blockhouse and was pursued a considerable distance; he survived having a tomahawk thrown at him at close range and a hand-to-hand encounter with a Narraganset warrior. This occurred along Indian Run Brook in Wakefield-Peacedale, Rhode Island. Four days later, the Great Swamp Battle took place on the bitterly cold and stormy day of December 19, 1675. The colonial militia from Plymouth Colony, Connecticut Colony, and Massachusetts Bay Colony were led to the main Narragansett settlement in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, by an Indian guide named Indian Peter. The massive fort occupied about of land and was initially occupied by over a thousand people, but it was eventually overrun after a fierce fight. The settlement was burned, its inhabitants (including women and children) killed or evicted, and most of the tribe's winter stores destroyed. It is believed that at least 97 Narragansett warriors and 300 to 1,000 non-combatants were killed, though exact figures are unknown. Narragansetts' fort in the Great Swamp Fight in December 1675 Many of the warriors and their families escaped into the frozen swamp; hundreds more died there from wounds combined with the harsh conditions. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault, and about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded. The dead and wounded militiamen were evacuated to the settlements on Aquidneck Island in Narragansett Bay where they were buried or cared for by many of the Rhode Island colonists.Axelrod, p. 104 American ranger.  Aftermath  The Great Swamp Fight was a critical blow to the Narragansett tribe from which they never fully recovered.\\"Flintlock and TomahawkNew England in King Philip's War\\" by Douglas Edward Leach, New York: MacMillan, 1958, pg. 130‚Äì132 The Narragansetts were completely defeated when their chief sachem Canonchet was captured and executed in April 1676, then female sachem Queen Quaiapen drowned on July 2 attempting to cross a river. Philip was shot and killed on August 12 by John Alderman, an Indian soldier in the company of Benjamin Church.

It was his last exclusive Final Fantasy score. The Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack, a compilation of all music in the game, was originally released on four Compact Discs by DigiCube in 2000, and was re- released by Square Enix in 2004. A Best Of and arranged soundtrack album of musical tracks from the game entitled Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection was released in 2000 by Tokyopop Soundtrax. Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS, an album of music from the game's full motion videos and extra tracks, was released by DigiCube in 2000 and re-released in 2004, and a collection of piano arrangements of pieces from the original soundtrack arranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi and performed by Louis Leerink was released as Piano Collections Final Fantasy IX in 2001. The game's soundtrack is best known for \\"Melodies of Life,\\" the theme song of the game, performed by Emiko Shiratori in Japanese and English. The song was released as a single by King Records in 2000. The soundtrack was based around a theme of medieval music, and was heavily inspired by previous Final Fantasy games, incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks. The music was overall well received; reviewers found the soundtrack to be both well done and enjoyable, though opinions were mixed as to the reliance on music of previous games. Several tracks, especially \\"Melodies of Life\\" and \\"Vamo' Alla Flamenco\\", remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as being published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups. Creation and influence In discussions with director Hiroyuki Ito, Uematsu was told \\"It'd be fine if you compose tracks for the eight characters, an exciting battle track, a gloomy, danger- evoking piece, and around ten tracks or so.\\" However, Uematsu spent an estimated year composing and producing \\"around 160\\" pieces for Final Fantasy IX, with 140 appearing in the game. Uematsu composed with a piano, and used two contrasting methods: \\"I create music that fits the events in the game, but sometimes, the event designer will adjust a game event to fit the music I've already written.\\" Uematsu felt previous games Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII had a mood of realism, but that Final Fantasy IX was more of a fantasy, so \\"a serious piece as well as silly, fun pieces could fit in.\\" He felt the theme was medieval music, and was given a two-week break to travel in Europe for inspiration - \\"looking at old castles in Germany and so on.\\" However, the music was not entirely composed in the medieval mode, as Uematsu claims that \\"it would be unbalanced\\" and \\"a little boring\\". He aimed for a \\"simple, warm\\" style and included uncommon instruments such as a kazoo and dulcimer. Uematsu also included motifs from older Final Fantasy games \\"because Final Fantasy IX was returning to the roots, so to speak\\" and incorporated ideas such as \\"the old intro for battle music\\" and arranged the Volcano theme from Final Fantasy and the Pandemonium theme from Final Fantasy II, as well as others from the series. Uematsu has claimed several times that Final Fantasy IX is his favorite work, as well as the one he is most proud of. He also stated in the liner notes for the Final Fantasy IX: Original Soundtrack album that he was \\"glad that [he] was able to join this project.\\" Albums =\\"FINAL FANTASY IX\\" Original Soundtrack= Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the game, composed, arranged and produced by Nobuo Uematsu. It spans four discs and 110 tracks, covering a duration of 4:46:31. It was first released on 30 August 2000 by DigiCube, and subsequently re-released on 10 May 2004 by Square Enix. The lyrics for the theme song to the game, \\"Melodies of Life\\", were written by Hiroyuki Ito for the Japanese version and Alexander O. Smith for the English version. The song was performed in both languages by Emiko Shiratori. The album reached #4 on the Japan Oricon charts, and sold 101,000 copies as of January 2010. The album was well received; many reviewers found that it was a \\"good\\" soundtrack, though not without faults. Josh Bizeau and Roko Zaper of Soundtrack Central especially liked it, finding it to be \\"a blessing for Final Fantasy music\\", and both Patrick Gann of RPGFan and Isaac Engelhorn of Soundtrack Central felt it was Uematsu's second-best work to date, behind only the soundtrack of Final Fantasy VI. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, however, found that the heavy reliance of the soundtrack on music and themes from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks resulted in a sense of \\"stretched creativity\\" and \\"a bit of blandness\\", though he still felt it was not \\"a bad soundtrack... [but] not really a great soundtrack.\\" Other reviewers, however, such as Engelhorn and Tyler Schulley of Final Fantasy Symphony, enjoyed the fact that it pulled from previous soundtracks, feeling that it gave the album \\"the classic feel of the older Final Fantasies\\" while still being \\"original and beautiful\\". Track listing Literal translation of the original titles appear in (brackets) if different =Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection= Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection is a soundtrack album composed of popular musical tracks from the Final Fantasy IX: Original Soundtrack album.

It was first released on August 21, 2000 worldwide by Tokyopop Soundtrax, with English track names. The release bears the catalog number TPCD 0201-2. Reviewers were much less pleased with Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection than with the original soundtrack, finding it to have a \\"great track listing\\" but that it felt as if \\"[they] tried to get as many tracks on the disc as they could\\", with the result that many tracks were cut too short. =\\"FINAL FANTASY IX\\" Original Soundtrack PLUS= Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS is a soundtrack album consisting of pieces that did not appear on the original soundtrack. The album was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and orchestrated by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi. Emiko Shiratori supplied the vocals for \\"The Song of Zidane and Dagger\\" and \\"Melodies of Life (Silent Mix)\\".

The album well received, with reviewers finding the album \\"enjoyable\\" and \\"a pleasant surprise\\", although they did find some of the arrangements to be \\"a bit on the simple side\\". Melodies of Life \\"Melodies of Life\\" is the theme song of Final Fantasy IX, and consists primarily of two themes that were frequently used in the game itself, the Overworld theme (Crossing Those Hills), and a lullaby that is sung by Dagger. It was performed by Emiko Shiratori in both the Japanese and English versions, arranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi, and composed, like the rest of the game, by Nobuo Uematsu. The lyrics were written by game director Hiroyuki Ito (credited as Shiomi) in the Japanese version and Alexander O. Smith in the English version. The song was released as a single by King Records on August 2, 2000, and contains both the English and Japanese versions, an instrumental version, and a bonus track named \\"Galway Sky\\". The single covers a duration of 23:17 and has a catalog number of KICS-811. Melodies of Life reached #10 on the Oricon charts, and sold 100,000 copies.

Additionally, Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy concert series. The music of Final Fantasy IX has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as 20020220 music from FINAL FANTASY, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including \\"Vamo' Alla Flamenco\\".

Common Dreams, 2007-7-25 on the outskirts of Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Lake Charles Metropolitan Statistical Area and is sandwiched between Sulphur to the west and Westlake to the east. With the Sasol expansion project almost all of the homes north of Old Spanish Trail have now been either moved to other locations or torn down and the land completely deforested. The community is featured in the 2002 documentary film Blue Vinyl, which focuses on the health effects of nearby polyvinyl chloride factories on community members. The film features footage of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade collecting air samples to determine the toxicity of the community's air.  History  Mossville was founded by Jack Moss, an ex-slave, beginning in 1790. This was more than fifty years before the creation of Imperial Calcasieu Parish. Over the years the hamlet grew to more than 600 residents but was never incorporated. The main roads are the Old Spanish Trail (East Burton Street), Prater Road, and extends west to the Sulphur city limits and Evergreen Road. When the project is complete Mossville will like cease to exist. The town was settled by former enslaved Africans who were granted the land through a \\"fee-simple title acquired by squatters rights.\\" In this manner, anyone who agreed to improve the property while residing for a specified number of years could attain ownership. After the Civil War, these individuals mostly from nearby farms, settled on the land and began growing crops and raising cattle. Originally known as Shoats Prairie, Mossville has a current population of 8,000 inhabitants. The area remained rural until the early 1900s, when the Locke-Moore Company built a sawmill. Lumbering became the major industry and was later joined by sugar refinement. The greatest period of growth occurred in the 1940s and 1950s, when petrochemical and industrial plants moved into the area. Today, these plants remain the primary source of employment for Mossville residents.  Sasol  Vista Chemical Company purchased Conoco Chemical Company in July 1984. In March 1996, Vista Chemical Company became Condea Vista Company. Sasol bought Condea Vista in 2000. Sasol is the apartheid-era South African synthetic oil company that helped the apartheid South African government avoid the late 1960s international oil embargo. The Sasol project that includes the ethane cracker complex, over 3 square miles with an estimated at $8.1 billion cost, and is named the Lake Charles Chemical Projects. This replaces the previously named Ethane Cracker Projects and Lake Charles Cracker Projects. All of the streets north of Old Spanish Trail within the Mossville community has been absorbed into Sasol by the property being bought through the voluntary land purchase program and closed to the public. These streets include VCM Plant road, Center street, 1st through 8th avenue, Michigan avenue, Lincoln avenue, Laurel avenue, and Rigmaiden avenue. Evergreen street near the Sulphur city limits is also included in the closures. The entire area has been deforested with major ongoing construction. = History preservation = Sasol, through a $275,000 donation, funded the Mossville History Project with the Imperial Calcasieu Museum. The goal is to \\"capture, record, preserve and make available Mossville‚Äôs written and oral history.\\"  Controversy  There has been an ongoing controversy concerning Mossville residents and area pollution. In 1993 a pipeline (built in 1947) transferring ethylene dichloride was found to be leaking into the Calcasieu estuary. The company estimated that 1.6 million pounds had leaked but other sources gave estimates of from 19 to 47 million pounds. Citizens claimed that ethylene dichloride had leaked into the water system and a lawsuit was settled for $47 million. = The buyout = In August 2013 Sasol opened an office on Old Spanish Trail to facilitate the Voluntary Property Purchase Program and extended the early signup part until November. The program covers 883 lots (an area around 620 acres) in Mossville and the Brentwood subdivision that is on the south side of Old Spanish Trail. Property owners that occupy their homes are offered $100,000 minimum and 60% of the appraised value, based on a complicated appraisal system, $75,000 for Rental property owners, and $5,000 for unimproved property. All property owners get a $500 professional advice allowance and those that qualify early get an additional $1,000. The firm Advocates for Environmental Human Rights in New Orleans is representing residents that have not agreed to the buyout seeking to address problems including disability assistance, avoiding financial hardship, and that the program offer is non-negotiable. 62 residents of Mossville and 2 residents of Brentwood are not expected to leave. Heirship rights must also be considered as there could be as many as 80 heirs.

The comic stars Phil Foglio, along with Dixie Null, as they explore the world of tabletop RPGs (the subject of Dragon) with a mixture of reportage and advice to the reader. A long-running joke revolved around the often promised and often delayed \\"Sex in D&D;\\" segment, which was finally presented in one of the strip's reprint volumes. The strip's original run began in 1980, lasting until issue #84 (April 1984), when Foglio went to work on other projects. One such project was an illustrated novel adaptation of Another Fine Myth; Phil and Dixie appeared in issue #5. The strip was resurrected in the 1990s in Duelist magazine, themed around trading card games, before returning to Dragon in issue #265 (November 1999), running to issue #311 (September 2003). A final \\"farewell\\" installment was published in Dragon #359, the last issue of the magazine's print incarnation. Reprints of the entire initial Dragon run of What's New? were published in two volumes in 1991 and 1994 by Palliard Press, with Volume #2 finally presenting the long-awaited \\"Sex in D&D;\\" article. In 2001 a third volume was published by Studio Foglio collecting all the Duelist magazine strips, along with some bonus content.

Watson also worked briefly with a variety of big bands, including those of Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw and Jimmy Mundy. Watson also provided the (uncredited) voice for Prince Chawmin' in the cartoon Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (directed by Bob Clampett, 1943), one of the racially objectionable Censored Eleven; primary voice artist Mel Blanc's contract only allowed for his solo credit. In a 1969 Funnyworld interview conducted by Michael Barrier and Milton Gray, Bob Clampett recalled Watson's name erroneously as Zoot Watson; thus, Leo Watson himself went uncredited for his work in the cartoon for almost forty more years. Finally, Australian voice artist and animation historian Keith Scott discovered his name correctly in the Warner Bros. Archives.

She was the owner and manager of the professional cycling team . Gilmore previously rode for G.S. Safi-Pasta Zara-Manhattan. She splits her time between the road circuit and the track World Cup. In 2006, she won a stage at the Geelong Women's Tour, took second in the Commonwealth Games points race (behind teammate Kate Bates), and earned top five finishes in a Giro d'Italia Femminile stage, the Geelong World Cup, and the Liberty Classic. Gilmore is often referred to in the media as the 'bridesmaid', as she constantly finished runner-up in many events. In the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, she broke the jinx and won the gold medal in the 112 km road bicycle racing event. After her retirement she said she felt she achieved her maximum potential during her career through hard work and extensive preparation. In her teens she competed in track cycling (velodrome) but specialised in road racing for more than 10 years. In addition to founding Wiggle-Honda, in January 2015 Gilmore announced the launch of the High5 Dream Team, an Australian women's team competing in Australia's National Road Series aiming to help riders progress to road racing in Europe and to fill a gap created by Cycling Australia suspending its women's development programme due to financial problems. In a blogpost for cyclingnews.com in November 2015 Gilmore announced that she had retired from competition.

He previously held the same position at the University of New Hampshire. He was hired by Furman on April 24, 2006, after serving as an assistant coach to Kevin Stallings at Vanderbilt University, of the Southeastern Conference. While an assistant at Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt made one NCAA \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" appearance (2004) by defeating Western Michigan and North Carolina State, before falling to eventual national champion, Connecticut. Jackson was also named one of the Top 25 College Basketball Recruiters by Rivals.com in 2004. During Jackson's tenure as an assistant at Vanderbilt, the Commodores totaled 4 NIT appearances and 1 NCAA appearance. Prior to his stint with Vanderbilt, Jackson was the head coach at the University of New Hampshire, where he coached for three seasons, compiling a record of 21-60. During the 1997-98 season, New Hampshire had only their third ten win season since 1984. The 1998‚Äì99 recruiting class was ranked 15th by Mike Sheridan of Eastern Basketball Magazine, the first time that the university's basketball program had ever received a regional ranking in its history. Before being introduced as the head coach at New Hampshire, he served as an assistant at Stanford University of the Pac-10 Conference. There, the Cardinal won twenty games twice, and received back to back NCAA tournament appearances for the first time in school history. Prior to his move to Stanford, Jackson served in assistant coaching capacities at Colorado State (1989‚Äì92), and St. Bonaventure (1986‚Äì89). He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Southern California in 1985 after serving as a student assistant coach his final two years at Cornell. Jackson resigned at Furman on March 22, 2013. He is currently the Deputy Commissioner of the Big South Conference.  Personal life  Jackson graduated from Cornell in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial and labor relations.

It is now also considered a sub-style of Shit≈ç- ry≈´. Seishinkai is also an international shotokan karate organization based in the UK. Seishinkai started as a dojo called Seishin-Kan, founded by Kokuba Kosei on June 6, 1943 in Osaka, Japan. The name Seishi-Kan comes partly from the Kanji for the temple located at the end of the street where Sensei Kokuba lived, Shotennoji. The character Sho can be pronounced sho or sei and means \\"pure.\\" He believed that true Karate-d≈ç comes from the heart so he called his dojo Seishin or \\"pure heart\\" dojo. During World War II, many of the Okinawan Karateka who left their homeland came to Osaka and visited the home of their old friend, Kokuba Sensei. In return for room and board these men often taught at the Seishin-Kan dojo and gave private lessons to Kokuba Sensei's young son, Kosho. The Seishin-Kan dojo became a well-known meeting place for bud≈ç men in Osaka and many of the founders of Karate taught there. Kokuba Kosei was a devoted student of Motobu Ch≈çki, and upon Motobu's death in 1947 he became the second S≈çke of Motobu's branch of karate, known as-ry≈´-kyu Motobu-ha Karate- d≈ç, and Seishin-kan became the center of the new organisation, Seishin-kai, promoting this style. In 1959, after the death of Kokuba Kosei, his only son Kuniba Sh≈çg≈ç (Kosho) became the third S≈çke of Motobu-ha Karate-do, and the 1st S≈çke of Motobu-ha Shit≈ç-ry≈´ Karate-do, a new style that he created by blending Motobu's karate with Shit≈ç-ry≈´, which he learned from Kenwa Mabuni himself, and other styles that he was taught by the great masters who visited Seishin- kan. Since he was only 29 years old, Teruo Hayashi was appointed as technical advisor and president of Seishin-kai from 1959 until 1970. In 1983 S≈çke Kuniba left Japan and moved the center of operation for Motobu-ha Shit≈ç-ry≈´ Karate-do to Portsmouth VA, and after his death in 1992, Kunio Tatsuno emerged as the Kaicho of Seishinkai. Kuniba's dojo in the U.S. separated from Seishinkai and became independent. Kunio Tatsuno died suddenly in May, 1999, and Seishinkai soon dissolved as an organization in Japan. In the same year the sons of Shogo Kuniba, Kosuke Kuniba and Kozo Kuniba, formed Nihon Karate-do Kuniba-kai, which is currently recognized by Japan Karate-do Federation (JKF) as the home of Motobu-ha Shito-ryu. The free-standing organization called International Seishinkai Karate Union (ISKU) was formed in 1999, now led by Sadatomo Harada,Sadatomo Harada on Shuriway.co.uk one of the students of Kenwa Mabuni, who is recognized by ISKU as the fifth and current soke of Seishinkai.

St. George (November 23, 1919 ‚Äì July 29, 2014) was an American author, World War II veteran, reporter, editor, columnist and screenwriter. He was born in Simpson, Minnesota. His best known work is C/O Postmaster, a semi- autobiographical description of his experiences in Australia as a U.S. soldier in 1942. This book was a best seller and Time Book of the Month Club selection in 1943.Book Extract St. George published a sequel to Postmaster in 1945, titled Proceed Without Delay, which chronicled his further adventures in the Pacific Theater during World War II, as a writer for Yank, the Army Weekly magazine. After the war, St. George was a screenwriter in Hollywood, and wrote the screenplay for the film Campus Honeymoon among others. He then worked as a reporter, editor, and columnist for newspapers in Rochester, Minnesota, San Diego, Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minnesota. He retired from newspaper work in 1994, and devoted the next several years to a series of nine satirical, semi- autobiographical novels. This collection is referred to as the Eddie Devlin Compendium, published by Xlibris. This series follows a gaggle of characters from the stock market crash in 1929, through the Great Depression, World War II, to life in an old folks home at the Millennium - Old Tim's Estate (covering the years 1929-1935) Wildcat Strike (1939) The Bloody Wet (1943‚Äì1944) Bringing Chesty Home (1948) Replevy for a Flute (1956) Clyde Strikes Back (1963‚Äì1964) Flacks (1973) Deadlines (1984‚Äì1985) The Survivors (1999‚Äì2000). These books are available in print and e-book versions at XLibris, Amazon.com, and Barnes & Noble. His published works, all of which he illustrated himself with sketches of his characters and their situations, are noted for their quirky humor, the lively immediacy with which he portrays a moment in time, and the often touching characterizations of people whom St. George obviously knew well. In 1945, at the end of World War II, St. George married a WAC (Women's Army Corps) Staff Sergeant from Philadelphia, whom he had met in Brisbane, Australia during the war. They had four children. His first wife died in 1994, his son died in 2004 and his second wife died in 2014. His three daughters now live in Wisconsin, in Maine, and in England. St. George resided in the Rochester, Minnesota area in his later years.

There are two different versions, both rather confusingly called by the same name. The most common version is defined on alternating multivector fields and makes them into a Gerstenhaber algebra, but there is also another version defined on symmetric multivector fields, which is more or less the same as the Poisson bracket on the cotangent bundle. It was discovered by Jan Arnoldus Schouten (1940, 1953) and its properties were investigated by his student Albert Nijenhuis (1955). It is related to but not the same as the Nijenhuis‚ÄìRichardson bracket and the Fr√∂licher‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket. Definition and properties An alternating multivector field is a section of the exterior algebra ‚àß‚àóTM over the tangent bundle of a manifold M. The alternating multivector fields form a graded supercommutative ring with the product of a and b written as ab (some authors use a‚àßb). This is dual to the usual algebra of differential forms Œ©‚àóM by the pairing on homogeneous elements: : \\\\omega(a_1a_2 \\\\dots a_p)=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\omega(a_1,\\\\dots,a_p)&(\\\\omega\\\\in \\\\Omega^pM)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&(\\\\omega ot\\\\in\\\\Omega^pM) \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. The degree of a multivector A in \\\\Lambda^p TM is defined to be A = p. The skew symmetric Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket is the unique extension of the Lie bracket of vector fields to a graded bracket on the space of alternating multivector fields that makes the alternating multivector fields into a Gerstenhaber algebra. It is given in terms of the Lie bracket of vector fields by :[a_1\\\\cdots a_m,b_1\\\\cdots b_n]=\\\\sum_{i,j}(-1)^{i+j}[a_i,b_j]a_1\\\\cdots a_{i-1}a_{i+1}\\\\cdots a_mb_1\\\\cdots b_{j-1}b_{j+1}\\\\cdots b_n for vector fields ai, bj and :[f,a_1\\\\cdots a_m] = -\\\\iota_{df}(a_1 \\\\cdots a_m) for vector fields a_i and smooth function f, where \\\\iota_{df} is the common interior product operator. It has the following properties. *ab = a + b (The product has degree 0) *[a,b] = a + b ‚àí 1 (The Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket has degree ‚àí1) *(ab)c = a(bc), ab = (‚àí1)abba (the product is associative and (super) commutative) *[a, bc] = [a, b]c + (‚àí1)b(a ‚àí 1)b[a, c] (Poisson identity) *[a,b] = ‚àí(‚àí1)(a ‚àí 1)(b ‚àí 1) [b,a] (Antisymmetry of Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket) *a,b],c] = [a,[b,c ‚àí (‚àí1)(a ‚àí 1)(b ‚àí 1)[b,[a,c (Jacobi identity for Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket) * If f and g are functions (multivectors homogeneous of degree 0), then [f,g] = 0. * If a is a vector field, then [a,b] = Lab is the usual Lie derivative of the multivector field b along a, and in particular if a and b are vector fields then the Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket is the usual Lie bracket of vector fields. The Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket makes the multivector fields into a Lie superalgebra if the grading is changed to the one of opposite parity (so that the even and odd subspaces are switched), though with this new grading it is no longer a supercommutative ring. Accordingly, the Jacobi identity may also be expressed in the symmetrical form :(-1)^{(a-1)(c-1)}[a,[b,c +(-1)^{(b-1)(a-1)}[b,[c,a +(-1)^{(c-1)(b-1)}[c,[a,b = 0.\\\\, Generalizations There is a common generalization of the Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket for alternating multivector fields and the Fr√∂licher‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket due to Vinogradov (1990). A version of the Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket can also be defined for symmetric multivector fields in a similar way. The symmetric multivector fields can be identified with functions on the cotangent space T*(M) of M that are polynomial in the fiber, and under this identification the symmetric Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket corresponds to the Poisson bracket of functions on the symplectic manifold T*(M). There is a common generalization of the Schouten‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket for symmetric multivector fields and the Fr√∂licher‚ÄìNijenhuis bracket due to Dubois-Violette and Peter W. Michor (1995).

Announced as \\"Double-deuce, triple-E, the one and only Juli Veee\\",Playful Juli Veee is Sockers' greatest Veee experienced his greatest success as an indoor player with the San Diego Sockers. He also earned four caps, scoring two goals, with the U.S. national team. Youth Veee grew up impoverished in Budapest, Hungary. The communist government controlled nearly every aspect of a Hungarian's life and when Veee turned fifteen he was given a choice, pursue a career in table tennis or soccer. He chose soccer. Chafing under the restrictions of his homeland under a totalitarian regime, Veee defected when he was eighteen years old while on a tour of Western Europe with the Hungarian U-21 national team. He began his professional career in France before moving to the United States. NASL In 1975, he moved to the U.S. where he signed with the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. That season, he played in nineteen games, scoring six goals. He was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes for the 1976 season. At the completion of the 1976 NASL season, Veee moved to Belgium where he signed with First Division club Lierse. He spent one season with Lierse before moving to Standard Li√®ge for the 1977-1978 season. Veee returned to the NASL to play for the San Diego Sockers from 1978-1982. Veee was a fan favorite for the Sockers. =NASL indoor= Veee played for San Jose during the 1976 indoor tournament and led the competition with eight goals.http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/V/Veee.Julie.htm A few years later the NASL started an indoor league, in which the Sockers participated in 1980-81, 1981‚Äì82, 1983-84. San Diego won the championship in the 1981-82 and 1983-84 seasons. Julie Veee was their star. He went on to play with the Sockers in the MISL. Overall, the Sockers won 10 indoor soccer championship (two in the NASL, and eight more in the MISL). Veee finished his career with the Sockers with 254 goals and 214 assists. Veee was described in a 1984 Sports Illustrated article as a player \\"who would find it tough to hold a place on a European third-division side, [and who] recognizes that the simplistic indoor version suits his talents better than the grown-ups' game.\\" In the same article Veee was quoted as stating, \\"tell the rest of the world to go on playing in the mud and rain...we'll get rich while staying clean. The future of American soccer is indoors.\\" Gammon, Clive \\"The NASL: It's Alive But On Death Row\\", \\"Sports Illustrated\\", May 7, 1984. Retrieved on March 16, 2015. MISL He began his career in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) with the New York Arrows. His greatest achievement in soccer probably came as he led the San Diego Sockers to five championships. He was MVP three times. He was the 1982-1983 championship series MVP. At the end of the 1984 season, the Sockers traded Veee to the Las Vegas Americans for whom he played a single season. In 1985, he returned to the Sockers and finished his career with them in 1988. National team Veee earned four caps with the US national team after he became a US citizen. His first game with the national team came in an October 15, 1976 loss to Mexico. He scored his first national team goal five days later in a victory over Canada. He played one more game in 1976, then did not earn another cap until his last one. That came in the only game the U.S. played in 1982, a 2-1 victory over Trinidad on March 21, 1982. Veee also scored his second national team goal in that game. Veee was also a member of the U.S. team which qualified for the 1980 Summer Olympics. While Veee scored a goal in the U.S. tie with Suriname which led to the U.S. qualifying for the games, President Carter cancelled the U.S. participation in those games as punishment for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because FIFA does not recognize Olympic and Olympic qualifying matches as full internationals, these games are not included in Veee's national team statistics. Post playing career After retiring in 1988, Veee found himself out of work and penniless. While he had become an artist and book collector these did not provide enough income at the time for him to make a living. A local youth coach who knew Veee asked him to help out with the coach's team. Veee needed income, so he agreed. He quickly discovered that he loved coaching and it has become his second career.Stroke of luck His coaching jobs include three years with the San Dieguito Surf and two years as coach of the Pegasus. In 2005, became the head coach of the La Costa Canyon High School girls team. He decided to become a high school coach due to dissatisfaction with regression his club players experienced during the high school season. Veee concluded that the low quality of high school soccer hurt his club and decided the best way to raise that quality was through his personal attention.New LCC cheer: Give me a Veee In 1997, the San Diego Breitbard Hall of Fame inducted Veee, the first soccer player so honored.San Diego Hall of Champions He was also selected as an inaugural member of the Indoor Soccer Hall of Fame in 2011.http://www.stltoday.com/sports/other/popovic-s-success-earns-indoor- soccer-hall-of-fame-nod/article_db621736-01ae-11e1-b3ec-001a4bcf6878.html References External links * Artist profile * Article about Veee's coaching * NASL and MISL stats Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Lierse S.K. players Category:Standard Li√®ge players Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Hungarian emigrants to the United States Category:Hungarian expatriate footballers Category:Hungarian footballers Category:United States men's international soccer players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) indoor players Category:Los Angeles Aztecs players Category:San Jose Earthquakes (1974‚Äì1988) players Category:San Diego Sockers (NASL) players Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978‚Äì1992) players Category:New York Arrows players Category:Las Vegas Americans players Category:San Diego Sockers (original MISL) players Category:American soccer coaches Category:Footballers from Budapest Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Juli Veee"},{"id":"11216440","text":"DZWI, branded as Power 108 FM, was an FM radio station in the Philippines which operated from 2001 to 2004.

Its studios are located in Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, while its transmitter is located at Laurel, Batangas.2011 Philippine Yearbook. Page 25. The radio station took its name from the famous \\"Power 106\\" (KPWR) in Los Angeles, California. The flamboyant logo of Power 108 FM represented its love of the urban culture. History It was the first and only radio station in the Philippines and Asia to play hip hop and R&B; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Located near Taal Volcano, the \\"pirate\\" station began in 2001 as a blip on the screen to quickly becoming a force in the competitive radio market. The urban culture was an untapped market in the metropolis and Power 108 FM executives and DJs (power jocks) were very aware of this. Both management and on-air talent were passionate about playing music and sharing the culture which earned the respect of hip hop enthusiasts around Metro Manila. The original format did not have on-air personalities 24/7. As the station gained popularity, programming changes were made and more DJs were added. =On-air personalities, 2001= *H-Town (currently with Wave 891) *T-Bone (currently with Magic 89.9 as Tony Toni on the weeknight program called Boys Night Out) *Caine *Tiny *Bliss *Tripp *Sugar *Lady-C (podcast: A Dose of Intensity) *Passion *Kel *J-Rok *Chesco *BuddhaMak *Fat Boy Klim *Silkk *Razorray Notable personalities that worked at the station were the late rapper Francis Magalona, using his on-air moniker as The Mouth and former MTV Philippines VJ and supermodel Sarah Meier. Power 108 FM eventually evolved as Project: Hip Hop which was created by three men, namely DJs Caine, Satoshi and Quaizy. The End of Power 108 FM Power 108 FM permanently signed off on August 31, 2004. No official announcement was made by the station and therefore speculation arose as to what the main reason was for its shutdown. With its signal reaching even the northern parts of Metro Manila, it was rumored to be due to its license. It supposedly allowed the station only to be heard in the Tagaytay area. In 2005, the Power 108 crew together with previous Investor - Marcelle John Marcelino (aka DJ Htown) and Cavite Businessman - Politician Mayor Dino Reyes Chua returned to the airwaves via a new radio station, Blazin' 105.9 (now Retro 105.9 DCG FM) in Pasig City. A major accomplishment of the station was to bring The Black Eyed Peas to the Philippines. Two years later, on the same frequency, 107.9 U Radio started broadcasting. When BLAZIN' 105.9 closed shop in mid-2008, Wave 891 in 2007 took over the format of Power 108 and the Pinoy hip hop scene, creating the 1st Urban Music Awards in 2010.

MacLean (born March 8, 1970 in Torrejon Air Base, Spain) is a former United States Federal Air Marshal and whistleblower. Early career MacLean served in the U.S. Air Force from 1988 to 1992. In the Air Force, MacLean was a nuclear weapons maintenance technician for Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). He was awarded the Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon, Outstanding Unit Awards, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal. After his discharge, MacLean entered the United States Border Patrol as a border patrol agent and served almost six years in its San Diego Sector as a trainer. MacLean was recruited by the Federal Aviation Administration's Federal Air Marshal program immediately after the September 11 attacks. MacLean was in the first air marshal class to graduate after the September 11, 2001 attacks. After subsequently hiring a significant amount of new air marshals, the FAA program was moved under the new Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration and called the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS).  Whistleblowing  On July 28, 2003, disclosed to MSNBC a proposed TSA operational plan that he believed would have reduced aviation security: removing air marshals from long distance, nonstop flights to save on hotel costs. MacLean said he previously brought his concerns to his TSA managers and a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General field agent, but was rebuffed, leading him to make contact with national media. MacLean was quoted, anonymously, along with other unnamed sources, in a story written by Brock N. Meeks, chief Washington correspondent for MSNBC.com. TSA first denied that air marshals would have been shifted, but the morning after MacLean's disclosure, the agency dropped the plan. TSA investigation and identification In 2005, MacLean appeared on NBC Nightly News to criticize a TSA dress code that he believed made it too easy to identify air marshals. While the appearance was supposed to be anonymous, MacLean's voice wasn't distorted, and he was identified by TSA officials. MacLean then admitted to being the source of the 2003 disclosure as well. Firing by TSA and administrative appeals MacLean was fired by the TSA on April 11, 2006, on the grounds that he disclosed prohibited security information. On August 31, 2006, more than six months after he was fired, the TSA retroactively marked MacLean's July 2003 disclosure as being Sensitive Security Information, an unclassified information category. MacLean appealed this decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), but after the TSA issued its August 31, 2008 \\"Final Order on Sensitive Security Information,\\" the agency argued that the MSPB had no jurisdiction to challenge an \\"Agency Order.\\" The MSPB Administrative Judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice so MacLean could challenge the Agency Order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 16, 2008, a Ninth Circuit panel ruled that the Transportation Security Administration was within its authority to retroactively classify the information as SSI, but found that MacLean could contest his termination before the MSPB under the authority of the Whistleblower Protection Act by arguing that he had a \\"good-faith belief\\" that the information did not qualify as \\"sensitive security information.\\" On June 22, 2009, a full MSPB panel declared that MacLean was not protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act. On May 12, 2010, MSPB administrative law judge Franklin M. Kang issued an Initial Decision to uphold MacLean's removal. MacLean appealed the decision to a 3-member appellate MSPB panel in Washington DC, but on July 25, 2011, the full panel denied all of MacLean's Whistleblower Protection Act defenses and affirmed the TSA's decision to terminate him.  Appellate and Supreme Court decisions  In 2013, a unanimous panel of three United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges ruled in favor of MacLean, instructing the MSPB to reassess whether his disclosure qualified for whistleblower protection. The federal government appealed the Federal Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. In January 2015, the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision, ruling that MacLean could pursue a whistleblower defense before the MSPB. Reinstatement and later dismissal In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, the MSPB remanded McLean's case back to judge Kang for a new hearing, and on May 8, 2015, MacLean was retroactively reinstated by the Department of Homeland Security. Kang formally designated MacLean a whistleblower in November 2015. In March 2019 MacLean was fired again by the TSA, on the basis of allegations including inappropriate posts on a message board for air marshals and lying about how he obtained information about potential witnesses against him.

Menchum Falls is a tributary of the Benue River. Bamenda from the mountain road into town. The Western High Plateau, Western Highlands or Bamenda Grassfields is a region of Cameroon characterised by high relief, cool temperatures, heavy rainfall and savanna vegetation. The region lies along the Cameroon line and consists of mountain ranges and volcanoes made of crystalline and igneous rock. The region borders the South Cameroon Plateau to the southeast, the Adamawa Plateau to the northeast and the Cameroon coastal plain to the south. Topography and geology The Western High Plateau lies along the Cameroon line, a series of volcanic swells running from the Atlantic Ocean in the southwestern part of the plateau to the Adamawa Plateau in the northeast. The region is characterised by accidented relief of massifs and mountains. The Western High Plateau features several dormant volcanoes, including the Bamboutos Mountains, Mount Oku and Mount Kupe. The plateau rises in steps from the west. To the east, it terminates in mountains that range from 1,000 metres to 2,500 metres in height, terminating in the South Cameroon Plateau. The plateau gives way to the Adamawa Plateau to the northeast, which is a larger but less accidented region. The core of the plateau is made up of volcanic rock, which is ringed by plutonic rock. The base is crystalline and metamorphic rock. The base rock is primarily gneiss and granite that dates to the Precambrian period. A layer of basalt covers this. Vulcanism has created fertile black and brown soils. Erosion played a large role. Climate and drainage The plateau experiences an equatorial climate of the Cameroon type. The area experiences two major seasons: A long, wet season of nine months, and a short, dry season of three months. During the wet season, humid, prevailing monsoon winds blow in from the west and lose their moisture upon hitting the region's mountains. Average rainfall per year ranges from 1,000 mm to 2,000 mm. High elevations give the region a cooler climate than the rest of Cameroon. For example, the average temperature at Dschang in the West Region is 20¬∞C. Toward the north, rainfall levels are reduced as the Sudan climate becomes predominant. The Western High Plateau's relief and high rainfall make it a major watershed for Cameroon. Important rivers in the region include the Manyu, which rises in the Bamboutos Mountains and becomes the Cross River on its lower course, and the Nkam, which is known as the Wouri River on its lower course. The region gives rise to important tributaries to the Sanaga River. These rivers follow a Cameroon regime, a subtype of the equatorial regime of other southern Cameroonian rivers. This means that the rivers experience a long, high-water period during the wet season and a short, low-water period during the dry season. The region's rivers ultimately empty into the Atlantic Ocean. The area's accidented geography gives rise to several waterfalls along these waterways. Ekon Falls near Nkongsamba in the West Region is 80 metres high. Crater lakes dot the plateau, the result of dead volcanoes filling with water. Flora The Western High Plateau was once heavily forested. However, repeated cutting and burning by human beings has forced the forest back to areas along the waterways and has allowed grasslands to expand into the area. Sudan savanna forms the dominant vegetation. This consists of grassfields‚Äîleading to the name Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda‚Äîand short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage during the dry season as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. Raffia palms grow in the valleys and depressions.

The club expanded over several years and by the early 1980s had branches in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, and was for nearly 15 years New Zealand's only nationwide science fiction fan organisation. kiwi, representing New Zealand, superimposed on a stylised rocket History Members in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin were involved in running national conventions, although none were officially run by NASF, and in many of the fanzines that sprouted up in the late '70s and early '80s, as well as amateur press association Aotearapa. NASF was also a motivating force behind the inauguration of a New Zealand Science Fiction fan awards in the late 1980s (these later reappeared as the Sir Julius Vogel Awards), and was also the umbrella organisation responsible for the appointing of host sites for national conventions. At its height in the mid-1980s, NASF had a membership of about 150 and a bimonthly club magazine called Warp. By the mid-1990s, the Auckland and Christchurch branches had folded, although there were still club members in those areas. The Dunedin branch and the Wellington branch continued until the late 1990s. Debate continues on why NASF died, as well as whether it was officially wound up, but it was largely inactive by the mid 1990s and went into indefinite recess in late 1997. The rise of science fiction as a popular genre in the cinema and television, coupled with easier accessibility to science fiction books, magazines, movie and television series on video and later DVD likely contributed to NASF's demise. Considerable infighting within the Wellington and Christchurch branches may also have contributed, along with an unwieldy National Committee. The Phoenix Science Fiction Society was founded in Wellington specifically as an alternative to what was seen as a moribund branch of NASF, draining many active fans away from NASF. Other factors included the growth of the internet, which made an organised club less relevant. In contrast to when Macskasy formed NASF in 1976, by the late 1990s, New Zealanders could soak themselves in science fiction without any need to meet other people with the same interest. Many of the national functions of NASF were later taken up by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Association of New Zealand (SFFANZ), which was founded in 2002. Branches =Dunedin branch= The Dunedin branch of the National Association for Science Fiction (NASF) existed from 1978 until the late 1990s. The branch was the first science fiction club formed in Dunedin and for many years was the southernmost science fiction club in the world. It held fortnightly meetings (later monthly), initially at the children's library in Stuart Street, then at various other venues, the last of which was the W.E.A. building in Crawford Street. The branch organised social events and outings and ran a small lending library. About a dozen people attended the first meetings, but it took till the middle of the year for the official formation of the branch. Membership began to increase as a side effect of Dunedin winning the rights to hold the New Zealand National Science Fiction Convention, Octacon, in 1982. There was also a jump in social gatherings with members meeting every weekend and on some week days. By 1983, the Dunedin branch was the most socially active within NASF and second in size only to the Wellington branch. Branch members were instrumental in staging other national conventions in Dunedin in 1986, 1989 and 1994. Dunedin branch members contributed to the NASF club fanzine Warp which was edited from Dunedin for several years, but the branch itself did not have a regular branch fanzine or newsletter other than the short-lived Larque's Lament, which ran for five issues in the late 1980s, and a one-off fanzine called Can‚Äôt Think of a Name So We Called it This! in 1982. Several branch members were also members of Aotearapa, or published their own fanzines, notably Tom Cardy's Worlds Beyond, which ran for 11 issues.

It also challenged the power and authority of the pre-existing quasi- parliament in the country, called the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, which had been imposed on Estonia after Moscow's illegal annexation in 1940. The Congress of Estonia declared that it represented the highest authority on questions of Estonian statehood and citizenship, deriving this authority from the consent and initiative of the citizens of Estonia. The aim of the Congress was to restore Estonian independence based on the principle of legal continuity, with the pre-1940 republic of Estonia, which had been established in 1918, as the foundation.The Restoration of Estonian Independence  Activity  In 1989, independence activists formed a mass movement called the Estonian Citizens' Committees () and started registering personsSoviet Union Cry Independence ‚Äì Time magazine ‚Äì August 21, 1989National minorities in Estonia ‚Äì Legal Information Centre for Human Rights, April 1998 who were Estonian citizens by birth according to the jus sanguinis principle, i.e., persons who held Estonian citizenship in June 1940 (at which point Estonia's de facto structures of state were systematically dismantled and reorganized, after the country had been occupiedSee, for instance, position expressed by European Parliament, which condemned \\"the fact that the occupation of these formerly independent and neutral States by the Soviet Union occurred in 1940 following the Molotov/Ribbentrop pact, and continues.\\" by the Soviet Union), and their descendants. People who did not satisfy these criteria were invited to file applications for citizenship. By February 1990, 790,000 citizens and about 60,000 applicants had been registered. In February 1990, the election of a body of representatives of these citizens ‚Äì the Congress of Estonia ‚Äì was conducted by those who had been registered. The Congress had 499 delegates from 31 political parties. The Estonian National Independence Party (, usually abbreviated as ERSP) won the most seats. Other parties represented included the Popular Front of Estonia, the Heritage Society and the Communist Party of Estonia.Elections and Referendums in Estonia 1989‚Äì1999 ‚Äì Elections to the Estonian Congress 24.02 ‚Äì 01.03.1990 The permanent standing committee of the Congress of Estonia ‚Äì the Committee of Estonia () ‚Äì was chaired by Mr. Tunne Kelam. In September 1991, a Constituent Assembly was formed of equal numbers of members of the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of Estonia to work out a new Constitution for the Republic. The new constitution was approved by referendum in June 1992, using the constitution replacement process specified in the 1938 constitution as a matter of legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia. Both the Congress of Estonia and the Supreme Soviet dissolved themselves in October 1992, with the swearing-in of the first parliament (Riigikogu) elected under the new constitution in September 1992.  Politics  March 1990 also saw the election of the Estonian Supreme Soviet, the first multi-party national elections in the Estonian SSR. Unlike the previous Soviet, which consisting largely of members of the Communist Party of Estonia, the new Supreme Council, as it had now begun to call itself, was dominated by the Estonian Popular Front. The main distinctions between the political ideas of the Congress of Estonia and the Supreme Soviet were: * The Congress of Estonia stood for the principle of legal continuity of the Republic, in contrast to the \\"Third Republic\\" concept (after the First Republic of 1918‚Äì1940 and the Soviet Republic of 1940‚Äì1991), which was the Supreme Soviet's dominant position; * The Congress of Estonia, as the Citizens Committees before it, supported continuity in citizenship, as opposed to extending citizenship to all people with residential registrations (called propiska in Russian) in Estonia in 1990 (sometimes called the 'zero option citizenship' or 'clean state citizenship', ), including more than 300,000 occupation-era migrants from the neighboring Soviet Union. Opposition on issues of substance between the Congress of Estonia and the Supreme Soviet over the first point was the primary reason that the Supreme Soviet did not \\"proclaim\\" or \\"establish\\" Estonia's independence during the 1991 August Putsch in Russia, but instead, as a compromise, decided to reaffirm it instead. In later discussions, the Congress of Estonia prevailed regarding the aforementioned points. A small number of the members of the Congress of Estonia were Estonians who had gone into exile during World War II, or children of such refugees. Some of the delegates from the United States commented on the similarity of the Citizens Committees of Estonia and Latvia (in the nineties, the Latvians had a movement analogous to the Estonian committees) to the American Committees of Correspondence, which were shadow governments organized by the patriot leaders of the Thirteen Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution. The American Committees of Correspondence played an important role in the events that led to the formation of the United States of America.Assertion based on an unpublished interview with a member of the Congress of Estonia  Citizenship  After the adoption of the new Constitution in 1992, a new Citizenship Law recognised the citizenship registrations of the Citizens' Committees as the initial legal registry of Estonian citizens. Citizens of the Soviet Union who had filed applications with the Citizens Committees were enabled to be naturalised on the basis of a simplified procedure.

The cha√±ar is cold and drought deciduous; it loses its leaves in winter, and possibly in summer if conditions get too dry. It is natural to Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, also present in Paraguay and southern Peru. It is a very characteristic tree in local culture and folk because of its vivid visual presence, propagation, and ancient ethnomedical uses. Flowers and leaves. Morphology The common name Chilean Palo Verde comes from the mottled green color of the trunks but does not seriously resemble Cercidium. The cha√±ar tends to be quite upright with a spreading canopy with both straight and mildly curving trunks. As trees mature the trunks and branches take on a sculptural quality with long longitudinal, irregular ridges and valleys. Along with this undulating trunk, large flakes of the bark peel off or decorticate (hence the species name decorticans). The peeling tan to brown bark is eventually shed revealing the dark green, \\"immature\\" trunk beneath. The contrasting colors and textures created by this puzzle-piece pattern make the tree visually fascinating.G. decorticans . Arid Zone Trees The flowers are very visible, small, papery and yellow-coloured. The tree flowers in spring, either singly or in clusters. Geoffroea decorticans is unique among legumes in that it produces fleshy, oval pods that hold a single seed. Fruit are initially green but turn deep orange as they mature. Distribution and habitat This tree inhabits dry to arid spiniferous forests in a rather broad area of southern South America which extends mainly through I to IV regions of Chile and central and northern Argentina and throughout highland Bolivia, though it is also found in Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. Its companions conforming the forest are usually algarrobos, quebrachos, and the related and very abundant cavens. In Chile, G. decorticans grows in USDA climate zones 8b to 10, and withstands short frosts as low as ‚Äì13 ¬∞C. The latter is the record low temperature for Santiago del Estero, Argentina, where G. decorticans occurs naturally. It is adapted to desert conditions and can withstand temperatures in excess of 40 ¬∞C. Mature fruits. Usage The seeds and fruit, being edible, are valued as human and animal feed, and the yellow wood is suitable for carpentry and furniture making once dry. It is also used as fuel and to make cheap posts for fences. The fruits are very commonly used for both culinary and medical purposes in the processed form of cha√±ar arrope. Extremely sweet, dark and thick, this is very similar to honey or vegetable molasses and is used in their place. It is locally known to alleviate sore throats and coughing.Cocina regional del norte argentino. turismosalta.gov.ar References External links Pictures and information of Geoffroea decorticans in Northern Chile *Faboidae Notes *Image of G. decorticans branch - sample stored at FieldMuseum (Chicago) Category:Dalbergieae Category:Trees of Argentina Category:Trees of Chile Category:Chilean Matorral Category:Flora of northern Chile Category:Atacama Desert Category:Drought-tolerant trees Category:Trees of Bolivia Category:Trees of Peru Category:Trees of Uruguay Category:Trees of Paraguay ","title":"Geoffroea decorticans"},{"id":"11216663","text":"Coat of Arms of the 6th Mountain Artillery Regiment The 6th Mountain Artillery Regiment () is an inactive field artillery regiment of the Italian Army, specializing in mountain combat.

The Korean presence in Indonesia goes back several decades. The Jakarta International Korean School in East Jakarta opened on 1 February 1975, and as of 2007 enrolled 719 elementary school students, 357 middle school students, and 375 high school students. It is thus the largest Korean day school in Southeast Asia, at more than twice the enrollment of the one in Ho Chi Minh City. A Koreatown began to form in South Jakarta's Kebayoran Baru subdistrict as early as 1982, when Kim Woo-jae opened a shop selling kimchi and doenjang. Between 2011 and 2013, their population increased by 11%. Nearly all (38,401, or 95%) are staying in Indonesia on ordinary residence visas. Other categories have shown rapid growth in recent years but remain small in absolute numbers: those on international student visas number 664 people (up 137% since 2011), 814 (up 285%) have permanent residence status, and 405 (up 58%) have become Indonesian citizens. The sex ratio of the community is unbalanced, with 1.3 men for every woman, similar to the pattern seen in most South Korean migrant communities in Southeast Asian countries besides Malaysia and Singapore; however, the imbalance has decreased from earlier years. Unlike Japanese expatriates of earlier years, most South Korean expatriates come accompanied by their families. Business and employment Most South Korean migrant workers in Indonesia are employees of South Korea multinational conglomerates with investments in Indonesia, or owners of small and medium-sized enterprises. Labour relations at South Korean-owned factories were poor in the 1990s, but have improved in recent years. Distribution In 2005 there were about 30,000 South Koreans living in Indonesia, with most of them being in the Jakarta area. Of the rest, 1,200 lived in Surabaya, 600 lived in Bandung, 150 lived in Bali, and 550 lived elsewhere.\\"Businesspeople: The backbone of RI's Korean community\\" (Archive). The Jakarta Post.

Semarang is another area mentioned as having a large number of Koreans, though they lack any Korean-language educational facilities there. Bali, a popular destination for Korean tourists, has also begun to attracting some scattered Korean workers. Religion The directory of the Korean Association in Indonesia listed 14 Korean churches (of various denominations including Presbyterianism) and one Buddhist temple of the Jogye Order in the Jabodetabek area. Muslims form a smaller minority of the Korean community. The Indonesian branch of the Korean Muslim Federation opened in 1982; they sponsored 22 Muslims from South Korea to come to Indonesia as students in 1983 and 1984 to study in local universities and better understand Islam.

It features mostly different actors, with James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. In the early days of sound film, it was common for Hollywood studios to produce foreign language versions of their films using the same sets and costumes but a different set of actors as the original. Although a different director would be brought in for the foreign- language version, they would have access to the daily footage from the English language production and would often use the same shots and camera setups. Often the result would be similar to a 'shot-to-shot' remake, although in some notable examples (such as Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)), the alternate director exercised more creative freedom. =Animation to animation= In the 1930s and 1940s, several American animated shorts originally produced in black-and-white were remade in color several years alter.

It is the sixth full-length CD released by the band; it is also their second live release (the first being General Admission) and their second effort under Kirtland Records. The concerts were filmed at the WorkPlay Theater and Studios in Birmingham, Alabama, and The Barns at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia. The WorkPlay performance is also the last recorded performance with Chris Williams, who died in October 2006 during the DVD post- production. Stages was released as a CD/DVD combination. It was first available for pre-order in November 2006 through the Aware Records online store, and achieved wide release in February 2007. Two online-only bonuses were available with the purchase of a hard copy of the album. The first offer was from the Aware store, where preorder customers were e-mailed a link to three exclusive acoustic song downloads, and the second was a similar offer to BestBuy.com customers that was available during the first week of the album's official release. CD content The CD only contains the WorkPlay show. Due to the length of the performance, \\"Shine\\" had to be left off the CD, though it can be seen and heard on the DVD.

Often, the acoustic summing of a room and system are much inferior to the ideal, so the specific relative level will change from ‚àí3 dB to 0 dB as the mono signal is panned from center to hard left or right, and this sounds natural. The idea is that when one directs signals left and right with the pan pot, the perceived loudness will stay the same, regardless of latitude. However, both the direction of attenuation throughout the panoramic sweep and the amount by which the signal is attenuated vary according to pan rule. For example, the Yamaha digital consoles employ a typical (compromise) 3 dB pan rule, however, the signal is at full level at 12:00 and becomes progressively louder (up to + 3 dB) as it is panned to the right or left. The 3 dB pan rule is a commonly applied compromise to comply with the mediocre acoustic summing capabilities of most control rooms. However, the console manufacturer SSL used to employ a 4.5 dB pan rule, because it was believed that their expensive consoles would normally be used in tuned rooms that had acoustic summing capabilities closer to the ideal. Many consoles that have only one pan rule employ one such that a signal panned hard left or right is at full level and becomes progressively lower in level as the pan is directed to the center. According to mastering engineer Glenn Meadows, the Kinoshita-Hidley rooms at Masterfonics (Nashville, Tennessee), produce close to 5.9 dB acoustic summing when both loudspeakers are presented with the same in-phase signal.

He appears in-game as a pupil of Master Eraqus who trains alongside his friends Aqua and Ventus to become a master of the Keyblade weapon. Terra's storyline highlights his struggle to tame his inner darkness, a negative attribute that serves as a source of both power and corruption for him. Prior to Birth by Sleep, he had a cameo appearance in a secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II and its re-release Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix; the later game included an optional boss fight against the , a hollow armor containing Terra's mind. Series director Tetsuya Nomura designed Terra's character when preparing the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix. He was developed to be reminiscent of series antagonist Xehanort as he appears in previous titles, as well as having a connection with Riku, one of the series' main characters. Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu has done the voice of Terra in Japanese and Jason Dohring in the English version. Video game publications gave mixed responses to Terra's character, with many noting his similarity to the Final Fantasy VII character Zack Fair, and later commenting on his naive portrayal in Birth by Sleep. Appearances An early character concept for Terra first appeared in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, titled \\"The Gathering\\" and \\"Birth by Sleep\\", respectively. Additionally, the latter game and remakes include the Lingering Will as an optional boss that is accessible upon clearing the game's story. The prequel Birth by Sleep introduces Terra as an apprentice Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure. Early in the game, Terra is denied the rank of Keyblade Master when his mentor and father figure, Master Eraqus, detects a strong presence of darkness in his heart. Disheartened, Terra is given a chance to redeem his failure when dispatched to eliminate an insurgence of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. Periodically, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to Terra to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism between him and his friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. Realizing the entire conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, Terra confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs to rage, allowing Xehanort to transplant his heart into the youth's body to prolong his own life. The process that turns Terra into Terra-Xehanort also transfers his disembodied mind into his discarded armor, becoming the Lingering Will that defeats Xehanort and remains in the Keyblade Graveyard. Following Terra-Xehanort's battle with Aqua, Terra's heart begins resisting Xehanort with the aid of Eraqus's heart, revealed to have entered Terra's own before his apparent death, while Xehanort ends up in an amnesic state by the time Ansem the Wise took him as an apprentice. Terra makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts Coded alongside various other suffering characters who are bound to Sora's heart. He is also mentioned in the secret ending of the remake Re:coded, where Mickey Mouse and Yen Sid discuss his and Ventus' whereabouts following the events of Birth by Sleep. Terra briefly appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, first during Sora's dream where Sora's friends, Riku and Kairi, are transformed into Terra and Aqua; and again when Sora declares his pride in being connected to many Keyblade wielders. A vision of Terra makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep ‚Äì A Fragmentary Passage, a part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, while Aqua explores the realm of darkness. In Kingdom Hearts III, Terra's restored body at the Keyblade Graveyard as one of Xehanort's thirteen \\"seekers of darkness\\" in his plan to open Kingdom Hearts, serving again as a vessel for Xehanort's heart from the past; the Lingering Will also appears, summoned by Namin√© after Sora uses the power of waking to undo his allies' initial defeat. During Sora, Aqua, and Ventus's battle against Terra-Xehanort, Terra's heart awakens from within Terra-Xehanort's \\"guardian\\" Heartless, which aids Sora in banishing Xehanort's heart and restoring Terra to his true self. After reuniting with Aqua and Ventus, and later aiding in keeping Kingdom Hearts closed, Terra releases Eraqus's heart and spirit, who persuades the dying Xehanort to surrender peacefully. Afterwards, Terra and his friends return home before joining their allies in celebration on the Destiny Islands. Terra's role from Birth by Sleep is reprised in Tomoko Tanemaki's light novels of the game. Additionally, the final chapter shows the Lingering Will fighting Sora from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix. Creation and development Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu voices Terra in Japanese. Although Terra, Ventus and Aqua first appeared in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II wearing armor, director Tetsuya Nomura still had not designed their final look, having only thought about their story. Despite not revealing their identities, Nomura still said that they are characters from the past from the Kingdom Hearts series. Following the release of the Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Nomura revealed a connection between them and the game's villain Xemnas, but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as he still could not reveal their identities. Terra's face was first shown in the 2006 Tokyo Game Show in which he was described as an avenger against Xehanort. Nomura also confirmed that the Lingering Will was connected with Terra. He also stated that his name, meaning \\"earth\\" from Latin, follows the \\"land\\" theme Riku represents, as well as connecting him with the other main characters' names from the series. In October 2007, Nomura was asked if the Lingering Will was actually Terra due to their similarities, but he responded it was still uncertain. When asked about the Will's true nature after being revealed to contain Terra's memories, Nomura stated it was not a Heartless. Nomura expressed that the fans liked the inclusion of the Will's battle due to his challenging difficulty, which led the staff to design another hard boss character for Birth by Sleep. Out of the three protagonists from Birth by Sleep, Terra's design was the only one Nomura decided on from the start, with Nomura stating Terra would be designed younger than shown in previous games. Japanese-inspired designs were incorporated into Terra's outfit based on the \\"master and apprentice\\" relationship featured in the game. Nomura had troubles designing Terra's, Ventus's and Aqua's armors due how they would be able to summon them. Therefore, an \\"X\\" was added to their clothes as a means of activating the armors as well as due to the fact it was one of the game's keywords. Ever since development of Birth by Sleep started, the staff already decided that the three stories would be told in separate scenarios, with Terra's story being the first one written. Nomura wrote Terra's conversation with Riku early on development, wishing to explain the reason for Riku's ability to use the Keyblade, and he requested the staff in charge to make it into the game. The staff also wanted to emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series, leading to the characters' interaction between the three scenarios. Nomura recommended players to first play as Terra in Birth by Sleep in order to understand the story better. Terra's gameplay was also described by Nomura as \\"heavy\\" in comparison to Ventus's and Aqua's. To expand the connection between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective were added to the game, though Nomura has stated that these scenes are not of a precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, the connection between both of them would be expanded. Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted an actor who sounded similar to Chikao ≈åtsuka, Xehanort's original voice actor, and Akio ≈åtsuka, Xehanort's current voice actor who also voiced the villain while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors. Reception Jason Dohring received negative critical response for his voicing Terra in the English dub When Terra's character was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found him to be very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII to the point where he wondered whether he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits. Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has received mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing. VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may know little about them due to their role in Kingdom Hearts II, but with Birth by Sleep, players will able to know about them. Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented that he did not understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he \\"can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion\\", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be \\"uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source.\\" Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game \\"won't turn out to be very pretty.\\" Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra \\"tortured and conflicted\\", but still criticizing the result. UGO Networks listed Terra's Helmet nineteenth on their list of \\"The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games\\", stating \\"For a minute, but only a minute, the two-horned helmet will get you feeling like the Keyblade is a viable weapon.\\" In a Famitsu poll, Terra was voted as the fifth most popular Kingdom Hearts character. Kimberly Wallace from Game Informer expected Terra, alongside his friends, to appear in Kingdom Hearts III.

It was the last song that he had written for them, but it had only been released as the B-side of the single \\"Kings of Speed\\", in March 1975.Kings of Speed at Discogs.com In May of that year, Lemmy was fired from Hawkwind and formed a new band, naming it after the song.

Most of the principal cast of the previous film returned for this installment. The story of Fantaghiro 2 tells the continuing adventures of the titular princess (Alessandra Martines), daughter of a king without a male heir (Mario Adorf). Fantaghiro fights for the heart of Prince Romualdo (Kim Rossi Stuart) against the wicked Black Witch (Brigitte Nielsen) who opposes their pure relationship and has cast her love spell over the prince.  Plot  Following the events of the first film, Princess Fantaghir√≤ and Prince Romualdo are due to be married. The Black Witch, an evil ruler of the Dark Kingdom, is disgusted by their love and wishes to destroy it, and to this end she kidnaps Fantaghir√≤'s father. The couple hold off their wedding so Romualdo can lead their army to save Fantaghir√≤'s father. On the journey to the Dark Kingdom, Romualdo and his men encounter Forest Elves and their Queen, who force them to submit to a series of tests to prove that their intentions are pure. Romualdo passes and the army continue on their way. They eventually reach the borders to the Dark Kingdom where they make camp for the night. As they;re resting, the Black Witch, magically disguised to look like Fantaghir√≤, arrives and gets Romualdo to kiss her. He faints and the evil queen takes him to her castle where she makes him her lover. Elsewhere, the real Fantaghir√≤ has decided to secretly go to the Dark Kingdom on her own. She cuts off her hair and travels with her horse Golden Mane and friend the White Witch who transforms herself into a goose. Along the way, she encounters bandits led by the Lemon Gobbler, but she manages to escape. When she arrives at Romualdo's camp, she finds it abandoned. Fantaghir√≤ enters the Dark Castle and learns that Romualdo's men have all been thrown in the dungeon. She negotiates with the Dark King to have a single duel between Fantaghir√≤ and the Dark Kingdom's champion to decide the victor, with the losing kingdom submitting to the other. The Dark King agrees but, Fantaghir√≤ is horrified to discover that she has to fight her beloved, Romualdo, who has been bespelled to forget all about her. While Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo are dueling, the Black Witch's minions Bolt and Lightning rebel against their mistress, poisoning her so she falls asleep. Bolt and Lightning release Romualdo's men, who subdue Romualdo, stopping him from killing Fantaghir√≤. The group flee from the castle, taking Romualdo, as well as the Dark King as a hostage. Everyone's able to escape the Dark Kingdom except Romualdo, who runs back to the Black Witch, and Fantaghir√≤, who goes after Romualdo. Fantaghir√≤ and the Witch have a face-off, with Fantaghir√≤ emerging victorious in a battle of wits and smashing the Witch into pieces. With the Black Witch gone, the Dark King is revealed to be Fantaghir√≤'s father, who was bewitched to forget his true self. However, Romualdo's memories do not return. Fantaghir√≤, with the help of the White Witch, recreates the events of the previous film where they crossed paths for the first time. Romualdo starts to regain his memories but in doing so, it's revealed that a residue remnant of the Black Witch has been hiding in his mind, and the witch reappears to transforms Fantaghir√≤ into a lowly creature off-screen. The White Witch comes to their rescue by shooting Lighting, who has transformed into an arrow, to finish-off the Black Witch and destroy her completely. Romualdo then guesses correctly that Fantaghir√≤ has been turned into an ugly toad, and upon kissing her, the two are reunited again.

It was shot in July 1992 at Bojnice Castle, Bouzov Castle, a park and an artificial castle in Lednice, and in-studio in Bratislava by a mixed Italian and Czechoslovak crew of over 100. The film's special effects were created by Armando Valcauda, known from his work on the horror film Demons and its sequels, and the costumes were designed by Marisa D 'Andrea. The production cost 6 billion Italian lira. Kim Rossi Stuart in 2007 Kim Rossi Stuart claimed that he enjoyed the role of the evil Romulado, nicknamed \\"Romul' altro\\" (\\"Romul 'other\\") by the film crew, saying that \\"naughty second identity\\" was more fun to play than the \\"sympathetic cliche\\" of an honest and fair Romualdo, and especially liking the scenes of him being intimate with Brigitte Nielsen's sultry Black Witch. During the filming of the fight between Romualdo and Fantaghiro, performed with no stunt doubles, his sword actually struck Alessandra Martines in the head, luckily causing no severe injury; Martines went to the hospital while still wearing her costume. Nielsen said her character was to be \\"more than a witch, but a queen, the type of Grimilde\\" from Disney's Snow White. √Ångela Molina, who has both played both the White Witch and the White Knight in the first Fantaghir√≤, was replaced by Katarina Kolajova for the second film; Kolajova later married Cataldo's actor Stefano Davanzati whom she met on the set. The film premiered on Canale 5, broadcast in two parts. The first part was originally scheluded for 21 December but was aired one day earlier to avoid the competition of the final episode of the sixth season of crime drama La piovra. The move sparked a \\"chain reaction\\" of programs being accordingly shuffled on other Italian channels. Fantaghir√≤ 2 was later dubbed into multiple languages for foreign television broadcasts and released on home video (VHS and DVD) in Italy and in several other countries. The film and its prequel and sequel were recut (reduced and intersected with each other) into a 200-minute compilation film titled La meravigliosa storia di Fantaghir√≤ (\\"The Wonderful Story of Fantaghir√≤\\") in 1995. Fantaghiro 2 proved to be a commercial success, receiving the audience of 6,601,000 (25.11%) (first part) and 9,160,000 (30,6%) (second part) when first aired in Italy. Polish weekly Tele Tydzie≈Ñ gave it three stars out of five. Italian daily Corriere della Sera hailed the film maker Lamberto Bava, saying he has learnt the lessons of his father and comparing his work to Ridley Scott's Legend, and also applauding Brigitte Nielsen for her \\"difficult\\" role as the Black Witch. Nielsen's character was received so well that the popular villainess later returned for three successive chapters of the saga. Critique Film's Erika Musiedlak retrospectively opined it was the last Fantaghir√≤ film worth watching, also praising Nielsen's \\"flawless\\" acting as a \\"marvelously diabolical\\" antagonist. Sequel In the 1993 sequel, Fantaghir√≤ fights against the handsome but cruel wizard Tarabas (Nicholas Rogers) and his mother, the witch Xellesia (Ursula Andress), to bring back to life the prince Romualdo, turned into a stone statue, and save the child princess Esmeralda.

It is directed by Lamberto Bava and stars Alessandra Martines as the title character. It originally aired on television in 1993 as a two-parter, and hence is alternately titled as a double-set of Fantaghir√≤ 5 and Fantaghir√≤ 6 in certain releases. Kim Rossi Stuart, who played the hero in the previous two films, returned in this film but his role was much reduced. In the film, Princess Fantaghir√≤ fights against the handsome but cruel wizard Tarabas (Nicholas Rogers) and his mother, the witch Xellesia (Ursula Andress), to bring back to life the prince Romualdo (Kim Rossi Stuart), turned into a stone statue, and save the child princess Esmeralda. Archenemy of Fantaghir√≤, the Black Witch (Brigitte Nielsen), also returns. Plot The evil wizard Tarabas has learned of a prophecy that a royal child no older than ten is destined to destroy his kingdom. Shocked to learn that he is not invincible, Tarabas sends his clay soldiers out to kidnap all the royal children of the world. His mother, Xellesia, disapproves of this, but Tarabas is obsessed with learning how he will be defeated. Among the children he targets are the babies of Catherine and Caroline, Fantaghir√≤'s sisters. Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo protect the babies from Tarabas's clay soldiers but, during the battle, Romualdo accidentally falls into a cursed river and turns into a statue. Fantaghir√≤ seeks the help of the Elf Queen to cure Romualdo, but she is told that only \\"The Impossible Kiss\\" by Tarabas can cure Romualdo. Fantaghir√≤ decides to track down Tarabas by following his clay soldiers. When she comes across the clay soldiers attacking another castle, she intervenes. However, she is too late to save the King who, with his dying breath, asks Fantaghir√≤ to take care of his daughter, Princess Esmeralda. Fantaghir√≤ agrees, and takes Esmeralda away to safety. Tarabas, who has learned about Fantaghir√≤'s quest, deliberately crosses paths with Fantaghir√≤ and Esmeralda as they are travelling in the forest. He claims to be a common traveler, and they agree to camp together for the night for safety. Although Esmeralda is suspicious, Fantaghir√≤ does not suspect anything. As they sleep, Tarabas is overcome with desire to kiss Fantaghir√≤, but as soon as he approaches her, he starts to transform into a hideous beast. Tarabas runs away from the camp, and as soon as he does, the transformation ceases and he returns to his human form. He is confronted by Xellesia, who explains that the dark magic within him does not allow him to fall in love, for as soon as he tries to kiss the one he desires, he will be transformed into a beast to devour them. Fantaghir√≤ and Esmeralda continue on their journey and are reunited with Lightning and Bolt who have a new plan to track down Tarabas. They decide to resurrect the evil Black Witch, who was destroyed in the previous film, and hold her heart hostage, promising to give her back her heart if she helps them find Tarabas. The witch reluctantly agrees, and leads them to Tarabas' underground lair. There, Fantaghir√≤ is shocked to learn that the man she befriended in the forest is the feared Tarabas. Tarabas agrees to give Fantaghir√≤ the Impossible Kiss if she will marry him. Fantaghir√≤ agrees. Tarabas chains himself up to prevent himself from devouring Fantaghir√≤ and they kiss. The magic of the Impossible Kiss is captured by the Black Witch, who promises to take it back to Romualdo. As Fantaghir√≤ is preparing to marry Tarabas, she is told by Lighting and Bolt that the witch has broken her promise, and the power of the Impossible Kiss is waning. Tarabas agrees to let Fantaghir√≤ go, if she will promise to return him. Fantaghir√≤ promises and chases after the Black Witch, but it is too late. Although Romualdo cannot be restored to life, Fantaghir√≤ keeps her promise and returns to Tarabas. But Tarabas has had a change of heart and lets Fantaghir√≤ go, realising that this is the only way to prove his love for her. A second Impossible Kiss is made when Tarabas kisses Esmeralda, whom he has also grown to care for. This second kiss revives Romualdo, the pair are finally married and they adopt Esmeralda as their daughter.

Tarabas' character was born from Romoli being a fan of the comic book series Dylan Dog, where a character of this name appears in one story. The film was filmed over six weeks of Summer 1993 in the former Czechoslovakia. Some of its special effects were created using computer-generated imagery resources similar to these used for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Kim Rossi Stuart categorically refused to reprise his role as Romualdo, so his character's scenes in the third and the fourth films were created using old footage, except two short scenes in the third film on which he grudgingly agreed on. Nicholas Rogers in the role of Tarabas also caused problems, as he had declared during his audition that he was able to ride horses but as soon as the shooting began, he could not even mount a horse. It was then soon realized he was also not good at acting; Bava said that for the scene where Rogers has to say \\"I love you\\", they had to make three shots and then combine them later. He also injured himself on the set and had to be taken to hospital while still wearing his costume. The Black Witch was originally supposed to be killed off in the second film, but the highly positive feedback from the public convinced Bava to bring her back for more films. The scene of her head being reanimated, as she had been crumbled into many small stones, was created by simply sticking her head from a hole in a coffee table. The film premiered on Canale 5 during Christmas 1993. It was later dubbed into multiple languages for foreign television broadcasts and released on home video (VHS and DVD) in Italy and in several other countries. Fantaghir√≤ 3 and both of its prequels were recut (reduced and intersected with each other) into a 200-minute compilation film titled La meravigliosa storia di Fantaghir√≤ (\\"The Wonderful Story of Fantaghir√≤\\") in 1995. Sequel In the next sequel, after a mysterious black cloud destroys Fantaghir√≤'s castle, she allies herself with Prince Parsel to track the cloud to its origins and stop whoever is casting it. The film featured very few returning characters from the previous films, and most notable is that Kim Rossi Stuart, the hero of the previous films, did not return at all.

Sousa ran against sitting Mississauga South MP Paul Szabo for the federal Liberal nomination in 2004, but was defeated in a tightly fought but amicable campaign. This would mark the start of a long-running rivalry between Sousa and Szabo for influence in that riding. In 2014 Sousa backed Sven Spengemann for the federal Liberal nomination against Szabo's preferred candidate, Julie Desjardins with Spengemann winning by only 19 votes as Szabo and Desjardins felt that the nomination was stolen. In the 2018 provincial election, Szabo backed PC party candidate Rudy Cuzzetto. https://www.electionprediction.org/2018_on/riding/63.php https://ipolitics.ca/2017/10/26/the-smell-coming-off-the-liberals-nomination- process-is-getting-hard-to-ignore/ Sousa ran for the federal Liberal nomination in Mississauga‚ÄîErindale in 2006 but was defeated as well. Sousa won the riding in the 2007 provincial election, defeating incumbent Tim Peterson. Formerly a Liberal, Peterson had crossed the floor in March 2007 to join the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC Party). Analysts had expected the vote to be extremely close, but Sousa ultimately won the riding with 46.8 per cent of the popular vote, a margin of just over 5,000 votes more than Peterson. He was re-elected in 2011 and 2014. He was appointed as a Parliamentary assistant to three different ministries before Dalton McGuinty promoted him to cabinet in 2010 as Minister of Labour.

In 2008, Sousa introduced a private member's bill to track and report industrial, commercial and institutional (IC&I;) waste. He also introduced a private member's resolution to improve Financial literacy education amongst youth. He also facilitated passage of the Payday Loans Act to protect Ontario consumers against predatory lending.

Sousa came in fifth place with 9.8% of the vote on the second ballot after which he withdrew to endorse Kathleen Wynne who went on to win the leadership of the party and the title of Premier of Ontario. In February 2013, when Wynne officially took over as Premier, she named Sousa as her Minister of Finance. In May 2013, Sousa also assumed the role of Management Board Chair when Harinder Takhar suffered a minor heart attack.

The Government of Ontario previously intended on introducing a provincial pension plan if the CPP was not expanded.https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/06/21/wynne-says-cpp- deal-means-no-need-for-ontario-pension-plan.html He has also led the establishment of the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulator.http://www.fin.gc.ca/n14/14-090-eng.asp Under Minister Sousa's mandate, the Trillium Trust was put in place to support the largest investment in public infrastructure in Ontario's history: $160 billion over 12 years, supporting 110,000 jobs across the province every year.https://news.ontario.ca/mof/en/2015/04/the-trillium-trust-and-moving- ontario-forward.html In February 2016, Sousa claimed the government intends to balance the $137 billion budget in 2017‚Äì18 following nine consecutive deficits for the province.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-budget-deficit- charles-sousa-nine-straight-1.3455967 Most recently, the 2016 Budget announced an improved deficit target of 4.3 billion in 2016‚Äì17, a return to balance in 2017‚Äì18 and continued balance in 2018‚Äì19.http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/ontariobudgets/2016/papers_all.pdf Since Sousa became Finance Minister in 2013 the provincial net debt has risen from $252.1 billionhttp://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/paccts/2013/13_ar.html to $305.2 billion.https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-accounts-ontario-2015-16 In November 2016, Sousa released the 2017 Fall Economic Statement, which continued to project a balanced budget in 2017‚Äì18, and projects a balance in 2018‚Äì19 and 2019‚Äì20. The statement also marked the eighth consecutive year that the government had beaten its deficit targets. The statement also announced a list of new initiatives, including the launch of previously announced initiatives like OHIP+, increased minimum wage, and supports for seniors. The statement announced new small business tax cuts, as well as cost- lowering initiatives and supports for business who hire young people. In June 2016, Sousa, through negotiations with the federal Ministry of Finance and other provinces, signed a deal to replace the planned ORPP with an enhanced CPP, The Ontario government, along with other provinces, had been pushing for an enhanced CPP since 2013, quoting studies showing that middle-class Canadians were not saving enough for retirement. The Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper did not want to discuss the idea. That lack of co-operation from Ottawa prompted Wynne to promise the ORPP, but she emphasized Ontario would abandon that plan if a deal to enhance the CPP could be reached. In November 2016, Sousa announced plans to create a new regulator in the province to consolidate and strengthen oversight of credit unions, mortgage brokers, provincial pension plans and provincially registered insurers. The creation of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) was a key recommendation of an expert panel on financial regulation convened by the Ontario government. In April 2017, Sousa released the 2017 Ontario Budget. As his government promised when elected in 2014, the budget was the Ontario's first balanced budget since the 2008 global recession. The budget announced new government initiatives like free prescription medications for everyone 24 and under (dubbed OHIP+), free tuition for 210,000+ post-secondary students, a %25 cut to energy bills via the Fair Hydro Plan, housing affordability measures through the Fair Housing Plan, the Ontario Seniors‚Äô Public Transit Tax Credit and increased investment for healthcare and education. Included in the budget, but announced previously, were initiatives like a plan to study basic income with pilot projects in 3 cities, and a pledge to open 100,000 new child-care spaces with a quarter of those spots set to open in 2017. On March 28, 2018, Sousa released the 2018 Ontario Budget: A Plan for Care and Opportunity. In the document, the Minister announced a new drug and dental coverage for Ontarians without employer health plans, free preschool child care for children aged two-and-a-half until junior kindergarten, billions in both hospital capital funding, and hundreds of millions in operational funding. Also included in the 2018 budget was new mental health funding, new home-care funding for seniors, and new funding for developmentally disabled adults, among other initiatives.

Released in 1994, it was directed by Lamberto Bava and stars Alessandra Martines as the title character. The film was released on television as a two-parter, and is known in some releases as Fantaghir√≤ 7 and Fantaghir√≤ 8. In Fantaghir√≤ 4, after a mysterious black cloud destroys Fantaghir√≤'s castle, she allies herself with Prince Parsel to track the black cloud to its origins and stop whoever is casting it. This film featured very few returning characters from the previous films, and most notable is that Kim Rossi Stuart, the hero of the previous films, did not return at all. In order to circumvent this, his character was written to accommodate a different actor, and footage of the first film was re-used for the finale. Plot A mysterious black cloud is travelling across the land, bringing death and destruction wherever it goes. Fantaghir√≤ is helping the people of her kingdom escape to safety when she crosses paths with young Prince Parsel. Parsel is chasing the black cloud because it took his castle, and he is trying to find a way to get it back. When the black cloud passes over Fantaghir√≤'s castle, it too disappears, so she joins with Parsel to search for the origins of the black cloud. They travel to the kingdom of Tohor where they discover that Tarabas, the reformed dark wizard, has been imprisoned and accused of conjuring the black cloud. Fantaghir√≤, who knows that he has renounced his evil ways, helps him escape. Fantaghir√≤, Tarabas, Parsel and Princess Angelica of Tohor (who has fallen in love with Tarabas) leave Tohor to track down the black cloud, which they discover is conjured by a powerful dark magician named Darken. Elsewhere, the evil Black Witch is struggling to revive her magical powers, which have become weak after she had helped Fantaghir√≤ in the previous film. She revives Tarabas' mother Xellesia, who was killed by her rebellious gnomes, and the two witches fly off to find Tarabas and prevent him from discovering the origins of the dark cloud. Fantaghir√≤ and her group have tracked the black cloud to Nekrad, a kingdom beneath a dormant volcano. There, they encounter a deformed man named Fiodor who tells them that the kingdom is ruled by Darken. Darken then emerges from Parsel's body, where he has been hiding from the very beginning. A fight ensues, and Fantaghir√≤ is killed. An enraged Tarabas attempts to kill Darken, but Xellesia arrives and stops him. It is then revealed that Darken is Tarabas' father, and the black cloud was part of an elaborate plot to bring Tarabas back to his evil ways. Darken promises to bring Fantaghir√≤ back to life if Tarabas will embrace his dark side again. Tarabas is reluctant, but Fiodor talks him into it. It is revealed that Fiodor is actually Romualdo, transformed by Darken into a hideous monster in order to torment him with never being able to return to Fantaghir√≤. Fiodor also makes Tarabas promise to take care of Fantaghir√≤. Tarabas finally agrees to become evil again if it means that Fantaghir√≤ can live, and Darken revives her. While Tarabas tries to convince Darken of his evil \\"honesty\\", Fantaghir√≤ conspires with Fiodor, Angelica and a revived Parsel to rescue the stolen castles from Darken's collection and escape from the underground kingdom. After Darken is temporarily subdued, Tarabas, Xellesia and a reluctant Black Witch join the group in escaping from Darken's kingdom. Along the way, Xellesia sacrifices herself so her son will be safe. Darken follows the group, and another fight ensues. In the end, Darken is defeated and Fantaghir√≤'s castle is restored to its full glory. Fantaghir√≤ has also realised that Fiodor is her beloved Romualdo. Fiodor tries to escape, embarrassed by his new form, but Fantaghir√≤ insists that she does not love him for his looks. Tarabas is touched by Fantaghir√≤'s devotion to Romualdo, and decides to move on with his life, promising Angelica that he will learn to love her. In the end, Fiodor transforms back into Romualdo (using edited footage from the first film), and the pair are reunited.

For Fantaghir√≤ 4, Kim Rossi Stuart (Romualdo) refused to take part in the film, forcing the writer Gianni Romoli had to create the film's plot in relation to the absence of Romualdo. The final scene where Romualdo back to having his likeness in front of the mirror was made using old footage played backwards and the part where he kisses Fantaghir√≤ the end is exactly the same scene in the final of the first film with modified dialogue. The saga Fantaghir√≤ ends with the fourth film. Fantaghir√≤ 5 is the beginning of a trilogy never completed, in which the protagonist would travel through several parallel worlds before being returned to her kingdom by Romualdo. Director Lamberto Bava said he had \\"two goals: to improve the quality and to renew the themes.\\" Alessandra Martines said, \\"I love the character of Fantaghir√≤, but I brought her to the doctor. The fact is that I found a new stimulus in an innovative screenplay: my heroine is still a crazy head, rebellious and mischievous, but she learned to be wiser.\\" Romoli, who wrote the story and the screenplay, said it have levels, the easiest being the archetypes and good feelings, and the other being \\"more complex and adulthood, sophisticated psychologically, involving identity conflicts of the characters.\\" His inspiration for the fourth film in the series was Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski's Three Colors: Blue: \\"Fantaghir√≤ has lost everything: family, castle, kingdom.

It had a population of 3,437 at the 2011 Census. The name of the village is not an ancient one; it first appears as a road-name on the Ordnance Survey 25\\" map of 1907. At that time Istead Rise was the only road in the region and led to Frog's Island at its western end. The name may be connected to a field-name, Highstead, appearing as plot 690 on the Northfleet tithe award of 1838. By road, it is east of London on the A2 road. The nearest railway station is away at Meopham (34 minutes from London Victoria). Istead Rise is from Ebbsfleet International for Eurostar services to Paris, Brussels and Lille. Southeastern commuter trains run on the high-speed track to London St Pancras (16 minutes away), stopping only at Stratford International. The new Linear Park, on the site of the old A2, is 15 minutes' walk away, 5 minutes by bike, and is suited to cycling, walking and jogging. At the Eastern end is Shorne Country Park. The new Cyclopark opened there in September 2012. Istead Rise Primary School provides education for children till the age of 11. In addition, on the site of the primary school, there are two nursery schools. St Barnabas Church (Church of England), founded in 1957, is located near the shops. There is a small parade of shops with an Indian restaurant, bakery, butcher, pharmacy, Co-op, hardware store and dry cleaner. On Lewis Road there are an hairdresser, florist and dentist. There is a GP surgery on Worcester Close. Istead Rise was a pig-farming community in the 1860s, situated in the North Downs pathway. A pig farm was on what is now the site of Istead Rise Primary School. Kent County Council bought the site for its school in the 1960s. Until then Istead Rise did not have a school as there were insufficient children in the area to make this viable. As well as a pig farm on Downs Road, there were orchards on what are now the Community Centre fields and the surrounding housing area. There was also a flower farm with large greenhouses around what is now Flower Hill House and Flowerhill Way. Frog Island is on the site of what is now Istead Rise Parade. Frog Island is also the name of the local Morris Men group. References to these can be found in the local history of Istead Rise The Rise of the Rise, by Ken Jones.

Playing career Born in Turin, Pantanelli spent his childhood in Parma, and began his footballing career with A.C. Reggiana, and from 1992 to 2006, he played for a host of other clubs, appearing in over 400 matches in the Serie C2, Serie C1, and Serie B, before making his Serie A debut in the 2006‚Äì07 season after Calcio Catania earned promotion to the premier division. After a feud with the club management, he moved to Avellino in the summer of 2007. Pantanelli is famous for his mane of hair kept out of his eyes with a baseball cap rather than the conventional headband. He has also captained Catania on a number of occasions. He is also well respected for his remarkable reflex saves, as well as his ability to save penalties. He is, however, also known to have made some high-profile blunders. Pantanelli has been compared to another Italian goalkeeper, Marco Storari, for a similar style of goalkeeping, as well as hairstyle. Storari, ironically spent much of his career with Sicilian rivals F.C. Messina =A.C. Reggiana= Pantanelli began his professional career with A.C. Reggiana 1919, in 1986. He spent 5 seasons playing within the club's youth system, and began to earn first team call-ups for the 1989‚Äì1990 Italian Lega Calcio season. He never earned a first team cap for the club, and was sold in July 1990 to Olbia Calcio. =Olbia Calcio ‚Äì Carpi F.C.= Following his official transfer to Olbia Calcio, Pantanelli soon became a vital part of the team, as after a quiet first season, the goalkeeper eventually earned a starting position, and went on to make 35 league appearances up until his 1994 summer transfer to fellow Serie C side Carpi F.C. 1909. Upon his transfer, the young net-minder managed to instantly break into the club's starting XI, and in just two full seasons with the team, Pantanelli made a very impressive 68 appearances for the club, in all competitions. At the conclusion of the 1995‚Äì96 season, he transferred to Serie A giants Inter Milan, following his impressive displays in the lower divisions. =F.C. Internazionale Milano= Following his impending transfer to the northern Italian giants, Pantanelli was signed as a reserve goalkeeper, and spent the entire 1996‚Äì1997 Serie A campaign on the bench. Without ever making an appearance for the nerrazzurri, Pantanelli soon returned to the lower divisions, returning to former club A.C. Reggiana in the summer of 1997. =Return to Reggio Emilia= Following his adventure with the Milan side, he returned to his youth club, and was surprisingly sent out on loan upon his arrival. He was loaned to A.S. Andria BAT, and in less than a full season, the keeper made 27 appearances, maintaining a starting position. Following the expiration of the loan deal, the 26-year-old Pantanelli returned to Reggiana. In between 1997 and 1999, the shot-stopper managed just 25 appearances, and was again sold in the summer of 1999. =A.C. Perugia= At the conclusion of his second spell with the Emilia-Romagna based Reggiana, Pantanelli was sold to A.C. Perugia, in Serie A, where he was again utilized as a reserve keeper, never making his Serie A debut, or even making a league appearance for the club, in less than one season. =Cosenza Calcio 1914= After another sub-par adventure in the Italian Serie A, Armando returned again to the lower divisions of the Lega Calcio, and joined Cosenza Calcio 1914 in 1999. It was here, where the goalie made a name for himself, and in just 2 seasons, he made over 65 appearances for the club, in all competitions, and was soon linked again to several Serie B clubs, and lesser Serie A clubs. With a hefty transfer link in the summer of 2001, he eventually moved to Sardinia with then-Serie B side Cagliari Calcio, for an undisclosed transfer fee. =Cagliari Calcio= With his permanent move to the club for the 2001‚Äì2002 Serie B season, Pantanelli instantly held down a guaranteed starting position, and eventually went on to make well-over 100 league appearances for the club, also appearing for the club in the Coppa Italia. He also helped to lead his team into the Serie A, but failed to make his Serie A debut, until the 2006‚Äì2007 Serie A season, with Sicilian giants, Calcio Catania. After spending 3 seasons in Sardinia with Cagliari, the 33-year-old keeper transferred to then-Serie B side, Calcio Catania. =Calcio Catania= Following his transfer to eastern Sicily in August 2004, and became the club's number goalkeeper, and eventually earned captaincy at the club. During his spell with the Sicilian giants, Pantanelli was an undisputed starter, ahead of Ciro Polito and Vitangelo Spadavecchia during the time. He led his club to promotion to the Serie A, following a 2nd-place finish in the Serie B 2005‚Äì06 season. During the 2006‚Äì2007 Serie A season, Pantanelli held down his starting place, but at the conclusion to the season, Pantanelli was involved in a controversy with the management of the club. =Catania Controversy= At the end of the 2006‚Äì2007 season Pantanelli was involved in a feud with Catania, accusing the club of bullying him into quitting the club by excluding him from training sessions and keeping him and two other players at a separate hotel at away games. In September 2007 he was allegedly implicated in a betting scandal. An inquest has been opened into betting involving Pantanelli, according to newspaper ‚ÄòLa Sicilia‚Äô. It is alleged that he placed bets on two games that ended with a negative result for Catania, supposedly due to mistakes made by Pantanelli. =Later years= As he was sent off the first team roster, Pantanelli had to find a new club where to play to. In summer 2007 he then joined Serie B club Avellino, but he did not manage to return to his highs, and the biancoverdi were ultimately relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione that year, but were eventually placed back in Serie B to fill the void left by the bankrupt FC Messina, who ultimately were relegated to Serie D. He was successively released for free by Avellino, and then signed by Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Paganese Calcio 1926. Coaching career In 2011, he passed his category 2 coaching exam.http://www.settoretecnico.figc.it/news.aspx?c=3‚âª=15&ssc;=36&n;=1739 References External links *http://aic.football.it/scheda/2000/pantanelli-armando.htm Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Turin Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Italian footballers Category:A.C.

A-weighting is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative loudness perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies. It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in dB. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A). Other weighting sets of values ‚Äì B, C, D and now Z ‚Äì are discussed below. The curves were originally defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended only for the measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phon), is now commonly used for the measurement of environmental noise and industrial noise, as well as when assessing potential hearing damage and other noise health effects at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation with occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech. It is also used when measuring low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States. In Britain, Europe and many other parts of the world, broadcasters and audio engineers more often use the ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the BBC and other organizations. This research showed that our ears respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C weightings were based are really only valid for pure single tones.  History  A-weighting began with work by Fletcher and Munson which resulted in their publication, in 1933, of a set of equal-loudness contours. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for sound level meters. This ANSI standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.  Deficiencies  A-weighting is valid to represent the sensitivity of the human ear as a function of the frequency of pure tones, but only for relatively quiet levels of sound. In effect, the A-weighting is based on the 40-phon Fletcher‚ÄìMunson curves which represented an early determination of the equal-loudness contour for human hearing. However, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation between the A scale and occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech, this scale is employed in many jurisdictions to evaluate the risks of occupational deafness and other auditory problems related to signals or speech intelligibility in noisy environments. Because of perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recently revised its standard curves as defined in ISO 226, in response to the recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher‚ÄìMunson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10‚Äì15 dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons that are not explained. Fortuitously, the 40-phon Fletcher‚ÄìMunson curve is particularly close to the modern ISO 226:2003 standard. Nevertheless, A-weighting would be a better match to the loudness curve if it fell much more steeply above 10 kHz, and it is likely that this compromise came about because steep filters were difficult to construct in the early days of electronics. Nowadays, no such limitation need exist, as demonstrated by the ITU-R 468 curve. If A-weighting is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present. Accurate measurements therefore require a 20 kHz low-pass filter to be combined with the A-weighting curve in modern instruments. This is defined in IEC 61012 as AU weighting and while very desirable, is rarely fitted to commercial sound level meters.  B-, C-, D- and Z-weightings  A-frequency-weighting is mandated by the international standard IEC 61672 to be fitted to all sound level meters and are approximations to the equal loudness contours given in ISO 226. The old B- and D-frequency-weightings have fallen into disuse, but many sound level meters provide for C frequency-weighting and its fitting is mandated  at least for testing purposes  to precision (Class one) sound level meters. D-frequency- weighting was specifically designed for use when measuring high level aircraft noise in accordance with the IEC 537 measurement standard. The large peak in the D-weighting curve is not a feature of the equal-loudness contours, but reflects the fact that humans hear random noise differently from pure tones, an effect that is particularly pronounced around 6 kHz. This is because individual neurons from different regions of the cochlea in the inner ear respond to narrow bands of frequencies, but the higher frequency neurons integrate a wider band and hence signal a louder sound when presented with noise containing many frequencies than for a single pure tone of the same pressure level. Following changes to the ISO standard, D-frequency-weighting should now only be used for non-bypass engines and as these are not fitted to commercial aircraft  but only to military ones  A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for light civilian aircraft measurements, while a more accurate loudness-corrected weighting EPNdB is required for certification of large transport aircrafthttp://www.icao.int/Meetings/EnvironmentalWorkshops/Documents/NoiseCertificationWorkshop-2004/BIP_2_2_jb.pdf Z- or ZERO frequency-weighting was introduced in the International Standard IEC 61672 in 2003 and was intended to replace the \\"Flat\\" or \\"Linear\\" frequency weighting often fitted by manufacturers. This change was needed as each sound level meter manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut- offs (-3 dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. It is a flat frequency response between 10 Hz and 20 kHz ¬±1.5dB. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with -3 dB points at 31.5 Hz and 8 kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk). B- and D-frequency-weightings are no longer described in the body of the standard IEC 61672 : 2003, but their frequency responses can be found in the older IEC 60651, although that has been formally withdrawn by the International Electro-technical Commission in favour of IEC 61672 : 2003. The frequency weighting tolerances in IEC 61672 have been tightened over those in the earlier standards IEC 179 and IEC 60651 and thus instruments complying with the earlier specifications should no longer be used for legally required measurements.  Environmental and other noise measurements  Label related to a portable air compressor A-weighted decibels are abbreviated dB(A) or dBA. When acoustic (calibrated microphone) measurements are being referred to, then the units used will be dB SPL referenced to 20 micropascals = 0 dB SPL. dBrn adjusted is not a synonym for dBA, but for dBa (in telecommunications dBa denotes \\"decibels adjusted\\" i.e. weighted absolute noise power, which has nothing to do with A-weighting). The A-weighting curve has been widely adopted for environmental noise measurement, and is standard in many sound level meters. The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include roadway noise, rail noise, aircraft noise). A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential hearing damage caused by loud noise. A-weighted SPL measurements of noise level are increasingly found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and computer fans. In Europe, the A-weighted noise level is used for instance for normalizing the noise of tires on cars. The A-weighting is also used for noise dose measurements at work. A noise level of more than 85 dB(A) each day increases the risk factor for hearing damage. Noise exposure for visitors of venues with loud music is usually also expressed in dB(A), although the presence of high levels of low frequency noise does not justify this.  Audio reproduction and broadcasting equipment  right Although the A-weighting curve, in widespread use for noise measurement, is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher- Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal- loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal- loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1 kHz and a downward tilt below 1 kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones. This enhanced sensitivity to noise in the region of 6 kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6 kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10 kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19 kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content. ITU-R 468 noise weighting was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness of all types of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI) and, , is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting are less accepted in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates. It is used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.  Function realisation of some common weightings  The standard defines weightings (A(f), C(f)) in dB units by tables with tolerance limits (to allow a variety of implementations). Additionally, the standard describes weighting functions R_X(f) to calculate the weightings. The weighting function R_X(f) is applied to the amplitude spectrum (not the intensity spectrum) of the unweighted sound level. The offsets ensure the normalisation to 0 dB at 1000 Hz. Appropriate weighting functions are: =A= :\\\\begin{align} R_A(f) &= {12194^2 f^4 \\\\over \\\\left(f^2 + 20.6^2\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(f^2 + 107.7^2\\\\right)\\\\left(f^2 + 737.9^2\\\\right)}\\\\ \\\\left(f^2 + 12194^2\\\\right)}\\\\ ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] A(f) &= 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_A(f)\\\\right) - 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_A(1000)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_A(f)\\\\right) + 2.00 \\\\end{align} =B= : \\\\begin{align} R_B(f) &= {12194^2 f^3\\\\over \\\\left(f^2 + 20.6^2\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(f^2 + 158.5^2\\\\right)} \\\\ \\\\left(f^2 + 12194^2\\\\right)}\\\\ ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] B(f) &= 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_B(f)\\\\right) - 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_B(1000)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_B(f)\\\\right) + 0.17 \\\\end{align} =C= :\\\\begin{align} R_C(f) &= {12194^2 f^2 \\\\over \\\\left(f^2 + 20.6^2\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\left(f^2 + 12194^2\\\\right)}\\\\ ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] C(f) &= 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_C(f)\\\\right) - 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_C(1000)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &\\\\approx 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_C(f)\\\\right) + 0.06 \\\\end{align} =D= : \\\\begin{align} h(f) &= \\\\frac{\\\\left(1037918.48 - f^2\\\\right)^2 + 1080768.16\\\\,f^2}{\\\\left(9837328 - f^2\\\\right)^2 + 11723776\\\\,f^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] R_D(f) &= \\\\frac{f}{6.8966888496476 \\\\cdot 10^{-5}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{h(f)}{\\\\left(f^2 + 79919.29\\\\right)\\\\left(f^2 + 1345600\\\\right)}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D(f) &= 20\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(R_D(f)\\\\right). \\\\end{align}  Transfer function equivalent The gain curves can be realised by the following s-domain transfer functions. They are not defined in this way though, being defined by tables of values with tolerances in the standards documents, thus allowing different realisations: =A= :H_A(s) \\\\approx {k_A \\\\cdot s^4 \\\\over (s + 129.4)^2\\\\quad(s + 676.7)\\\\quad (s + 4636)\\\\quad (s + 76655)^2} :kA ‚âà 7.39705√ó109 =B= :H_B(s) \\\\approx {k_B \\\\cdot s^3\\\\over(s + 129.4)^2\\\\quad (s + 995.9)\\\\quad (s + 76655)^2} :kB ‚âà 5.99185√ó109 =C= :H_C(s) \\\\approx {k_C \\\\cdot s^2\\\\over(s + 129.4)^2\\\\quad (s + 76655)^2} :kC ‚âà 5.91797√ó109 =D= :H_D(s) \\\\approx {k_D \\\\cdot s \\\\cdot \\\\left(s^2 + 6532 s + 4.0975 \\\\times 10^7\\\\right)\\\\over(s + 1776.3)\\\\quad (s + 7288.5)\\\\quad \\\\left(s^2 + 21514 s + 3.8836 \\\\times 10^8\\\\right)} :kD ‚âà 91104.32 The k values are constants which are used to normalize the function to a gain of 1 (0 dB). The values listed above normalize the functions to 0 dB at 1 kHz, as they are typically used. (This normalization is shown in the image.)

It originally aired in 1991 as a two-parter, and hence has been known in certain video releases and airings as double-set of Fantaghir√≤ 1 and Fantaghir√≤ 2 (not to be confused with the sequel, Fantaghir√≤ 2). It is the first installment in the Fantaghir√≤ series and is loosely based on the Italian folktale Fanta-Ghiro the Beautiful. Plot For many centuries two kingdoms have been at war at each other, though neither side remembers what the war is for. In one of the kingdoms, the warrior king has three daughters: Catherine, Caroline and Fantaghir√≤. Although Catherine and Caroline are well-behaved princesses, Fantaghir√≤ is outspoken, rebellious, and longs to fight in battle. She constantly argues with her father and two sisters who disapprove of her behaviour. Fantaghir√≤ secretly learns to fight when she befriends the White Knight, a mysterious warrior whom she meets in the forest. As they are training, she briefly crosses paths with Romualdo, the newly-crowned king ruler of the neighbouring enemy kingdom. Romualdo is enchanted by Fantaghir√≤'s eyes, but is unaware that they belong to the daughter of his sworn enemy. Romualdo is tired of the war and sends an offer of a single duel to determine the outcome. Fantaghir√≤'s father is told by the magical White Witch that only one of his daughters can win that duel. Seeing no other option, the King commands his three daughters to disguise themselves as male knights so they may fight Romualdo. Fantaghir√≤ relishes the opportunity and cuts her hair to make her look like a boy, but Catherine and Caroline are fearful. While traveling to Romualdo's kingdom, the three sisters argue about the wisdom of their fighting, and Catherine and Caroline decide that their youngest sister is the most qualified to win. Catherine and Caroline return to their father and Fantaghir√≤ continues on her journey. Fantaghir√≤ eventually meets with Romualdo, who is confused when he recognises her eyes. After various attempts by Romualdo to discover her true gender by trickery, they eventually battle and Fantaghir√≤ emerges victorious. However, she cannot kill him and returns home in shame. Fantaghir√≤'s father, who is proud of what his daughter has achieved, forgives her. The King also allows Romualdo to continue to rule his people, on the condition that he marry one of the three princesses. Although at first Romualdo is hesitant to agree, when he sees Fantaghir√≤ dressed up as a woman, the two kiss happily. Cast * Alessandra Martines as Fantaghir√≤ * Mario Adorf as King * Kim Rossi Stuart as Romualdo * √Ångela Molina as the White Witch (White Knight/White Goose) * Jean-Pierre Cassel as The General * Stefano Davanzati as Cataldo * Tom√°≈° Val√≠k as Ivaldo * Ornella Marcucci as Catherine * Kate≈ôina Bro≈æov√° as Caroline * Stanislava Barto≈°ov√° as Governess Production and release Inner courtyard of Bouzov Castle (Fantaghir√≤'s castle) in 2012 Fantaghir√≤ was inspired by Italian fairy tales collected by Italo Calvino and was shot in locations at Bouzov Castle, Pern≈°tejn Castle, and Lednice in Czechoslovakia. Initially Fantaghir√≤ was to be a single film but the production costs were excessive and so it was decided to make it into a miniseries. The first film has been finished in 1990, but it was then shelved for a whole year; the sequels were approved when it turned out to be a success. The film was originally aired on Canale 5 on 22 December 1991. Upon its Italian premiere, it was the most watched program of that evening, with over six and a half million viewers (27.50% market share). Kim Rossi Stuart's role as Romualdo gained him a national popularity. Sequel In the 1992 sequel, the love of Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo is opposed by the evil Black Witch (Brigitte Nielsen), who steals the prince for herself and plots to eliminate the princess. Both films and the third sequel were later recut (reduced and intersected with each other) into a 200-minute compilation film titled La meravigliosa storia di Fantaghir√≤ (\\"The Wonderful Story of Fantaghir√≤\\") in 1995.

Early career On the completion of his articles in London with George Morgan, he crossed the Channel, and, after a short term in the office of a French architect, established himself in Paris. He met influential clients, who commissioned him renovation of old chateaus including Ch√¢teau de Bizy (fr) and Ch√¢teau de Martinvast (fr). At the time, White received an architect pupil, Charles Alfred Chastel de BoinvileObituary C.A.C. de Boinville, Journal of Riyal Institute of British Architect, 1896. After the Franco-Prussian War broke out, White returned to the Britain and found new job in India through his father connection, where he entered the Public Works Department of the Indian GovernmentSource 2.. He designed several important buildings, such as the Court of Small Causes at Calcutta (illustrated in The Builder, 23 March 1878), the Monument to Chief Justice Norman, and the Presidency College. After travelling in India and on the Continent, White returned to London and took up journalistic work, contributing his articles to The Builder. About this time he was appointed the Examiner in Architecture at the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper‚Äôs Hill, a post be occupied for about two years. RIBA Secretaryship The Secretaryship of this Royal Institute became vacant in 1878 through the retirement of Charles Eastlake, the present Keeper and Secretary of the National Gallery. White gained the post, and served his time eighteen years‚Äîan era in the progress of the Institute marked by increased influence at home and abroad, and a necessarily more extended system of administration. A glance at any of the official publications at the period when White entered upon his duties, put in comparison with any recent number of the JOURNAL, or a volume of the TRANSACTIONS issued till within the last three years, will suffice to show the amount of increased responsibility imposed upon the Secretary as Editor of all the Institute publications. Works In 1892, he published \\"The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art\\" in reply to \\"Architecture, a Profession or an Art\\" edited by Norman Shaw and T. G. Jackson. This had been part of the course of events which resulted in the passing of the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938 which established the statutory Register of Architects and monopolistic restrictions on the use of the vernacular word \\"architect\\", imposed with threat of penalty on prosecution for infringement. The keeping of the Register of Architects is now governed by the Architects Act 1997, and the name of the body responsible for the Register has been changed from the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) to the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

He had previously served Li Shimin's elder brother, Li Jiancheng, with whom Li Shimin was locked in an intense rivalry during the reign of their father, Emperor Gaozu, but after Li Shimin killed Li Jiancheng and then took the throne, he knew that Wang was faithful to Li Jiancheng and was capable, and therefore retained him, eventually making him chancellor. Wang was known for his honest and blunt criticism of the emperor, and for that was honored by Taizong, who appreciated such criticism.  Background  Wang Gui was born in 571, during the reign of Northern Qi's emperor Gao Wei. His grandfather Wang Sengbian had been a major general and later regent of Liang Dynasty, who, at one point, in order to make peace with Northern Qi, sent Wang Gui's father Wang Yi (ÁéãÈ°ó) and grandmother to Northern Qi as hostages. After Wang Sengbian was killed in a coup by the general Chen Baxian (who later founded Chen Dynasty) in 555, Wang Yi remained in Northern Qi and served as a commandery governor. In 573, after the former Liang general Wang Lin, with whom Wang Yi shared the desire of destroying Chen and reestablishing Liang, was killed by the Chen general Wu Mingche, Wang Yi, in great distress in mourning Wang Lin, died. Wang Gui, having lost his father early in his life, was said to be elegant in his behavior, having few desires and comfortable in his poverty, and not making friends easily with just anyone. His uncle Wang Po (ÁéãÈ†ó) was a highly regarded scholar at that time and was said to be a good judge of character, and Wang Po once commented, \\"Our clan's hopes all rest on this child.\\"  During Sui Dynasty  Near the end of the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui, Wang Gui served as a low-level imperial official in charge of ceremonies. After Emperor Wen died in 604, his crown prince Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Another son of Emperor Wen, Yang Liang the Prince of Han, on whose staff another uncle of Wang Gui's, Wang Kui (ÁéãÈ†ç), served, rose in rebellion against Emperor Yang, and after he was defeated, Wang Kui committed suicide, and Wang Po was executed. Based on the laws of the time, Wang Gui was to be executed as well, but he fled into the Qinling Mountains and remained in hiding there for more than a decade. In 617, the general Li Yuan rose against Emperor Yang, and later that year captured the capital Chang'an, declaring Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong) but retaining power himself as regent. Li Yuan's staff member Li Gang (ÊùéÁ∂±) recommended Wang Gui, as he knew Wang Gui's capabilities. Li Yuan made Wang Gui a military advisor to his heir apparent Li Jiancheng.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  In 618, after news arrived at Chang'an that Emperor Yang had been killed in a coup at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) led by the general Yuwen Huaji, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He created Li Jiancheng crown prince, and Wang Gui continued to serve on Li Jiancheng's staff as a trusted advisor. In 622, with Tang having mostly reunited the former Sui territory under its rule due to the contributions of Li Jiancheng's younger brother Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, Li Shimin's fame and power thus threatened Li Jiancheng's position. Wang and Wei Zheng, another advisor to Li Jiancheng, suggested that he should also try to establish some military achievement of his own and also recruit capable people to serve on staff during the campaign. Li Jiancheng agreed, and volunteered to attack one of the remaining threats against Tang rule, Liu Heita the Prince of Handong. Li Jiancheng subsequently defeated Liu, who was then betrayed by his own subordinate Zhuge Dewei (Ë´∏ËëõÂæ∑Â®Å) in 623 and delivered to Li Jiancheng, who executed Liu. Subsequently, in 624, when Li Jiancheng was suspected of having recruited his personal guards against regulations and having encouraged his guard commander Yang Wen'gan (Ê•äÊñáÂππ) into rebelling, Emperor Gaozu briefly considered deposing Li Jiancheng and replacing him with Li Shimin, but changed his mind after intercession by the chancellor Feng Deyi, another son Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, and his concubines (who were on much better relations with Li Jiancheng than with Li Shimin). However, he blamed Li Jiancheng's and Li Shimin's staff members for encouraging their rivalry, and he exiled Wang Gui, Wei Ting (ÈüãÊå∫, another of Li Jiancheng's advisors), and Du Yan (an advisor to Li Shimin) to Xi Prefecture (Â∑ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan), blaming them for the discord between his sons. In 626, Li Shimin ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and killed them, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince. Rather than slaughtering Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's staff members, as some of his supporters had suggested, he retained many of them for his administration, including Wei Zheng. He also recalled Wang Gui and Wei Ting from exile, making them advisors. When many of Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's supporters nevertheless fled in fears of reprisals and were captured by those who believed that they could received awards, Wang informed this to Li Shimin, who then issued an order not to carry out any reprisals against the followers of Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, or their cousin Li Yuan (ÊùéÁëó, note different tone and character from Emperor Gaozu's name) the Prince of Lujiang (who had supported Li Jiancheng and considered rebelling in light of Li Jiancheng's death). Soon, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin (as Emperor Taizong). Wang continued to serve in Emperor Taizong's administration.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Later in 626, Emperor Taizong had Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji reburied with honors due imperial princes. Wang Gui and Wei Zheng requested permission to accompany Li Jiancheng's funeral procession, and Emperor Taizong approved‚Äîand further expanded the approval to an order that all of Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's staff members participate in the funeral processions. In 627, on an occasion, Emperor Taizong stated to his high-level officials: :When a good emperor encountered evil subordinates, the empire will not prosper. When an evil emperor encountered good subordinates, the empire will also not prosper. But if an emperor and his subordinates were like fish and water, the empire will have peace. Emperor Gaozu of Han was but a farmer, but he conquered the empire carrying just a short sword. His foundation was strong, and his descendants ruled for generations, because he had good subordinates. Even though I am not an intelligent ruler, it is fortunate that I have you, Dukes, to save me occasion after occasion. I hope that you will give me good strategies to allow the empire to remain peaceful. Wang responded: :I heard that if a tree follows a rope it will be straight, and if an empress followed suggestions she would be holy. Therefore, the ancient holy rulers always had seven advisors who were willing to speak honestly and willing to die if their suggestions were not followed. Your Imperial Majesty is willing to receive our weed-like suggestions, and I happen to be serving here in an administration that has no taboos. I am willing to offer my wild words. Emperor Taizong approved of Wang's response and ordered that whenever high-level officials would meet with him to discuss important matters of state, officials whose responsibilities were criticism should follow them in. He treated Wang with kindness, creating him the Baron of Yongning and made him the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) as well as an advisor for his son and crown prince Li Chengqian. Later that year, the head of the examination bureau, Gao Shilian, was demoted after he withheld a petition from Wang, and in 628, Emperor Taizong made Wang the acting head of the examination bureau instead‚Äîa post considered as one for a chancellor. On an occasion in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang and who was taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong stated, \\"The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. He killed her husband and seized her. How could he survive long after this barbarous act!\\" Wang instead responded, \\"Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?\\" Emperor Taizong responded, \\"Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?\\" Wang responded, \\"I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo [formerly an independent state], he asked the seniors of Guo, \\"Why was Guo destroyed?\\" The seniors stated, \\"The lord of Guo knew right from wrong.\\" Duke Huan responded, \\"If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. Why was he destroyed?\\" The seniors responded, \\"The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. That was why he was destroyed.\\"' Now, this woman is still by your side. I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. If you believe that this is wrong, you are the one who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it.\\" Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (Á•ñÂ≠ùÂ≠´) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen. In 630, Emperor Taizong officially made Wang the head of the examination bureau. On an occasion that year, at a feast Emperor Taizong held for the chancellors, he stated to Wang, \\"You are known for your good judgment, and you are also a good speaker. Please, starting with Fang Xuanling, discuss what these officials' strengths are.\\" Wang responded: :As far as being careful and being dedicated to the state, and doing everything that he felt was right, I am not as capable as Fang Xuanling. As far as being capable in both civilian and military matters  being a great general while not at the capital and being a chancellor while in the capital  I am not as capable as Li Jing. As far as writing imperial edicts and reporting on important matters, doing so in detail and clearly with fair analysis, I am not as capable as Wen Yanbo. As far as handling complicated issues and emergency matters well, I am not as capable as Dai Zhou. As far as always wishing that the emperor can be compared to Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun and viewing correcting the emperor as his responsibility, I am not as capable as Wei Zheng. But as far as eliminating those lacking virtues and abilities, promoting those who are capable and virtuous, hating evil, and liking righteousness, this is my strength compared to the gentlemen here. Emperor Taizong agreed strongly, and those present also agreed this as fair analysis. Wang further advocated ruling the state by Confucian principles, a position that Emperor Taizong agreed with. Soon, Emperor Taizong upgraded his title to duke. In 633, Wang was accused of leaking state secrets, and he was demoted to the post of prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi). In 634, Emperor Taizong recalled him to be the minister of ceremonies. In 637, he finished compiling a work on proper ceremonies, and for this contribution Emperor Taizong awarded him with silk and created one of his sons a baron. That year, he was also made the teacher of Emperor Taizong's favorite son Li Tai the Prince of Wei. By Emperor Taizong's orders, Li Tai treated Wang with honors due a teacher, and Wang also accordingly treated Li Tai as a student. Also around the time, Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Nanping was due to marry Wang's son Wang Jingzhi (ÁéãÊï¨Áõ¥). At those times, the customs were that when a princess married into an official's household, her parents-in-law were to bow to her. Wang believed this to be improper‚Äîthat princesses needed to be in their proper roles as daughters-in-law, and therefore he instead accepted bows from Princess Nanping. After this, it became customary for princesses to bow to their parents-in-law. Similarly, in 638, Wang submitted a petition pointing out that it was improper to have the high-level officials bow to imperial princes and that it should be the reverse‚Äîa suggestion that Emperor Taizong was initially offended by and resisted, but after Wei Zheng pointed out that this would reduce speculations that imperial princes would take the place of the crown prince, Emperor Taizong approved Wang's suggestion. It was said that when Wang was young and received help from others, he would not thank them. However, after he became an honored official, he sought those who had helped him in the past and repaid them greatly‚Äîand if they had died already, repaid their families. He was kind in supporting his widowed sister- in-law and his nephews, and often helped clan members who were less fortunate. However, he was also criticized for not building an ancestral temple, instead only sacrificing to the ancestors privately at home. At one point, he was thus accused by other officials of being not filially pious. Emperor Taizong did not punish him, but had the ministry of constructions construct a temple for Wang to shame him. In 639, Wang grew ill. Emperor Taizong ordered Princess Nanping to attend to him, and also sent Tang Jian the minister of census to look after Wang's meals and medicines. Wang soon died, and Emperor Taizong mourned him. Emperor Taizong also sent Li Tai and the officials to attend Wang's wake.

Housed in a former dairy, it was founded by recording engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood. The studio became well known as the place where many of the folk-rock acts signed to Joe Boyd's Witchseason publishing company, such as Fairport Convention, Nick Drake and John Martyn, recorded their albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was also the studio where early records by Pink Floyd, Elton John and Jethro Tull were made.  History  Geoff Frost and John Wood had both been working at Levy's Sound Studio in the centre of London. When studio owner Morris Levy sold the studio in 1964, the pair decided that they would start their own studio. Frost left Levy's in September 1964 and began looking for premises for the studio while the pair raised funds to start the company. They registered the name of the company in December 1964, with Wood explaining to Sound on Sound magazine in 2008 where the name came from: Frost eventually found a property that had been a former dairy located at 46a Old Church Street, Chelsea, London, with both the first and second floors available to lease. Wood left Levy's and the pair knocked out the middle of the second floor to obtain a high ceiling from the first floor in the centre of the room, and created a workshop and a control room from the two remaining sections of the second floor, both accessed via stairways from the first floor. With a limited budget, Wood and Frost designed and built most of the equipment themselves, utilising Frost's experience as chief engineer at Levy's. The studio opened its doors for business in mid-1965. In addition to building the mixing desk at Sound Techniques, Frost and his team manufactured desks for other studios such as the Music Centre and Trident Studios. The early desks were made in the workshop above the Sound Techniques recording studio, and whenever recording was in progress a red light would go on in the workshop and work would stop. In 1969 manufacturing would move to a mass production facility at a small factory in Mildenhall, Suffolk. Sound Techniques gained a reputation for the sound it could obtain for string sections, following a commission from composer Philip Green. The studio also began to gain regular work from Elektra Records, and Wood became friends with Elektra's UK office manager, Joe Boyd. When Boyd started his Witchseason production company and signed with Island Records, many of his artists also recorded at Sound Techniques, notably Nick Drake and Fairport Convention (and the subsequent records made by the group's former members such as Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny). Other acts also recorded at Sound Techniques in their early days before finding fame. The first two singles by Pink Floyd, \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\", were both recorded at Sound Techniques in 1967. Jethro Tull's debut album This Was was recorded at Sound Techniques in 1968. In 1970 during his early career as a session musician, Elton John recorded an album of songs written by the artists on Witchseason, as an attempt to make them more widely known through a more commercial style. The studio closed in 1976 when the lease on the building ran out and Frost and Wood were unable to purchase the property due to lack of funds. As of 2018 a documentary film about the studio is in production, directed by Neil Innes and Nick Turner and provisionally titled The Parts You Don't Hear.

The society he found there failed to live up to his idealistic expectations, but he explained such elements away as deviations from God's plan for Cameroonians and the belief that God would punish those French people whom he found cruel or exploitative. Nevertheless, when Pouka returned to Cameroun in the 1950s, his poems were increasingly characterised by a \\"vague uneasiness\\". Pouka struggled to reconcile his belief in French culture and equality and his realisation that colonialism did not allow for the equality of Africans and Europeans.

The film stars Lou Taylor Pucci, Zooey Deschanel, and Jena Malone. In the film, 19-year-old Mercer (Pucci) steals a stranger's car to embark on a road trip to find his estranged brother and tell him that their mother has died. He communicates with the car's owner, Kate (Deschanel), via her cell phone while he travels. The story was based partially on Hynes's own experiences. After his mother died, and his marriage ended, he took a road trip of his own and wrote \\"different things,\\" some of which came together in the script for The Go-Getter. Before production began, Hynes and three other crew members traveled to almost every location visited in the film to perform a test shoot, trying various filming styles and techniques. Filming took place between October and November 2005 in Oregon, Nevada, California, and Mexico. Singer and guitarist M. Ward provided most of the music for the film, complemented by songs from The Black Keys, Elliott Smith, The Replacements, and Animal Collective. The Go-Getter debuted on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was given a limited theatrical release on June 6, 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment. Its run lasted just three days, and it grossed only US$11,931. Critics were divided in reaction to the film; some praised the performances, the dialogue and the cinematography, while others thought it was unoriginal, forgettable, and poorly acted. Plot One ordinary day, 19-year-old Mercer White (Lou Taylor Pucci) steals a Volvo station wagon from a car wash, and leaves Eugene, Oregon to find his estranged half-brother Arlen, who is unaware that their mother has recently died. Soon after leaving, a cell phone in the car rings, and Mercer finds himself talking to the owner of the car, Kate (Zooey Deschanel), who lends him her car on the condition that he calls regularly to describe his trip to her. Mercer travels to a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that he moved to Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada to meet up with the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the director (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande √† parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car. Mercer talks to Kate while driving, imagining her sitting in the back seat of the car, but she hangs up in jealousy when he mentions Joely for the first time. He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays as part of her probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more amicably, and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes. Production =Development= Zooey Deschanel was cast against her previous types as a \\"glamour girl\\" Writer-director Martin Hynes referred to the film as \\"very uncomfortably autobiographical\\". He had learned that his mother was diagnosed with cancer when making his 1999 film The Big Split. His marriage ended soon after his mother died, which Hynes saw as \\"a huge amount of loss\\". After deciding that \\"I have to do less,\\" he took a road trip, spending much of his time writing as he traveled. He wrote \\"really different things\\", some of which were pieced together and led to his script for The Go- Getter, which he wrote in 2004. Within six months of the script's completion, producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly had raised the entire budget of the film without any actors attached at the time. Barzun Donnelly recommended to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci for the lead role of Mercer, believing that he was \\"perfect\\". Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that \\"We'd be so lucky to have him.\\" He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway in less than a week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles to have lunch with him. Hynes said of the meeting, \\"I think we really [got] each other,\\" and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she \\"loved the script\\" and was keen to play \\"a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation\\"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they \\"read [the script] and really liked it\\". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a \\"glamour girl\\" and Malone as a sexually mature woman. =Filming= A scene with Pucci and Malone was filmed at the Reno Arch. Four months before filming began, Hynes asked Barzun Donnelly to set US$20,000‚Äì25,000 aside from the film's budget so that he could perform a test shoot. Hynes, cinematographer Byron Shah, a camera assistant, and a stand-in for Mercer‚Äîas Pucci had not yet been cast‚Äîtraveled to every location in the film except for Mexico. Over , they shot of film, testing different filters, lenses, film stocks, and shooting styles. Hynes wrote an 85-page shot list, \\"scop[ing] out\\" the entire film. He called the test shoot an \\"incredible boon\\" and remarked that \\"Not one frame of it ended up on the movie, but it paid for itself time and time again.\\" After returning to Los Angeles, he visited each of the locations (including Mexico) again with the principal and technical crews. Principal photography began in mid-October 2005 and continued through November over a total period of 25 days. The film was shot in sequence, with production starting in Eugene, Oregon and then moving to Reno, Nevada and subsequently Ensenada, Mexico. Hynes called the filming \\"a high-wire act the whole way\\", and said that one of the biggest challenges was transporting the crew of 40 from Oregon to Mexico, sometimes changing locations twice a day with few hours of daylight. A crew member lost the project's Filming Permit on the last day of shooting in Mexico, and filming at rush hour was halted by the police. Hynes took a smaller camera to film several blocks away from the original set, but the second assistant director soon arrived warning that the police were coming and that they would be taken to prison because they did not have the paperwork for filming. Hynes and the crew \\"scatter[ed]\\", leaving Pucci alone further down the street, which Hynes claims is his strangest experience in the film industry. The crew later returned to Los Angeles to shoot final scenes and to commence post-production. =Music= Hynes described M. Ward's music as \\"Mercer's sound\\". When searching for the film's music, one of the producers suggested to Hynes that he go to a Bright Eyes concert. Singer and guitarist M. Ward opened the show as a supporting act, and Hynes recalled thinking, \\"Holy shit! That's the guy. That's it. He's perfect!\\" Hynes sent an unsolicited script of the film to Ward, who read it and signed on to the project when there was no financing behind the film nor any actors attached. He told Hynes that any of his songs could be used in the film; Hynes said that, in post-production, he tested every one of Ward's songs, including instrumental versions, in the final cut. In the beginning of the film, Mercer comes across a band; Hynes had always intended for whichever song they were playing to become the overture of the film. Ward's song \\"Vincent O'Brien\\" became that overture, and described the continuous presence of Ward's music as \\"a reminder of home\\". He decided that when Joely entered \\"it was right to step away from Mercer's sound‚ÄîM. Ward‚Äîand [convey] that this movie has been overtaken by forces outside his control,\\" using The Black Keys' \\"10 A.M. Automatic\\" and \\"Keep Me\\" in addition to The Replacements' \\"Color Me Impressed\\". Hynes was able to obtain, at a low cost, \\"Banshee Beat\\" by Animal Collective and the late Elliott Smith's song \\"Coast to Coast\\", after writing a \\"heartfelt letter\\" to Smith's mother and sister, his main estate holders. He also used \\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\" by novelty singer Corn Mo at the insistence of Nick Offerman, who plays three minor roles in the film. The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward's \\"One Life Away\\" as an \\"old-timey instrumental\\" for one of Mercer's dreams, an homage to a dancing sequence seen in Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film Bande √† part. For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of \\"When I Get to the Border\\" from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight. The pair found themselves \\"mutually charmed\\", according to The New York Times Melena Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack. Distribution =Theatrical release= The world premiere of The Go-Getter was held on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was subsequently screened at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival, Waterfront Film Festival, Nantucket Film Festival, Hamburg Film Festival, Austin Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, and the Prague Febiofest. Peace Arch Entertainment bought the film's distribution rights and it was given a limited release on June 6, 2008 in selective theatres in New York City, Santa Monica and Irvine, California, and Portland, Oregon. The film's release was withdrawn on June 8, its theatrical run lasting only three days. On its only open weekend, the film earned US$11,931 across six locations with a per-screen average of $2,386. The Go-Getter placed 512th for the highest-grossing films of 2008 and 375th for the year's highest-grossing opening weekends. =Home media= The Go-Getter was released on DVD on October 21, 2008 in Region 1 and in August 2008 in Region 4. The region 1 disc includes an audio commentary with Martin Hynes, a \\"20 Questions\\" featurette with the cast and crew, a voucher for the download of a She & Him song, and a digital copy of the film for use with portable video players. Reception Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 43% of 23 collected reviews for the film were positive, with an average score of 5.6/10 and the consensus that \\"The Go-Getter features nice performances, but ultimately fails to carve its own path\\". At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 69, based on 12 reviews. Rolling Stones Peter Travers awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, commending the film for being \\"emotionally truthful, painfully funny and vibrantly alive\\" and labeling it \\"a near-perfect road movie\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times believed that \\"Much of the dialogue is so quirky it sounds overheard instead of scripted\\" and called the cast \\"correspondingly spontaneous\\". New York magazine's chief film critic David Edelstein praised Hynes' \\"talent for deadpan jaw-droppers that aren't self- consciously quirky\\", and thought that \\"In The Go-Getter, filmmaking itself feels like Manifest Destiny.\\" Todd McCarthy, writing for Variety, was impressed by Pucci's performance and Shah's cinematography, calling the film \\"an unusually fresh-feeling indie with a nice sense of style\\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote that The Go-Getter \\"breathes new life [...] into the overworked indie road-movie formula\\", labeling Pucci as \\"charming\\" and the cinematography as \\"unusually nice\\". The New York Presss Mark Peikert thought that Deschanel made the film's flaws \\"almost forgivable\\", and that the film was \\"a feature-length audition reel for Deschanel to finally get the roles she deserves\\". New York Daily News critic Elizabeth Weitzman called Pucci \\"one of the best, and most overlooked, young actors around\\" and giving the film 4 out of 5 stars. Other reviews were less positive. The Los Angeles Times Carina Chocano felt that \\"despite flashes of genuine emotion [The Go-Getter] eventually succumbs to its own tweeness\\" and that the \\"moments of beauty\\" were outweighed by \\"the mannered dialogue and hamstrung performances\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film as a C, saying that it \\"travels, but it doesn't go anywhere\\" and likening Pucci to \\"a wan, passive Johnny Depp\\". The Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck praised the film's \\"appealing performances, sun-dappled cinematography and occasional witty dialogue\\", but thought that it was \\"contrived and derivative\\" and \\"a little too pleased with itself\\". The Globe and Mails Rick Groen called The Go-Getter \\"a fairly well-made picture that's just been fairly well-made too many times before, a knock-off of a thousand other knock-offs\\". Gabriel Wilder of The Sydney Morning Herald felt that it was \\"hard to maintain interest in [Mercer's] plight\\" because of Pucci's underacting and thought that \\"the script isn't so much quirky as incomplete\\", referring to the film's ending. With a rating of 2.5 out of 4, Maitland McDonagh wrote for TV Guide that the film is \\"too familiar to make any great impression\\".

The other campus is located in the San Sebasti√°n Technology Park in Miram√≥n. The building, which houses the Telecommunications and Microsystems laboratories, was completed in March 2006. In the 1996‚Äì1997 academic year the School of Engineering at San Sebasti√°n began offering three official degrees: Automation and Industrial Electronics Engineering, Industrial Management Engineering, and Materials Engineering. The degree plan was changed in 1999‚Äì2000. Starting in that academic year, TECNUN Tecnun offered several specialisations in Industrial Engineering (unofficial degrees from the University of Navarra), which made double degrees possible. The School of Engineering at San Sebasti√°n began offering a degree in Telecommunications Engineering in 2000‚Äì2001. This degree programme focuses on the design, construction and operation of telecommunications equipment, systems and services or other equipment, systems and services that involve similar technologies, such as radio communication and telematics. In 2008‚Äì2009 Bioengineering was added to the list of specialisations in Telecommunications Engineering. Starting in 2007‚Äì2008, TECNUN Tecnun expanded its degree offerings to include the graduate Master‚Äôs in Biomedical Engineering. This official master's degree is jointly taught with other centres at the University of Navarra: The Schools of Medicine, Sciences and Pharmacy, the Cl√≠nica Universitaria de Navarra and the Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA) This degree provides highly qualified training to professionals in engineering, physical sciences, mathematics, etc., so they are able to apply the principles and fundamentals of engineering and physics to solving existing and emerging issues in medicine, biology and bio-sanitary technology. The research carried out at the School of Engineering is undertaken in collaboration with the Centre of Studies and Technical Research of Gipuzkoa (CEIT), with whom the school shares laboratories and a library. This allows scientific speculation, a necessary feature of a university, to be complemented by the practical interests of a centre like CEIT, which focuses on meeting the needs of industry. Degrees Tecnun offers five official degrees that are recognised by the Spanish Ministry of Education at both undergraduate and doctorate levels: * Industrial Engineering * Telecommunications Engineering * Electrical, Electronic and Control Engineering * Industrial Management Engineering * Materials Engineering These degree programmes are currently being phased out and will be gradually replaced by the new undergraduate and master's degrees. Beginning with the 2009‚Äì2010 academic year, TECNUN Tecnun began offering its new four-year undergraduate and master's degree programmes, which conform to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The undergraduate degrees are: * Industrial Technology Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Electrical Engineering * Industrial Electronics Engineering * Telecommunication Systems Engineering * Industrial Management Engineering * Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering * Biomedical Engineering The postgraduate degrees are: * Master in Industrial Engineering * Master in Telecommunications Engineering * Master in Biomedical Engineering (beginning in academic year 2014-2015) Other teaching and training activities (seminars, courses and Master‚Äôs programmes) are offered to postgraduates.

The late Supreme Court Justice Roddy Meagher describes Jordan as being one of New South Wales's foremost Equity Judges. He is described by biographer John Bennett as a \\"man of bookish tastes, ... respected rather than liked by most of his colleagues who, while recognizing his brilliance as a lawyer, found him cold as a person. He, in turn, despised the narrowness of many of his fellows, writing that 'those who are constrained to think for the purposes of their professions refrain in general from thinking about anything else'. He delighted to relax in his vast library, indulging his voracious appetite for Romance languages, and committing to memory the entire contents of many literary works\\". According to Bennett, Jordan was a daunting figure in court, and his manner was not just cold but chilling. His manner was bleak and he had no time for service out the strict call of duty. However, Jordan's associate, Justice Slattery recalls Jordan as \\"quietly spoken, of calm disposition, kind and relaxed but not much given to expressing emotion\\". Jordan was a man at ease in familiar surrounding, but less relaxed and ill-at-ease at times in public view. Jordan preferred to catch a tram to work each morning, and in the afternoon, would catch to the terminus in the opposite direction to ensure that he obtained a seat for the return journey home. [2007] NSW Bar Association News 18. Early years and education Jordan was born on 13 October 1881 in London, the son of Frederick Jordan and Sarah Jordan (n√©e Nobel). He grew up in Balmain, a suburb of Sydney, after his parents migrated to Australia in 1886 when Jordan was five. He attended Balmain Superior Public School, for his primary education and Sydney Boys High School for his secondary education. After leaving school, he was employed as a clerk in the Master in Lunacy's office between 1898 and 1900. He later worked as a shorthand writer and typist in the Public Library of New South Wales (now the State Library of New South Wales) from 1900 and the then State's Intelligence Department from 1906. Jordan was a sub-editor of publications and compiler in the Bureau of Statistics from 5 June 1907. During this time, he began evening studies at the University of Sydney, which eventually led to him obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in 1904, and an LL.B. with second-class honours in 1907. He was a Wigram Allen Scholar in 1904 and a George and Matilda Harris Scholar in 1905. Jordan was admitted to the New South Wales Bar on 19 August 1907 and practised from Selborne Chambers. He primarily practised in equity work. He took silk as a Kings Counsel in 1928. He also lectured part-time in the law school of the University of Sydney. He married Bertha Maud Clay on 9 January 1928 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, on Macquarie Street, Sydney. Judicial career Jordan was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 1 February 1934 in succession to Sir Philip Street. Jordan had not been a judge before his appointment and at the time had been a senior equity barrister in New South Wales. He was Chief Justice between 1934 and 1949. This was a difficult time for the court with a shortage of resources and manpower due to the Second World War, although Jordan's administrative skills helped the court through this period. He was appointed KCMG in 1936, two years after his appointment as Chief Justice. Jordan was dominant when presiding on a Full Court, with a reputation for being remote, devoid of \\"human passions and that he was only at home when plumbing the depths of Equity or when writing judgments replete with citation of authority and exposition of legal principle\\" [1991] NSW Bar Association News 7. and whose public utterances were said to be limited to \\"a few well-frozen words\\".Attributed to Alroy M Cohen QC in =Decisions= Jordan in his time as Chief Justice sat on many cases. Perhaps the most notable case was Commissioner of Railways v Small.. This case involved the issuing of a subpoena to a person not involved in the court proceedings. A subpoena issued in these circumstances is usually called a \\"fishing expedition\\" as the legal counsel involved in issuing the subpoena is fishing around for evidence that may or may not be there. The following passage is often cited in court decisions around Australia where Jordan said: > \\"The writ of subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to a stranger to the case > or to a party. If it be addressed to a stranger, it must specify with > reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced. A > subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him > to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his > possession or power relating to a particular subject matter\\". Another enduring judgment is in the appeal considered in R v Geddes.. This decision is often cited in criminal appeals. Jordan held that after making allowance for any relevant considerations, there has to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and that any sentence should be appropriate to the particular crime having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. He concluded that it was easier to see that a wrong conclusion had been applied rather than arrive at any fixed rules for solving the problem. He concluded with the classic line \\"the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule'. Another notable case is In re Will of Gilbert (decd).. This was an early case in which the Supreme Court said it would not unnecessarily interfere with interlocutory orders on an appeal. Jordan said \\"... I am of opinion that...there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal.\\" Perhaps the funniest quote is in Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council.. Jordan remarked in that case that \\"there are mistakes and mistakes\\".cited by President Keith Mason in . =The High Court and Jordan= Chief Justice Jim Spigelman writing in the Quadrant magazine, noted an interesting case of Browning v The Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission of NSW.. This concerned a decision of the then Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission to deny in 1946 an Italian-born naturalised Australian a water license for irrigation. This was a time when irrigation was being introduced into the Riverina area of New South Wales as a result of the Snowy Mountains water scheme. The denial of the licence was based on policy considerations that licenses would not be granted to Italians for a number of policy reasons. Firstly, they had been enemy aliens during the Second World War. Secondly, it was considered that Italians were not good farmers. Lastly, it was undesirable for Italians to aggregate in the irrigation area. Jordan and the other members of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales allowed Browning's application. Spigelman notes that in \\"blunt words\\" Jordan rejected the commission's use of the three considerations as it was \\"no business\\" of the commission to consider those matters in the granting of a license. The commission appealed to the High Court of Australia.. The commission's appeal was unanimously allowed and Jordan's decision overturned. Spigelman notes that this was perhaps the low point of High Court jurisprudence particularly as the Chief Justice of the High Court, Latham, supported the commission's policy to exclude immigrants. Sir Owen Dixon spoke of Jordan saying that it was a tragedy that Sir Frederick Jordan had not been appointed to the High Court stating that \\"I really do not know what, if anything happened; but at all events he was not appointed and by one of those curious twists which seem to touch the finest natures, this highly scholarly man and a very great lawyer eventually took some queer views about federation. But I do not think he would have taken them if he had been living amongst us.\\"\\"Retirement of the Chief Justice\\" (1964) 110 CLR pp. X-XI. Government administration Jordan was appointed as the Administrator of the Government of NSW between 28 October 1937 and 1 November 1937. Sir Phillip Street died in 1938 and Jordan was appointed to replace him as Lieutenant-Governor of NSW, and Jordan was required to administer the Government of NSW in 1946 in the period between the resignation of Lord Wakehurst on 8 January and the appointment of Sir John Northcott on 1 August. Jordan became seriously ill in 1949 and died in his home at Vaucluse on 4 November 1949. He was accorded a state funeral. He was succeeded in office by Kenneth Whistler Street. Frederick Jordan chambers in Martin Place is named after Jordan. Works Jordan's notes of lectures delivered in the Law School of the University of Sydney were subsequently published as books, which were a major contribution to the practice of equity in Australia. These were reprinted in 1983 as \\"Sir Frederick Jordan Select Legal Papers\\". The authority of the books have been little doubted since Jordan first published them all those years ago. The foreword was written by Roderick Meagher ,then a leading barrister and lecturer in the Faculty of Law at Sydney University, who stated that an indication of the 'current utility' of Sir Frederick's work was the reliance on them in recent High Court decisions, by reference to Legione v Hatley,. and Hewett v Court.. On a lighter note, Roderick Meagher, by then a judge on the NSW Court of Appeal, argued that one particular footnote in \\"Chapters On Equity\\", page 52, footnote (e). was wrong.Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v ISVT Pty Limited (1998) 45 NSWLR 639 at p 654. (1999) 15 Journal of Contract Law 1. Meagher JA stated that \\"Great as is the homage we all owe to Sir Frederick Jordan, one must state that the footnote is nonsense. It has, of course, been approved by the High Court on about four occasions ... but that does not convert it into sense\\". Meagher JA then sets out why he says the footnote was wrong. Chief Justice Spigelman would later observe that the High Court judgments, to which Meagher JA referred with such scorn, were those mentioned in the foreword by Meagher JA as an indication of the 'current utility' of Sir Frederick's great work. [2004] NSW Bar Association News 21. An article by Justice David Ipp written in a similar vein discusses one of Jordan's decision on malicious prosecution,. and humorously suggests that Jordan may have been \\"recalcitrant\\". (2005) 79 Australian Law Journal 233. Jordan was widely read and wrote notes as a review and impression of what he read as well as a collection of quotations and epigrams recording his observation of analogies and parallels found in literary works written across centuries in English, Greek, Latin, French, Italian and German. His long-time friend Sir Lionel Lindsay had these published under the titles Appreciations and Parallels.

The two connected buildings stand beside each other on Chambers Street, by the intersection with the George IV Bridge, in central Edinburgh. The museum is part of National Museums Scotland. Admission is free. The two buildings retain distinctive characters: the Museum of Scotland is housed in a modern building opened in 1998, while the former Royal Museum building was begun in 1861 and partially opened in 1866, with a Victorian Venetian Renaissance facade and a grand central hall of cast iron construction that rises the full height of the building. This building underwent a major refurbishment and reopened on 29 July 2011 after a three- year, ¬£47 million project to restore and extend the building led by Gareth Hoskins Architects along with the concurrent redesign of the exhibitions by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. The National Museum incorporates the collections of the former National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. As well as the national collections of Scottish archaeological finds and medieval objects, the museum contains artefacts from around the world, encompassing geology, archaeology, natural history, science, technology, art, and world cultures. The 16 new galleries reopened in 2011 include 8,000 objects, 80 per cent of which were not formerly on display.NMS press release for the reopening One of the more notable exhibits is the stuffed body of Dolly the sheep, the first successful cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. Other highlights include Ancient Egyptian exhibitions, one of Elton John's extravagant suits, the Jean Muir Collection of costume and a large kinetic sculpture named the Millennium Clock. A Scottish invention that is a perennial favourite with school parties is the Scottish Maiden, an early form of guillotine. In 2018, the museum received 2,227,773 visitors, making it Scotland's most popular visitor attraction that year. History The history of the museum can be said to begin in 1780 with the foundation of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which still continues, but whose collection of archaeological and other finds was transferred to the government in 1858 as the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, from 1891 sharing the same building as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Queen Street in the New Town, Edinburgh. In 1861 construction in Chambers Street of the Industrial Museum of Scotland began, with Prince Albert laying the foundation stone. In 1866, renamed the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, the eastern end and the Grand Gallery were opened by Prince Alfred. In 1888 the building was finished and in 1904 the institution was renamed the Royal Scottish Museum. The organizational merger of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Museum took place in 1985, but the two collections retained separate buildings until 1995 when the Queen Street building closed, to reopen later occupied solely by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. In 1998 the new Museum of Scotland building opened, adjacent to the Royal Museum building, and connected to it. The masterplan to redevelop the Victorian building and further integrate the architecture and collections was launched in 2004, and in 2006 the two museums were formally merged as the National Museum of Scotland. The old Royal Museum building closed for redevelopment in 2008, before reopening in July 2011. The Royal Scottish Museum displayed prank exhibits on April Fool's Day on at least one occasion. In 1975, a fictitious bird called the Bare-fronted Hoodwink (known for its innate ability to fly away from observers before they could accurately identify it) was put on display. The exhibit included photos of blurry birds flying away. To make the exhibit more convincing, a mount of the bird was sewn together by a taxidermist from various scraps of real birds, including the head of a carrion crow, the body of a plover, and the feet of an unknown waterfowl. The bare front was composed of wax. Staff at the museum took several days of strike action at points during 2015 and 2016, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union. Architecture The Grand Gallery of the former Royal Museum building on reopening day, 29 July 2011 =Royal Museum building= Construction was started in 1861 and proceeded in phases, with some sections opening before others had even begun construction. The original extent of the building was completed in 1888. It was designed by civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, who is also responsible for the Royal Albert Hall. The exterior, designed in a Venetian Renaissance style, contrasts sharply with the light-flooded main hall or Grand Gallery, inspired by The Crystal Palace. Numerous extensions at the rear of the building, particularly in the 1930s, extended the museum greatly. 1998 saw the opening of the Museum of Scotland, which is linked internally to the Royal Museum building. The major redevelopment completed in 2011 by Gareth Hoskins Architects uses former storage areas to form a vaulted Entrance Hall of 1400 sq M at street level with visitor facilities. This involved lowering the floor level by 1.2 metres. Despite being a Class A listed building, it was possible to add lifts and escalators. =Museum of Scotland building= The building is made up of geometric, Corbusian forms, but also has numerous references to Scotland, such as brochs and castellated defensive architecture. It is clad in golden Moray sandstone, which one of its architects, Gordon Benson, has called \\"the oldest exhibit in the building\\", a reference to Scottish geology. The building was a 1999 Stirling Prize nominee. Collections The galleries in the newer building present Scottish history in an essentially chronological arrangement, beginning at the lowest level with prehistory to the early medieval period, with later periods on the higher levels. The Victorian building, as reopened in 2011, contains four zones (each with numerous galleries), covering natural history, world cultures (including galleries on the South Pacific, East Asia, and Ancient Egypt), European art and design, and science & technology. The Grand Gallery contains a variety of large objects from the collections, with a display called the \\"Window on the World\\" rising through four storeys, or about 20 metres, containing over 800 objects reflecting the breadth of the collections. Beyond the Grand Gallery at ground level is the \\"Discoveries\\" gallery, with objects connected to \\"remarkable Scots ... in the fields of invention, exploration and adventure\\".NMS press release on reopening Notable artifacts include: * Assyrian relief of King Ashurnasirpal II and a court official * Monymusk Reliquary * St Ninian's Isle Treasure * 11 of the Lewis chessmen.

The remains of nine of these can be seen from passing trains. While a number of these were closed following the so-called \\"Beeching Axe\\" in the 1960s, many of them had been closed much earlier, the traffic for which they had been built failing to materialise. Background The railway from Plymouth to Truro was opened by the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859, where it joined up with the West Cornwall Railway which had been completed from there to Penzance on 16 April 1855. The section from Carn Brea to Angarrack dates back to the Hayle Railway, opened on 23 December 1837. It now forms Network Rail's Cornish Main Line. Plymouth to Truro =Plymouth Millbay= The trains of the South Devon Railway finally reached the town of Plymouth on 2 April 1849. Docks were opened adjacent to the station and a new headquarters office was built next door. The station was expanded ready for the opening of the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859 and the South Devon and Tavistock Railway on 22 June 1859. It became known as Plymouth Millbay after other stations were opened in the town in 1876-7 at Mutley and North Road. The station was closed to passengers on 23 April 1941 after bombs destroyed the nearby goods depot; the passenger station being used thereafter only for goods traffic and access to the carriage sheds. All traffic ceased from 14 December 1969 except for goods trains running through to the docks which continued until 30 June 1971. The site is now occupied by the Plymouth Pavilions leisure complex. Two granite gate posts outside the Millbay Road entrance are all that is left of the station, although a goods shed on what used to be Washington Place is still extant nearby =Wingfield Villas Halt= This suburban halt near Devonport Junction in Plymouth was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 June 1904. It was served by the Plympton to Saltash railmotor service introduced at that time to compete with the electric tramways in the town. It was closed in June 1921. =Ford Halt= Ford http://olddevonport.uk/Railways-Ford%20Halt.htm was one of the halts opened by the Great Western Railway for its railmotor services on 1 June 1904. It was located to serve the northern district of Devonport which had grown around the naval dockyard; other stations serving this traffic were opened at Keyham (1900) and Dockyard Halt (1905). The denuded remains of the southbound platform still remain, just west of an underbridge into the Royal Navy Dockyard and at the commencement of the cutting before Keyham. It was closed on 6 November 1941, during the World War II blitz of Plymouth and Devonport. =Defiance Platform= Old entrance to Defiance Platform Defiance Platform () was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 March 1905 and served naval personnel travelling to the nearby torpedo training school on HMS Defiance which was moored nearby. Most trains were the railmotors and auto trains from which were run for an extra beyond Saltash where they otherwise terminated. The line was doubled and moved on 4 February 1906 and Wearde became the junction for a deviation line to that allowed the removal of the remaining timber viaducts on the Cornish Main Line. As a result of the deviation the platform was moved in 1907, where access to the platform was by steps from a bridge that carried a road across the railway to Wearde Quay. The signal box that had been at the original location was also relocated and was situated at one end of the platform. The station closed on 27 October 1930 but the platforms are still in existence and alterations to the road bridge to accommodate the new alignment of 1906 can be clearly seen. The old line was retained as carriage sidings for Saltash until 2 December 1964 and another siding behind the platform was kept in use until 1972. =Doublebois= A 1905 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (lower right) railways in the vicinity of Doublebois Doublebois station () was situated at the west end of a cutting and is the summit of the Cornwall Railway. A siding was provided here when it opened on 4 May 1859 to enable trains to be split into smaller parts to enable them to be worked over the steep inclines up from Liskeard and Bodmin Road. In January 1860 the railway company was asked to provide a facility here for goods traffic, which they acceded to after local people subscribed ¬£130 towards it and offered the necessary land. Because of this the company offered to build an accompanying passenger station. The station opened on 1 June 1860, providing a service to people and mines in the St Neot area, providing a passing loop until the line was doubled in 1894. A signal box was provided part way along the platform, with sidings at both ends on the down side. During World War 2 the eastern sidings were used by the military for ammunition. The station was closed on 5 October 1964,and the sidings were taken out of use in January 1968. There are extant earthworks still visible from passing trains. =Respryn= Due to delays in securing the site for Bodmin Road, the Cornwall Railway provided a temporary station a little further west for the opening of the line on 4 May 1859 until the permanent station was ready on 27 June 1859. =Burngullow= Once it was open, the Cornwall Railway found there was a demand for facilities to transport china clay from the St Stephens district to Par harbour. To satisfy this they opened a station consisting of a single platform at Burngullow () on 1 February 1863. The construction costs were largely met by Mr Robartes, who had interests in the extraction of the china clay. A branch line to Nanpean was opened for goods traffic by the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway on 1 July 1869. A small engine shed was built by them on the north side of the station. The shed closed in 1922 and was removed in 1931. The station was closed and rebuilt a little further west () on 1 August 1901, this time with two platforms, and closed to passengers on 14 September 1931. The sidings and branch continue to handle heavy china clay traffic. The large dryer and storage sheds alongside the main line are the Blackpool clay works; Burngullow clay works are smaller and situated alongside the branch line a short distance from the junction. Two railway accidents have happened here, both involving runaway china clay trains. On the first occasion a train had left Burngullow with wagons for Par harbour on 29 October 1872. It was unable to stop for signals at St Austell but the driver of the passenger train coming in the other direction saw the train sliding towards it and reversed his train back to Par. On 9 June 1952 a similar problem occurred with a train on the branch line approaching Burngullow. This time the train ran into a siding where it collided with a stationary engine. Unfortunately the driver of the runaway train, who had stayed at the controls in an attempt to bring it to a halt, later died from his injuries. The former 'up side' (London bound) station building still remains some seventy years plus after closure. The signal box was closed in 1986 when the Burngullow to Probus section of the main line was singled, and the signals were then controlled by the Signal Box at Par railway station. The double line was re-instated in 2004. =Grampound Road= New houses have been built at Grampound Road since the station closed. A two-platform station () to serve Grampound was opened in a cutting by the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859, but it was known as \\"Grampound Road\\" due to the distance from that town. A newspaper at the time reported at the time merely that \\"it comprises arrival and departure stations exactly similar to those at Par.\\" A goods shed was not provided until 1864 when one was erected in the up yard, but with up and down yards the goods traffic developed quickly: 3,580 cattle were dispatched in the twelve months to June 1869, more than any other station on the line. A signal box was erected half way along the up platform Because of its remote location two cottages were built in 1860 for the station master and his staff. A small village known as Grampound Road grew up around the railway station and continues to expand despite the station's closing (along with Doublebois, Chacewater, Scorrier, Gwinear Road and Marazion) on 5 October 1964, but the signal box remained open until June 1972. Harry Hingston was the last registered paid employee and station master. The site is easily recognised from passing trains. =Probus and Ladock Halt= This halt () was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1908 as Probus and Ladock Platform, the term platform being used rather than Halt to indicate that it was staffed; it was later changed to an unstaffed halt. Characteristic Great Western Railway corrugated iron waiting shelters were provided on both of the wooden platforms at opening. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways from 1 January 1948 and the station was closed on 2 December 1957. The station was nearer to Probus than Ladock, indeed Grampound Road railway station was also convenient for the latter village. Both platforms still remain here and although grassed over are easily detectable. Truro to Penzance =Chacewater= Chacewater railway station in 2008 A station () was opened at Chacewater by the West Cornwall Railway on 25 August 1852. On 6 July 1903 a branch line to Perranporth was opened from nearby Blackwater; it was extended to Newquay on 2 January 1905. Blackwater Junction was closed on 9 November 1924 which resulted in the physical junction being moved the half mile to Chacewater station, although most trains ran through to Truro. The Perranporth line closed on 4 February 1963. The station closed to passengers on 5 October 1964 but continued to be served by goods traffic for many years, latterly for Blue Circle Cement. The Penzance bound platforms can still be seen, complete with much altered station building. There are two viaducts east of Chacewater. The 128 yard (181 m) Blackwater Viaduct is immediately east of the station site and the 93 yard (132 m) Chacewater Viaduct is a little further east towards Truro.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth . =Scorrier= A station () was opened at Scorrier by the West Cornwall Railway on 25 August 1852. Initially known as \\"Scorrier Gate\\", the name was changed to \\"Scorrier\\" in March 1856. It reverted to \\"Scorrier Gate\\" from 1 June 1859 but became plain \\"Scorrier\\" once more on 1 October 1896. It closed to passengers on 5 October 1964. =Carn Brea= A station () was opened near Carn Brea on 23 May 1843 by the Hayle Railway and named \\"Pool\\" after a nearby village. The railway was closed on 16 February 1852 and reopened by the West Cornwall Railway on 11 March 1852, however Pool station remained closed until 25 August 1852, when it was reopened as \\"Carn Brea\\", only to be renamed \\"Pool\\" once more in June 1854. It reverted to \\"Carn Brea\\" on 1 November 1875. It was closed on 2 January 1961. Carn Brea was the home of the West Cornwall Railway's workshops, where they maintained the locomotives and rolling stock. =Dolcoath Halt= The Great Western Railway opened a railmotor halt () near Dolcoath mine on 28 August 1905 but it closed again on 1 May 1908; the days when Dolcoath was one of the biggest mines in Cornwall were long past. The halt was situated to the west of Dolcoath level crossing, and the site can be recognised because of this. =Penponds= The Hayle Railway provided a station at Penponds from 23 May 1843 until 16 February 1852. It was not replaced when the West Cornwall Railway opened a month later. =Gwinear Road= A station known as \\"Gwinear Road\\" () was opened by the West Cornwall Railway on 11 March 1852, west of a level crossing, and became a junction for the Helston Railway on 9 May 1887. The goods yard lay west of the station to the north of the line, but extensive sidings were constructed alongside the main line east of the level crossing to handle traffic for the branch. The station formerly had two signalboxes: West, on the down platform itself, and East, out in the goods marshalling yard. The branch line to Helston closed to passengers on 3 September 1962 and to goods on 5 October 1964. The station closed on 5 October 1964. The former 'down' (Penzance-bound) platform and Helston branch bay is still more or less intact. The DMU, formerly on site undergoing restoration by the Helston Railway Preservation Company in the cattle dock just east of the level crossing, has now been moved to the company's Prospidnick base. =Angarrack= The Hayle Railway introduced passenger trains on 23 May 1843. The service was closed on 16 February 1852. On 11 March 1852 the West Cornwall Railway opened a new station. The old station had been on the section of the Hayle Railway that was closed entirely as a steep rope-worked incline descended from Angarrack to sea level at Copperhouse, it was replaced by a much gentler incline to the new Hayle railway station. However the new Angarrack station was closed in 1853. (See also Angarrack viaduct.) =Copperhouse Halt= The Great Western Railway introduced railmotor services in west Cornwall and provided several small halts at which they called. Copperhouse was one of the small halts provided for these services, opening on 1 July 1905 to provide a service to the Copperhouse district in Hayle. It closed in 1908. An earlier station had been provided at Copperhouse nearer the waterfront by the Hayle Railway from 23 May 1843 until their line closed on 16 February 1852. =Marazion= 43189 passes the disused Marazion station in 2007 A station () was opened at Marazion by the West Cornwall Railway on 11 March 1852. New waiting rooms with corrugated iron pent roofs were completed in December 1878 or January 1879. The original single platform was situated on the south side of the line but the station was rebuilt about thirty years later, when a second platform was added. The line westwards to Penzance was doubled in 1893 and the goods yard expanded so that it could share in handling the large volume of perishable traffic ‚Äì fish, fruit and vegetables ‚Äì from the surrounding farms and harbours. The line eastwards to St Erth was not doubled until 1929. The station closed for passengers on 5 October 1964. The station is situated on the shore of Mount's Bay with fine views of St Michael's Mount and for many years was home to six old Pullman coaches that were formerly used as camping coaches. Three of these were rescued and restored, and now provide sleeping accommodation at Petworth railway station, which has been converted into a guest house. One was purchased privately, while the others were left to become derelict until broken up on site.Abandoned lines and railways ‚Äì Marazion (includes pictures of station and coaches) Accessed 05 Jun 2007 In 2006 the remains of these coaches was cleared away from the site to make way for nine holiday cottages, the old station has now been fully restored into a two bedroom bungalow currently owned by the developers. The 1880s station building still stands, but part of the line westwards is currently reduced to a single track.

Description It is an erect to pendulous shrub that usually grows from in height. Its globular, yellow flowerheads appear from late winter until mid spring. The hairy leaves are bipinnate with linear to narrow-elliptical shaped leaflets to that are around in length. The spherical flowerheads are held on slender stalks around in length exceeding the length of the leaves. Following flowering a distinctively pleated seed pod is formed. Classification The species was first formally described by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1975 as part of the work Studies in the genus Acacia (Mimosaceae) - A Revision of Series Pulchellae published in the journal Nuytsia. The only known synonym is Racosperma plicatum as described by Leslie Pedley in 2003. Distribution The species is found around Dandaragan in the Mid West region of Western Australia where it grows mostly in loamy and clay soils, often overlying sandstone or siltstone and is common in drainage lines. It is often found along watercourses in the understorey as a part of Eucalyptus wandoo and Eucalyptus loxophleba woodland communities. Cultivation Seeds need to scarified or treated with boiling water prior to planting. It is drought and frost tolerant.

He was born at Beddington, Surrey, into an Anglican family, and was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at Oriel College, Oxford. He obtained a BA degree on 9 February 1843. He was ordained in the Church of England, and became the vicar of Mitcham in Surrey, in 1844, the same year that he married his cousin, Elizabeth Mary Cranmer. He resigned his position some time before being received into the Catholic Church on 1 August 1846. He then spent more than a year on the continent, becoming very proficient as a linguist. Simpson returned to England in 1847, and settled in Clapham, Surrey. In 1850, he began to write for The Rambler, a Catholic periodical founded by converts. In 1856, he became its assistant editor, and in 1858, was made editor. When the magazine was discontinued in 1862 Simpson, with Sir John Acton, began the Home and Foreign Review. This met with resistance from the Catholic hierarchy, and was discontinued in 1864. Afterwards Simpson devoted himself to the study of Shakespeare, to music, and to writing. He was one of the first to advance the theory that Shakespeare had been a Catholic.Josef L. Altholz: \\"Richard Simpson\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Also, he was elected a member of the committee of the New Shakspere Society in 1874.

It was written while he led the Vienna Outpatient Clinic for sexually-related problems and is an early work in his career which was to develop around the subject of human sexuality. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of unconscious fantasy and the subsequent emerging guilt feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself. Reich built on papers written by other professionals of his time, however, he decided to probe deeper into the myriad variations of both female and male masturbation. The essay was presented to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society on October 10, 1922 and was published in the Internationale Zeitschrift f√ºr Psychoanalyse in 1922. It formed the basis for Reich's later views on the role of genitality in the therapy of neuroses.Reich, Wilhelm (1999) [First English tr. published 1942], The Function of the Orgasm: Sex-Economic Problems of Biological Energy, The Discovery of the Orgone, Volume I, Trans. Vincent R. Carfagno, London: Souvenir Press, : p. 57  The way people masturbate indicative of sexual potency  Reich's work with patients at the clinic was often related to problems of diminished sexual potency, or impotence. He therefore decided to look closer at such factors as (1) where do they masturbate? (2) when do they masturbate? (3) with what materials do they masturbate? (4) with what fantasies do they masturbate? (5) how often do they masturbate? (6) in what bodily posture do they masturbate, and is that posture related to any childhood event or events? and (7) with what furniture do they masturbate, and what associations does the act have with that furniture? From surveying these aspects Reich wanted to separate out healthy forms of masturbation from unhealthy ones. = Four categories of male masturbation = # Against the sheet or an improvised vulva (shirt, pillow, etc.), lying face down, and without the assistance of the hands, thrusting the pelvis rhythmically. # Using the hands, lying on the side or in a bathtub, by far the most common form. # Lying on the back using only the hands. # In front of a mirror; while reading rape scenes (a very frequent occurrence, Reich remarked); on the toilet; in public parks (although hidden behind bushes); mutual masturbation with friends etc. Only the first of these types indicated a strong inclination towards the opposite sex. The second type shows a strong autoerotic component. The third and fourth types were both considered by Reich to indicate pathological processes. In the third type, he noted that this form was mainly practiced by males with female attitudes, and he gave a poor prognosis for these patients.

Involved in maritime trade and both born and married into prominent Quebec families, Louis Fornel was among the partners Louis Bazil convinced to invest in his ill-fated Labrador sealing station.

It is a comedy written by John Webster and William Rowley. The play was first published in 1661, though it is understood to have been composed some four decades earlier. Date and performance Hard-data on the play's actual date of origin is lacking. Scholars have generally assigned the play's creation to the 1624‚Äì25 period. The King's Men is generally assumed to be the first theatrical troupe to have performed it.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Popular School: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1975; p. 96. The play was later adapted by Joseph Harris into The City Bride (1696).Alfred Harbage, \\"Elizabethan:Restoration Palimpsests,\\" Modern Language Review Vol. 35 No. 3 (July 1940), pp. 287‚Äì319; see p. 289. Publication In 1661 a quarto was printed by Thomas Johnson for the bookseller Francis Kirkman. Its title page assigns the play to Webster and Rowley. This quarto was the only edition of the play's publication printed before the nineteenth century. Authorship Nineteenth-century scholars and critics (notably F. G. Fleay) disputed the attribution to Webster and Rowley but following the lead of Edmund Gosse most twentieth-century commentators have accepted the original authorial assignment,Elmer Edgar Stioll, John Webster: The Periods of His Work as Determined by His Relations to the Drama of His Day, Boston, Alfred Mudge, 1905; pp. 34‚Äì43. with Webster as the author of the serious main plot, and Rowley responsible for the comic subplot. Gosse, who admired the serious main plot, actually proposed splitting the play in two;Edmund Goose, \\"John Webster,\\" Fraser's Magazine, May 1874. and surprisingly enough this was later done ‚Äî Webster's portion was published as a short play titled Love's Graduate in 1884. Gosse wasn't alone in his attitude; Algernon Charles Swinburne called the play \\"a mixture of coarsely realistic farce and gracefully romantic comedy.\\" In a 1927 study, Henry Gray posited Thomas Heywood as a third author. Gray argued that the play is mainly Rowley's work, with three scenes by Webster and four by Heywood. Webster may have revised the whole, in Gray's view.Henry David Gray, \\"A Cure for a Cuckold by Heywood, Rowley, and Webster,\\" Modern Language Review 22 (1927); pp. 389‚Äì97. Gray's hypothesis has not found widespread support, though F. L. Lucas allowed a possibility that Heywood may have revised an original Webster/Rowley collaboration.Logan and Smith, p. 96. Lucas, The Complete Works of John Webster, 1927, Vol.3, pp.10‚Äì18. Webster appears to have handled the play's main plot, and Rowley (unsurprisingly for a professional clown) the comic subplot. Influences A Cure for a Cuckold shares a complex inter-relationship with a set of other plays of its era, including Marston's The Dutch Courtesan, Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady, Fletcher and Massinger's The Little French Lawyer, and Massinger's The Parliament of Love. Since A Cure for a Cuckold is later than most, perhaps all, of these plays, it likely represents the cumulative influence of a skein of dramatic development winding through them, centring on the plot of a woman who wants her lover to duel with and kill his best friend.Rupert Brooke, John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama, New York, John Lane, 1916; pp. 261‚Äì74. Synopsis The house of Woodroff, an English merchant and justice of the peace, is celebrating the wedding of Woodroff's daughter Annabel with her suitor Bonvile. Two of the wedding guests, Lessingham and Clare, open the play in conversation about the wedding. Lessingham, who is in love with Clare, tries to use the occasion to further his own suit; but Clare is withdrawn and taciturn. She leaves him alone, then sends him a curt and cryptic message that reads: ::Prove all thy friends, find out the best and nearest; ::Kill for my sake the friend that loves thee dearest. Lessingham is appalled at this but his passion for Clare is so intense that he feels compelled to obey Clare's dictates to win her love. When other wedding guests and friends reproach Lessingham for his preoccupation, he confesses that he needs a friend to second him in a duel ‚Äî a friend who will not only support him morally, but fight and perhaps die with him. Lessingham's professed friends quickly drop away with a variety of excuses, till only one is left: it is Bonvile, the groom. Without hesitation, Bonvile delays his wedding night to accompany Lessingham to the \\"field of honor\\" ‚Äî so proving himself to be the \\"best and nearest\\" friend whom Lessingham must kill. Since duelling is illegal in England, Lessingham and Bonvile leave immediately for Calais, as was customary at the time. Annabel is distressed to find that her groom has left without a word; she sends a servant after him, and then follows herself. In the nearby woods, Rochfield, a younger son left destitute by the strictures of primogeniture, has decided to turn thief; he encounters Annabel, his first intended victim, and tries to rob her of her wedding necklace and bracelets. These, however, are locked onto her; as he fumbles with them in trying to remove them, Annabel grabs his sword. Yet because he is a gentlemanly thief who does not threaten her virtue, she returns his sword and promises to give him the monetary value of her jewellery, if he returns with her to her house. Since his career as a thief is not going well, Rochfield agrees. True to her word, Annabel gives Rochfield twenty gold pieces, and introduces him as a friend of the groom. Justice Woodroff is gathering investors for a trading voyage that he's planning, and Annabel manoeuvres Rochfield into investing his twenty gold pieces in the venture. Broke again and having nothing to lose, Rochfield enlists in the venture personally. The voyage turns out to be brief but eventful: when not long out of port, the ship is attacked by \\"three Spanish men-of-war.\\" The captain and master are killed ‚Äî but Rochfield takes command and leads the crew in an effective resistance they even capture one of the Spanish ships, and return to England with a lucrative prize. From a desperate would-be thief, Rochfield has suddenly become a hero flush with new wealth. On the beach at Calais, Lessingham reveals that Bonvile is his intended opponent. First surprised, then angered, Bonvile dismisses Lessingham's friendship; he suggests that Lessingham may want Annabel for himself, this being his true motive for the duel. This break in their friendship paradoxically negates the premise of the duel. Rather than fighting to the death as friends, the two men return to England separately, as enemies. When Lessingham confronts Clare again, she tells him that he has completely misunderstood her meaning. Clare confesses that she was madly and hopelessly in love with Bonvile; with his marriage, she was deeply despondent. Clare had thought that Lessingham would recognise her, Clare, and his dearest friend, and therefore his correct victim. Once the five passionate young people, Annabel, Bonvile, Clare, Lessingham, and Rochfield, are all under the same roof, they involve themselves in a tangle of misunderstandings and jealousies ‚Äî until wise old Woodroff manages to get them altogether and straighten them out at the end of the play. In the subplot, a sailor named Compass returns home after four years at sea ‚Äî to find that his wife Urse, believing him dead, has borne an illegitimate child, a son now a year old. Compass not only forgives her, but wants to be acknowledged as the child's father. In Compass's laissez-faire attitude, the true father has actually done the sailor a service in begetting him a child. This brings Compass into conflict with the boy's biological father, a merchant named Franckford. (Franckford is Woodroff's brother-in-law, and the link between the two plots.) Since Franckford's marriage (with Woodroff's sister Luce) is barren, Urse's baby is his only heir. Franckford has been paying the costs of the child's upkeep, and insists on his parental rights. The two men almost go to law over the issue (allowing for some satire on lawyers in the process), before Justice Woodroff, in a sort of mock-trial in a tavern, rules that the baby does not belong to either of the men, but to Urse, his mother. Compass and Urse renew their vows in the final scene, to make a new start as a family. The easy amorality of the subplot distressed Victorian critics such as Swinburne and Gosse. Modern readers may tend to take the opposite approach, and judge the main plot's ethic of chastity, honour, and duelling far less humane and palatable than Compass's live-and-let-live ethos.
