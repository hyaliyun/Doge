He is known for his recordings with Harry Choates and his broadcasts on KVOL. Next to the Hackberry Ramblers, the Rayne-Bo Ramblers were the most popular and innovative of the Cajun string bands. Family Leroy was born on January 30, 1915 Rayne, Louisiana to Gilbert Leblanc and Carrie Bird Hoffpauir. He married Della Meche. He traded rice in order to purchase his first guitar. Music and career In 1932, his career started when he played guitar with Joe Falcon and Amedee Breaux. Later, in 1935, he would create the band known as the \\"Rayne-Bo Ramblers\\" which started as the backup band for Nathan Abshire and played regularly at the OST Club in Rayne. The band featured people such as \\"Rang Tang Bully\\" Joe Werner, Harry Choates, Oran \\"Doc\\" Guidry, Nathan Abshire and many more. By 1940, he and Harry recorded their first hit, \\"La Veuve de la Coulee\\". In 1941, the band split up and Happy joined Leo Soileau's \\"Rhythm Boys\\". Later, he would tour with Tex Ritter and appear on the world-famous Louisiana Hayride. By 1953, every morning on KVOL, Happy would play popular Cajun bands on his radio talk show. That same year, he would meet with John Pusateri, form the \\"Bayou Buckaroos\\", and record with Bella Records of San Jose. In his later years, Happy Fats signed up with J.

In 1945 after the Second World War, Hanu≈° returned to Czechoslovakia, but after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, he escaped back to the United Kingdom and rejoined the Royal Air Force, with which he served until 1968. Hanu≈° then had a civilian career with International Computers Limited until his retirement in 1977. He died in England in 1992. Early life Hanu≈° was born in Doln√≠ ≈†tƒõpanice in northern Bohemia. His father was a metal-worker. He went to school in nearby Jilemnice, passed his Matura and in 1931 went on to study at nearby Jest≈ôeb√≠. =Czechoslovak Air Force= In 1932, Hanu≈° joined the Czechoslovak Air Force. He was briefly with the 2nd Observation Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment \\"Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk\\" at Prague-Kbely and then was posted to the school for air force officers at Prostƒõjov in Moravia. From June to September 1933, he was with the 1st Air Regiment's 4th Observation Squadron at Cheb in western Bohemia. He trained at the military academy, passed out as a poruchik on 2 July 1935 and returned to the 4th Observation Squadron. Over the next two years, Hanu≈° learnt night flying and occasionally was an assistant instructor teaching theory at the air force training school. On 25 April 1938, Hanu≈° was given a temporary attachment to the Interior Ministry. He was stationed at airfields at Cheb, Terez√≠n in northern Bohemia and Plze≈à-Bory in western Bohemia. In his Czechoslovak Air Force career, Hanu≈° completed 650 flying hours. On 30 September 1938, France and the United Kingdom allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. On 15 March, Germany occupied the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia and imposed a Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia under a puppet government that it ordered to dissolve its armed forces. The Czechoslovak Air Force ceased to exist, and the Luftwaffe confiscated its aircraft. =Escape to Poland= On 14 July 1939, Hanu≈° escaped to Poland, where he reported to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Krak√≥w. He was then accommodated in a Czechoslovak transit camp at Bronowice Ma≈Çe that had been converted from a disused Austro-Hungarian Army camp. Between 28 July and 1 August, he and other Czechoslovaks, including the future fighter ace Alois Va≈°√°tko, sailed from Gdynia to France aboard the Polish ocean liner . French Air Force France did not yet allow Czechoslovak refugees to join its Arm√©e de l'air. But the Ambassador in Paris for the Czechoslovak government-in-exile reached agreement with the French Government that Czechoslovak volunteers could join the French Foreign Legion for a five-year term, on the understanding that if war broke out they would be released to form a Czechoslovak army in exile. Hanu≈° joined the Foreign Legion and was posted to a barracks in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre. On 3 September 1939, France declared war on Germany. The official agreement allowing Czechoslovak airmen to join the Arm√©e de l'air was not reached until 17 November, but one source claims that Hanu≈° began pilot training in October. Here he proved to be more experienced and skilled than the French pilot who was supposed to be his instructor. Hanu≈° was trained on the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter Hanu≈° was trained on the Morane- Saulnier M.S.406 fighter and then posted to Groupe de Chasse III/1 at Le Plessis-Belleville airfield in the Oise d√©partement of northern France. Here he commanded a flight of three aircraft, in which the other two pilots were also Czechoslovaks. Hanu≈° scored his first victory, as one of a patrol of seven aircraft that shot down a Luftwaffe Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft near Herb√©court. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France, and on 22 June France capitulated. Hanu≈° escaped via Casablanca in Morocco to Gibraltar. There he embarked on the British-India Steam Navigation Company ship Neuralia, which reached Liverpool, England on 12 July. Royal Air Force On 2 August 1940, Hanu≈° joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve. He was re-trained at No. 6 Operational Training Unit and then on 15 October was posted to a Czechoslovak- manned unit, No. 310 Squadron RAF at RAF Duxford in Cambridgeshire. The squadron was operating Hawker Hurricane I fighters and engaged in the final days of the Battle of Britain. By the end of 1940, Hanu≈° had been promoted, first to flying officer and then to flight lieutenant. =Night fighter pilot= From April 1942 Hanu≈° flew Bristol Beaufighter night fighters From June 1941, Hanu≈° flew with British-manned squadrons. He was with No. 32 Squadron RAF until 18 September, then No. 245 Squadron RAF until 1 April 1942. From 5 to 21 February 1942, he received a fortnight's training in night flying at No. 54 Operational Training Unit. From April 1942, he flew twin-engined, twin-seat Bristol Beaufighter night fighters equipped with AI Mk IV airborne interception radar. He spent the first half of April with No. 600 Squadron RAF and the second half with No. 125 Squadron RAF, before returning to 600 Squadron on 30 April. On 1 September 1942, Hanu≈° was posted to No. 68 Squadron RAF, a Beaufighter night-fighter squadron whose \\"B\\" Flight consisted overwhelmingly of Czechoslovak airmen. But Hanu≈° got on badly with the flight commander, Squadron Leader Vlastimil Vesel√Ω. On 10 January 1943 Hanu≈° and his radar operator, Pilot Officer Ernest Eyles, were posted to take part in the North African Campaign. Later Hanu≈° had a different radar operator, Flying Officer H. Finlay. In 1943 in North Africa, Malta and Italy, Hanu≈° shot down four Junkers Ju 88 aircraft. On 13 May, the remaining German and Italian forces in North Africa surrendered. On 20 May 1943, Hanu≈° was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He continued to serve in Malta, the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Italian Campaign. In his service in North Africa, Malta and Italy, Hanu≈° flew 79 combat sorties and amassed 225 flying hours. He shot down four Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 aircraft and damaged a Dornier Do 217. On 23 October, he was promoted to squadron leader and on 1 November he was given command of \\"A\\" Flight. =Liaison officer= On 5 December 1943, Hanu≈° was transferred to the Inspectorate-General of the Czechoslovak Air Force in London. He wanted to return to flying duties, but instead spent the rest of the war as a liaison officer. His duties included attending funerals of Czechoslovak airmen who had been killed in action, and visiting airfields to restore good relations where there had been discord between Czechoslovaks and locals. On 6 May 1944 in Cambridge, Hanu≈° married a British woman, Lilian Evelyn Webb. Their first child, a daughter, was born in January 1945. After the war The RAFVR's Czechoslovak contingent returned to liberated Czechoslovakia in August 1945. Hanu≈° returned on 22 August with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He wanted to be given command of the 106th Air Regiment, based at Chrudim in eastern Bohemia. Instead he was made a staff officer, first at the regional command in Prague and then at Ruzynƒõ airbase. He had a brief posting to the air force command in Brno in Moravia. On 1 October 1946, Hanu≈° was made Chief of Staff at the Anti-Air Defence Headquarters. In February 1948, the Czechoslovak Communist Party seized power. Shortly after the coup, Hanu≈° was made Chief of Staff at Air Force Command in Brno. But the Communists soon started a political purge of armed services personnel who had served with the Western Allies. On 14 April, Hanu≈° was placed on enforced leave. Lilian Hanu≈°ov√° was expecting their second child. Hanu≈° sent his wife and daughter back to Britain. On 3 May, he was arrested, accused of helping Major-General Karel Janou≈°ek to try to escape abroad. Janou≈°ek had been arrested on 30 April. By 6 May, Hanu≈° was one of 10 air force officers and 14 civilians being held in a prison controlled by the Obrann√© zpravodajstv√≠ (OBZ) military and political intelligence organisation in the Hradƒçany district of Prague. One source claims that Hanu≈° was then released without charge. Another states that he was tried and sentenced to two months in prison. =Second escape from Czechoslovakia= de Havilland Mosquito night fighter with nose radome for AI Mk. VIII radar On 8 July 1948, Hanu≈° escaped from Czechoslovakia to the United States zone of occupied Germany. He went from Bavaria via Wiesbaden airbase to Britain, where he rejoined the RAF. On 1 December, Czechoslovakia dismissed Hanu≈° from the air force in absentia. He flew de Havilland Mosquito night fighters, first with No. 23 Squadron RAF and then with No. 141 Squadron RAF, until June 1951. He also flew Gloster Meteors which triggered his deafness which gradually deteriorated through the rest of his life. He continued his RAF career in non-flying duties, initially as an Air Traffic Controller and then as an Equipment Officer until 19 September 1968, when he retired. He then had a civilian career with International Computers Limited until he retired in 1977. =Rehabilitation= In November and December 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. On 10 September 1991, the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic promoted Hanu≈° to colonel. In March 1992, it promoted him again, to major general. But by then Hanu≈° was seriously ill. He died in England on 21 April.

The genus contains only one species, the type species Sigournea multidentata, which was named in 2006 by paleontologists John R. Bolt and R. Eric Lombard on the basis of a single lower jaw from Iowa. The jaw came from a fissure-fill deposit of the St. Louis Limestone that was exposed in a quarry near the town of Sigourney and dates to the Vis√©an stage, making it approximately 335 million years old. Bolt and Lombard named the genus after Sigourney. The species name multidentata alludes to the many teeth preserved in the jaw. The jaw, which is housed in the Field Museum and cataloged as FM PR 1820, curves strongly downward but was probably straight to begin with, having been deformed by the process of fossilization after the individual died. Rooted in the dentary bone along the outermost edge of the jaw are 88 small, pointed marginal teeth. An additional row of even smaller teeth runs along the coronoids, three bones positioned lengthwise along the lower boundary of the dentary on the inner surface of the lower jaw. Bolt and Lombard were able to classify Sigournea as an early member of Tetrapoda based on the presence of bone surfaces covered in pits and ridges, a single row of dentary teeth, a jaw joint that faces upward, and an open groove for a lateral line along the outer surface of the jaw, and on the absence of teeth on the prearticular bone or enlarged fangs on the coronoids. Sigournea differs from other stem tetrapods in having several holes within a depression called the exomeckelian fenestra on the inner surface of the jaw. The closest relatives of Sigournea within Tetrapoda are unknown. Bolt and Lombard did not include it in a phylogenetic analysis in their 2006 description because they thought the single known jawbone did not possess enough unique anatomical characteristics to elucidate its evolutionary relationships. However, in 2008, Bolt and his colleague Marcello Ruta published a phylogenetic analysis that did include Sigournea, and found good support for S. multidentata grouping with Occidens portlocki, a species of stem tetrapod named in 2004 from the earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) of Northern Ireland. Milner et al. (2009) suggested that Sigournea may be a close relative of the slightly younger baphetoid tetrapod Spathicephalus from Scotland and Nova Scotia based on the presence of small, closely packed marginal teeth in both taxa. However, their proposition was tentative because they did not include Sigournea in their phylogenetic analysis.

Together with similar structures at Fort Mitchell (Spike Island), Fort Davis (Whitegate), and Templebreedy Battery (also close to Crosshaven), the fort was built to defend the mouth of Cork Harbour. Though originally constructed in the 16th century, the current structures of the fort date to the 1860s. Originally named Fort Camden and operated by the British Armed Forces, the fort (along with other Treaty Port installations) was handed-over to the Irish Defence Forces in 1938. Renamed Fort Meagher in honour of Thomas Francis Meagher, it remained an Irish military installation until 1989 when the Irish Army handed the fort over to Cork County Council. It remained largely overgrown until 2010 when a group of local volunteers began restoration and development of the fort for heritage and tourism purposes. The fort was renamed Camden Fort Meagher and is now open seasonally to visitors, with exhibits on the fort's Brennan torpedo installation (the world's first \\"practical guided weapon\\").  History  The headland known as Ram's Head overlooks the entrance to Cork Harbour ‚Äì one of the world's largest natural harbours, and historically of strategic defensive and naval importance to Ireland and the region. The first harbour defences built at Ram's Head date from 1550 and were originally known as James' Battery. This fortification was extended in 1600, but fell into disuse after the Nine Years' War. The fort was reinforced in 1690 to defend Cork Harbour during the Williamite War in Ireland, but a party secretly came ashore and took the fort in an overland assault. The ports at Cork and Kinsale were later captured by forces under the Williamite Duke of Marlborough. By the Napoleonic War (1779) the defences were known as the Ram's Head Battery, and upgraded and remodelled to complement other installations at Haulbowline, Spike Island (Fort Westmoreland/Mitchell) and Whitegate (Fort Carlisle/Davis). In 1795 these fortifications were named Fort Camden for John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Gateway from pier area to lower courtyard By the 1830s, Fort Camden had been reduced to a token force, and the fort was briefly repurposed as a prison. However, a Royal Commission in the 1850s gave renewed consideration to the strategic importance of the harbour, and proposed enhancements to landward defences and seaward gun batteries. This construction work started in 1861, using convict, military and civilian labour. The fort was extended during these works, with many of the site's structures being constructed underground. The current structures of the fort are attributable primarily to these works. In the 1880s and 1890s the guns were upgraded with breech-loading rifled guns, newer larger cannon were installed, a minefield was laid across the channel and a launching position was added for the \\"world's first practical guided weapon\\", the \\"Brennan Torpedo\\". During the First World War, the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the \\"Western Approaches\\", an anti-submarine net was added and further upgrades were applied to harbour defences. After the Irish War of Independence, under the Anglo-Irish Treaty the harbour defences remained in the control of British government. These Treaty Port installations, including Fort Camden, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in July 1938. Haulbowline Naval Base, (B) Fort Mitchel/Westmoreland, (C) Fort Meagher/Camden, (D) Fort Davis/Carlisle, (E) Fort Templebreedy During \\"the Emergency\\" (1939‚Äì1945), elements of the Coastal Defence Artillery (CDA) of the Irish Artillery Corps operated from the fort and the nearby Templebreedy Battery. The fort was later renamed Fort Meagher for Thomas Francis Meagher ‚Äì who had fought in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. (Similarly, \\"Fort Westmoreland\\" on Spike Island was renamed \\"Fort Mitchell\\", and \\"Fort Carlisle\\" at Whitegate was renamed \\"Fort Davis\\"). By the mid- to late-20th century the CDA was merged into other artillery regiments of the Irish Army, and the fort was used primarily for training of Civil Defence and Reserve Defence Forces. In the 1980s the army handed-over the fort to the local civil administration authority, Cork County Council. The facility remained disused however, and became overgrown and derelict in the following decades. In 2010 Cork County Council afforded a lease to community members from Crosshaven, who instrumented a volunteer campaign to clear and redevelop the fort as a heritage tourism site.  Tourism development  Historical reenactors on the fort's parade ground From 2010, under a \\"Rescue Camden\\" banner, a community group of volunteers began reclaiming and restoring Camden Fort Meagher. With input from Cork County Council, Foras √Åiseanna Saothair (the Training and Employment Authority), and other partners, the group began to clean, restore, develop and (ultimately) operate the fort as a tourism and heritage centre. Some of these works were covered in documentary programming by RT√â. As of 2017, the fort and its surrounding 45 acre site were open visitors, but limited to weekends and bank holidays between May and September. Parts of the site have been restored for self-guided and guided tours ‚Äì though several areas are not accessible to visitors with reduced mobility. A number of exhibits and installations cover the British and Irish military heritage of the fort, and the site houses one of the only resident 9/11 exhibits outside of the United States. There is a caf√© with views of the harbour mouth, and historical reenactment events are sometimes held on the parade square.  Features  Plan with key features: (A) Barracks, (B) Square, (C) Upper batteries, (D) Lower batteries, (E) Terreplein, (F) Caponier, (G) Bright Tunnel, (H) Main magazine The features of the fort date primarily to developments in the 19th century, when ‚Äì at peak ‚Äì the fort had 7 officers, more than 200 men, and upwards of 20 guns. On the landward side, a ditch, ramparts, terreplein, caponier and flanking batteries defended the approaches. The casemated barracks on the north-east corner (close to the land entrance) housed the garrison and commanded the landward defences. The barracks overlooks the approach road which enters the fort on a bridge over the dry moat. A two-tiered musketry gallery and a number of flanking galleries also covered this moat ‚Äì which at points is wide. Additionally a two-storied caponier had positions for landward gunners. On the ramparts, the terreplein had a number of movable cannon (supported by fixed magazines) and covered an arc of the landward approaches. In 1898, the landward defences are recorded as having four 32 pounder smooth bore breech loading guns. On the seaward side, land batteries were trained on the harbour from upper and lower batteries. The lower casemated batteries had 10 gun positions (behind shields) extending along the sea front. The upper en-barbette batteries had three guns each on the left and right batteries. In 1898 the upper batteries are recorded as having two 6-inch breech loading guns and five QF 12-pounder guns, with QF 6-pounder guns in the lower batteries. At the waterfront, a Brennan Torpedo station was constructed in the 1890s, and a second torpedo slipway was added after 1900. The fort had two piers for boat access. In the centre of the fort a spiral staircase leads down from the parade ground to the vaulted main powder magazine. This main magazine is connected to the lower batteries by a tunnel. The garrison area connects to the lower batteries and piers via a zigzag path to the west. The upper batteries and parade ground also link to the lower areas via a tunnel (known as the \\"bright tunnel\\") to the east.

These are reached from Starkey, Virginia via Starlight Road (State Road 615) and Boone's Chapel Road (State Road 614). One is at the end of Boone's Chapel Road where a Jeep trail crosses the Franklin County line at a pipeline and descends to State Road 613 adjacent to the Maggodee Creek bridge. The other is at the end of Wild Turkey Road (branching southwest from Boone's Chapel Road) and passing just below and east of Milner Place, where it crosses the Franklin County line and descends to Maggodee Creek at the junction of State Road 852 (Guthrie Rd.) and State Road 613. History \\"Maggoty Gap\\" describes a natural gateway of the Great Wagon Road (locally known as The Carolina Road) that made it possible for wagons and livestock traffic to pass through the Blue Ridge Mountains at Roanoke, Virginia near Maggoty Creek (now called Maggodee Creek).Maud Carter Clement, An Abbreviated History of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, chapter 5, Chatham, VA, 1952, per http://victorianvilla.com/sims- mitchell/local/clement/mc/abb/05.htm accessed June 25, 2014. It carried enormous amounts of traffic in the late 18th century and much of the 19th century until a railroad was extended over the ridge in 1892. During the years from 1760 to 1776 it was said to be the heaviest traveled road in all of America.Carl Bridenbaugh, Myths and Realities: Societies of the Colonial South (1952: Louisiana State University Press) p. 130. Morgan Bryan (1671‚Äì1763) cut the path for the first wagon to cross the gap from Starkey, Virginia to Boone's Mill, Virginia in 1746 (at age 78). He reported that he had to disassemble his wagon and carry it piecemeal up the last slope. (It reportedly took three months for him and his sons to travel a distance of about 80 miles from Roanoke to their destination at the \\"Shallow Ford\\" of the Yadkin River in the vicinity of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.)J.P. Crump & H.A. Spraker, The Boone Family, 1922, page 508. In 1753, the original 15 Moravians used Bryan's road to get a wagon to their Wachovia Tract located at present-day Winston- Salem, but took a wrong turn and missed Maggoty Gap; instead with great difficulty they traveled over nearby Windy Gap and rejoined Bryan's road at present-day Boone's Mill. In 1838, Claudius Crozet (1789‚Äì1864) surveyed the road for its improvement as the Pittsylvania, Franklin, and Botetourt Turnpike, still made of dirt but with grades generally to be less than 4 percent and the carriageway to be a minimum of 18 feet wide (right-of-way to be a total of 40 feet wide).List of turnpikes in Virginia and West Virginia (Pittsylvania, Franklin, and Botetourt turnpike) In his field notes, he had two sketches showing \\"Maggoty Creek\\" winding around in the vicinity of the present-day junction of State Roads 613 and 726 (Wades Gap Rd.), and also a road continuing up past the Jacob Naff homestead and John Arthur Road to the \\"top of the Blue Ridge\\" where he labeled the present-day Simmonds Gap as \\"Maggoty Gap\\". His sketch showed the road continuing due north down to the cultivated fields of Starkey. He also noted that a nearby path (now called Daybreak Lane) was not \\"the lowest and best gap\\".J. Daniel Pezzoni (April 1996). \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Cahas Mountain Rural Historic District\\". Virginia Department of Historic Resources; and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map The turnpike was built immediately afterward, following the route over Simmonds Gap that eventually has become State Road 613 (Naff Road and Merriman Road). It suffered deterioration during the Civil War years, however, and the turnpike was abandoned by its owners around 1865.Herman E. Melton: The Franklin Turnpike accessed June 7, 2014, printed in The Pittsylvania Packet, Pittsylvania Historical Society, Chatham, Virginia, Fall 1995, pp. 14/15.

According to Wakka Wakka's website, SAGA features 30 puppets, ranging from 3 inches to 10 feet, portrayed by an international cast of puppeteers from Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and the US'. Form The play uses puppets, the puppeteers wearing masks throughout the play to make them look like Icelandic horses. It makes extensive use of recorded sound, along with sound effects produced by the puppeteers themselves, and quasi-cinematic effects like bullet time. There is some use of a diorama of the farm where the play is set, on which the movements of cars to the farm are performed. The play is in English spoken with Icelandic accents. It lasts for about an hour. Synopsis The play opens with the puppeteers performing a slow, sinister dance to bagpipe music evoking medieval music, looming over the character who turns out to be the protagonist of the play, Gunnar Oddmundsson. The play then cuts to a scene of Gunnar and his son √ìli digging a hole for an outdoor jacuzzi. The scene is rural Iceland and Gunnar and √ìli wear lopapeysur. Gunnar's wife Helga emerges and it becomes clear (partly through this scene and partly later in the play) that √ìlafur is preparing the jacuzzi as part of a scheme to open the 'Viking Bed and Breakfast', tourist accommodation at which Helga is to run a restaurant and Gunnar to run horse and jeep tours. Their conversation is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Geir Haarde making his 'God bless Iceland' speech of October 6, 2008, breaking the news of the unfolding 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis. Gunnar soon finds himself beset with bills he can no longer pay (literally: they flock around his head, held by the puppeteers). A flashforward shows Gunnar looking in on himself unconscious in a jeep that has crashed into the unfinished jacuzzi and telling himself to wake up. Meanwhile, flashbacks recount his earlier conversations with his friend at the bank, who glibly encouraged him to sell his fishing boat and fish-quota, invest the proceeds rather than pay off his mortgage, and to take out loans to buy his way into an idyllic pastoral life, purchasing land, a new house, a jeep, horses, and funding Gunnar's putative tourism business. The series of loans in these flashbacks are portrayed as being taken out with a growing tone of frivolity and derangement on the part of both Gunnar and the banker, with Gunnar coming to sign his name as 'Michael Jackson' and 'Elvis Presley' on loan documents, followed by a dance routine. Gunnar is also portrayed in a flashback horse-racing with his son. Back in the present time of the play, the financial strains in turn strain Gunnar's relationship with Helga: they are shown arguing over whose fault their deteriorating financial situation is. Gunnar meets his lawyer friend J√≥n and they agree to sue the bank in a narrative that runs through much of the play, implying that J√≥n becomes Gunnar's best or even only friend, but never with success. Gunnar participates in the Kitchenware Revolution, facing the police's use of tear gas of January 22, 2009 and his jubilation at the resignation of the government on January 26 is represented by the puppeteers performing an energetic dance with Icelandic flags to the soundtrack of Emil√≠ana Torrini's 2009 hit Jungle Drum. The revolution does not, however, help Gunnar's financial situation; while shearing sheep with √ìli, he is visited by the local sheriff who serves an eviction notice: Gunnar's house is to be repossessed and put up for auction. Helga moves to Norway to take a job in a restaurant there, taking √ìli with her. The backstory of her relationship with Gunnar is explored as a flashback to their first meeting, drunk, outside a bar, involving a graphic representation of drunken outdoor sex, during which Helga implicitly gets pregnant with √ìli, on the occasion of whose birth Gunnar proposes marriage to Helga, which she accepts. After two months in Norway, Helga calls Gunnar asking for a divorce. Gunnar sells his horses at a knock- down price to be able to buy a plane ticket to Norway to try to save the marriage but is thwarted by the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull and their consequent disruption of air traffic. Gunnar's rage provokes the appearance of a representation of his inner Viking, depicted as a huge, bald, black-haired, axe-wielding figure reminiscent of Egill Skallagr√≠msson, and a fantasy of raising a N√≠√∞st√∂ng against his oppressors followed by a homicidal, spade- wielding rampage against them. Gunnar does not, however, follow through on this, instead chasing the Viking away. However, he does not vacate his house ahead of the auction as he is supposed to, and chases away a prospective buyer. A few days later, the day before the auction, the auctioneer brings a policeman to the house to ask Gunnar to leave; Gunnar promises to and the policeman pretends that Gunnar already has. Inspired by his inner Viking, however, Gunnar instead pours petrol around the inside of the house and sets fire to it before driving the jeep into the unfinished jacuzzi. His is knocked unconscious by the crash, but wakes up, climbs out, and calls J√≥n asking for help. J√≥n is not shown to appear, however, and the play closes with Gunnar lying beside the crashed car surrounded by the sinister figures of the puppeteers.

Haslewood was born in 1810 in Wimbledon, then considered part of Surrey, but the exact date of birth is not known; he was christened at Hampstead on 16 July 1811 and he died in 1876 at Marylebone. Cricket career Haslewood played in three matches for Cambridge University that have later been judged to be first-class games: one in each of the 1833, 1834 and 1835 seasons. He batted in the lower order and in the 1835 match at least he bowled, because he is recorded as taking wickets in that game; scorecards for his other matches are incomplete, so it is not possible to determine his exact role, nor whether he batted or bowled right- or left-handed. Career outside cricket Educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, Haslewood was ordained as a priest in the Church of England after graduation. He was a curate at Boughton Monchelsea in Kent where his father was vicar from 1823 to 1857, and then at Greenwich. From 1845 to 1864 he was priest in charge of St Mark's Church in Marylebone and while there he founded a choir school which moved in 1872 to Leatherhead in Surrey to become St John's School, Leatherhead, where one of the school houses is named after him. He was later a vicar in Coventry, in Maidstone and at Mavesyn Ridware in Staffordshire. Haslewood's appointment to St Mark's Church in Hamilton Terrace, which is in Maida Vale, was controversial: he donated ¬£3,500 towards the founding of the church and was then appointed as the priest in charge. Correspondence in The Times suggested that there might be an implication of simony in the arrangement.

Characteristics and capabilities  When completed in 1967, Miller Freeman was the largest research ship in the history of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and its ancestor organizations, and she remained one of the largest research trawlers in the United States throughout her career. Her stern-ramp configuration allowed her to conduct trawling operations in deep-sea waters. Miller Freeman had two cranes with a maximum lifting capacity of 8,500 pounds (3,856 kg) and a third crane with a lifting capacity of 2,750 pounds (1,247 kg). She had three A-frames; one of them is a 29.5-foot (9-meter) trawl gantry and the other two are 14.5-foot (4.4-meter) Oceo A-frames. She also had twelve winches, one with a maximum safe working load of 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg), one with a maximum safe working load of 23,000 pounds (10,433 kg), two with maximum safe working loads of 22,000 pounds (9,979 kg), two with maximum safe working loads of 18,000 pounds (8,165 kg), one with a maximum safe working load of 3,550 pounds (1,610 kg), two with maximum safe working loads of 3,300 pounds (1,497 kg), and two with maximum safe working loads of 1,150 pounds (522 kg). Miller Freeman had various laboratory capabilities, including s 300-square-foot (sq.-ft.) (27.9-square-meter) (m¬≤) wet laboratory, a 300-sq.-ft. (27.9-m¬≤) fish-processing laboratory, a 240-sq.-ft. (22.3-m¬≤) rough laboratory, a 170-sq.-ft. (15.8-m¬≤) ocean chemistry laboratory, and a 152-sq.-ft.(14.1-m¬≤) acoustics laboratory. She also had a 220-sq.ft. (20.4-m¬≤) data plot room and a 50-sq.-ft. (4.6-m¬≤) autosalinomater room. She was outfitted with a large live-tank system which allowed scientists to sustain live sea specimens under pressure aboard ship. Miller Freeman carried three boats: a 26-foot (7.9-meter) Hammerhead Munson Launch with a capacity of nine people, a 185-horsepower (138-kW) motor and a top speed of 21 knots; a five- person rigid-hulled inflatable boat with a 130-horsepower (97-kW) Hamilton jet inboard motor capable of 40 miles per hour (64 km/hr); and a 15-foot (4.6-meter) Zodiac inflatable boat with a 25-horsepower (18.6-kW) outboard motor. In addition to her crew of 34, Miller Freeman could accommodate up to 11 scientists.  Service history  NOAAS Miller Freeman (R 223) approaches a disabled vessel to render assistance during bad weather in the Bering Sea.NOAAS Miller Freeman (R 223) in northern waters.Not yet fully rigged - for example, she had a two-ton (907-kg) crane on her port forecastle but no lifting capability aft - Miller Freeman proceeded after commissioning in 1967 from Ohio through Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the Panama Canal to her home port at Seattle, Washington. However, she did not put to sea again until 1969, when she left Seattle for a cruise in the southern Bering Sea to conduct oceanographic and crab surveys for the Auke Bay Laboratory. Due to a lack of funding for her operations, Miller Freeman was decommissioned on 1 July 1970. When NOAA was established on 3 October 1970, she became part of NOAAs fleet as NOAAS Miller Freeman (R 223), although she remained inactive. Work began on the completion of her rigging, but it, too, suffered from a lack of funding and was suspended at the end of 1972. Work on her rigging eventually resumed, including the installation of a much-needed five-ton (4,536-kg) crane aft, and when it finally was completed she was recommissioned in 1975. She was re-rigged in 1982.NOAA Ship Miller Freeman Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations after her recommissioning with her home port at Seattle, Washington, Miller Freemans primary mission was to provide a working platform for the study of the ocean's living resources, operating primarily in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.NOAA Ship Miller Freeman Images and Real-Time Data After returning to service, she spent much of the remainder of 1975 conducting work in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea in support of the NOAA Offshore Continental Shelf Survey and Assessment Program, primarily carrying out resource surveys for the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction Program (MARMAP). Her research activities were interrupted on 22 October 1975, when the United States Coast Guard asked her to assist the crabbing vessel Aquarian, which had lost her steering while operating in the Aleutian Islands. Despite the rough seas in 40- to 60-knot (74- to 111-km/hr) winds, Miller Freemans crew managed to get a line across to Aquarian and tow her to Akutan Island, ending a two- day ordeal for Aquarians crew. In 1976, Miller Freeman discovered mastodon or mammoth tusk, tooth, and jaw fragments during trawl hauls in the Chukchi Sea and Kotzebue Sound. The discovery was of interest to researchers studying the ancient Bering Land Bridge. In 1988, two of Miller Freemans crew members - Lieutenant Edward R. Cassano, NOAA Corps, and Daniel W. Granstrom - received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal for their role in fighting a major fire that broke out aboard the ship while she was in port at Seattle.

Mathew Quay, on the bank of the River Lee in Cork. It belongs to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and is the only church dedicated to Father Theobald Mathew. The building's listing in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes it as a \\"Regency Gothic-style church with Gothic-Revival portico\\", and it is \\"one of the first large churches in the south of Ireland to be built in this style.\\" Construction of the church began in the early 1830s but stalled shortly before the Great Famine. It would only be completed in 1890, in time for the centenary of the birth of Fr. Mathew. The church features several noteworthy stained glass windows, including three by Harry Clarke's studio and a large memorial to Daniel O'Connell. Background The Capuchin Order arrived in Cork in 1637, thirteen years after the first Capuchin Community in Ireland was established in Dublin. The Cork friary was destroyed at some point in the seventeenth century. Father Bartholomew Mortell subsequently opened a hospice in the city.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 16, 18. Most Catholics, including the Capuchins, were expelled from Cork by Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin in 1644, but the friary was reopened five years later, in 1649. This establishment was likely located on the same site as the later South Friary, on Blackamoor Lane, in what is now Cork's South Parish.Curtin-Kelly, p. 20. The South Friary was built in 1771 by Father Arthur O'Leary. O'Leary described the church as \\"remarkable for its dwarfish dimensions, its utter want of architectural grace, and its perfect seclusion from the public gaze\\". The Capuchin and temperance reformer Theobald Mathew arrived in Cork in 1814 and became an active social crusader, working to improve the conditions of the city's poor.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 23‚Äì24. Father Mathew resolved to replace the cramped South Friary with a new church, and a committee was established to oversee the planning. A competition was held in 1825, and the plan by architect George Richard Pain ‚Äî who also designed Blackrock Castle and the courthouse on Washington Street ‚Äî was chosen. Pain, a former apprentice of the architect John Nash, was awarded the contract for ¬£50.Curtin-Kelly, p. 37. Construction The city authorities offered a site on Sullivan's Quay, facing across the River Lee's south channel to the Grand Parade. For reasons that are uncertain, Mathew declined and opted for a site on Charlotte Quay, now Fr. Mathew Quay. This required the marshy ground on Morrison's Island to be drained and a foundation be built to bear the church's weight. The preparation of the site cost almost ¬£1,600.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 39‚Äì40. It was estimated that the church would cost ¬£10,000 to build, half of which was raised by the citizens of Cork. The simultaneous construction of two other churches ‚Äî St. Patrick's on the Lower Glanmire Road, by Pain and his brother James Pain, and the Dominican St. Mary's on Pope's Quay by Thomas and Kearns Deane ‚Äî meant that the architects were competing for funds at a time when the city was stricken by a cholera outbreak. A further ¬£4,500 was provided by Mathew himself.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 31, 44. The foundation stone was laid on 10 October 1832, Mathew's birthday. A dispute over costs led to Mathew paying Pain a further ¬£300. Pain died in 1838, and supervision of the construction was taken over by Thomas Coakley. The cost of the church had spiralled to ¬£14,000 by 1840. With the builder, a Mr Anthony, unable to meet his costs, work stalled in 1841.Curtin-Kelly, p. 44. Mathew refused the suggestions of many to use subscriptions from the temperance movement to fund his church.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 26‚Äì27. Following the Great Famine, a public meeting in Cork agreed to continue work on Holy Trinity. Thomas Deane, whose entry in the original competition had failed, was chosen to complete the church without its portico and spire. William Atkins was given responsibility for the church's interior.Curtin-Kelly, p. 45. The church finally opened on 10 October 1850. A Pontifical High Mass was held, with admission by ticket, and celebrated by the bishops of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, and Ossory.Curtin-Kelly, p. 46. Nevertheless, the interior was only completed ten years after Mathew's death, about 1866, and the portico remained unfinished. The sculptor John Hogan produced two carved heads flanking the main door.Curtin-Kelly, p. 56. =Completion= Several suggestions were made in the following two decades to complete the fa√ßade of Holy Trinity. A proposal by George Ashlin was approved in 1877 which would have differed drastically from Pain's original plans, but this was not carried out.Curtin-Kelly, p. 48. Fr. Paul Neary, the Capuchin provincial superior in Ireland, organised celebrations for the centenary of Fr. Mathew's birth, and organised a public meeting to stimulate progress on the church. It was decided to complete the church to Pain's design. A campaign was organised to ensure the funds were in place for work to be completed.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 50‚Äì51. Another competition was held to select a fa√ßade, with the prize again ¬£50; among the requirements were that it should be made of limestone, like the existing structure, and cost no more than ¬£6,000.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 51‚Äì52. Of the twelve entries, Ashlin, now consultant architect to the Building Committee, described that by Walter G. Doolin as \\"the one most suitable for a fa√ßade to the building;\\" submissions also came from Thomas Drew and Ashlin's own firm Pugin & Ashlin. The committee, however, selected a design by Dominic (or Dominick) J. Coakley. This design was praised for its closeness to that of Pain but at a smaller scale. The limestone used in the fa√ßade came from the same quarry as the earlier work had used, in Little Island, which had deliberately lain unused until work recommenced.Curtin-Kelly, p. 52. The construction work was taken over by Corkman John Sisk. There was evidently some concern that the church would not be completed for Mathew's centenary, which Denny Lane said would be \\"a national disgrace.\\" Nevertheless, work on Holy Trinity was completed in time and the church was reopened on 13 October 1890, marked with another ticketed Mass. =Interior= The nave of Holy Trinity The north window, behind the high altar, is dedicated to Daniel O'Connell and was installed in 1850, three years after his death.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 70‚Äì71. Two other stained glass windows, likely by the same artist, depict the Virgin Mary and the coat of arms of Pope Leo XIII.Curtin-Kelly, p. 73. A stained glass window in the east wall, commissioned by the Cork and District Trades and Labour Council and dedicated to Cork Capuchin brother Thomas Dowling, who had mediated an industrial dispute during World War I, was produced by Joshua Clarke to a design by his son Harry Clarke and under his supervision. Among other figures, it features Christ as Prince of Peace and Saint Francis holding a dove, with the city's skyline at the bottom of the window.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 77‚Äì82. Two further windows were commissioned from Harry Clarke and his brother, Walter, depicting the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Conception being venerated by Munster saints.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 85‚Äì86. Installation of these windows was overseen by the architect James Finbarre McMullen (or McMullan) and John Sisk between 1918 and 1929. The interior was substantially altered in the early 1900s. A memorial chapel was added in 1908, dedicated to Fr. Bernard Jennings (died 1904), a Cork Capuchin social worker, at a cost of ¬£3,500 and designed by Ashlin. This extension had the effect of unbalancing the interior, however, as there was no space for a mirroring chapel on the other side.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 96‚Äì97. Further alterations were made to the interior about 1942 by McMullen. Extensive renovations were carried out in the 1980s at the instigation of church guardian Father Eustace McSweeney, who wished to bring the church's interior in line with the liturgy of the Second Vatican Council. Structural flaws and problems such as dry rot evidently riddled the building, to the extent that some suggested demolishing and rebuilding the church from scratch.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 98‚Äì99. At a cost of ¬£500,000, the church was entirely renovated within a year in 1982. This involved, controversially, replacing the casings around the cast-iron columns with more slender wooden casings and removing the original pulpit, high altar and confessionals.Curtin- Kelly, pp. 63‚Äì65, 98-99. The interior porch was extended in 2013 to encompass the area beneath the balcony.Curtin-Kelly, p. 109 =Friary= Together with the 1771 chapel, a Capuchin friary stood on Blackamoor Lane from the mid-18th century until the 1850s. The congregation moved to George's Quay by 1855 and subsequently moved across the river to a site across the road from the new church. A plan for a friary which would wrap around the church on three sites was put forward by John Pine Hurley, who \\"offered his professional services, without remuneration,\\" and the foundation stone was laid during a ceremony on 23 September 1866. However, the building was evidently never completed.Curtin- Kelly, p. 66. The current friary, directly adjacent to the church on the west side and designed by Robert Walker in the Venetian Gothic style, was completed in 1884 (although some sources say 1888). This three-storey structure, built out of limestone and red brick, was built in a matter of weeks and described by the Cork Examiner as \\"pleasing in the extreme ... the most perfect monastery in Ireland\\". A statue of Saint Francis was placed over the entrance in 1934.Curtin-Kelly, p. 69. Architecture Holy Trinity was designed in a simple English Gothic Revival, or Regency Gothic, architectural style. Pain was a strong proponent of this style over High Victorian Gothic, which was favoured by his rivals, the Deanes, although he also worked in Classical architecture.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 38‚Äì39, 61. He made extensive use of arched windows, flying buttresses and columns, culminating in a tapering \\"lacy Gothic spire, seemingly more air than stone.\\" At the time of its completion, the church was described by the Cork Examiner as \\"a worthy memorial of its renowned patron ... The whole design is exceedingly graceful.\\" Pain's plan would have brought the church to a height of , but the building as realised only reaches .Curtin-Kelly, p. 60. Cast-iron was used extensively to achieve the spaciousness of the church interior. Curtin-Kelly suggests this was because of the poor, marshy foundations, which would have prohibited heavier, stone columns.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 63‚Äì65. Social history The Capuchin community in Cork acquired a premises on Queen Street, modern Fr Mathew Street, in 1907. This building, now known as Father Mathew Hall, was used to host theatrical performances, annual pantomimes and other productions from 1911 to the 1960s. It remains the venue for the annual Feis Maiti√∫ begun by Capuchin Fr Miche√°l O'Shea in 1927. A fenced boundary wall was added to the front of the church about 1960. From 1968, the Capuchin friars organised a \\"Clothing Guild\\" to distribute clothes and other items to the poor in Cork, distributing up to 5,000 sacks of clothing annually at its peak. Various other social efforts have been undertaken by the Capuchins in Cork, including the organisation of youth groups, sodalities and prayer groups. In 2013, the church hosted visiting relics of Franciscan saint Anthony of Padua. In 2015, the Capuchin Order celebrated the four-hundredth anniversary of its arrival in Ireland. Patricia Curtin-Kelly's book An Ornament to the City, a survey of Holy Trinity's history, was published at this time with a foreword by the provincial superior.Curtin-Kelly, pp. 4‚Äì5. In popular culture The church features in the novel Beyond Absolution by Cora Harrison, and was used as a filming location in an episode of The Young Offenders television series.

Many existing stars of the Argentine stage and radio appeared in the film, but its success was limited due to poor sound quality and weak acting. ¬°Tango! established a formula that would be used by many subsequent tango films. Synopsis ¬°Tango! follows a formula established by Carlos Gardel with films such as Luces de Buenos Aires (The Lights of Buenos Aires, 1931) in which a melodramatic story is interspersed with tango songs. However, the film had less dialog and more music, making it more like a musical revue. This format would be copied by many subsequent films. The plot is derived from tango songs. Many of these songs tell of the seduction of an innocent slum girl by a rich man who promises her a glamorous life, but who abandons her when her looks fade. The stylized and sentimental plot of ¬°Tango! revolves around a young man who is abandoned by his girlfriend for an older rich man and is heartbroken. The film follows his misfortunes. The final scene has the hero, dressed as a typical compadrito, singing Milonga del 900. The song, by Carlos Gardel, ends: I love her because I love her and therefore I forgive her. There is nothing worse than rancor to live in bitterness.

Associate membership was available to those \\"otherwise not qualified, but who had assisted at the ports of evacuation\\". The association was formed at Leeds in 1953. Five veterans who had been on the Dunkirk Beach or in the vicinity fighting, met in the bar of the Queens Hotel, City Square, Leeds on 3 September 1953. They wanted to foster the spirit of comradeship and support experienced during the evacuation and support fellow veterans who had fallen on hard times. The first membership card, no 1, showed the 6d subscription collected and receipted by Harold Robinson (awarded MBE in 1970 for services to veterans charities) who had been voted in as Honorary General Secretary and stayed in that honorary post until his death in 1988, whilst working as a schoolteacher. The association started to arrange pilgrimages to the beaches and towns from which troops had been evacuated including Dunkirk, De Panne, Bray Dunes and Calais. During the first pilgrimage by 45 veterans in 1954, they realised that the local towns and population were still suffering deprivation and shortages. Subsequently, DVA members arranged food parcels for the local population. As the DVA expanded more veterans joined the pilgrimages. The accepted rule was you paid your own way there and joined fellow veterans at pre-booked Hotel and B&B; accommodation. Some stayed with families they had met during the evacuation who had assisted them, taking the opportunity to repay kindnesses. These pilgrimages took place when large parts of the towns and villages were still exhibiting severe War damage and rebuilding had not fully started. Remembrance services were held on beaches and in villages, towns, many conducted by the Reverend Leslie Aitken (later Right Rev. and MBE) who was the DVA first and only 'Padre' having been part of the founding group. (Aitken was the author of Massacre on the road to Dunkirk, detailing the murder by an SS company of 45 officers and men at Wormhoudt in France.) In 1956 Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother agreed to be the patron and attended the 1957 pilgrimage, unveiling the Dunkirk Memorial and taking the salute at a march past of DVA members in the Place de Jean Bart in Dunkirk. Over 1000 veterans paraded. At its peak membership in the mid 1970s over 20,000 veterans from the UK, with increasing numbers of ex-patriates and Commonwealth Dunkirk Veterans, would make the pilgrimage trip each year to honour their fallen comrades. Distinguished DVA members included General James Steele, General Ashton Wade, Brigadier General James Gawthorpe, Squadron Leader Douglas Bader and Donald Kaberry (later Lord Kaberry of Adel). Royal patronage continued with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh taking the salute at the 40th anniversary parade in May 1980 in Folkestone. Official 1940 DVA organised pilgrimages (arranged by Harold Robinson MBE) continued every year until 1988 (when he died in office) then became locally organised by branches until the 60th anniversary in 2000 when the association was disbanded centrally in light of an aging and decreasing membership. Some local branches maintained contact between members until time took its toll. At its height, the 1940 Dunkirk Veterans Association had over 165,000 members worldwide, with over 100 branches in the UK, 20+ branches across the USA and Canada, 25+ branches across Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, 12 branches across South Africa, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia at the time they were created) Kenya, Tanzania, branches in Gibraltar, Malta, Brazil and Argentina. Harold Robinson fostered links between veterans associations in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany, promoting peace and comradeship between old soldiers. During the 1970s, when the British veterans became eligible for the Dunkirk Medal, he vetted all applications, processed and issued over 100,000 medals on behalf of the Dunkirk Town Council. Upon his death in October 1988, his funeral was held at St Michael's and All Angels church, Headingley, Leeds. It was attended by over 2500 people, requiring a p.a system for the crowds outside. Attendees included The Lord Mayors of Leeds, Bradford, Dover, Folkestone, Margate, Ramsgate, the entire town councils and mayor's of Dunkirk, De Panne and Calais. Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire, Lord Kaberry of Adel (representing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) local MPs, DVA members from all UK branches bringing the branch standards, plus representative members from many overseas branches. The Yorkshire Regiment supplied an overnight guard of honour for the coffin in the church and paraded with the DVA at the start of the service. Many ex-pupils, taught through his 35years as a teacher, also attended. The service was conducted by the Right Reverend Leslie Aitken, the DVA padre and was followed by a private family cremation at Lawnswood Cemetery. Harold Robinson received many accolades during his life, including the MBE. Chevalier D'Honour, The Freedom of Dunkirk, The Freedom of De Panne. The Flandres-Dunkirk award, and awards from many other countries for his veteran support work. He occupied varying additional posts including 20 yrs as Chairman of the Headingley Branch of the Royal British Legion, Leeds Poppy Appeal organiser for the RBL, Parade Marshall for Leeds City Remembrance Day Parade, Council member of SAFA, regional Council member of RBL, and was also a hospice visitor for veterans. He spoke seven languages fluently and could 'get by' in several more, taught thousands of children and was married for 43 years to Eileen Robinson who died only eight months after him.

He was the last known member of the Strus family of Komarow-Osada. His father was Jakub Strus, and mother was Barbara Potocka. Strus began military service probably in 1590 or 1591. On March 7, 1591, he was granted royal permission to own real estate near Kamieniec Podolski. In the following years, he took part in a number of wars and military conflicts in eastern areas of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as in Moldavia, Livonia and the Tsardom of Russia. In 1595, he probably participated in a raid on Moldavia, carried out by Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski. In 1596, serving under Stanislaw Zolkiewski, he pacified the Nalyvaiko Uprising. In 1600, he once again fought in Moldavia, fighting against Michael the Brave. In 1601 - 1602, Strus fought against the Kingdom of Sweden in the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War (1600‚Äì29). Among others, he participated in the Siege of Wolmar, Siege of Fellin and the Siege of Weissenstein. On January 19, 1602 in Vilnius, Strus, as an envoy of Polish cavalry, discussed delayed payments with King Zygmunt III Waza. By 1605, he already was a Rittmeister of a Cossack choragiew, with which he fought Crimean Tatars in the Battle of Udycz, on January 28, 1606. In the autumn 1609, Strus joined the Siege of Smolensk (1609‚Äì11), leading a unit of 150 Hussars, 50 Cossacks and 100 infantry. On July 4, 1610, he fought in the Battle of Klushino, after which he rushed with Aleksander Zborowski and Mikolaj Scibor Marchocki to King Zygmunt III Waza, presenting to him captured flags of the enemy (July 17). In the spring of 1612, together with 1000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, Strus joined forces of Lithuanian Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, which was sent to reinforce Commonwealth garrison of the Moscow Kremlin. Battle of Klushino On June 27, 1612, Strus was named commandant of the garrison, and in September of the same year, under Russian pressure, he agreed for negotiations. On November 7, 1612, Polish-Lithuanian garrison of the Kremlin capitulated: the Russians broke the conditions of the capitulation, and murdered some Polish soldiers. Strus himself was captured and imprisoned in the Chudov Monastery, where he stayed for seven years, despite numerous efforts of Polish authorities. He was released on June 10, 1619, half a year after the Truce of Deulino, and immediately rejoined the Commonwealth army, fighting in the Battle of Cecora (September 19, 1620). In this battle, he commanded a unit of 2000 men, and was listed among main leaders of the Polish troops. While fighting, Strus was wounded and captured by Crimean Tatars, who took him with them to Crimea. On July 21, 1621, the szlachta appealed to King Zygmunt III Waza to initiate negotiations to release Strus.

Polish Crown forces under Stefan Czarniecki besieged the town of Stavyshche (Stawiszcze), which at that time belonged to Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth‚Äôs Kiev Voivodeship. The residents of Stavyshche rebelled against Polish rule, and as a result, the town was destroyed in January 1665. In mid-1664, Polish forces under Czarniecki raided Right-bank Ukraine. At the same time, the town of Stavyshche/Stawiszcze, located near Kiev rebelled against Polish rule (see Treaty of Andrusovo). Its siege began on July 7, and lasted four months, after which the defenders surrendered, due to hunger and lack of ammunition. Leaders of the rebellion were caught and killed, and the town had to pay a large fine to Polish troops. Soon afterwards, another rebellion began at Stavyshche. This time, Czarniecki ordered to murder all residents, and burn the town to the ground.  First Rebellion  The rebellion began in June 1664, and its leaders immediately called Zaporozhian Cossacks commanded by Ivan Briukhovetsky for help. In response, Crown Hetman Stefan Czarniecki ordered 1000 soldiers to stay at Korsun, in order to check the Cossacks of Briukhovetsky. Main Polish forces headed towards the town, appearing there on July 7. The defence of Stavyshche was commanded by Cossack Colonels Diachko and Bulganin, and Polish forces were supported by Crimean Tatars, who, with permission of Czarniecki, burned all local villages, capturing their inhabitants. On July 11, Czarniecki ordered general attack. Poles and Tatars managed to get into the town, but immediately the Tatars busied themselves with looting. Cossack defenders took advantage of this and counterattacked, forcing the invaders to retreat. In late July Poles attacked again, managing to get onto the defensive wall, but their losses were so high that Czarniecki halted the assault. Cossack losses also were extremely high. After both assaults Czarniecki, whose forces lacked heavy artillery, decided to stop further attacks, and concentrated his efforts on blocking the town. Since main Polish and Tatar forces were concentrated around Stavyshche, Cossack Hetman Ivan Briukhovetsky counterattacked. After initial success, the Cossacks, supported by Russians and Kalmuks, were defeated by fresh forces of the Nogai Horde.  Capitulation  The situation of the besieged town was desperate. Furthermore, in late summer 1664, Stefan Czarniecki‚Äôs soldiers brutally pacified Ukraine, murdering thousands of peasants, and Cossack rebellion lost its momentum. On October 7, the rebels gave up the resistance and pledged loyalty to Polish king. After the capitulation, Cossack leaders were killed by Poles, but upon order of Czarniecki, other residents of Stavishche were spared. The inhabitants were obliged to financially support two units of Polish Crown army, and Czarniecki ordered the removal of bells at the local Orthodox church.  Second Rebellion  In January 1665, another anti-Polish rebellion broke out in Stavishche. Cossacks killed all Polish soldiers, stationed in the town, and Stefan Czarniecki decided to punish Stavishche, sending a division, which completely burned the town, murdering all its residents. During these events, Czarniecki was injured, and as a result of this, he died on February 15, 1665.

It was an industrial union which represented all production employees in the vehicle industry and automotive parts manufacturing industry. History In the late nineteenth century a number of small unions were formed in the Australian colonies to represent skilled coachbuilders in the horse-drawn coach building industry. In NSW a union of coachbuilders was formed in Bathurst in 1863, while a South Australian union was formed in the 1880s, before folding in 1896 due to lack of members. In 1917 the Australian Coach, Motor Car, Tram Car, Waggon Builders, Wheelwrights' and Rolling Stock Makers' Employees' Federation was registered federally. During the 1920s the union's membership was transformed as motor cars replaced coaches and carriages, and assembly line methods of production replaced trade-qualified coachbuilders with unskilled or semi-skilled assembly workers. In 1930 it reregistered under the even more cumbersome name of the Australian Coach, Motor Car, Tram Car, Waggon Builders, Wheelwrights' and Air Craft Rolling Stock Makers' Employees‚Äô Federation. In 1938 it changed its name to the much simpler Vehicle Builders Employees' Federation. The union grew rapidly after WWII, due to the growth in the Australian car industry, reaching approximately 30,000 members by the early 1960s. Many of these new members were recent migrants from Europe, termed New Australians, who could easily find unskilled work in the large car assembly plants despite limited English. In 1993 the VBEF merged with the Metals and Engineering Workers Union to form the Automotive Metals & Engineering Union.

It was founded in 2007 with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona.‚ÄúAbout Local Motors‚Äù, Local Motors Website The company‚Äôs current vehicles include the Rally Fighter and their 3D-printed Strati and Swim vehicles. The company develops vehicles using 3D Printing and utilizes vehicle designs provided by the online community. In 2016, the company introduced an autonomous electric-powered shuttle named Olli. Community Local Motors' website is a community focusing on vehicle innovation. The content is created by the users who discuss designing, engineering, and building innovative vehicles. Members contribute their own ideas and projects which are discussed with the community. Co-creation is a technique used by Local Motors, General Electric, and LEGO to enhance new product development. Select organizations have partnered with the company to facilitate co-creation of their products including US Army, Domino‚Äôs, and Airbus. Local Motors uses Co-designing type of customer co-creation in which the selective process is made by its community and some features such as frame and structure are scoped by the company. Firstly, users create drawing designs and the decorative ideas on their own style. Although the users are novices or experts, all users can participate in this step. After that users present their designs on the website, the best design selected by people in the community will be developed by the company. Finally, the company will launch the co-designing car into the market. Using Co-creation method, company gains customer‚Äôs engagement and loyalty. One of the biggest community driven competitions was hosted by Local Motors in collaboration with Airbus. Propositions The propositions that Local Motors offer are:  The car is produced and designed using the co- designing type of co-creation, which is called crowdsourcing.  The car was produced in 18 months, which is faster than the usual process by five times.  They are road legal cars.  The wheels are strong off-road wheels and are grade 8, which are used in the military.  About $3 million was spent to develop the car, which is less than the amount spent on commercial models by the automakers. The company achieved to spend about 3 million dollars by rethinking the car‚Äôs features, so they designed a five-point seat belt, which costs $10, instead of developing an airbag, which will cost them $6 million.  Rally Fighter  The Rally Fighter was the first model produced by Local Motors and is an open sourced vehicle. The car was introduced in 2009 after 18 months of development, which constitutes a record Time to Market compared to the automobile industry standards, by applying innovative technologies and crowd sourcing techniques. As the company describes it, the Rally Fighter is \\"a fully capable off-road prerunner, with the amenities and luxuries of an every-day on road vehicle\\". Strati In collaboration with Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory Local Motors manufactured Strati, the world's first 3D printed electric car. The printing took 44 hours to complete, and was witnessed by a live audience at the 2014 International Manufacturing Technology Show in McCormick Place, Chicago. The car consists of 50 individual parts, far less than a traditional vehicle (which is manufactured with roughly 30,000 parts). The Strati was designed by Michele Ano√®, a member of the Local Motors community, and is produced in small quantities to serve strategic partnerships, such as with NXP Semiconductors.  LM3D Swim  In 2015, the company debuted a 3D-printed car named the LM3D Swim. It was designed by Kevin Lo, a member of the Local Motors community. The materials used are 80 percent ABS plastic and 20 percent carbon fiber. The vehicle uses technology provided by IBM that offered IoT connectivity. The Swim is currently on display at the company‚Äôs location in National Harbor, Maryland.  Olli  Olli In 2016, the company unveiled an autonomous, electric-powered bus. The vehicle was designed by Edgar Sarmiento, initially named the \\"Berlino\\" from the Urban Mobility Challenge: Berlin 2030. The vehicle was built by Local Motors and has IBM Watson technology installed to provide a personalized experience for riders. The vehicle was demonstrated live to their online audience on Facebook Live at a media event in National Harbor. The vehicle is still undergoing development. On January 2, 2018, Local Motors received a pledge of up to a $1 billion in financing and operational support to customers of Olli from Florida-based Elite Transportation Services (ETS) with additional funding of $20 million from Texas-based Xcelerate. Olli was manufactured in Chandler, Arizona using additive manufacturing techniques, including 3D Printing. The company has not announced pricing yet. Miami-Dade County, the State of Nevada and the Danish Vesthimmerland Municipality expressed interest in using Olli on their roadways. As of January 2020, Olli has been deployed at the United Nations ITCILO campus in Turin, Italy to provide transport shuttle to employees and guests within the campus.https://www.newmobility.global/autonomous/autonomous-shuttle-olli- deployed-turin-italy/  Locations  Local Motors has facilities in Phoenix, Tempe, Knoxville, and National Harbor.

The hotel currently has 1,479 rooms and 39 restaurants. It has hosted numerous heads of state and is home to a 400-year-old garden. History Construction of the hotel was requested by the Japanese government in the early 1960s, in order to fill a perceived shortage of hotel space for foreign visitors to the upcoming 1964 Summer Olympics. Yonetaro Otani, a former sumo wrestler who founded and ran a small steel company, agreed to build the hotel on a site he owned.

Retrieved on April 3, 2009. The 1,085-room hotel was built in seventeen months using a number of techniques that were revolutionary in Japan at the time, such as curtain walls and prefabricated unit bathrooms. The 400-year-old garden on the site was retained as part of the hotel. The hotel was first announced under a management contract with Sheraton Hotels as the Otani-Sheraton Hotel. However, by the time of its completion, the arrangement was no longer in place, and the hotel opened as The New Otani on 1 September 1964, to coincide with the Olympics the following month. The New Otani was the tallest building in Tokyo from 1964 until 1968, when the Kasumigaseki Building was completed. It took on an iconic status during this period, particularly for its unique revolving restaurant on the highest floor. During this time, the building was a filming location for the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, where it appeared as the headquarters of Osato Chemical & Engineering Co Ltd, the Japanese front for Ernst Stavro Blofeld's SPECTRE organization. The New Otani was greatly expanded in 1974, when the 40-storey Garden Tower opened. A third building, the 30-storey Garden Court office tower, opened in 1991. The original 1964 building, today referred to as \\"The Main\\", was extensively renovated and remodelled in 2007, when it was given a modern glass facade.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Burford House is located on the west side of New Hampshire Route 10, about south of its junction with Brook Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wooden structure, with a clapboarded exterior and gabled roof. Instead of more typical stud- framing construction, its walls are formed with three-inch planks as framing members, joined for lateral stability by wooden dowels. It is five bays wide and three deep, with a central chimney. It has a particularly elaborate Greek Revival front entry surround, with sidelight windows and fluted moulding. The main block is joined to a 19th-century barn by a series of smaller ells. The house was built in 1843, and is one of a cluster of locally significant plank- frame houses. This house belonged to Walter Nelson, who was the first to identify and document Goshen's numerous plank-framed houses. He lived in this house for 65 years until his death in 1970, and became interested in the subject after researching this house's construction and history.

The first feature film produced by Rooster Teeth, it stars Burnie Burns, Gavin Free, Michael Jones, Colton Dunn, Allie DeBerry, and Alan Ritchson. The film follows the Lazer Team, a group of four who find themselves responsible for the fate of the planet upon discovering an alien crash site containing a battle suit. The film was produced by Hullum, Burns, and Doreen Copeland. Burns and Hullum also co-wrote the script, alongside Rooster Teeth employees Chris Demarais and Josh Flanagan. Funding for Lazer Team was largely raised through a successful Indiegogo campaign, raising over $2.4 million in a month. Filming began in October 2014, with principal photography taking place in Austin and New Mexico. Lazer Team premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 24, 2015. Through Amplify and Tugg, the film was theatrically released on January 27, 2016, as a cinema-in-demand model. The film was also released onto YouTube Premium the same day, as well as being added to Rooster Teeth's FIRST streaming service on November 3, 2017.Lazer Team Is Now On Rooster Teeth FIRST! - Rooster Teeth Lazer Team received mixed reviews and grossed $1.6 million on a $2.4 million budget. A sequel, Lazer Team 2, was released on November 13, 2017.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx0oRAg47Bo Plot The suit of power on display In 1977, the government has secretly decoded a transmission, sent by the alien Antareans, which warns of a deadly race known as the Worg, coming to destroy Earth. To help defend Earth, the Antareans have sent a powerful battle suit for the \\"Champion of Earth\\" to wear. The government begins training a boy named Adam from birth to be the Champion. Thirty-eight years later, Officer Anthony Hagan arrests Zach Spencer for causing trouble at a party and begins to drive him away, only to find Woody Johnson and Herman Mendoza shooting unauthorized fireworks. Herman defiantly launches a massive rocket which strikes an incoming UFO and causes it to crash nearby. The UFO opens to reveal the battle suit, and the four men each take a piece of it. The suit activates when all four pieces are worn, and each piece becomes irreversibly and genetically locked to its wearer. They discover Zach's arm-cannon can shoot energy projectiles, Hagan's gauntlet can create an energy field, Woody's helmet increases his intelligence over time, and Herman's boots can make him run at superhuman speeds. The military shows up and apprehends the group. Angry that their preparations have been jeopardized and that Zach has posted a selfie with the suit (calling the four \\"Lazer Team\\"), Colonel Emory gives Adam orders to train them in only four days, after which time the Worg are scheduled to arrive. Meanwhile, a group of soldiers are possessed by small robotic insects sent by the Worg, and begin to hunt down Lazer Team and possess Mindy, Hagan's daughter. The officers in charge decide to try and amputate the suit from the team, but when brought to the hospital, they escape using the suit's abilities. They are intercepted by Adam, but they work together to create a strong energy shield and knock him unconscious. After escaping, they hide out in Hagan's ex-wife's cabin. Zach calls the Worg- controlled Mindy on Skype and gives her his location. She arrives and attacks the group, but they subdue her and Woody communicates with the Worg through the device on the back of her neck. Before they can finish negotiating, Zach rips the device off and it self-destructs, destroying the cabin. They are then pursued by the possessed soldiers, but escape. The team goes on their way to Zach and Mindy's high school, where they find that an Antarean ship has arrived and is over the town's football field, creating a giant forcefield around it. The Worg transmit a message, calling the Champions of Earth to battle. Lazer Team is once again ambushed by the possessed soldiers, but they use teamwork to kill all four of them. With the pressure of saving the planet weighing down on them, they decide to hide except for Hagan, who turns himself in to the military. However, now seeing the full potential in the team, Adam frees Hagan and they sneak to the stadium where a crowd has formed around the UFO. They find the rest of the team there and regroup, hijacking a police car and ramming it into the forcefield to successfully reach the football field. The Worg warrior arrives in an identical suit of armor. Woody intercepts a transmission from the ship, revealing that rather than a war they are part of an elimination tournament where the Antareans destroy the losers' planets until one remains. Lazer Team proves unsuccessful at defeating the Worg by themselves, so Adam begins a distraction using riot gear from the police car. Adam is killed by the Worg with a dark matter beam, indirectly teaching the team how to achieve this with the suit. Lazer Team and the Worg fire dark matter beams into each other, creating a vortex. The four separated suit pieces malfunction and Lazer Team is blown clear of the forcefield, but the Worg and the Antarean ship are consumed. The team is greeted by a huge crowd outside. Emory arrives and states that the war isn't over, and that Lazer Team is going into space.

Production =Development= The concept for Rooster Teeth's first live action feature was in development as early as 2010. It was first announced at Halo Fest during PAX Prime 2011. Burns stated they were drawing inspirations from, \\"a lot of the sci-fi classics that we've grown up with,\\" but were, \\"not making a parody and we're not making a send-up ‚Äì we're making our own movie.\\" Influences on the script included \\"team movies\\" such as The Mighty Ducks and Cool Runnings. According to co-writers Chris Demarais and Josh Flanagan, the third act was completely restructured by them a week before shooting began. Lazer Team is the second feature film directed by Rooster Teeth CEO Matt Hullum. While writing the story, Burns did not imagine himself playing Hagan, saying \\"I tend to be a bigger, loud-mouthed, talk-fast kind of guy ... I had to essentially take it down a notch to play him.\\" In February 2014, Burns confirmed the company was going to launch a crowdfunding campaign for the film as a way to offer more support options while gaining publicity. Freddie Wong was a consultant in shaping their campaign. The Indiegogo page for the film launched in June 2014. The fundraiser reached its $650,000 goal in under 10 hours and broke Indiegogo's record for the fastest film campaign to reach $700,000. Within three days, Lazer Team broke $1 million. Lazer Team holds the record for the highest funded film campaign on Indiegogo with over $2.4 million collected. On the final day of the campaign, Rooster Teeth released a special perk for a single fan to be cast in a walk-on role; within 20 seconds of the perk going live, 535 people purchased the perk, as it slowed the site's ticketing system. All 535 people were used for a crowd scene in the film. Hullum stated that the crew had been contacted by multiple distribution companies, media companies, and acting agencies since the campaign began. Burns corroborated, explaining that the film's budget increased as the campaign earned more money: Casting calls and auditions for minor speaking roles in were held for attendees at RTX 2014. Additional casting for extras was held during shooting. Blaine Gibson also auditioned for the role of Zach. =Filming= Principal photography began on October 14, 2014. Filming took place over 40 days in Austin and New Mexico. During the first week of production, filming took place at the Austin National Guard Armory, as well as the University of Texas at Austin. Filming wrapped on December 13. Reshoots started in late February 2015. To avoid interrupting Achievement Hunter's online video schedule, Free and Jones pre- recorded content for a month prior to filming. During filming, both came into the office, \\"half the days that we had off\\" to film videos instead of sleeping for a few hours before returning to set. Release Lazer Team premiered in Austin at Fantastic Fest, on September 24, 2015, followed by a Canadian premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival on October 16, a European premiere at the Film4 FrightFest on October 24, and an Australian premiere at RTX Australia on January 22, 2016.

The theaters were selected through the Tugg platform, which determines the interest of a screening at a specific theater. It set a Tugg record in Australia when it sold 800 tickets to a single theatre at Event Cinemas' George Street, in Sydney. The film reportedly grossed $1 million through pre-sale tickets. From February 10, 2016, the film was available for streaming as part of YouTube's new paid subscription service YouTube Red. On November 3, 2017, shortly before the release of the sequel, Lazer Team was made available for FIRST members on Rooster Teeth's website. Reception =Box office= Lazer Team played in theaters as a cinema-in-demand model where if fans gathered a certain number of people who wanted to see the film, the producers would find a theater for a one-time showing event. The distributors managed 480 screenings (for one night only) in both the U.S. and abroad. The picture was also four-walled for a 35-screen run in the U.S. It was played 47 times in the UK and fans lined up around the block. In Australia, it screened 65 times. Lazer Team ended up grossing over $1.1 million in the U.S. and over $1.6 million globally, according to Rentrak. The film was unable to recoup its 2.4 million dollar budget in the theatrical window. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Scott Weinberg, writing for Nerdist, praised the film's amiable, '80s tone and \\"surprisingly nifty\\" effects, calling it \\"a good deal of quaint, geeky fun.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered dubbed it, \\"the Anti-Pixels.\\" Marc Savlov from The Austin Chronicle gave it a mixed review, writing \\"Sharply edited while ranging all over the comic map ‚Äì Lazer Team has its share of groaners, to be sure ‚Äì it's a solid debut from Austin's gaming and comedy hometown heroes.\\" New York Times Neil Genzlinger criticized the film saying \\"Lazer Team ends by setting itself up for a sequel, but that's mighty wishful thinking\\" and \\"What they‚Äîor the men playing them‚Äîreally need to learn to do is act.\\" Matt Fagerholm of RogerEbert.com heavily criticized the film, writing \\"This movie is, in essence, a product of fame and money without the slightest tangible shred of effort.\\". Sequel On August 5, 2016, Burnie Burns and Gavin Free announced that a sequel to Lazer Team was green-lit by Rooster Teeth in partnership with YouTube Red and they had officially began pre- production on the film.https://www.facebook.com/roosterteeth/videos/1098977163495151/ In December 2016, Matt Hullum confirmed Rooster Teeth is aiming to shoot Lazer Team 2 in late Spring in Texas followed by release in 2017.

The story takes place mostly on the Welsh Coast. It features Sarah, Nan, Grey and Neville as well, who were characters first introduced in The Wizard of London. In the book, the seal folk are referred to by their old Scots name of Selch. They are also known as Selkie. Plot summary Mari Prothero lives a simple life on the Welsh coast with her fisherman father, Daffyd Prothero, who always comes home with a catch. For her whole life, it has just been the two of them. Well, them and the small fairy folk she can see around her house. Their world begins to be turned upside down when a constable comes to their quiet town of Clogwyn and starts to become a nuisance, prying into business that is not his, particularly when it comes to the Protheros. After encountering him and making him go away, Mari encounters a small water spirit, who tells her to bargain in the future. It makes sense when her father reveals to her that she must marry a Selch and then turn over her firstborn child to the Selch clan, to keep the Prothero luck going. At first, Mari is beside herself, but then remembers the small water fairy's words. The spirit appears again and informs her she has magic in her blood. Emboldened, she confronts the Selch chief and demands him to send her suitors and a teacher to school her in the art of Water Magic. The chief rails at her, but in the end brings four suitors, Trefor, Siarl, Rhodri and Mabon, and a teacher, Idwal. Her lessons begin in earnest, learning she is a Water Master and also spending time as a seal, and begins to fall for her teacher Idwal, even as the suitors begin to leave. In London, Sarah and Nan have returned from walking through the wildernesses of Africa. However, the two young ladies do not know what to do with themselves. They try teaching at Mem'sab's school, but find that they are not teachers. Despairing of what to do with themselves, their friend and benefactor Lord Alderscroft suggests the two of them to travel to Wales to seek a Water Master that is located somewhere in the country. The two immediately accept, and with Neville and Grey in tow, travel to Clogwyn. The two girls set themselves up in a comfortable cottage and come up with a ruse that the two of them are sisters. With the help of their old friend Puck, they discover the truth about Mari. Before they can do anything about it, they are set upon by the constable, who is then driven away by Puck in dog form and a sassy Neville. Upon encountering Mari, the three girls become fast friends, and as the suitors continue to leave, one of them, Rhodri, ends up falling for Nan. Mari and Idwal fall head over heels in love, and state their intent to get married. With Rhodri remaining and pretending that he is still courting Mari, all is well until the Selch chief, Gethin, blows into the cottage in a rage, accusing Mari and Idwal with treachery and for stealing his Druid. Mari rebuffs him, informing him that he did not specify that she could not fall in love with her teacher, which Idwal reiterates. Gethin is taken aback, then spitefully reminds her of the Prothero luck and the promise her ancestors made. He storms out of the cottage, leaving the group behind. Soon after, Mari and her newfound friends cook up a scheme by which she is wed forcibly to Idwal, and the two are married and soon Mari is happily pregnant. Nan and Sarah depart for a time and must obtain winter clothing and goods before returning to the cottage just in time for the birth of Mari's twin boys. As soon as the boys are born though, Gethin storms in and seizes the boys and enchants Idwal into returning to the sea with him. Mari rages and weeps, and things get worse after Nan and Sarah depart to seek help and when Constable Ewynnog returns and arrests her father on charges of murder of her husband and children. Upon being alerted by Puck, Nan and Sarah rush back to the cottage just in time to stop Mari from killing the Constable. With the help of Puck, a few ghosts, and the local Water and Earth Elementals, the three manage to free Daffyd. With Puck taking him, the three women make their way to the coast, where they meet Rhodri. Rhodri takes Mari to the group of Selch, and Mari challenges Gethin to allow her to get Idwal and her children back. She barters with her life, and faces three challenges. The first, the Test of Courage, has her holding onto Idwal while he changes forms, including a serpent, burning log, and ice. She succeeds, and then is given the Test of Wisdom. She goes toe to toe with Gethin and answers all of his riddles, even when Gethin begins to lose his cool. The final test, the Test of Love, is where she must pick Idwal and her babes from a crowd of Selch folk that all look the same. At first she despairs, but puts on her sealskin, and in an instant is able to find her babes and Idwal soon after. Gethin flies into a rage, and banishes Idwal and Mari from the clan, much to the disapproval of the others, and withdraws the Prothero luck. Idwal responds that they do not need it, and they return to the cottage. None too soon when the constable shows up, intent on arresting Daffyd, and bringing some fellow officers with him. But when they arrive and find the babes and Idwal, the constable is shuffled out of Clogwyn for good. The story ends with Idwal and Mari standing on the coast and gazing out to sea. 2012 American novels American fantasy novels Novels based on fairy tales Novels by Mercedes Lackey Novels set in Wales Fiction set in the 2010s ","title":"Home from the Sea (fantasy novel)"},{"id":"42987019","text":"Frank George Fahrion (17 April 189416 January 1970) was a four star Admiral in the United States Navy.

During an anniversary of Gus Dur's death in 2016, Iskandar described an editorial by the former on Tempo magazine about Muhaimin's father who buried an abangan Muslim, illustrating him as an example of humane behavior. Muhaimin added that the writing \\"made his father famous\\". The two are distantly related, with Iskandar often being described as Gus Dur's nephew.  Education  Iskandar completed his middle school equivalent in a state-funded madrasa in his hometown (Madrasah Tsanawiyah Negeri Jombang), graduating in 1982. He continued his education in Madrasah Aliyah Negeri 1 Yogyakarta (high-school equivalent) from which he graduated in 1985. During these two periods, he also taught in the pesantren where his dad was teacher. Enrolling at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta in 1985, he studied in the university's social science and political science faculty. His thesis was titled Perilaku Kapitalis Masyarakat Santri: Telaah Sosiologi tentang Etos Kerja Masyarakat Desa di Jawa Timur (Capitalistic Behavior of Santri: Sociological Study on East Java's Rural Population Work Ethic), and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1992. He resumed his education in the University of Indonesia, studying communications management starting in 1996. He graduated in 1998 with a master's degree. During and after his studies, he was part of several student organizations, namely Pergerakan Mahasiswa Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic Students' Movement) in which he served as president between 1994 and 1997. He also served in several other student positions including social sciences students' corps leader (1989), member of his faculty's student council (1990) in addition to being Yogyakarta branch president of PMII (1990‚Äì1991). He was also member of Komite Nasional Pemuda Indonesia (Indonesian Youths' National Committee) in which he served as vice president of the Yogyakarta branch. During his studies, he was introduced to figures such as Tjahjo Kumolo (then president of KNPI) and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.  Early career  Before entering politics, Iskandar worked in several organizations including between and during his university studies. After concluding his studies he moved to Jakarta and worked at the Institute for Islamic and Social Studies as a secretary, Lembaga Pendapat Umum (Public Opinion Institute, founded by Gus Dur) as the research division head, and became active in ForumDemokrasi which was a harsh critic of then-president Suharto. Later, him and Eros Djarot founded the Detik tabloid, in which he served as the chief for research and development until the publication was censured. He also briefly worked at Helen Keller International.  Political career  The New Order government, under Suharto, made the Nahdlatul Ulama part of the United Development Party and constrained the presence of Islam in politics while promoting its cultural presence. Hence, in 1984 the organization withdrew from practical politics. According to Iskandar, he was once interrogated alongside his entire class in Madrasah Tsanawiyah when they discussed Suharto's wealth. During the Asian financial crisis, Iskandar had served as the president of the PMII since 1994. The Nahdlatul Ulama appointed him as part of an assistance team to form the National Awakening Party. Iskandar's role was to prepare the party's articles of association. He was also appointed as secretary general for the party. After the fall of Suharto, the new party participated in the 1999 election and won 12.6% of the national votes, securing 51 seats in the People's Representative Council and becoming the third-largest group behind PDI-P and Golkar. = Deputy speaker of DPR = Several weeks after he was selected into the People's Representative Council, he became a deputy speaker of the house at the age of 33, one of the youngest in its history. His post covered the industry, trade and development sectors. During his first term, he also acted as the speaker of the PKB faction. PKB's coalition in the People's Consultative Assembly would then deliver Abdurrahman Wahid to become the 4th President of Indonesia in a vote The Economist described as \\"a shock\\", defeating Megawati Soekarnoputri 373 against 313. Later on, after being reelected for his second term in the 2004 election, he would continue serving in his post after he was re-elected along with other coalition politicians, with Agung Laksono as speaker. He stated in an interview that the body's competencies when it comes to legislative and budget matters were very weak, due to lack of expert staff. = Party disputes =  2005‚Äì2006: Leadership dispute  In a party congress held between 16 and 18 April 2005 in Semarang, Iskandar was elected as the new chairman of the National Awakening Party, replacing Alwi Shihab. He won 304 from the 382 votes through acclamation, with competitors such as Ali Masykur Musa, Saifullah Yusuf and Mohammad Mahfud. The latter stated that the vote was \\"legally broken\\", and that Iskandar's position was invalid. The case was brought to court, and the South Jakarta District Court ruled in favor of Iskandar's version of the party leadership on August. Some political observers noted that Abdurrahman Wahid, no longer president despite still being influential, visited president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and may have caused him to influence the court's decision. Regardless, the opposing ulama faction held a separate congress in Surabaya on early October that year. This congress elected Choirul Anam as chairman instead. The Supreme Court also determined that the removal of Alwi Shihab was invalid in November 2005, strengthening the ulama faction's claims to party leadership. Despite this, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights recognized Iskandar's faction as legitimate in March 2006, followed by the South Jakarta District Court in June. The ulama faction appealed to the Supreme Court following the latter decision. The Supreme Court ruled in accordance with the Ministry and the District Court, hence ending the schism in September 2006. The ulama faction proceeded to splinter off and form the Ulema National Awakening Party.  2008: Conflict with Gus Dur  By 2007, rumors surfaced that Iskandar was attempting to take over Gus Dur's position in the party by holding an extraordinary congress. He vehemently denied this, saying \\"Me, against Gus Dur? Who am I?!\\". Following an internal meeting in March 2008, he was voted out from his chairman position, but neither him nor Gus Dur were allowed to vote. Soon afterwards, Iskandar formed a faction and brought the case to court, suing Gus Dur. His former organization, PMII, declared its support for his faction. Iskandar also removed Gus Dur's daughter Yenny Wahid from her position as secretary general in April. The initial court sessions were not attended by party officials from either factions. In May, Iskandar's faction set up an office for the upcoming election, with the opposing faction reporting it to the police for misuse of party attributes. Representatives from both factions were present during the distribution of the ballot number by the KPU. The dispute settled down in July, when the Supreme Court decreed that the party leadership remained as it was in 2005. In the following year, the party gained 28 seats (compared to 53 in 2004) from the election. On December 25, he removed Gus Dur's sister Lily Wahid from the party, citing internal rule violations. Just several days later, Gus Dur died. Iskandar denied that he \\"betrayed\\" Gus Dur in a 2014 address, claiming that he had resigned from the party but Gus Dur returned his resignation letter. On the same year, he had been reported by Gus Dur's family for using the former president's image in campaign materials despite demands to not do so. = Minister of Labor and Transmigration = Under him, PKB supported Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's reelection in 2009. In the same year, he was elected for his third term in the house. He later was appointed as a minister in the Second United Indonesia Cabinet, as the minister of labor and transmigration. At the age of 43, he was the youngest minister in the cabinet. Due to this position, he resigned from his post in DPR, to be replaced with fellow PKB politician Imam Nahrawi. Iskandar's wealth was reported at Rp 1.6 billion (US$170,000) in April but he reported it as Rp 6.9 billion (US$733,000) by November, with him saying that he \\"hadn't been disciplined in reporting his wealth\\". In September 2010, his ministry prohibited Indonesian maids from leaving to Malaysia, Kuwait or Jordan following the abuse of an Indonesian maid in Penang. When a maid was executed in Saudi Arabia without the Indonesian government being notified in 2011, he also stopped the flow of Indonesian domestic workers there. He stated that Indonesia will ratify the International Labour Organization Convention 189 on Domestic Workers in March 2014. As of September 2018, Indonesia still have not ratified the convention. In 2014, he signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia on the protection of household workers. Following major demonstrations by workers across the country in October 2012, Iskandar created regulations regarding outsourcing, limiting it to 5 sectors i.e. mining, catering, transport, cleaning and security. It was made official as Labor and Transmigration Minister Regulation 19 of 2012. He was called as a witness in a trial for a corruption scandal involving his ministry in February 2012. He was also briefly investigated by the Corruption Eradication Commission the year prior regarding the same scandal. One of the involved parties accused Iskandar of demanding Rp 1.5 billion through his underlings. The court's verdict did not find him guilty, nor was he investigated as a suspect. = Joko Widodo presidency = In the 2014 legislative election, PKB gained 9.04% of the national votes and secured 47 seats in the parliament. On September that year, Iskandar secured his third term as the party's chairman. For the presidential election, PKB under Iskandar backed PDI-P candidate Joko Widodo (Jokowi) who won and became president. In Jokowi's Working Cabinet, the Ministry of Labor and Transmigration was renamed to the Ministry of Labor and Iskandar was replaced by Hanif Dhakiri. Iskandar was also elected to the People's Representative Council for the fourth time, winning 116,694 votes. He refused to resign from his legislative seat, and was not placed in Jokowi's cabinet. He criticized Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti's policies, saying that they cause trouble for the Indonesian fishermen. Another probe by the Corruption Eradication Commission on a bribe scandal within his ministry resulted in his involvement being investigated. On 26 March 2018, as part of a new regulation on the legislative bodies, he was appointed to one of three newly created deputy speaker positions in the MPR. = 2019 presidential election = As early as February 2016, members of his party had proposed for him to run as a running mate in the 2019 election. This was followed by several organizations and individuals, from santri to fishermen groups and PKB legislators. In Bekasi, multiple banners appeared promoting him for the candidacy. When another occurrence happened later, PKB's deputy secretary general Daniel Johan claimed that the banners were put up by a grassroots movement. While an observer from Padjadjaran University assessed Iskandar as \\"too confident\\", Iskandar himself stated on 6 March 2018 that he was \\"still certain that Pak Jokowi will ask [him to become his running mate]\\". Joko Widodo in March 2018 noted that he was still setting up the criteria for his running mate, and has not settled on one. Gerindra officials have also entertained the possibility of a Prabowo Subianto‚ÄìMuhaimin ticket. Survey results for vice presidential candidates gave varying results, with a result from LSI placing Iskandar as a top contender for the slot. Other surveys conducted on similar dates however put forth other contenders such as Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, if incumbent Jusuf Kalla is unaccounted for. On 15 March 2018, Iskandar announced that he had officially proposed to become Joko Widodo's running mate for 2019, citing his advantages as an attractor for Muslim voters. In accordance with this, he established an office for JOIN (Jokowi-Muhaimin) in April 2018. In August, Joko Widodo officially declared Indonesian Ulema Council leader Ma'ruf Amin as his vice presidential candidate. While he said he was \\"surprised\\", Iskandar declared his support for the ticket, and continued to use the \\"JOIN\\" (now Jokowi-Ma'ruf Amin) acronym. Iskandar himself ran in the legislative election, running for a fifth term still in East Java's 8th electoral district. He won 149,916 votes and secured a seat. He was later appointed as a deputy speaker at DPR.  Personal life He married Rustini Murtadho in 1995. According to Iskandar, he called in four major political figures (Megawati Soekarnoputri, Taufiq Kiemas, Abdurrahman Wahid and Eros Djarot) to convince his in-laws when he proposed. The couple has three children born in 1996, 2000 and 2003. In 2017, he received an honoris causa doctorate from Airlangga University. Some lecturers at the university protested against the awarding, citing a procedural failure.

Also produced and sung by Wilson, it appears as the eleventh track on their 1966 album Pet Sounds. He described it as \\"about a guy who was crying out because he thought he was too advanced, and that he'd eventually have to leave people behind.\\" Its chorus features Spanish-sung background vocals: \\"Oh, ¬øcu√°ndo ser√©? Un d√≠a ser√©\\" (\\"When will I be? One day I will be\\") The song is an early work of psychedelic rock.J. DeRogatis, Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), , p. 4. Its instrumentation includes harpsichord, muted bass guitar, and a theremin soundalike instrument called the Electro-Theremin. It is the first instance of an Electro-Theremin being used in popular music and the first in rock music to feature a theremin-like instrument. Background The song was written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher. While it is commonly understood that Wilson composed the majority of the music on Pet Sounds, it has been claimed in Steven Gaines' book Heroes and Villains that \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\" was one of three songs in which Asher contributed musical ideas rather than acting solely as a co-lyricist; the other two being \\"Caroline, No\\" and \\"That's Not Me\\".  Composition  On the song's meaning, Wilson stated \\"It's about a guy who was crying out because he thought he was too advanced, and that he'd eventually have to leave people behind. All my friends thought I was crazy to do Pet Sounds.\\" Asher says \\"In many of the other songs, when Brian would express a feeling, I would say, 'Oh, yes, I've had those feelings,' maybe not in the same way or the same degree, but I understood them. But this one I didn't relate to. It was more trying to interpret what he was feeling than having this joint feeling in our various ways.\\" In reviewer Donald A. Guercio's interpretation: \\"The lyrics are a first-person chronicle of disillusionment from a narrator who, despite being intelligent, can't find a place where he can comfortably feel like a part of the world.\\" Alternatively, author Charles Granata reads the song as a \\"plaintive ballad about coming to terms with one's differences\\". On the relationship between words and music, Guercio elaborates: Like other songs on Pet Sounds, there is no drum kit until the chorus. Its chorus features background vocals sung in Spanish: \\"Oh, ¬øcu√°ndo ser√©? Un d√≠a ser√©\\" (\\"When will I be? One day I will be\\") while Wilson leads with the lyric \\"sometimes I feel very sad\\". Each musical bar that follows within the chorus introduces a new contrapuntal melody, where Wilson further adds \\"ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into\\" and \\"people I know don't wanna be where I'm at\\". Bob Stanley of indie pop outfit Saint Etienne wrote: \\"Although he was only twenty-three, there was something incredibly old and incredibly melancholy within Brian Wilson. 'Sometimes I feel sad,' the song goes, and no amount of convoluted Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell wordplay is as effective or affecting.\\" Granata concludes: \\"The protagonist is desperate to define himself, but is depressed and struggling. Ultimately, the answer to the question‚Äî'Where do I fit in?'‚Äîlies in the realization that he doesn't.\\" Author Jim Fusilli remarked that portions of the song recall The Catcher in the Rye. In 2011, Brian reflected: \\"It was like saying: 'Either I'm too far ahead of my time' or 'I'm not up to my time.' ... [The feeling has] stayed the same ... a little bit, in some ways not ... [Now] I do feel I was made for these times.\\" Recording Desiring electronically produced sounds for the recording of Pet Sounds, Wilson contacted Paul Tanner to play as a session musician with the mistaken assumption that he was using a theremin for the song's recording. Tanner recalls the sessions being unusual for what he had been familiar to; Wilson forwent notation and instead sung Tanner's part for him to play. Wilson considered the theremin to make frightening, sexually evocative sounds that he associated with a woman's voice and 1940s mystery films. The instrumental track was recorded on February 14, 1966 at Gold Star Studios, and vocal sessions ran between March 10 through April 13 at CBS Columbia Square. Although sung by Brian Wilson, Dennis Wilson was originally intended to sing lead on \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\". Shortly after this track was recorded, Wilson used the Electro-Theremin on sessions for \\"Good Vibrations\\" which quickly proceeded.T. Pinch and F. Trocco, Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2004), , p. 87. Variations In 1996, Sub Pop released a stereo mix of The Beach Boys' \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\" as a single with a vocal only version of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and with the stereo backing to \\"Here Today\\" as the B-side. The track's instrumental along with session highlights were released the following year for The Pet Sounds Sessions. In popular culture The episode \\"Far Away Places\\" of the American television drama Mad Men features the song as an underscore during an LSD sequence. The song title was also used for musician Don Was' 1995 documentary about Brian Wilson, as well as its accompanying soundtrack album, which would be Wilson's second as a solo artist.

Equipped with it, a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter plane or an Arado 196 float plane would fly low at night over areas near enemy power plants or urban centers where power lines were located and would use it to cause local blackouts. This would, it was hoped, lead to civilian panic and the inability of local opposing forces to coordinate a defense. The piloting of planes so equipped was extremely dangerous, as it required the pilot to fly his plane almost directly at enemy power lines in the dark when visibility was already severely limited and within easy range of anti-aircraft fire. Operation The Seilbombe device was a box-like frame attached to the belly of plane with a roll of strong, detachable 70- to 80-foot long cables connected in series and attached to a set of pulleys, each cable having a small weight attached to one end. The fighter pilot would fly his craft low over sections of the electrical grid while trailing the cable beneath and behind it. When one cable wrapped around an electricity cable, it broke off, short-circuiting that cable. The Bordfunker (\\"radio operator\\") of the plane would then use a control box to reel out the next length of cable, and the Bf 110 would continue to the next section of the grid. Implementation Seilbomben saw little actual use by German forces. They were considered for the attack on Moscow, Operation Barbarossa, where assaulting the city's power plants appeared to some German commanders to be a more useful tool for subjugating the city than outright terror (the Russian populace was considered too obstinate for the latter to be effective).

The main members of the league were the Itza, the Tutul-Xiu, Mayapan, and Uxmal. Mayapan means flag of the Maya.  Before the League  =The Itza= The Itza were known as water witches.

A Cocom man named Ceel Cauich Ah was ritually thrown into the cenote of Chichen Itza (cenote being the a Spanish term for the Mayan word dzonot, which is a deep, karstik sinkhole filled with water). The Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza was specially considered an entrance to the afterlife and thus a site of pilgrimage. It is 15 meters deep from the ground to the water surface and its very steep walls made almost impossible to climb out if thrown into. But Ceel managed to survive and climbed out, which he used as a sign of his divine right to rule and proclaimed himself Ajaw, a spiritual and political leader. He also renamed himself Hunac Ceel Cauich. The Itz√°es did not fall for this ruse and negated to recognize his authority. Ceel gathered many followers from Mayapan and The Cocom region. In 1194, Hunac Ceel Cauich declared war on Chac-Xib-Chac one of the K'ul Kokom, the four rulers of Chich√©n Itz√°. The other three K'ul Kokom, and his brothers were Sac Xib Chac, Chac Ek Yuuan and Hun Yuuan Chac (also called uooh Puc). Ah Itzimthul Chac was also one of the Chac brothers, he ruled Ichcanzihoo also known as T'ho in present-day M√©rida. = Legend of the depopulation of Chichen Itz√° = Scientific data points to the fact that Chich√©n Itz√° declined before the rise of Mayapan as a regional power, but ongoing research is currently being done in several Maya sites, so there's not any chronological certainty yet. However, traditional sources (which are often mixed with fantasy and legend) say that Hunac Ceel Cauich had a daughter named Sac Nict√© (in Yucatec Maya Sac Nikt√©' meaning white flower). Sac Nict√© fell in love with a member of the royalty of Chichen Itz√° named Canek (Kaan Ek in Yucatec, meaning black snake). When they met Sac Nict√© was 15 and Canek was 21. This was the same day Canek was crowned ruler if the Itz√°. The Itz√° chose new ruler every Kat√∫n Ahau (period of almost 20 years).http://homepage.univie.ac.at/elisabeth.trinkl/forum/forum0910/forum56navarro.pdf Based on this Canek became ruler of the Itz√° on 22 November 1194. Sac Nict√© and Canek instantly fell in love. Sac Nict√© was destined, by prearranged marriage, to marry Ah Ulil, Batab of Izamal. Canek and Sac Nict√© slept together, later Canek stayed awake all night crying because he knew he could not marry Sac Nict√©. Ah Ulil and Sac Nict√©'s wedding was to take place 37 days after Canek's coronation (29 December 1194). Three days before, the wedding fianc√©s arrived in Uxmal. Gifts from all over Mayeb arrived, Gold, animal tusks, perfume, emeralds, and turtle shells filled with quetzal feather. These gifts came from distant and near cities - except nothing arrived from Chichen Itz√°. On the Day of the wedding, Uxmal was decorated with ribbons, feather, plants, and brightly painted bows, the people of the city were dancing and having parties in the street. Ajaws, Batabs, Halch Uiniks, Nobles, and other elites arrived with minstrels. Canek had been invited and he arrived, with him he brought the Itz√°es sixty best soldiers. Canek and his warriors ran to the altar where Sac Nict√© was being married. Incense was burning and a priest was chanting. Sac Nict√©, Canek, and the sixty warriors fled Uxmal, everything had happened so fast that nobody was able to try and stop them. Hunac Ceel, Ah Ulil, and other leaders traveled with a large army to Chichen Itz√° only to find the city completely abandoned. Sac Nict√© led the Itz√° to Nojpet√©n where they established a new Itza Kingdom.

The player controls skycaps working at an airport and tries to collect pieces of luggage that fall overhead from a frantic luggage carousel. A two-player mode, in which the second player controls the direction the luggage falls, is also available. Programmer Ed Salvo was inspired to make Lost Luggage when he was waiting for his luggage at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and the game took around four weeks to produce. Reviewers criticized the game's similarity to Activision's Kaboom! which itself is based on the arcade game Avalanchebelieving Lost Luggage to be an inferior clone. Gameplay A screenshot of Lost Luggage, showcasing the two skycaps collecting luggage. Lost Luggage is an action game in which the player controls skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends. There are two difficulty levels, and depending on the difficulty selected, players can control one skycap or two at once. There is also a two-player competitive mode where the second player controls the direction of the flying baggage. Another mode, featuring \\"terrorist suitcases\\", is available; enabling this mode will cause black suitcases to appear mixed with the regular baggage. These black suitcases will cause the game to instantly end if they touch the floor, regardless of the player's current number of collected suitcases. Development Lost Luggage was developed by Games by Apollo, a video game studio based in Richardson, Texas, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing that they would like its content. At the time of Lost Luggages development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and was waiting at the carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they came up with the idea to have the carousel \\"spewing unmentionables.\\" Afterwards, Salvo presented artist Ernie Runyon with a rough sketch of his ideas for the game. The crew of Apollo brainstormed titles for half an hour before deciding on Lost Luggage; Runyon later remembered one of the proposed titles was \\"Airport Mayhem\\". Runyon programmed the game with help from Salvo. He has stated he would have liked to include a luggage train, but there was not enough room in the 4-kilobyte cartridge. Salvo had difficulties with collision detection and synchronizing the character movements with the joystick, which took one week to fix. Due to a hardware issue, a graphical bug would also occur whenever a suitcase was captured, which was solved by compiling the game on another computer. The sound effects and music for Lost Luggage were created by Larry Minor. According to Runyon, the game was the first to integrate music on the 2600 as opposed to only sound effects. Salvo estimated that Lost Luggage took a total of four weeks to complete. A four- minute advertising jingle was made by Byron Parks for the game. Apollo founder Pat Roper was \\"fishing for ad material\\", and Parks belonged to a sound studio which Roper also owned. The jingle was never used, and in a 2013 interview Runyon recalled that he did not \\"know or remember where it was intended for use.\\" Following the release of Lost Luggage, Runyon departed Games by Apollo, making it the only game he worked on at the studio. Salvo eventually left as well. The studio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 12, 1982, due to pressure from its advertising agency Benton & Bowles, to which Apollo owed $2.5 million (out of a $5 million total debt). Although Roper expected the company to return in a \\"smaller form\\", Apollo closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed. Release and reception Games by Apollo released Lost Luggage in September 1982. Two versions were released, differentiated by the color of the label. Cartridges with blue labels feature an opening sequence in which the character takes out the three starting suitcases. In the green-labeled version, the game may be restarted by pressing the fire button, which does nothing in the blue-labeled version. Neither Salvo nor Runyon were aware of the existence of this version. Runyon speculated that Salvo may have found more space after tweaking the game and added the features, while Salvo did not \\"remember doing any of this and I can't conceive of anyone at Apollo messing with the game after it went to production.\\" Lost Luggage received mixed reviews upon release. Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz wrote in a 1982 issue of the magazine Electronic Games that Lost Luggage did not have \\"the spark of greatness\\". While they praised the game for shifting away from \\"the typical SF shoot-out\\" and said that it was \\"solid\\" and \\"playable\\", they remarked on its plain-looking graphics and said that \\"even the greatest concept cannot make a great game when it isn't blended with an outstanding type of play action.\\" Writing for Video, Kunkel and Katz commented on the game's \\"incredibly cute touches\\", but suggested that Apollo may have better \\"scrimp[ed] on the frills\\" in favor of additional gameplay challenges. Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games wrote that \\"graphics are fun to watch, but the game play for experienced players gets old fast\\". A reviewer for the magazine TV Gamer recommended the game for children, but felt that seasoned video game players would enjoy Kaboom! more. More positive opinions were from Videogaming Illustrated, which described the game as the most charming of Apollo's releases, and Texas Monthly, which described it as a \\"fiendish little amusement.\\" Modern reviews have been largely critical ‚Äì Brett Alan Weiss, writing for AllGame, considered the game to be a \\"slower, less intense, less enjoyable\\" version of Kaboom!. He criticized the lack of support for the paddle controller, and stated that not even the two-player and terrorist modes made the game enjoyable. In his book Classic Home Video Games, Weiss wrote that Lost Luggage was a \\"fleeting pleasure\\", opining that \\"the airplanes flying overhead look nice, but the rest of the game is ordinary in appearance\\" and that the difficulty curve and action were poor. Writing for Atari HQ, Keita Iida commented that \\"there are good Kaboom! clones (Eggomania) and then there are bad ones (this one).\\" Iida believed that if the game was not as similar to Kaboom! then it would be \\"mildly amusing\\", but that the better alternatives hampered it.

It is known from a single type species, Occidens portlocki, named in 2004 on the basis of a left lower jaw that British geologist Joseph Ellison Portlock described in 1843. Portlock attributed it to the lobe-finned fish Holoptychius and it was housed in the collections of the British Geological Survey for over a century before being reevaluated in 2004 by vertebrate paleontologists Jenny Clack and Per E. Ahlberg, who reclassified it as a new genus and species of early tetrapod. The genus name Occidens refers to its presence west of better-known early tetrapod assemblages in Great Britain, and the species name honors Portlock. The jaw likely comes from the Altagoan Formation and, based on an analysis of fossilized pollen, dates to the late Tournaisian stage of the Early Carboniferous about 350 million years ago. The occurrence of Occidens in the Tournaisian makes it a critically important taxon because it lies within Romer's gap, a time interval spanning most of the Early Carboniferous in which almost no tetrapod fossils are known. Romer's gap separates the first appearance of tetrapods in the Late Devonian from the group's first evolutionary radiation toward the end of the Early Carboniferous. However, the relationship of Occidens to other early tetrapods both before and after the gap remain uncertain, which means that its context in tetrapod evolution remains unknown. Clack and Ahlberg noted several distinctive features of Occidens, including a straight row of teeth along the coronoid bones on the inner surface of the lower jaw, an open groove for a lateral line sense organ on the jaw's outer surface, and a stepped shape to the connection between the dentary and angular bones. The jaw bone is deep, resembling those of Crassigyrinus and whatcheeriids (which both occur in Romer's gap) in overall appearance. In most phylogenetic trees produced by Clack and Ahlberg's 2004 analysis, Occidens fell near whatcheeriids and the Devonian taxon Tulerpeton, being more derived than all other Devonian taxa and more basal than Crassigyrinus and the post-Romer's Gap taxa Greererpeton and Megalocephalus. A 2008 phylogenetic analysis by paleontologists Marcello Ruta and John Bolt found Occidens to be the closest relative of Sigournea multidentata, a species from the end of the gap found in Iowa, but could not determine where these two taxa fit relative to other Early Carboniferous tetrapods.

Il Tempo also won the Chalmers Handicap over two miles, plus being placed over the two-mile distance several times. He was trained by Mr Bruce Priscott, a butcher by trade. Normally he was ridden by jockey Noel D Riordan. He had a fantastic fresh up record. Il Tempo also won a weight for age over one and a half miles.

In his preparation for the cup, he broke down after running a 1 min. 39.0 sec. mile in a training gallop. He never raced again. World record The Wellington Cup was over 2 miles and he won it in a world-record time of 3:16.2. To do this he beat a top class field including Highland Rebel, who finished second and also broke the previous world record, and champion race mare Honour Me, who finished third. This world record still stands as an imperial world record today. To put this into perspective, the record holder of the two-mile Melbourne Cup is Rain Lover, with a time of 3.19.1, set in 1968. The Melbourne Cup distance was changed to 3200 meters (about 20 metres shorter) in 1972, and the record is held by Kingston Rule at 3.16.3.

Image taken before procedure A hair tattoo, scalp micro pigmentation (or SMP for short), is a medical, non- surgical, cosmetic tattoo that gives the illusion of a close buzz cut hairstyle on a bald head or adds density to a thinning hair line The procedure can also be used to conceal scars from hair transplantation, hide the visual impact of burns or scars on head. Scalp micro pigmentation can be performed on all skin types and colours. This procedure involves local anesthesia to avoid any pain during procedure. In contrast to other tattoos, the procedure penetrates the epidermal level of the skin and pigment is deposited in upper dermal level and the inks (or pigments) used are less prone to color change over time. The advantages of this procedure is that the hairline can be adjusted and freshened up with relative ease. Hair Tattoo (MIcro Scalp Pigmentation) result after procedure. The cost of scalp micropigmentation depends on a variety of factors, such as where you live, the type of clinic you choose, the treatment area required and how many treatments you need. The procedure takes about two or three sessions, which usually last about three hours each. Clients can choose from hundreds of shades of ink to match their original hair color and skin tone. Whilst scalp micro pigmentation is a permanent treatment, it can be removed with a correctional procedure or laser treatment. Since the procedure is relatively new, there is not much, if any scientific data on whether people have suffered side effects. Due to the two main health concerns with hair tattoos being the cleanliness of needles and the possibility of an allergic reaction to the ink used, many practitioners of the procedure perform a small patch test on an inconspicuous part of your scalp before performing the full treatment. Finding a natural looking hairline is the most crucial aspect of scalp micro pigmentation. If this procedure is not done properly, it can, in some cases, totally prevent the illusion of hair and leave the client with an un-natural finish.

It was dedicated in 1869 on George Washington's birthday. The property fronted on Church street, and extended from Pine to Main streets. History Construction commenced on September 1, 1868. The structure was fully completed by the contractors and ready for use and occupation in May 1869. The entire cost of the building, which was erected by contract, together with its appurtenances, fencing, etc., amounted to the sum of US$15,000. There were accommodations for the five hundred and twenty pupils and their teachers. The necessary funds for the purchase of the ground and erection of the building were raised by a special tax of one per cent, levied for the year 1868, and 90 cents for the ensuing year. John Isaiah Caldwell and A. B. Gregory, who constituted the Board, are credited with originating the enterprise and carrying it out to a speedy completion. The contractors for the work were Mcllvaine and Palmer, of Nevada City, who executed the same in accordance with the plans and specifications of the architect, William Craine, of San Francisco. The Nevada City Elementary School was constructed on the old Washington School lot and opened in the fall of 1937. The lot is now occupied by Trinity Episcopal Church. Architecture and fittings The building, set upon a solid granite foundation, formed a square, . It contained two stories, the first of which, in height, contained four class rooms, , and four wardrobe rooms, each, with a hall in width, from which two stairways communicated with the second story, which contained two class rooms, , and two wardrobe rooms, each, and also an assembly hall, , for school examinations and exhibitions. The front and rear doorways were placed in projections in the centre of the building, each , affording ingress and egress. The entire interior was lighted and ventilated. There were a series of metallic ventilating registers, placed near the floor, which brought in fresh air. There were ventilators near the ceiling, and louvre windows at the base of the cupola. A bell, weighing 350 pounds, was cast in San Francisco. Grounds The lot, which cost US$3,000, measured two acres.

It began in 1974 when SEMTA assumed control of the Grand Trunk's existing commuter trains over the route. SEMTA discontinued operations in 1983. Amtrak began offering intercity service between Detroit and Pontiac in 1994 as part of its Michigan Services.  History  = Grand Trunk = Passenger rail service between Detroit and Pontiac dated back to 1843 with the completion of the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad, the second railroad (after the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad) to operate trains in the state of Michigan. The Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway, began offering commuter service on August 1, 1931. In 1968 the Grand Trunk operated six daily commuter trains (three round-trips) between the two cities. Average daily ridership was 2,812. By 1971 the Grand Trunk estimated yearly losses at $241,626, leading it to contemplate increasing fares or canceling the trains altogether. Both options would require the approval of the Michigan Public Service Commission. The coming of Amtrak and end of most private-sector intercity passenger service was then three weeks away but commuter trains were considered separate entities and remained in private operation after May 1, 1971. = SEMTA = The Michigan Legislature passed the Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act of 1967, which included the creation of SouthEastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA). SEMTA was charged to take over the ownership and operations of the fractured regional transit systems in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, and Monroe counties, including the city of Detroit. On January 2, 1974, SEMTA began subsidizing one-third of the losses of the commuter trains This subsidy increased to two- thirds in 1977, with SEMTA formally acquiring the rolling stock and taking full responsibility for losses in 1978. In 1975 service consisted of three rush hour trips between Pontiac and Detroit, supplemented by a single evening rush hour trip from Detroit to Birmingham, Michigan. The Birmingham train ended in spring 1976. Average train capacity in 1979 stood at 250 passengers. SEMTA operated a pair of special trains in 1982 for Super Bowl XVI, running from the newly completed Renaissance Center to Pontiac, near the Pontiac Silverdome. One carried the CBS production crew; the other was chartered by a \\"private tour group\\". In 1981 daily ridership stood at 3,000. SEMTA's April 1983 timetable featured a stylized NYC Hudson locomotive on its cover and it continued to operate three weekday rush-hour round-trips, but all was not well. By the fall of 1983 SEMTA faced a $16 million budget shortfall and aging equipment. SEMTA estimated the cost of operating the commuter train at $1 million per year. Unable to secure funding for the train from local communities, SEMTA decided to discontinue the trains amid other cutbacks. The last train ran on October 17, 1983. SEMTA leased 22 passenger cars to the Metro-North Railroad for $320,000 per year. The five EMD GP9 diesel locomotives were stored and later sold to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. A year after discontinuance SEMTA estimated start-up costs at $1‚Äì2 million. = Expansion politics = Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s SEMTA attempted to expand its commuter rail network as part of an integrated regional transit plan. These efforts failed because of funding problems and political disagreement. In 1974 the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) and SEMTA rolled out a transit plan for rapid transit, bus rapid transit, people movers, and improved commuter rail. It included improvements for existing services on the Grand Trunk route to Pontiac and the Penn Central route to Ann Arbor, but not the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) route via Plymouth. The plan would cost $6.2 billion. SEMTA unveiled a smaller plan in 1977 for $1.2 billion in transit projects, to be partially funded by the federal government. This plan included two rapid transit lines, three bus rapid transit lines, the Detroit People Mover, and upgrades to existing bus routes. For commuter rail SEMTA allocated $42 million, both for the existing Pontiac route and to create service from Detroit to Ann Arbor and Port Huron, but not Plymouth. The system would total . In 1979 the Michigan Department of Transportation commissioned a $350,000 feasibility study for the revival of passenger service over the C&O; between Detroit and Lansing, the state capital. In 1947 the C&O;'s famed Pere Marquettes covered the distance in an hour and a half. The study included commuter rail service Plymouth, a distance of . SEMTA, as in 1974, was non-committal, believing the C&O; route \\"too congested\\" with freight traffic and preferring to establish service through Wayne County to Ann Arbor over the former Penn Central route, which was now owned by Conrail. It was anticipated at that time that SEMTA would assume operation of the existing Ann Arbor commuter service, then operated by Amtrak, by 1984. In 1981 SEMTA formally proposed a Detroit‚ÄìAnn Arbor commuter service, operating over the Conrail route. This route already saw three Amtrak intercity trains per day, plus the Amtrak-operated Detroit‚ÄìAnn Arbor Michigan Executive commuter train, like SEMTA a holdover from private operation. SEMTA proposed Conrail would operate the service under contract, with a minimum of eight round-trips per day. The Detroit terminus would be a new station near Joe Louis Arena. = Amtrak revival = The Pontiac Transportation Center in 2002. It has since been demolished. Passenger rail service resumed over the Grand Trunk on May 5, 1994, when Amtrak extended the Chicago‚ÄìDetroit trains Twilight Limited and Wolverine to Pontiac. With this change service began at a new station in Detroit's New Center, near the old commuter stop at Milwaukee Junction. In Pontiac Amtrak used the Pontiac Transportation Center, originally constructed for the SEMTA commuter service but which had opened just six months prior to discontinuance.  Route  SEMTA operated a single line from Detroit to Pontiac, running parallel to Woodward Avenue. In Detroit trains used a small station at St. Antoine and Franklin near site of Brush Street Station, which was demolished in 1973 to make way for the Renaissance Center (later SEMTA timetables simply indicated \\"Renaissance Center\\" as the Detroit terminus). Outbound stops included Milwaukee Junction, the Chrysler Center in Highland Park, Ferndale at 9 Mile Road, Royal Oak (at 11 Mile Road and at 12 Mile Road), Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills (at Charing Cross Road and at Long Lake Road), and finally Pontiac.

Career Caldwell was a native of Champaign County, Ohio. He received his legal education in his native State, being a student under Judge John A. Corwin, who was elected Chief Justice of Ohio in 1851, and was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court at Columbus, Ohio. From there he went to Lexington, Missouri, where he was likewise admitted to practice before the Supreme Court sitting in banc. In 1850, Caldwell set out for California across the plains, arriving in Sacramento on August 12 of that year. The train of which he was a member, when it set out from Lexington, Missouri, consisted of twenty-three wagons. At Independence Rock, Caldwell left the train and packed alone over the mountains and into California, beating the company by sixty days and thus escaping the cholera, which at that time was raging fiercely along the emigrant road. For a time, he mined on the American River, near Folsom, CaliforniaFolsom, but in October he set out for Nevada County, arriving first at Rough and Ready, then the most lively camp in the State. Here he remained during the ensuing winter, going in the early spring with a company of fifteen others to the North Yuba River, where they located a mining claim, calling it the Missouri Bar. On July 3, 1851, having completed their dam, they proceeded to prospect the claim, and found it would pay well. Caldwell continued there until late in November of that year. and then sold out and went back to Missouri by way of Panama. In the spring of 1854, he returned once more to California, coming via New Orleans and the Nicaragua route. He went at once to Nevada City, arriving there June 23, 1854, and at once \\"hung out his shingle\\" and began the successful practice of his profession, which he has continued since. In December, 1854, Caldwell was admitted as an attorney at law in the Supreme Court of California in Sacramento, and thus is one of the older practitioners of the State, and he has been counsel also in some of the most prominent cases in Nevada County. In 1869, he was elected District Attorney, taking the office in 1870 and holding it two years. It may also be stated that he has been interested in a great many mining operations, both quartz and placer, during his residence. Caldwell was an active promoter of education, encouraging by all means in his power the public schools of Nevada City, not only by his presence, but in aiding out of his private means and in other ways the erection of suitable buildings. The building now known as the Washington School House was planned and constructed while he was a Trustee, being chiefly engineered by him and his co-Trustees. They bought the lot, laid the foundation, and when the school funds were exhausted he, in company with his brother Trustees, A. B. Gregory and E. G. Waite (the place of the latter being later filled by E. F. Spence), shouldered the expense of erecting the building, this being afterward refunded by the people of Nevada City. Caldwell continued to be a Trustee for eight years, paying during that time out of his own pocket hundreds of dollars for poor people. Caldwell encouraged farming and fruit-raising wherever practicable in the county. He was an unmarried man.

After her NOAA career, the ship became MV Townsend Cromwell, first as the property of the government of American Samoa from 2002 to 2003 and then as a private yacht in New Zealand from 2003 to 2009. Since 2009, she has operated in Fiji as the passenger-cargo ship MV Lau Trader.  Construction and commissioning  Townsend Cromwell was built for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by the J. Ray McDermott Company in Morgan City, Louisiana. She was launched in July 1963, delivered in November 1963, and commissioned into service in the Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries on 25 January 1964 as BCF Townsend Cromwell. In 1975 she was transferred to NOAA and in June 1975 was commissioned into NOAAs fleet as NOAAS Townsend Cromwell (R 443).Ships of the NOAA Fleet, Rockville, Maryland: United States Department of Commerce, June 1989  Characteristics and capabilities  Townsend Cromwell had a 40-foot (12.2-meter) telescoping boom with a lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds (907 kg), a 25-foot (7.6-meter) articulated boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (305 kg), a plankton boom, and a movable A-frame.

She was commissioned into service with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services Bureau of Commercial Fisheries at Honolulu on 25 January 1964 to support the Fish and Wildlife Services Honolulu Laboratory. Her first 20 cruises involved an oceanographic experiment to characterize the influence of northeast trade winds north of the equator, which contributed to the development of a general circulation model for the waters of the North Pacific Ocean.Altonn, Helen, \\"Ship winds up last research voyage,\\" Honolulu Star- Bulletin, October 7, 2002. In 1975, Townsend Cromwell came under the control of NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. Under NOAA control, she conducted fishery and living marine resource research in support of the National Marine Fisheries Service Honolulu Laboratory in Honolulu, using bottom trawls, longlines, and fish traps to collect fish and crustacean specimens. She carried out fisheries assessment surveys, physical and chemical oceanography, marine mammal plans, and coral reef research, operating around the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in the waters of the central and western Pacific Ocean.NOAA Ship Townsend CromwellAnonymous, \\"N.O.A.A.

With the passage of the Magnuson‚ÄìStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act by the United States Congress in 1976 and the U.S. Government's establishment of a 200-nautical-mile fishery conservation zone, Townsend Cromwell began to support U.S. Government- and State of Hawaii-sponsored investigations of marine and land resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. After completing that work in 1982, she returned to assessments of commercial fishery resources such as spiny lobster, groundfish, and precious corals, and she conducted assessments of the deep shrimp and groundfish fisheries around Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. She also supported field camps on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to count Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles under a U.S. Government mandate for preservation of those species, and she took part in oceanographic cruises using satellites to improve the understanding of wind-generated eddies and large frontal systems in Pacific Ocean fisheries areas. In her later years, she participated in resource assessments for the Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. For several years prior to her decommissioning, she took part in multi-agency U.S. Government efforts to remove hundreds of tons of discarded fishing gear and other marine debris from coral reef ecosystems. Townsend Cromwells final cruise, a 30-day research expedition for the Northwestern Hawaiian Island Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program, ended at Honolulu on 7 October 2002. After making an estimated 281 research cruises over nearly 39 years of service, she was decommissioned on 10 October 2002. She was replaced by NOAAS Oscar Elton Sette (R 335). =Later career= After NOAA decommissioned Townsend Cromwell, the U.S. Government transferred her to the Government of American Samoa in accordance with Public Law 106-555, Section 204. As MV Townsend Cromwell, she arrived at Pago Pago, American Samoa, in November 2002. The government of American Samoa hoped to use her to carry passengers and light cargo between Manu'a and Tutuila, but she was not certified to perform such services.

Rioting in the republican area of the New Lodge escalated and reinforcements were called for. 156 Battery was ordered into the area. Because mobs of rioters were threatening the bordering unionist Tiger's Bay area the Battery was deployed along the interface to block them. A large crowd gathered at the junction of New Lodge Road and Lepper Street. A troop of soldiers from 156 Battery, including Gunner Rob Curtis, were deployed to disperse the crowd. As the troop moved to the junction they were attacked with a barrage of stones and bottles by the mob and deployed in ‚Äúriot-formation‚Äù with shields as protection. Subsequently, a nail bomb was thrown at the troop and in the aftermath of the blast the crowd split allowing a gunman to fire a long burst of automatic fire from a Sterling submachine gun, probably from the base of Templar House. The crowd then reformed, allowing the gunman to escape. Gunner Curtis was hit by a ricochet which passed through the shoulder opening of his flak jacket, penetrating his heart. He died almost instantly. Four other troop members were wounded, one seriously. Status Curtis was, at the time of his death, 20 years old and married for just over a year. His wife was expecting their first child and had just informed him in a letter that he was to become a father. He is laid to rest in West Road Cemetery, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.

Biography Of German descent, Reitsenshtein was born in St Petersburg as the son of Karl Ivanovich Reitsenstein, a privy councilor to the Tsar. In September 1870, he entered the Sea Cadets and entered active duty as a midshipman in March 1873 and was promoted to ensign in September 1875. He graduated from the Naval Staff College in 1877 as a specialist in mine warfare and was promoted to lieutenant in 1880. He was given his first command in 1882, the torpedo boat Chaika. Reitsenshtein subsequently served as mine officer on the frigate Knjas Poscharsky. He commanded the destroyer Raketa in 1883, and was mine officer on the cruiser in 1885. From 1886 to 1889, he served on the staff of Vice Admiral Schmidt in the Russian Pacific Fleet, and returned to the Baltic in 1889 to command the torpedo boat Narva. Reitsenstein was promoted to captain, 2nd rank, in 1891, and chief mine officer on the staff of the Baltic Fleet from 1895 to 1898. In 1899, he was sent to Germany to oversee the completion of the cruiser and was promoted to captain, 1st rank the same year. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Reitsenshtein was appointed commander of the small squadron based at Vladivostok. However, on 15 March 1904, Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov reassigned him to command the cruiser squadron based at Port Arthur and promoted him to rear admiral. At the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Reitsenstein made Askold his flagship. During the battle, he noticed that the battleship had been badly hit and was out of control, and was unable to signal the battleline as her signal masts had been destroyed. Reitsenshtein attempted to assume control, but his signals were either missed or ignored by the more senior commanders, and ultimately he was forced to break out of the Japanese entrapment with only the cruiser and escaped to Shanghai, where the ship and crew were interned until the end of the war. After the end of the war, Reitsenshtein was director of naval artillery training for the Baltic Fleet and was promoted to vice admiral in 1909. From 1910 to 1912 he headed a special committee to oversee the Amur Military Flotilla, and from 1912 to 1916 headed a special committee to oversee improvements to Russian coastal defenses. He was promoted to admiral on 14 April 1913 and appointed to the Admiralty Board at the end on 1915. He retired from active service on 21 June 1916 and died on 27 November in Petrograd. His grave was at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

It originally aired on January 27, 2011. The episode was written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot The episode starts with Jules (Michaela McManus) waking up in the woods next to a camp after the full moon night when she attacked Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and bit Rose (Lauren Cohan). She is surrounded by dead campers who she attacked the previous night and she starts trying to cover her tracks when an officer arrives and asks if she is fine. Jules pretends she is crying and that her friends were attacked by a wolf but when the officer goes to call some help, Jules kills him before he does it. Stefan (Paul Wesley) tells Elena (Nina Dobrev) that he wants to find Isobel so he can ask her about Elijah and he plans to ask Katherine where he can find her. Elena does not agree with his plan and reminds him that she made a deal with Elijah so no one get hurt. Stefan reminds her that she was the one who made the deal and not him and leaves to find Alaric (Matt Davis) at the Grill where Stefan asks his help to find Isobel. Alaric gives him a former phone number of Isobel's and Stefan starts searching for her. Rose is at the Salvatore house and she is getting worse after the werewolf bite. Damon tries to convince her that everything will be fine and he will find a way to cure her but he knows that this will be difficult. He leaves Elena to take care of her while he goes to the Grill to meet Jules and ask her to tell him how to help Rose. Jules though tells him that the only way to end Rose's suffering is by killing her. Back at home, Rose starts having hallucinations and she thinks Elena is Katherine and attacks her. The first time the hallucination stops and Rose realizes that it's Elena so she stops before hurting her. The second time Elena has to run and hide from her to save herself. Between the two attacks, Rose tells Elena how much she misses being human and the place she was grown up. After the second attack, Rose leaves the house and goes to the local high school where she attacks a man and kills him and later two teenagers. Damon arrives and helps her get back home. Meanwhile, Tyler (Michael Trevino) thanks Caroline (Candice Accola) for helping him through his first transformation. Caroline confess to him that a werewolf bite is fatal for a vampire and that makes him asking why would she stay if she knew that but before Caroline answers Matt (Zach Roerig) interrupts them. Tyler leaves them alone and Matt tries to tell Caroline he wants them to get back together and kisses her. Caroline does not want them to be together because she does not want to hurt Matt, but instead of telling him why she says that they cannot and she leaves. Caroline gets back home where she finds Tyler waiting for her and insists on his question of why she would stay with him and risk her life. Caroline says that she only cares and she did not want him to be alone but he still cannot understand her. Tyler kisses her as well but Caroline leaves him alone, as she did with Matt, and gets into the house. Back at the Salvatore house, Damon is alone with Rose. Rose is really bad and Damon gets into her mind to control her dreams and make her feel better. Rose dreams that she is at her hometown and Damon is there with her. She is not afraid or suffer anymore and she is ready to meet her family again and Trevor. Off the dream, Damon takes a stake and stabs Rose in the heart killing her, crying while he does it. Elena tries to comfort Damon who insists he does not care about Rose's death but he finally admits that he does not like to feel because it hurts. He asks her to go home and leave him alone, Elena hugs him and leaves. Damon is lost after everything that happened that he decides to go out and attack an innocent girl named Jessica (Ahna O'Reilly) after admitting to her that he misses being human. Jessica tries to get away but Damon catches her and feeds on her. Jules meets Tyler and tells him that Mason (Taylor Kinney) is dead and that Caroline and her vampire friends killed him. She also tells him that Caroline lied to him about being the only vampire in town but Tyler does not want to believe her. Meanwhile, Elena gets back home where she finds Stefan waiting for her. He tells her that he called Isobel and did not find her but he found instead someone else to help them; uncle John (David Anders).

Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode with 9.5/10 saying that it was one of his favorite episodes of the series yet. Goldman praised Lauren Cohan's acting and also commented on the human side of Damon we've seen on this episode. \\"Kudos to Lauren Cohan, who was in many ways the star of the show this week and gave one hell of a performance, showing the varied and extreme emotional states Rose found herself in. [...] If they were going to show Damon Salvatore actually cry, this was certainly the episode to do it.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5/5. \\"Overall, one might criticize the episode for focusing too much on Rose, a character we haven't known for very long. But I see it differently. The extended death scene and the pain she was in as a result of the werewolf bite was necessary in order to depict the stakes that are on the horizon during the impending werewolf/vampire war.\\" E. Reagan of The TV Chick gave the episode an A rating saying that it was an awesome episode and a fine start to the second half of the season while Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating saying: \\"Overall, this was a strong episode, emotionally driven by Ian Somerhalder‚Äôs heartbreaking performance. Despite my previous insistence that brooding wasn‚Äôt allowed here on The Vampire Diaries, I think brooding is coming. And I kind of think the brooding might be fantastic.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that it was not a bad episode, but it was a frustrating one because it was easy to see where a few tweaks here and there could have made for an excellent episode. About the story focusing on Rose's death, Franson Pruter commented: \\"The episode should have focused on the impact of Rose‚Äôs death on Damon, the only character who has any sort of relationship with Rose and would be affected by her death. Yes, the episode covers that, but it doesn‚Äôt focus on it. These kinds of focus issues require truly advanced writing skills, and I can‚Äôt fault the writers too much for not getting the fine-tuning right.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 4/4 saying that despite the focusing on Rose's death, this was not her episode, but it was Damon's. \\"Ian Somerhalder has been consistently great in this show, but rarely has Damon had the opportunity to have an honest and simple emotion as he did with his psychoanalyst-cum-victim. He did such a wonderful job. I cried. And then I cried some more.\\" References External links 2011 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Descent (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42988138","text":"Acacia adoxa, commonly known as the grey-whorled wattle, is a species of plant in the legume family that is native to northern Australia.

Shrimp breeders have given colourful names to the many other variants of the bee shrimp, which include the Princess Bee, Blue Bolt, Tangerine Tiger and Shadow Panda. Reproduction  Expected CRS Hatching Date Female Caridina cantonensis can be distinguished from males by size; the female is larger than the male, and has a deeper abdomen. The female shrimp signal readiness to mate by releasing pheromones into the water which lead the males to the female. During this time swimming activity can be quite vigorous as males search for the females. The eggs are carried underneath the female's abdomen and uses the pleopods to maintain a continuous circulation of water. The eggs hatch to reveal tiny versions of the adult shrimp. The duration the female carries the eggs before they hatch is linked to water temperature. At the expected hatching time is 28 days. At the shrimp develop the strongest colours. Extended high water temperatures result in higher juvenile and adult mortality, and less egg survivability. Warmer water will bring invertebrates to sexual maturity earlier but with a smaller body size than cold water. A cold water environment will slow down invertebrate sexual maturity; consequently the shrimp have longer to grow, have a larger body size at sexual maturity than if they had been brought up in warmer water.

Inspired by the biography of Shivkar Bapuji Talpade, the film stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Mithun Chakraborty and Pallavi Sharda. Set in Bombay, 1895, it follows the purported story of Talpade who is credited with having constructed India's first unmanned plane. The film released on 30 January 2015. The film was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh. Plot During the era of the British Raj, a happy-go-lucky school drop-out named Shivkar Bapuji Talpade (Ayushmann Khurrana), a.k.a. Shivi, falls in love with a local stage dancer named Sitara (Pallavi Sharda). This makes Shivi's father throw him out of the house. Shivi bumps into a crazy scientist, Pandit Subbaraya Shastri (Mithun Chakraborty). Shastri is constantly being chased by British soldiers for his weird experiments, but unbeknownst to them, Shastri is secretly building a flying machine. Seeing Shivi's great knowledge of the Vedas, Shastri shares with Shivi a secret book of ancient Indian aeronautics, which he is using to build an aeroplane. Shastri offers to let Shivi be his assistant, but Shivi refuses. Shivi later proposes to Sitara, but Sitara resists on the grounds that society will not accept their marriage. She goes away to Hyderabad. Heartbroken, Shivi goes back to Shastri and accepts his offer to assist him. Together they work for several months on the flying machine, but they fail again and again. On running out of funds, they ask a local king to sponsor their experiments. Finally, they manage to build a small aeroplane and have a successful unmanned test flight in the presence of eyewitnesses ‚Äî but it crashes within a few seconds. Shivi later learns that Sitara is back in Bombay, living in poverty and debt. In order to get Sitara out of debt, Shivi sells Shastri's secret book to a British officer. Feeling betrayed, Shastri does not survive this trauma and dies. Shastri's death makes Shivi feel so guilty that he (along with Sitara and Shivi's nephew Narayan) decides to fulfill Shastri's dream. In his quest to build a perfect flying machine, Shivi goes to Banaras to meet a guru, to whom Shastri used to refer. The guru gives Shivi a code, \\"4121\\", which helps Shivi figure out that mercury will be the best fuel for his engine, since in Hindi the word for \\"mercury\\" (‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ) looks like the number 4121. Before Shivi can complete his machine, British officers arrest him on a complaint made by his brother. After being rescued by a freedom fighter, Shivi finally takes the aircraft to the beach. Before the soldiers can arrest him, Shivi flies away with Sitara, thus becoming the first people to ride in a flying machine.

Hence, the makers re-created an entire city from scratch in Gondal, Gujarat. In a bid to depict that era, the team also had to recreate several antiques. Director Vibhu Puri stated in an interview, \\"Many artefacts that we read about aren‚Äôt available in this day and age. So, we used our imagination and recreated them. We even designed the plane based on how it was described in the books.\\" The makers of Hawaizaada recreated a plane from scratch as Puri wanted to depict Shivkar Talpade's first plane in all authenticity. For this, the team of Hawaizaada did extensive research on the products used in ancient times for making the plane that is shown in the film. The team used velvet, wood and canvas that was available at that time including all natural colors in painting the plane, and had to create about 25‚Äì30 models before finalizing the plane for the film. From these samples, only 2 small planes will be seen in the film. Also, In order to maintain the authenticity of the era and avoid fabrication, the makers kept every single detail in mind to re-create the plane. The team was keen to install the plane at Girgaon Chowpatty, as that was where Shivkar Talpade‚Äôs first plane had taken off. But since the makers denied permissions from the authorities, the sequence was shot at Versova Beach in Mumbai. Nearly 3,000 technicians had worked in this film for almost two years. The director insisted to bring \\"magical realism\\" for the audience. = Characterization = Ayushmann Khurrana learned Marathi dialogues for the film, based on the character of Marathi-scientist Shivkar Bapuji Talpade. = Costume design = Director Puri and his team did many look tests for Ayushmann Khurrana and Mithun Chakraborty, and the former tried on nine different hairstyles for this film. Sahil Kochhar, was the costume designer of the film. He and his team designed outfits according to the fabrics and colours available in that era. They made sure we didn‚Äôt use any nylon outfits as it had not been invented then. Similarly, the colour pink wasn't used then. Critical reception Subhash K. Jha gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5, and stated \\"Hawaizaada, a film that soars into the skies with its overweening ambitions and miraculously manages to stay airborne as it chronicles the life a man who wanted to fly.\\" The Times of India rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stating \\"Hawaizaada works because this story about India‚Äôs unsung hero needs to find its place. But this realm depends heavily on performances ‚Äì the histrionics could be several notches higher.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"The film is an interesting idea that never takes flight.\\" Anupama Chopra gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, stating \\"Vibhu has designed Hawaizaada to be an all-purpose vehicle that has romance, comedy and drama . But the writing is flat and the telling, clumsy. Ayushmann, who is in nearly every frame, trembles with fervour. Mithun matches him. The respite here is Pallavi Sharda, who lifts this film.\\" Bollywood Hungama gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars stating that \\"If you watch the film with a feeling that you will be transported into the world of invention of the first ever man made desi flight, then, take our word for it that, you will be sorely disappointed, because the film actually is an extravagant 'costume musical'. The film barely touches upon anything that's got to do with the story pertaining to the first manmade Indian flight and is far away from reality. It is instead loaded with melodrama. At the end of the film, one really feels sorry for the film's producer because the over- expense was just not needed!\\" Koimoi gave the same rating noting the work of the design team in recreating the 1800s, but faulted the script for focusing on a fictional love story and too many songs rather than the historical story of the airplane's flight. Then stated that \\"Hawaizaada turned out to be a sheer disappointing watch. It has a yawn-inducing storyline which makes it difficult to watch even as it drags for over two hours. It is low on historical knowledge and even the execution is not top notch.\\" =Box office= The film grossed 5 million on the opening day, with 6 million on Saturday and 7.5 million on Sunday, with grossing 18.5 million on the opening week. Then facing a drop on Monday, grossing 3.5 million, total up to 23 million in 4 days.

He was elected to Second Lok Sabha from 1957 to 1962 from Dhulia Lok Sabha Constituency of erstwhile Bombay State as a candidate of Bharatiya Jana Sangh. He was elected to Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989 to 1991 from Erandol Lok Sabha Constituency of Maharashtra as a candidate of Bharatiya Janata Party. He was also a Member of Maharashtra Legislative Council during 1954-55 and from 1966 to 1978. He was the Leader of Opposition of the Council from 1966 to 1978. He was also a member of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from 1978 to 1980. He was state cabinet minister from 1978 to 1980 in the Progressive Democratic alliance Government of Maharashtra state led by Sharad Pawar. He held revenue portfolio. He was an advocate by profession. Shri Patil authored two books. He was also the founder editor of Sudarshan weekly. He died on 18 November 2001 at Mumbai.  Early life and education  Uttamrao Patil was born at Waghali in Chalisgaon tehsil of Jalgaon district in a farmer family. His school education was done at Raver. His college education was done at Baroda in an institute run by Raje Sayajirao Gaekwad. He did his law graduation in Pune. It was in law college where he became acquainted with the thoughts of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, N B Kher and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, whom he brought to the law college as a guest speaker. He was a college debate secretary. He did his postgraduate studies at Kolhapur.  Early political days  When Bharatiya Jana Sangh was formed at the national level in 1951, the party started planning in Maharashtra also. They wanted their leader to be learned, an orator, an organiser and from a rural background. Uttamrao Patil was the right choice. On pursuation of Dattopant Thengdi, Nana Dhobale and Rambhau Godbole, Mr. Patil joined Bharatiya Jansangh. He, along with colleagues, toured the state and brought many dedicated workers in the party who became founder pillars of the organisation. Some of these included Baburao Vaidya, Zamatmalji, Raghoba and Rajabhau Zarkar, Sadubhau Deshpande, Kshema Thatte, Malati Paranjape, Meera Pavgi, Kisan Gharpure, Gangadharpant, Vasantrao and Bhagwanrao Patwardhan, Bhagwanrao Joshi, Baburao Dev, Pandurang Ghalsasi, Hampi Vakil, Bhausaheb Badhiye, and Bhaskar Ninave. He was the first State President of Bharatiya Jansangh and Rambhau godbole was the first organising secretary.  Electoral and Parliamentary politics (1954‚Äì1991)  = Member of Maharashtra Legislative Council (1954-1955) = In 1954, Nanasaheb contested election to Maharashtra Legislative Council and won by sheer hard work of party workers. Thus party got its first legislator in Maharashtra. The first congratulatory telegram message was from Swatantryaveer Savarkar. In 1955, he resigned from the legislature on party orders on formation of the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement. In 1956, Nanasaheb was amongst leaders of Goa liberation movement. He organized volunteer batches to be sent in Goa. Later, the Maharashtra government granted Freedom Fighter status to all participants. A signed letter by Nanasaheb was sufficient to grant this status to an applicant. Nanasaheb himself never accepted any awards, perks or pension for his contributions. = Member of Second Lok Sabha (1957-1962) = 241x241px In 1957, first time after Jan Sangh's formation, Parliament elections were held. Nanasaheb contested from Dhule Loksabha and won handsomely. Nanasaheb became the first member of Parliament from Jan Sangh from Maharashtra. Only four MPs from Jan Sangh were elected from the whole of India - Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Premji Asar and Shivdin Droher were the other three. Atalji shared a room in MP hostel with Nanasaheb during his five-year term. Some of the key issues Nanasaheb focused on during his tenure were long term national economic agenda, food shortages in country, and sincere and prompt action against China on the border issue. When PM Jawaharlal Nehru proposed co-op farming in India based on a Russian model, Nanasaheb opposed this in Parliament. He formed a strong farmer lobby of MPs including Chaudhari Charansing, A G Ranga, and Purushottam Patel, and opposition became nationwide. He propagated that \\"Land is farmer's mother and such soviet ideas are alien to this motherland\\". PM Nehru had to withdraw the proposal and Nanasaheb became the farmers' leader. In 1957, he started a Marathi weekly publication, Sudarshan. It was a platform for the oppressed and an efficient tool against government apathy. He had to undergo many court cases for his articles but nothing could stop him from his mission. This weekly continued almost for 40 years. For a brief period of 1960 to 1962, He was National Vice President of Jan Sangh. = Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council (1966-1978) = In 1966, Nanasaheb contested legislative council election from Graduate constituency. After some days, all opposition members of the council formed a National Democratic Alliance and Nanasaheb was chosen as its leader. He became Leader of Opposition in the legislative council and had ministerial status and perks. His office became a meeting point for opposition resulting in a very effective opposition assault on government on important issues. For a common man from rural area, his office and residence was open to visit and seek help. The formation of regional agriculture universities and realisation of the Employment Assurance Scheme (precursor of MNREGA) were his contributions in this period. He continued to be Leader of Opposition till 1978.  Emergency years (1975-1977)  During Indira Gandhi's national internal emergency, most of the opposition leaders (including those of Jan Sangh) were put behind the bars. Some went underground. Nanasaheb was not behind bars owing to the fact that he was hospitalized after a major road accident. He had suffered a severe injury with 36 fractures and neuromuscular ailments. He used this time to the party's advantage, and notwithstanding all his physical limitations, he worked as the party's national executive secretary as well as President for some time. He extensively connected with jailed party workers' families and arranged for their paroles in sickness, family death or family marriages. He also participated in the formation of the Janata Party and its initial setup (Janata Party was an amalgam of Indian political parties opposed to the State of Emergency). As a result, the party formation was complete and the party was ready when elections were declared in 1977.  Personal defeat forgotten in party victory  After formation of Janata Party, he was unanimously elected as President of Maharashtra Pradesh. In 1977, he contested a Lok Sabha election from Dhule constituency. There was a Janata wave and Congress was uprooted all over India (Indira and Sanjay Gandhi suffered a personal defeat as MP candidates). Candidates like George Fernandes won even from jail. But surprisingly Nanasaheb lost the election to a novice congress candidate in Dhule. This was the only defeat of the Janata Party on Mumbai Agra highway constituencies. Keeping his personal defeat aside, Nanasaheb consented to a victory procession in Dhule to celebrate the nationwide Janata Party victory. = Revenue Minister of Maharastra State and Member of Legislative Assembly (1978-1980) = border In 1978, the elections to Maharashtra assembly were declared. Nanasaheb was still a council legislator but he decided to contest and was given a party ticket from Paola‚ÄìBhadgaon constituency. He was seen as a chief ministerial candidate in case of the party win. As a party president, he had to tour the whole Maharashtra state and had very little time to campaign in his own constituency. The young party workers took this campaign responsibility and he won the election by a handsome majority. Janata party was the largest single party but congress and S-congress came together and managed to form a government. Nanasaheb became the Leader of Opposition in the assembly. There was soon a deflection in the congress coalition government and Sharad Pawar broke away from the Congress party to form a coalition government with the Janata Party in 1978. Though Janata Party had more than thrice the legislature members than Sharad Pawar's fragment, still Pawar became the Chief Minister of the new Progressive Democratic Alliance. Nanasaheb was given a revenue and rehabilitation portfolio. He occupied 'Varsha' bungalow as his official residence. This government was short-lived and summarily dismissed in February 1980, following Indira Gandhi's return to power in Delhi. During this short tenure, Nanasaheb took many important decisions including the renaming of Dr Ambedkar Marathwada university and giving to the tribal people (Adivasis) ownership of the land which they had cultivated for generations. = Retirement from electoral politics (1980-1989) = In 1980, Janata Party disintegrated fully. The old Jan Sangh again reunited as the Bharatiya Janata Party in Mumbai with the lotus as its symbol. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was chosen as the National President and Nanasaheb was chosen as the President of Maharashtra BJP. In the same year, Nanasaheb declared his retirement from active electoral politics and vowed to work for the party only. In 1984, he handed over the presidency to the young Gopinath Munde and declared that in future neither would he contest elections nor would he hold party positions. He will be just 'a party worker' henceforth. He was 63 years old at the time. = Last stint as Member of Ninth Lok Sabha (1989-1991) = Nanasaheb with Atalji Despite his resolution of not participating in active politics, Nanasaheb contested the Lok Sabha elections once more, for the final time. The reason for contesting was an emotional one. Party was expecting a good parliamentary result and a probable government formation in Delhi. The party counted on winning every favourable seat to achieve its goal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee personally insisted that Nanasaheb should contest the upcoming elections. Nanasaheb was not physically ready for the task, but following party dictum he contested from Erandol constituency. Despite 10 years of absence from electoral politics, he was still the people's leader and won easily. Ninth Lok Sabha did not complete its five-year tenure and was dissolved in 1991. Nanasaheb felt very much relieved. He never again contested.

With limited television budgets Australian broadcasters were unable to produce a weekly anthology series of their own during the 1950s (the monthly 1959‚Äì1960 series Shell Presents was the closest to such a series, along with standalone twice- monthly plays on ABC from 1957 to early 1960s), and as such several American anthology series were shown there, along with a few British anthology series and at least one Canadian anthology.

His family traced their lineage to the Rurik Dynasty, and had been moderately prominent boyars in the Muscovite period. He was held in scant respect by his colleagues, who felt that his rank and position owed more to family connections than any competence or ability.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 404. Lt. Commander Newton McCully, American Naval attach√© in Port Arthur through much of the siege noted that Ukhtomsky \\"was not esteemed as particularly able, but was considered a Russian patriot, and had the credit with the fleet of having forced Admiral Vitgeft to make the sortie of June 23\\" Biography Ukhtomsky‚Äôs family traced their lineage to the Rurik Dynasty, and had been moderately prominent boyars in the Muscovite period. Ukhtomsky graduated from the Sea Cadets in 1867 and the Maritime College in 1873, as a specialist in mine warfare. He was promoted to captain, 2nd rank in 1885 and to captain, 1st rank in 1894. From 1896, he was commander of the cruiser , followed by the battleship in 1900. In 1901, Ukhtomsky was promoted to rear admiral and appointed chief-of-staff of Kronstadt. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Ukhtomsky was at Port Arthur as deputy commander under Admiral Oskar Stark and was entrusted with a portion of the battleship squadron. Following Stark‚Äôs dismissal on 24 February 1904, he served as acting commander of the Port Arthur squadron for ten days until the arrival of Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov. He was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus, 1st class with swords, for his participation in the defense of the Russian base against Japanese destroyer attacks. After the death of Admiral Makarov on 13 April, Ukhtomsky again served as acting commander until Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev reassumed command. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, after Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft on the battleship had been killed in combat, command of the fleet fell to Ukhtomsky. The signal halyards of his flagship, the battleship , had been shot away, so it took some time to get signals to the rest of the fleet. Ukhtomsky ordered the fleet to return to the safety of Port Arthur. While some perceived his actions as acts of cowardice, to be fair to Prince Ukhtomsky he was not a coward. The Peresviet suffered significant damage at Yellow Sea. According to Lt. Commander Newton McCully (the American naval attache in Port Arthur) who visited the ship after the engagement and observed the damage, the Peresviet received no fewer than sixteen \\"well defined\\" penetrating hits by shells of 8\\" and larger - the most of any Russian ship in the engagement. By the end of the battle Peresviet was unable to steam at more than six knots (because of significant damage to her funnels and thus to the boilers below) leaving Ukhtomsky with little practical choice but to return to Port Arthur with the rest of the slow battleships and heavily damaged cruisers. He commanded Port Arthur for the next three weeks until replaced on 4 September by the lower- ranking Captain Robert Wiren. After the end of the war, Ukhtomsky retired from active service in 1906 citing illness and was promoted the position of vice admiral.

It depicts an Australian soldier of World War I sitting on a muddy battlefield in France. The diorama was commissioned by the AWM in 1986, and was placed on display in 1989. Man in the mud is popular with visitors to the Memorial, and remained on display after the AWM's World War I galleries were closed for major renovations in 2013. Design and construction In 1986 the Australian War Memorial commissioned Corlett to produce a diorama which depicted the difficult conditions endured by the Australian soldiers who fought on the Western Front during World War I. Corlett selected a pose for the subject of the diorama from that of a soldier in a photo in the AWM's collection which depicts a group of gassed Australians at a casualty clearing station in France during May 1918. The diorama was designed using a live model, who Corlett photographed replicating the pose in the AWM photo. Corlett subsequently slightly altered the pose, however, to increase the tension of the soldier's body.Hutchings (1992), p. 90 The figure and the mud in which he is seated are crafted from fibreglass. The soldier wears a fibre uniform and metal helmet, and the diorama's backing is a brown-toned photograph of a muddy battlefield. In his book Peter Corlett : sculptures, Patrick Hutchings provides the following description of Man in the mud: Reception Man in the mud was completed in 1989, and placed on display in the AWM's World War I galleries that year. As of 2005, the diorama was located immediately after the exit of the Memorial's gallery on the Gallipoli Campaign, and was the first item visitors saw when they entered the Western Front galleries. This placement was intended to stress the more impersonal and brutal nature of the fighting in France compared to that in Gallipoli. A 1988 Canberra Times article labelled the then-incomplete diorama \\"very fine\\". Hutchings also judged the work to be a success.Hutchings (1992), p. 91 The diorama is one of the most popular items on display in the AWM, and the Memorial's website labels it \\"much-loved\\". Responding to the realistic appearance of the soldier and the muddy battlefield, many of the memorial's visitors touch the work. Man in the mud was removed from the AWM's World War I galleries when they were closed for a major redevelopment in April 2013. It was placed on display in the Memorial's temporary exhibition space. The statue was not included in the World War I galleries after they re-opened.

Additionally, there was an assault on a student and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in one incident at the school, with no arrests. In November 2015, Pennsylvania State Police began investigating a case of Pleasant Valley Middle School students transmitting sexually explicit images of a minor. The photographs of the minor were taken in Ross Township, PA. Police have yet to release a statement regarding the incident. In 2009, the district's administration reported there were 7 incidents of bullying at the Middle School. There were seven incidents involving the police with two arrests. The district has implemented district-wide coordination of safety initiatives. In 2009, the school district: 1) Established a PVSD Workplace Safety Committee; 2) Upgraded the high school access system; 3) Added video cameras to the high school system; 4) Increased security patrols; 5) Increased the use of metal detectors; and 6) Worked to coordinate the school district‚Äôs school police and PSP School Resource Officer‚Äôs efforts.Douglas C. Arnold, Ph. D, Pleasant Valley School district Annual Community Report, 2010 The Pleasant Valley School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Pleasant Valley School Board established a district-wide wellness policy in March 2006. The board approved nutritional standards for Competitive Foods in the district. The district's policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Pleasant Valley Middle School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. All foster children, whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household, are eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Pleasant Valley School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in the Middle School to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and the Pennsylvania Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars The Pleasant Valley School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. Any student not passing two or more credits per semester will be declared ineligible for further participation until passing averages are earned. The district is compliant with state law, posting its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website in 2014. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to Pennsylvania‚Äôs Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. =Sports= Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Pleasant Valley School Board, Pleasant Valley School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 In 2013-14, the district reported spending $1,289,195 on student activities, excluding transportation and facility costs.

He pioneered judo in Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries.

With Mitsuyo Maeda, Satake formed the head of the second generation of Kodokan judoka, which had replaced the first by the beginning of the 20th century. Satake, at and , was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match Maeda in judo. At that time, there were few graduated Kodokan judoka. Maeda and Satake were the top graduated professors at Waseda University, both sandan (3rd dan), along with Matsuhiro Ritaro (nidan or 2nd dan) and six other shodan (1st dan). In 1903, a senior Kodokan instructor named Yamashita Yoshitsugu traveled to the United States at the request of the Seattle businessman Sam Hill.

Before traveling to Europe, Maeda and Satake went to Cuba along with Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito. All of them engaged in combats. On 8 February 1907, Maeda and Satake arrived in Liverpool, England. Apparently they had planned to join up with Akitaro Ono, who had gone to London to wrestle for promoter William Bankier in London music halls. During September 1909, a Japanese calling himself 'Nobu Taka' arrived in Mexico City for the purpose of challenging Maeda for what the Mexican Herald said would be the world jujutsu championship.Mexican Herald, September 3, 1909. After several months of public wrangling, Taka and Maeda met at the Colon Theater on November 16, 1909; Taka won.Mexican Herald, November 16, 1909 There was an immediate rematch, and four days later, Maeda was pronounced the champion.Mexican Herald, November 20, 1909. It was later revealed that Taka was, in fact, Soishiro Satake. During 1911, Maeda and Satake were joined in Cuba by Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito. The four men were known as the 'Four Kings of Cuba.' The Four Kings were very popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media were proud of the reputation they were bringing to judo and Japan.Japan Times, November 1, 1912. In 1913 Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while they were there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay Maeda to lose, and, in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Porto Alegre on 14 November 1914. and then moved throughout the country for a year. On 26 August 1915, Maeda, Satake, Okura, Shimitsu, and Laku were at Recife, during October 1915, they were in Bel√©m, finally arriving in Manaus in the Brazilian state of Amazonas on 18 December 1915. Tokugoro Ito arrived some time later. On 20 December 1915, the first demonstration in Bel√©m took place at the Theatro Politheama. The O Tempo newspaper announced the event, stating that Conde Koma would show the main jiu-jitsu techniques, excepting the prohibited ones. He would also demonstrate self-defense techniques. After that, the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd, and there would be the first sensational match of jiu-jitsu between Shimitsu (champion of Argentina) and Laku (Peruvian military professor). On 22 December 1915, according to O Tempo, jiu-jitsu world champion Maeda, head of the Japanese troupe, and Satake, New York champion, performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu-jitsu match. On the same day, Nagib Assef, an Australian Greco-Roman wrestling champion of Turkish origin, challenged Maeda. On 8 January 1916, Maeda, Okura, and Shimitsu boarded the SS Antony and left for Liverpool. Tokugoro Ito went to Los Angeles.Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Tokugoro Ito\\" Satake and Laku stayed in Manaus teaching, according to O Tempo, jiu-jitsu. After 15 years together, Maeda and Satake had finally split up. Of this last trip to Europe, little is known. Maeda went from England to Portugal, Spain, and France, coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone. Satake would become the founder, in 1914, of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil. He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil. In January 1916, Satake won the first jiu-jitsu tournament in the Amazon. In Manaus Satake opened his own academy in 1916, at the Atl√©tico Rio Negro Clube, which became the first Japanese to open a judo and jiu-jitsu academy in Brazil. Satake became a Brazilian citizen and changed his name to Ant√¥nio Soshihiro Satake. On 19 September 1921, Satake, Maeda, and Okura were briefly in New York City. They were aboard the Booth Line steamship SS Polycarp. All three men listed their occupations as professors of \\"juitso\\".Ancestry.com. New York Passenger Lists, 1820‚Äì1957 (database online). Year: 1921; Microfilm serial: T715; Microfilm roll: T715_3023; Line: 2. After leaving New York, the three men went to the Caribbean, where they stayed from September to December 1921. In Havana, Satake and Maeda took part in some contests. Their opponents included Paul Alvarez, who wrestled as Espanol Icognito. Alvarez defeated Satake and Yako Okura‚Äîthe latter being billed as a former instructor at the Chilean Naval Academy‚Äîbefore being himself beaten by Maeda. Maeda also defeated a Cuban boxer called Jose Ibarra, and a French wrestler called Fournier.Diario De La Marina, Havana, various dates, September‚ÄìDecember 1921. In 1922, Satake embarked to Europe and nothing was known about him after that.

Founded in 1776 as an amateur theatre by a society of friends from both the nobility and the middle class, it was initially respected and influential but declined in the early 19th century after the fashion shifted to elaborate historical and verse dramas and the national theatre movement grew in importance, and was eventually dissolved in 1832. The Baroque building on Hauptstra√üe in the Innere Neustadt was abandoned for many years in the second half of the 20th century, but beginning in 1979, a movement grew to restore it. The theatre reopened in 1999 and is now operated by the city. History =Foundation and heyday= Keystone over the theatre entrance, by J√ºrgen Mehlhorn, 1979 After the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the theatrical landscape in Dresden shifted, with French actors being replaced by German, \\"partly to save money, partly out of patriotism\\". \\"Reformed\\" theatre groups such as that of Abel Seyler gained in respect against the court theatre, which was felt to be too focussed on spectacle, and the educated middle class began to emulate the amateur theatre of the aristocracy. On 19 May 1776, a group of fifteen friends founded a society for the purpose of creating a private theatre in their leisure time, and the Societaetstheater was ceremoniously opened the same day, initially in a temporary home near the current location of the main station with a capacity of approximately 50 spectators. In 1777, with the assistance of the publisher Conrad Georg Walter, the theatre moved to a larger building in Borngasse (near the current location of the German Hygiene Museum), but after Walter's death the following year, it moved again on 7 December 1779 to its current home, a garden building in the courtyard behind the residence of the government secretary Johann Christoph Hoffmann at Hauptstra√üe 19. This had been built in 1740 in Baroque style, intended for masquerades, but never used. It accommodated an audience of 250 and a 24-piece orchestra.\\"Vom Societ√§ts- Theater in Dresden\\". pp. 86-87. The stage was small even then; it was illuminated with wax or tallow candles in special holders designed to reflect the light on the desired spot. The interior was by Johann Ludwig Giesel, who also designed the interior of the original Gewandhaus in Leipzig. The design for the curtain in 1779 was by Johann Eleazar Zeissig, known as Schenau, a director of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts; it depicted, amongst genii and garlands of roses, scenes from Greek mythology, such as Thalia, the muse of comedy, showing a youth the way to the temple of virtue while a bacchante tried to draw him towards the temple of lust. Watercolour by Johann Heinrich Ramberg of a performance of Siegfried von Lindenberg at the Societaetstheater in 1790 The society of friends of the theatre grew to fifty members, and by the end of the 18th century to more than 75. They belonged to both the nobility and the middle class and agreed to a 25-article constitution which included equality of members. Decisions and assignment of positions were voted on; five board members, a secretary and a cashier were elected, whose duties included determining the list of plays and assignment of roles. The constitution divided the society's membership into active and passive members.Gruber (1998), p. 101. The active members were overwhelmingly attached to the court of Saxony. For example, the privy advisor of the privy council, Hans Ernst von Teubern, translated scripts into German. The poet August Gottlieb Mei√üner used his influence within the society to secure performances of works by his friend Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Other members wrote plays themselves or, like the painter Ernst Ferdinand Oehme in the 19th century, performed on stage. Altogether between 20 and 30 of the members were active as performers, leading to frequent doubling of roles.Gruber (1998), p. 104. The passive members included aristocratic patrons who funded needs such as costumes or the upkeep of the theatre. Such benefactors included Prince Charles of Saxony, Count Alois Friedrich von Br√ºhl and Count Hans Moritz von Br√ºhl. Productions took place mainly in the winter season, between September and early May. Like almost all other theatres, the Societaetstheater closed for Lent. However, performances also took place on Fridays and Sundays, which out of respect for religion were avoided by public theatres in Dresden until the early 19th century. Performances of the Societaetstheater were usually restricted to members' family, friends and acquaintances; a 1792 announcement speaks of each member receiving three tickets. Outsiders were admitted only in exceptional cases and after presenting a calling card. Nonetheless, the theatre soon acquired a reputation extending outside Saxony. Productions were reported on in theatrical publications alongside those of the established court theatres and tours by well known companies. The persistence of the theatre was remarked on, since similar associations were at the time usually short-lived. It became a model which was emulated in various cities. In Dresden itself, where there were also two public theatres, a summer theatre, and touring productions, a second theatrical association, the Freundschaftliche Theater, was founded in 1787; since some of the members belonged to both, this was combined with the Societaetstheater in 1789.Gruber (1998), p. 109. By 1802, there were a total of twelve other theatres in Dresden. =Closing= The Societaetstheater was originally entirely amateur. There is no record of any appearances by actors from public theatres until 1800.Gruber (1998), p. 160. In the early 19th century this began to change, as upcoming actors increasingly discovered the theatre as a place to hone their talent. Actresses including Demoiselle Hartmann, the Weinhold sisters and Luise Wagner, sister of Richard Wagner, used the theatre to make the transition to professional careers. The years around 1800 also saw a generational shift from the founders to their successors, who chose the stage as their profession while retaining close ties to the Societaetstheater, where they had begun their association with the theatre.Gruber (1998), p. 162. The bourgeois drawing-room dramas which dominated the repertoires of theatres of all sizes at the beginning of the 19th century made few demands in casting, time, settings or props. However, the general movement towards grand historical dramas, such as those by Goethe and Schiller, with their demanding costumes, complex verse which was difficult to memorise and to recite, and large casts, once more opened a gulf between professional and amateur drama. Dilettantism had a negative connotation; Goethe and Schiller themselves collaborated in the summer of 1799 on a compilation with that as its theme, '. The Societaetstheater produced simple dramas and comedies, some slapstick; no production of Goethe or Schiller there is recorded.Gruber (1998), p. 171. The theatre's reputation waned, and as the national theatre movement gained in importance, it was excluded from the mainstream. Many of the upper middle class regarded amateur theatre as at best a \\"harmless pleasure\\" with no particular moral or aesthetic merit. Financial, social and political pressures led the Societaetstheater to close on 19 May 1832 and the society was dissolved. =Reopening= Theatre building before restoration In 1837 a building was erected beside the theatre, covering almost half the fa√ßade. A second storey and more windows were added to the building itself, and beginning in the second half of the 19th century, it was used as a residence. In the early 20th century, small handwork businesses moved into what had been the foyer; traces of metalworking remain. The premises were also reportedly used by a photographic studio and by the post office. Pavilion in Baroque garden The building was not destroyed in the bombing of Dresden on 13 February 1945, but fell into increasing disrepair after the war. In the 1950s and 60s, urgently needed repairs were not made, and from the 1970s on, the building was abandoned. Despite the renovation of the Hauptstra√üe beginning in 1978, the intention was to gut and demolish the building. The architect J√ºrgen Mehlhorn, who had become interested in the building while still a student and was now using it to store material for the reconstruction of other buildings on the street, in 1979 designed a keystone for the main entrance at Hauptstra√üe 19 depicting two theatrical masks and with the inscription \\"Societaetstheater 1715 1779 1979\\". The association \\"Interessengemeinschaft Societaetstheater\\" was then founded; in 1992 this became \\"Societaetstheater e.V.\\" The association worked to preserve the building and raised money for urgent repairs such as roof work and provisional safety measures. In 1985, the building became a registered landmark of the German Democratic Republic.Gruber (1998). \\"'Der Weg entsteht beim Gehen'\\". p. 238. More extensive repairs were made in 1989. After German reunification in 1990, Dresdner Bank sponsored the building's restoration. The Dresden city council decided in October 1994 that the theatre would be operated by the city once restored, and work began in 1996. The building was restored based on its original state, with the addition of an annexe containing a cellar theatre, a restaurant and five guest rooms. The adjoining Baroque garden, which had belonged to the sculptor Johann Benjamin Thomae amongst others, was also restored, and a restored pavilion by Thomae placed in the centre. The theatre had its ceremonial reopening on 19 February 1999. Current uses The Societaetstheater today is a modern chamber theatre, accommodating spoken word, dance, music and puppet performances. Resident productions evolve by a workshop process harking back to the theatre's origins. Independent performers from the region as well as guest performers from Germany and other countries have appeared there. In addition to the main theatre and the cellar stage, performances may take place in the foyer and in the garden. It has served as one of the venues for the Jazztage Dresden festival.

In 2015, Nyovest endorsed with MTN and AG Mobile in launching a smartphone named, AG Hashtag which was inspired and partly designed by him.

The record label was established in 2014 after his departure of label, Impact Soundz.  Personal life  In July 2015, after months of denying any romantic involvement with each other, Nyovest and actress Boitumelo Thulo finally confirmed in a July issue of DRUM that they were dating. The headline on the cover of the magazine implied that the couple was engaged but Nyovest and Thulo later denied this claiming that the magazine used the headline as a ploy to increase sales. The couple broke up in December 2015. Controversies =Feuds= In 2014, Nyovest was embroiled in a feud with long-time rival, AKA. As Nyovest claimed his song \\"Doc Shebeleza\\" was the biggest song in South African Hip-Hop, AKA who was promoting his new single \\"Congratulate\\", showed contradiction when he tweeted, \\"There's a rapper running around saying he got the biggest song in the country ... I challenge you to find his song in the iTunes Top 100\\". Thereafter, Nyovest responded with a tweet stating reasons why his song was bigger than AKA's. The argument escalated as both rappers were responding to each other multiple times. In August 2014, the pair were scheduled to both perform on SABC 1 music show, Live Amp when a member of AKA's entourage allegedly pulled a gun on Cassper and his team. Further controversy arose in 2015, when Cassper accused AKA of slapping him which led both rappers to release diss tracks. In 2018 when Nyovest was asked about the status of his feud with AKA, he stated the two would never reconcile, which has so far proven true. =Lawsuits and civil disputes= In 2018, Xitsonga musician, Benny Mayengani was to do his concert named, #FillUpGiyaniStadium. As Mayengeni used a similar affix (\\"Fill Up\\"/\\"#FillUp\\") as Nyovest, Nyovest then accused Mayengani for using his trademark in a form of sending him a cease and desist letter. Investigation revealed that Nyovest does not yet own the #FillUp trademark and can not take any action.  Awards and nominations  Nyovest has been awarded and nominated for various music awards both locally and internationally. His first set of awards were in 2013 when he won four awards at the second edition of the South Africa Hip Hop Awards .

He signed a document stating he was ceasing all activities as a painter (probably to relieve himself of the duty to pay dues to the guild) in 1645 and joined the Dutch East India Company. In the same year he sailed to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Here he would reside with interruptions from 1645 to 1664.Philips Angel II at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In the company of envoy Joan Cunaeus he traveled as a 'Chief Buyer' (in Dutch: opperkoopman) of the Dutch East India Company to Persia where he arrived in Bender-Abassi on 25 December 1651. He visited the ruins of Persepolis on 16 February 1652 and 11 days later took up his new post. With his interpreter Nils Mathson K√∂ping he also traveled to Arabia. When soon thereafter he had to resign because of irregularities in his management, he travelled to Isfahan in Persia. Here he was the drawing master of Shah Abbas II of Persia (1641-1666), grandson of Shah Abbas the Great. In 1656 he was summoned to Batavia to justify himself. As he failed to clear his name he was forced to leave the service of the Dutch East India Company. He was able to obtain other administrative positions in Batavia. Again there were irregularities in his management of affairs and he was removed from all posts on 11 October 1661.Angel, Philips (2) in: P.C. Molhuysen en P.J.

Web. 7 Jun. 2014 Lof der Schilder-konst The Wedding of Samson, by Rembrandt, 1638 His booklet 'Lof der Schilder-konst' ('Praise of the Art of Painting') situates itself in a line of art historical and theoretical writing in the Dutch Republic that started with the 'Schilder- boeck' published by Flemish √©migr√© Karel van Mander in Haarlem in 1604. Angel gave his lecture at a time when he and other painters in Leiden were seeking permission to establish a guild to protect their economic interests. They likely also sought recognition as a group with an important socio-economic status in local society. The latter is reflected in the first part of the book which seeks to affirm the status of the painter's profession.Eric J. Sluijter, 'Belering en verhulling? Enkele 17de-eeuwse teksten over de schilderkunst en de iconologische benadering van Noordnederlandse schilderijen uit deze periode.' in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 4. Sub Rosa, Lettele 1988 The first part of the booklet makes the traditional comparisons between the value and ranking of painting, sculpture and poetry. In this part Angel liberally borrows anecdotes on famous painters from antiquity up to the 17th century from van Mander's Schilder-boeck. According to Angel, painting deserves more praise than the other two arts because it can imitate all that is visible in nature. The second part of the booklet deals with the wide range of skills that a painter must master to excel. This is the most original part of the booklet as Angel describes genres such as seascapes, battle scenes and guardroom scenes that were new at the time. One of the skills he emphasizes is the ability to accurately imitate visible things, so that they seem 'truly real'. He argues that light and shadow must be divided so that even things that appear difficult to imitate with brush and paint seem very real. As a final point, he recommends the need for neatness (a careful, smooth way of painting) which must be accompanied by a certain 'lossicheyt' (looseness) in order to avoid a \\"stiff neat unpleasantnesss'. He praises Gerard Dou as a painter accomplished in this respect. Finally, Angel emphasises the need of a painter to display a pleasant behaviour, virtue and industry - especially the latter is strongly emphasized - in order to obtain the highest honor and fame as a painter. According to the book, the main concern of painting should be to please the eye of the beholder. The largest section of Angel‚Äôs book is devoted to history painting and he discusses several contemporary Old Testament paintings including Rembrandt‚Äôs 'The Wedding of Samson'. He argues that in order to depict 'godly, poetic and heathen histories' one must first read the texts of the stories well so that the information in these stories is represented accurately without mistakes in relation to the text. Angel is not concerned about expressing the deeper meanings inherent in these stories and neither does he stress the need to express emotions to move the beholder. Angel expresses no clear consciousness of a hierarchy between the different genres. His appreciation for Gerard Dou, who had already started to concentrate mainly on paintings of interiors and tronies is certainly no less than that for Rembrandt and Jan Lievens.Facsimile of 'Lof der Schilder-konst' on Google Books References 1618 births 1660s deaths Year of death missing Dutch Golden Age painters Dutch male painters Artists from Leiden Dutch East India Company people ","title":"Philips Angel II"},{"id":"42989268","text":"The MAZEM ‚Äì Mannheim Center for Empirical Multilingualism Research (in German: Mannheimer Zentrum f√ºr Empirische Mehrsprachigkeitsforschung) in Mannheim, Germany is a linguistic and educational research institute that originated at the University of Mannheim.

She writes young adult fiction and in 2014 began publishing an adult mystery series. Her background as a Mormon has influenced her topics of interest as a writer, especially in the A Linda Willheim Mystery series which focuses on a Mormon woman within her religious community. Her novel, Mira, Mirror won the Utah Letters About Literature award in 2006, and three other novels were finalists for the AML Awards in 2007, 2014 and 2015.  Early life  Born on September 30, 1970, in Summit, New Jersey, Mette Harrison grew up in New Jersey as the ninth of eleven children in a Mormon family. The Harrisons eventually moved to Provo when she was ten years old. In high school she studied German and in 1985 spent the year attending a German gymnasium. In 1988, Harrison received Brigham Young University's \\"Ezra Taft Benson Scholarship\\". She graduated from Brigham Young University two years later with bachelor's and master's degrees in German Literature. Harrison received a full scholarship to attend Princeton University and in 1995 earned a PhD in Germanic Languages and Literatures. She wrote her dissertation on the female Bildungsroman of the 18th century.  Career  Harrison quit her job as an adjunct professor at Brigham Young University in 1997. In 1999, her first book, The Monster In Me, was accepted for publication. = Works and awards = Her novel, Mira, Mirror won the Utah Letters About Literature award in 2006. In 2007 Harrison's The Princess and the Hound was a finalist for the Association for Mormon Letters (AML) Young Adult Literature award. The Bishop's Wife was a finalist for the AML Novel Award in 2014, and His Right Hand was a finalist for the same award in 2015. Harrison regularly wrote in the religion section of The Huffington Post on topics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) over the span of 2015‚Äì2017. Her articles describe common misconceptions of LDS beliefs, addressing people outside of the LDS Church and also focusing on her internal religious audience. Harrison's articles describe her concern about the culture of the LDS Church while also pointing out the positives of her religion. Harrison writes for Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show, giving writing advice to authors. = A Linda Wallheim Mystery series = Harrison uses her religious background to write mysteries on LDS cultural issues. The A Linda Wallheim Mystery series is about a Mormon bishop's wife who uncovers terrible truths within her community. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Harrison said, \\"I want to make a 'regular' Mormon woman the heroine of the story\\". Harrison feels that Mormon women are often overlooked or forgotten. This series gives others a look into LDS culture while delving into situations LDS members neglect to address. Kirkus Reviews favorably reviewed The Bishop's Wife (2014), the first book in the series, stating that \\"this decidedly adult tale adds twists aplenty to an insider's look at a religion replete with its own mysteries\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the novel was \\"apt to offend most Mormon men\\" and praised the way Harrison helped readers contemplate the \\"question of how dangerous fire-breathing extremists really are\\". The Bishop's Wife was an ABA IndieNext Selection for December 2015 and a national bestseller.

She wrote about her experience with high-functioning autism in Sunstone, where she noted that participation in the LDS Church helped her to make social connections she otherwise would not have pursued. She also described how her lack of \\"normal facial expressions\\" leads other church members to underestimate the depth of her feelings, especially depression. Since Harrison does not intuitively understand human interactions, she attributes her proficiency in portraying human interactions in her writing to her need to analyze human behavior closely. Harrison is married to her husband Matt, and together they have six children.  Notes   References          External linksMette Ivie Harrison papers, MSS 8039, L.

The film is a remake of Aaina. The film recorded as Super Hit at the box office. Brahmanandam, AVS and Kota Srinivasa Rao's comedy is excellent and very popular in this film. Plot Krishna Mohan (Murali Mohan) is a widower and he has a daughter Ramya. He wants to marry Kavita for Ramya because she needs a mother. Their servants talk with each other that no one loves step-children and believing them, she starts hating Kavita. But Kavita is good at heart. Later she gives birth to a baby girl Ooha. Ramya hates Ooha also. Ramya wants to own what Ooha likes. They have grown up. Ooha (Ooha) is a fan of Surya (Jagapati Babu), who writes stories for Jabilli magazine, owned by Nageshwara Rao (Brahmanandam). She loves Surya and writes letters to him. Surya is impressed by her letters and loves her. He gets her address and goes to her house. He mistakes Ramya (Ramya Krishna) for Ooha. Ramya also falls for Surya. He talks over the phone with Gummadi that he will come to their house for the marriage proposal with his granddaughter. He thinks it is Ooha and tells her. Surya comes to their house and both Gummadi and Ooha are shocked to know that he wants to marry Ramya. Mysore Jackson (Kota Srinivasa Rao) and Visweswara Rao are photographers. They tell Ramya that they will make her an actress. Ramya happily agrees for that. Surya reluctantly accepts that. She becomes a cover girl in the process. On the day of Surya and Ramya's marriage, Mysore Jackson and Visweswara Rao come to marriage and tell her that she will not become a popular actress if she marries. She writes a letter addressing Surya to wait for a few years for marriage and puts the letter in her room and goes with them. Surya reads the letter and marries Ooha in order to protect his and Krishna Mohan's fame, for which Ooha reluctantly accepts. Ramya becomes an actress. Ooha does not let Surya touch her. Later she sees the letter which she has written to him in the past, framed on the wall and comes to know that he loves the one who wrote the letter i.e., Ooha. While she is saying that her parents and grandfather come there, Surya goes towards them without hearing her. Later she calls Surya and tells him to come home early i.e., she accepts for the first night. Before that, Ramya comes to Surya's house. She warns Ooha to leave Surya. Ooha also warns Ramya. Ramya says that they both want sex and to be married without waiting for her. Surya tells her to go away. She goes to her house and her father also tells her to go away. Later she meets with an accident and is admitted to the hospital. Surya takes her to his home to teach a lesson to Ramya and make Ooha aggressive. Surya moves intimately with Ramya in the process. Seeing this, Ooha becomes sad. Nageshwara Rao comes to Surya's house and tells Surya that his fans are threatening him because his stories are not being published those days. Surya starts a novel Aayanaki Iddaru (literally, he has two wives). He writes the event which happens in his home. Later Nageshawara Rao comes to Surya's house to know the climax. Surya tells him to wait and goes outside with Ramya. He takes her to a suicide spot and tells her that they can not live in the society and it is better to commit suicide. Ramya does not accept that and says that she does not love him. Nageshwara Rao discusses the climax with Ooha and he tells her that the hero should marry the lover instead of living with his wife for variety. Later he goes to his office. Ooha calls him and swallows sleeping pills and tells him the climax which he has told her. She tells that the climax has been given to Surya. Nageshwara Rao comes to know that she has swallowed sleeping pills and sends Rambabu (A.V.S.) to save her. Rambabu admits her to hospital. Her parents and grandfather go to the hospital. Later Surya and Ramya also go to the hospital. There, Krishna Mohan confronts Surya and asks why he cheated their daughters. Surya tells them why he did like that and tells them that he loves Ooha. Ramya changes at heart. Surya and Ooha are united.

Born into a theatrical family, he learnt his craft touring in melodramas, as a young man, but made his reputation as a comedian in musical comedy, music hall and, later, revue. Lester's gloomy stage persona was seen to its quintessential comic effect in the long-running musical The Arcadians (1909) in which he delivered optimistic lyrics in a lugubrious manner. Among his other hit shows were The New Aladdin (1906), Havana (1908) and The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). His co-stars included George Grossmith Jr., Phyllis Dare, George Robey and Violet Lorraine. Ill health brought Lester's career to a premature close, and he died of pneumonia at the age of fifty. Early life and career Lester was born in Nottingham, the son of the comedian Alfred Leslie and his wife, an actress whose stage name was Annie Ross.Parker, pp. 561‚Äì562 Lester made his theatrical debut at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, in the role of Little Willie Carlyle in East Lynne. He toured the provinces for several years playing in some comedies in roles such as Charles Middlewick in Our Boys, but the staples of the touring repertory were melodramas, including The Lights o' London, The Shaughraun and The Colleen Bawn.

Lester made an immediate impression with his monologue \\"The Sceneshifter\\", in which a gloomy stagehand gives his ideas for the improvement and brightening of Hamlet. He was booked for further monologues and sketches by Butt, and in 1906 he appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in London as the Lost Constable in George Grossmith Jr.'s musical The New Aladdin, in which the reviewer in The Times judged his performance the funniest thing in the show.\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 1 October 1906, p. 12 At the same theatre he played Nix, the bo'sun, in another musical Havana in 1908; again, his performance received critical praise as the best thing in the piece.\\"Gaiety Theatre\\", The Times, 27 April 1908, p. 9 Lester (right) with George Robey and Violet Lorraine in The Bing Boys Are Here (1916) The Arcadians in 1909 confirmed Lester's reputation as a leading West End performer. In a cast that included Phyllis Dare, Dan Rolyat and Florence Smithson, he was singled out by The Times, which found him \\"more hilariously melancholy than ever: the audience rocked to hear him sing that his motto was 'always merry and bright.'\\"\\"Shaftesbury Theatre\\", The Times, 29 April 1909, p. 10 In 1912 he played Vodka in The Grass Widows, and the following year was Byles in The Pearl Girl. Between runs in musical comedy he returned to his music hall monologues. Who's Who in the Theatre noted that Lester had \\"the unique distinction of being the only person who has been selected to appear at both the Royal Command Theatrical and Music Hall performances.\\" Bing Boys and later years In May 1915 Lester reprised his original role in a revival of The Arcadians, and among his most celebrated shows of the First World War years was a revue, The Bing Boys Are Here (1916) in which he and George Robey co-starred with Violet Lorraine. The Observer commented, \\"Nothing so funny in revue has ever been seen in London ‚Ä¶ the three together are almost too much to endure for three hours\\".\\"The Bing Boys Are Here\\", The Observer, 23 April 1916, p. 7 His later roles in musical comedy were Umpicof in Round the Map (1917), Hu-Du in Shanghai (1918), George in The Eclipse (1919) and Miggles in a revival of The Shop Girl (1920). He starred in four more revues: Pins and Needles (1921), Fun of the Fayre (1921), Rats (1923), and his final show, The Punch Bowl (1924). The Times considered the last, \\"with its brilliant changes of character in the various scenes, was technically perhaps better than anything he had ever done.\\" During the run of The Punch Bowl Lester was taken ill and had to leave the cast. Suffering from a chest complaint he was recommended to go to a warmer country, and spent some weeks in Morocco. Feeling considerably better he began the journey home by train, but he was taken ill again en route and died of pneumonia at a nursing home in Madrid.\\"Mr Alfred Lester\\", The Times, 7 May 1925, p. 16 Notes References 1874 births 1925 deaths English male musical theatre actors English male singers Music hall performers Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery Deaths from pneumonia 19th-century English singers 19th-century male singers ","title":"Alfred Lester"},{"id":"42989425","text":"Ole Edvard Borgen (8 November 1925 ‚Äì 24 March 2009) was a Norwegian theologian and Methodist bishop.

When variables of fluid density, depth, gravity, and other forces such as atmospheric pressure are charted, the resulting figure somewhat resembles a prism. Description Pressure variation along depth Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest ‚Äì for example, on the sides of a swimming pool, a glass of water or the bottom of the ocean. Its value at any given location within the fluid is the product of the fluid density (œÅ), the depth (d), and the forces applied by gravity (g) plus any background pressures, such as atmospheric pressure. Hydrostatic pressure on surfaces surrounding (or within) fluid volumes can be represented by the pressure prism, a useful visualization technique. Hydrostatic pressure (P) increases linearly with depth. Generally it can be expressed by the relationship below, where the pressure at the top is zero and at the bottom is œÅgH, H being the total depth of the fluid volume. P = œÅgd, where P is the gauge pressure above atmospheric pressure œÅ is the density of the fluid g is gravitational acceleration d is the target depth of the fluid Variation of pressure with depth is shown in the first Figure above. Further, the centre of pressure (COP) on the surrounding wall can be calculated by the following formula: HCOP = ‚à´px x dx / ‚à´px dx, where px is the pressure at x distance from the bottom With this formula we see the height of the COP for a plane surface is H/3 from the bottom, as shown in Figure 2 (left). With two fluids of differing density in a volume, the slope of the pressure prism will not be constant over the depth. See Figure 3 (right). The pressure prisms shown as examples pertain to situations where the surrounding surfaces are flat. Pressure prisms for fluid volumes with curved surfaces are more complex.

So, by our condition of irrotational flow, we have \\\\vec{v} = - abla\\\\phi And then using our continuity equation abla\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v} = 0, we can substitute our scalar potential back in to find Laplace's Equation for irrotational flow: Note that the laplace equation is a well studied linear partial differential equation. It has an infinite amount of solutions, however, we are able to discard most solutions to it when considering physical systems, as boundary conditions completely determine the velocity potential. Examples of common boundary conditions include the velocity of the fluid, determined by \\\\vec{v}= - abla\\\\phi, being 0 on the boundaries of the system. There is a great amount of overlap with electromagnetism when solving this equation in general, as the laplace equation also models the electrostatic potential in vacuum. There are many reasons to study Irrotational flow, among them; *Many real world problems contain large regions of Irrotational flow. *It can be studied analytically. *It shows us importance of Boundary layers and viscous forces. *It provides us tools for studying concepts of lift and drag.

Strange, 1970, pp. 56-60. Accessed 6 June 2014. She was the first female landscape architect in Victoria. Ina Higgins was the daughter of John and Anne (n√©e Bournes) Higgins. She was born in County Cork, Ireland, in 1860. She arrived in Melbourne, from Ireland, on the ship Eurynome on 12 February 1870 with her mother and four siblings. Both Ina and her younger sister, Anna, attended the Presbyterian Ladies' College and the University of Melbourne.http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/higgins-frances-georgina-ina-14248 Retrieved on 27 Jan 2015 A brother, Henry Bournes Higgins, was a Justice of the High Court of Australia. In 1897, Charles Bogue Luffman, the director of Burnley Horticultural College in Melbourne, welcomed women into his institution as students, an event that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of landscape architecture. Ina Higgins enrolled at Burnley in 1899 and later established herself as Victoria's first professional woman landscape architect, while maintaining a prominent role as a political activist. She assisted with the planting schemes for two new model towns in the Murrumbidgee district at the invitation of the New South Wales Commission of Irrigation, designed notable private gardens and was a vocal advocate for women's participation in the profession.http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0030b.htm The Encyclopedia of Women & Leadership in 20th Century Australia Retrieved on 27 Jan 2015 In 1891 a petition signed by approximately 30,000 women was presented to the Victorian parliament to urge the Government of the day to grant women the right to vote. Although that right was not won until 1908, the petition is an indication of the strength of the women's suffrage movement in Victoria. Ina Higgins signed the petition and, from 1894, was the honorary secretary of the United Council for Woman suffrage and sat on its executive committee from 1900. During the First World War, Ina Higgins, now in her fifties, was active in her profession of landscape gardening and also in political activity. In 1914, she was invited by the New South Wales Government Commission of Irrigation, to assist with the planting plans for the two new townships in the Murrumbidgee irrigation districts of New South Wales. In 1915 when a co- operative women's farm, The Women's Rural Industries Co. Ltd., was started at Mordialloc, Ina Higgins was involved. She was also a member of the Women's Political Association. From 1890 Ina lived at the family home, \\"Killenna,\\" Malvern. She never married and continued to live there until the time of her death on 26 October 1948.

It was founded in 2003 by a group of Turks and Turkish students living in Arizona, USA with the goal of introducing Turkish culture, history, arts and literature to Americans and help build connections between the two countries. After a year, they incorporated the organization in 2004. From their inception onwards, the organization received support from internationally recognized Turkish actress and director Seda Egridere who was among the founders of the organization and Turkish novelist Elif ≈ûafak who has been an official contributor from the beginning.  Foundation and history  Upon realizing the lack of information about their country and culture within the American public, in October 2003, a group of Turks and Turkish American students came together in Phoenix, Arizona and founded a non-profit organization which they chose to name Bosphorus Art Project, paying homage to their beloved city Istanbul, Turkey and hoping that the way Bosphorus Bridge connects east and west over Bosphorus, it would connect American and Turkish cultures together. At the time, a similar non-profit, the Moon and Stars Project in New York, USA, founded by Turks and Turkish Americans living in the east coast, was actively working towards introducing Turkish culture to Americans in the form of seminars, film days and art shows and the Turks and Turkish Americans of the west coast were inspired by their work. Bosphorus Art Project received substantial support from their east coast sister, The Moon and Stars Project, from their inception until 2006. One of the most prominent Turkish organizations in the States, Turkish Cultural Foundation also supported Bosphorus Art Project by approving grants for their cultural and promotional activities.  Activities  The first cultural activity organized by Bosphorus Art Project was the Turkish Film Festival, which they organized in 2004 with the support and help of Phoenix Film Festival. It was the first Turkish Film Festival in the west coast and took place between September 10‚Äì12, 2004. During the festival, selective films from internationally recognized Turkish director Zeki Demirkubuz' filmography were screened with the attendance of a large audience. The first festival proved to be a success and the Bosphorus Art Project decided to turn it into an annual event. Next year, the 2nd Annual Turkish Film Festival was hosted with the official sponsor Harkins Valley Art Theatre in Phoenix Arizona between October 14‚Äì16, 2005. The following year, in 2006, Bosphorus Art Project rose to critical acclaim in the west coast and became an official partner of Phoenix Film Festival with the goal to screen Turkish films every year within Phoenix Film Festival. In 2006, the 3rd Annual Turkish Film Festival took place between September 29-October 1, 2006. Bosphorus Art Project further received support from internationally recognized Turkish artists. Seda Egridere, a Turkish actress and filmmaker, was studying at Arizona State University at the time and became one of the founders, Elif ≈ûafak, a modern Turkish novelist, joined a book signing in Phoenix, Arizona to support the organization, the author of the bestseller Expat Harem Catherine Salter attended a book talk, and many established local Turkish bands gave concerts to introduce Turkish music to masses. With an attempt to bring together international artists, writers, filmmakers together, allow them to create art together and introduce them to American audiences, Bosphorus Art Project also publishes an online magazine of art and literature, Bosphorus Art Project Quarterly. The editors of Bosphorus Art Project Quarterly select a specific theme for each unique issue and accept worldwide submissions. The topics of the magazine cover a wide range from arts to literature and from theater to photography but always with the goal of building bridges among countries. Established authors including but not limited to Elif Shafak are among official contributors of the magazine and they submit excerpts from their literary works.

The first delving research was led by Albert Poirrier, who carried out the construction of the railway line and who had a keen interest in prehistory. A few years later, between 1867 and 1872, Dr. Guillaume Bailleau undertook new research. A third cave (today collapsed), was discovered in 1867 by Bailleau. Several thousand flint blades and mammoth tusks of over long were found. The last research, from 1951 to 1954 and in 1962, was led by Henri Delporte and revealed back blades of flint (named \\"couteaux de Ch√¢telperron\\"), burins, drills and scrapers. Most of the artifacts are today located at the British Museum and at the Philadelphia Museum. A few pieces are on display at the Moulins museum and at the Mus√©e d'Arch√©ologie Nationale at Saint-Germain- en-Laye. The display at Ch√¢telperron (Pr√©historama, located in the former railway station) has only reproductions for the time being. It is to the Grotte des F√©es that the Ch√¢telperronian era (‚Äì B.C.) owes its name.

After an apprenticeship with a touring company he was engaged by the impresarios George Edwardes and Robert Courtneidge to play comic roles in musical comedy. He also played in variety shows and, later in his career, in farce. Rolyat's greatest success was probably in the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in The Arcadians (1909), first in the West End of London and then in the British provinces. While playing the role on tour he suffered a severe accident that threatened to end his career. He recovered and worked on until the mid-1920s when ill-health forced him to retire. Early life and career Rolyat was born in Birmingham in the English Midlands, the son of Thomas Taylor, described in Who's Who in the Theatre as a \\"private gentleman\\".Parker, p. 790 Rolyat was educated at Queen's College, Birmingham. Jay Laurier (right) Carrie Moore and Dan Rolyat in Tom Jones (1907) He adopted the stage name of Dan Rolyat ‚Äì \\"Dan\\" in honour of Dan Leno and \\"Rolyat\\" because he thought \\"Taylor\\" more distinctive when spelled backwards than forwards.\\"Mr Dan Rolyat\\", The Manchester Guardian, 12 December 1927, p. 10 He made his stage debut at Coutts's Theatre, Birmingham, in 1896, and joined a touring company playing in From Scotland Yard and Sentenced for Life. He joined George Edwardes's company, and toured as Sammy Gigg in the musical comedy The Toreador (1901). He was a member of Fred Karno's company, playing Sergeant Lightning in The Dandy Thieves (1905) and then appeared in variety. He had established a reputation as a whimsically original comedian when he was cast for his first West End show in 1906 at the Apollo Theatre.\\"Dan Rolyat: Tragedy of a great laughter-maker\\", Derby Daily Telegraph, 10 December 1927, p. 8 This was The Dairymaids, by Paul Rubens and Arthur Wimperis.

That Christmas, he played the Baron in a pantomime version of Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. The Dairymaids had been produced by the impresario Robert Courtneidge, who engaged Rolyat to create the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in the long-running musical The Arcadians in 1909. Also for Courtneidge, Rolyat played Suki in The Mousm√© (1911). In 1912, while touring in The Arcadians, he fell from his horse in Act II and suffered such severe injuries to his back that there was some doubt whether he would ever be able to appear on stage again. He recovered after several months and toured as Prince Bogumil in Princess Caprice in 1913. Later years Returning to the West End in October 1914, Rolyat appeared as Simon Slinks in a revival of another musical, Miss Hook of Holland. For the rest of his career he performed in variety and musical comedy, and in 1922 he played in a non-musical farce, Nuts in May. In the mid-1920s his health gave way, and he had to retire from performing. He underwent surgery for oral cancer, but the operation was unsuccessful. An all-star benefit show was organised to raise money to support him. Rolyat was twice married. His first wife was the singer and actress Florence Smithson; the marriage was dissolved, and in 1915 he married the actress Constance Worth. He died at his home in Brixton, south London, at the age of fifty-five and was buried at Streatham Park Cemetery in London.Wilson, Scott.

It lies in the Archdiocese of Uppsala of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture V√§nge Church dates from the Middle Ages, and the oldest parts of the building date from the 13th century. It was successively expanded during the 14th and 15th centuries. The latest medieval additions - among them, the brick vaults inside the church - were probably funded by a local guild called the Guild of St. John the Baptist, that existed in V√§nge at the time. The church however derives much of its present-day appearance from a reconstruction and enlargement carried out in 1882-86, during which the church was re-made in Neo-Romanesque style both internally and externally. The reconstruction was carried out after the parish had been merged with neighbouring L√§by parish, and the new congregation needed a larger church. In 1935 an attempt to restore the interior to its medieval appearance was carried out. During this time, lime frescos from the 1480s by Albertus Pictor (c.1440‚Äìc.1507) were uncovered. The church has a baptismal font dating from the 12th century. The pulpit was added in 1935 and is adorned by three sculptures by Anton Lundberg. The altarpiece from 1935 was painted by Eva Bagge (1871-1964). West of the church lies the parsonage, which consists of a main building (built 1849-50) and two wings (18th century) as well as a well- preserved tithe barn. The former church school is also located nearby. All together, these buildings constitute an unusually well-preserved ensemble.

It is now part of the LVR Industrial Museum. Location Engelskirchen is midway between Cologne and Olpe, today served by the A4 autobahn. In 1840 it was a quiet village on the banks of the Agger (river), a tributary of the Sieg (river). In Bergisches Land it is 54 km south east of Barmen (Wuppertal). This put it in the heart of the North European Textile belt. History Friedrich Engels from Barmen, was the father of Friedrich Engels who worked with Karl Marx on a series of influential literary works in the fields of sociology and economics. Engels senior made a visit to Manchester in 1837 with the manufacturer Peter Albertus Ermen. On their return, they founded the company \\"Peter Ermen & Co\\", which was renamed \\"Ermen & Engels\\" on 1 August 1838.Michael Knieriem: Die Firma \\"Ermen & Engels\\" in Manchester und Engelskirchen im 19. Jahrhundert. p. 218. They planned to convert the Unterbarmen church into a cotton spinning mill, which would spin and double yarn.Thomas Schleper: Mit Engels ins Industriezeitalter, Von Wasserkraft, Fabrikarbeit und Baukunst. 2. unver√§nderte Auflage, Rheinland-Verlag, K√∂ln 1993, . The church was a two-story Fachwerkhaus, in the old Bergisches Land tradition, and by 1821 the town already had water-powered mills, warehouses and over 50 textile factories. Also in 1837 Engels acquired the former Schnabelsch Hammerwerk in Engelkirchen with the ensuing water-rights. This enabled him to use water from the River Agger to drive a water-wheel, at a point where it dropped over a waterfall. There were expansion possibilities. This land was less expensive, and being less developed than Barmen there was a pool of available labour. The company, with capital from Manchester was founded 1 July 1837, with its head office in Barmen where it remained until 1885.Thomas Schleper: Ermen & Engels in Engelskirchen, Industrialisierunge einer l√§ndlichen Region, Rheinland-Verlag, K√∂ln 1989, . Production started in 1844: in the 1970s all textile work had moved to Asia and closure occurred in 1979. The land was sold to a property company and the usual destruction took place. Before all had been destroyed it was protected as an important historical monument (Denkmalschutz). Alternative usage was sought, and reconfiguration occurred between 1993 and 1996.Thomas Schleper: Unter Spannung, Bei Ermen & Engels dem Strom auf der Spur. Rheinland-Verlag, K√∂ln 1996, . Power The first mill was powered by water using a waterwheel, and the power transmitted to the individual machines using leather belts and lineshafts. in 1854 the water wheels were replaced by water turbines and reserve steam boilers, which could deliver 130 hp, were installed two years later. In 1900 the turbines started to drive electric generators to power the machines, which had individual electrical motors. Three years later the turbines were providing electricity to the mill and to deliver electric street lighting to the town,Unter Spannung ‚Äì LVR-Industriemuseum Schauplatz Engelskirchen; retrieved, 24 October 2011 and in 1909 the new company turbines were generating 640 hp. In 1924 this had changed and the Elektrizit√§tswerk Engelskirchen was providing mains electricity to the whole town and to the factory from their steam turbines in the Kreiselektrizit√§tswerk in Dieringhausen. This became part of the Rheinisch- Westf√§lischen Elektrizit√§tswerk in 1935. Industrial museum The museum is an integral part of the restored site. It is one of the sites of the LVR Industrial Museum. It is an important site to show the early generation of electricity, as well as demonstrating the cotton heritage.

It was to Victoria Mill, in the Weaste neighborhood of Salford that Friedrich Engels (the father) sent his son Friedrich in 1842. It was while working for the firm that Friedrich wrote his influential bookThe Condition of the Working Class in England.The Condition of the Working Class in England is contained in the Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 4 (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295‚Äì596. The book was written between September 1844 and March 1845 and printed in German in 1845 and in English in 1887. In the book, Engels gave way to his views on the \\"grim future of capitalism and the industrial age\\".Fox Hunter, Party Animal, Leftist Warrior by Dwight Garner, The New York Times, 18 August 2009Whitfield, Roy (1988) The Double Life of Friedrich Engels. In: Manchester Region History Review, vol. 2, no. 1, 1988 The Engels were a pietist, fiercely Calvinist family with solid beliefs in predestination and the rejection of forms of worldly pleasure. Hardwork and prayer were mantras: and they saw no contradictions in creating vast wealth while neighbours, their employees remained in poverty; as that was their destiny. From Rhineland farming stock, the family's prosperity began when Johann Casper Engels (1715-1787) arrived in Barmen and saw that the crystal clear lime free waters of the Wupper was idea for linen bleaching. He built up a mechanical lace production enterprise which he passed onto his sons. They were paternalistic employers, building houses, schools and a granary co-operative for his workers in Barmen. The second generation expanded the firm to include ribbon weaving. Johann Casper II became a town councillor and built the Barmen United Protestant Church. They were fabricants (merchant-manufacturers) representing everything Biedermeier. With the next generation, the family fragmented- the Engels & Sohne went to one brother, and Friedrich left to join the Ermen brothers to spin and double sewing cotton and trade in Manchester and Engelskirchen.

The congress is the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. 999 delegates represented the party's 750,000 members. The 2nd Central Committee, elected by the congress, reelected Kim Tu-bong as WPNK Chairman, and Kim Il- sung and Chu Yong-ha as deputy chairmen. Congress =1st session (27 March)= The 1st session was presided over by Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the 1st Central Committee, and Chu Yong-ha, a Deputy Chairman of the 1st Central Committee, and it lasted for two hours. The first order of business was to elect the officers of the congress; a 57-member executive committee, a 7-member credentials committee, a 9-member secretariat, and a 15-member committee responsible for drafting party documents. As in the previous congress, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was elected the congress' honorary chairman. A resolution extolling Stalin's achievements was adopted shortly afterwards. A 3-point agenda was approved by the delegates, and the rest of the time was spent on congratulatory messages from other mass organizations and parties (the most notable one being the one from the Workers' Party of South Korea, read out by Ho Chong-suk). In total 5,287 letters and 5,515 telegrams were received by the congress to congratulate it one it convening. =2nd‚Äì3rd sessions (28‚Äì29 March)= The 2nd session began with Kim Il-sung delivering the report on the work of the 1st Central Committee while in tandem talking about the international situation. The report praised the work of the Central Committee in the period since the 1st Congress, praising its work in introducing democratic reforms (while in tandem condemning the undemocratic situation in South Korea). In the last part of the report, Kim Il-sung told the congress delegates in the shortcoming in party works, and how they could be improved upon. However, what dominated the speech was Kim Il-sung's accusation that the domestic faction of the old Communist Party of Korea (CPK) were involved in factionalism and anti-party activities. The majority of the domestic communists (those who stayed behind during Japanese rule over Korea) were in large parts opposed to the establishment of the WPNK and the dissolution of the CPK into two halves; one Northern and one Southern. Kim Il- sung claimed that the domestic communists had breached party protocol, even if the majority in the party supported the establishment of the WPNK and the WPSK. O Ki-sop, Hyon Chun-hyok's successor as informal head of the domestic faction, received most of the blame, and was forced to defend himself at the congress. Others who were accused of factionalism were Chong Tal-hyon, Choe Yong-dal, Yi Sun-gun, Chang Si-u and Chang Sun-myong. The majority of those who stood accused were high-standing officials, for instance Chong Yong-dal had served as head of the Justice Bureau, Yi Sun-gun as head of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and Chang Si-u as head of the Commerce Bureau for instance. After Kim Il-sung's opening criticism, several Soviet-Koreans continued the attack, with Han Il-mu accusing O Ki-sop of \\"individual heroism\\", Chong Tal-hyon of factionalism, claiming that Choe Yong-dal and Yi Chu-ha were conspiring against the central party leadership and Cho Chung-hwa of embezzlement, and demanding that all of them recant their errors to the congress. Soviet-Korean Kim Yol accused O Ki-sop and Chong Tal-hyon for the opposition to creating an independent communist party in the North, while simultaneously taking orders from the CPK central leadership. He claimed that the two failed to understand the new and favourable conditions which existed in the Northern half for communism, and claimed that they were acting as semifeudal petty bourgeois. Kim Yol went on to accuse Chang Sun-myong in the latter half of his speech, charging that he had failed to perform his duty as a member of the 1st Central Inspection Commission. By this stage, the Soviet- Koreans were contributing to consolidating the position of Kim Il-sung in the party hierarchy; during the struggle between Kim Il-sung and his allies against the domestic faction, the Yanan faction remained neutral. Because of the pressure asserted on him, O Ki-sop went on to \\"admit\\" his mistakes to the congress. He acknowledged that he had not taken in the criticism given to him by Kim Il-sung at the 4th Plenary Session of the North Korean Bureau (held in February 1946); his apology to Kim Il-sung in 1946 was formalistic, and he had in reality been committing double-dealing ever since. Despite this, he claimed that Pak Chang-ok's criticism of him was unjust, stating that as Head of the Labour Bureau he had become obsessed with increasing the powers of the working class in a socialist state through trade unionism. O Ki-sop criticized Kim Yo's criticism of him, claiming they were factual inaccurate. Chang Si-u and Yi Sun-gun apologized to the congress, similar to O Ki-sop, but in contrast to him they accepted the criticism, and pledged their loyalty to the Kim Il- sung's leadership. Choe Yong-dal admitted to mistakes, but claimed that the accusation that he had been participating in factionalism and creating independent power centres from the central party leadership was utterly false. With the accused having apologies the delegates took a 10-minute break. When the meeting resumed, Ho Ka-i (a Soviet Korean) delivered a \\"stunning speech\\" in which he harshly criticized all the apologies (focusing most of his speech on O Ki-sop's and Choe Yong-dal's apologies), claiming they were defending their own personal dignity at the expense of the party's image. Cho Yong-ha, a domestic communist, defended O Ki-sop, claiming his stance on the trade unions was a phenomenon of the transitional stage in which North Korean society was undergoing. In the second round of apologies, Chong Tal-hyon accepted all the accusations without \\"defense or rebuttal\\". However, Chang Sun-myong went even further, accepting all the accusations and admitting for mistakes he had been accused of. Kim Il-sung delivered his concluding remarks when the discussions had ended. He criticized by name O Ki-sop, Choe Yong-dal and Chong Tal-hyon, claiming that there \\"was no substance to the self-criticisms\\" they delivered. O Ki-sop was the centre of much of the criticism, with Kim Il-sung charging that O Ki-sop's idea of trade unionism had been plagiarized from the works of Vladimir Lenin focusing on the New Economic Policy. He went on to criticize his character, claiming he \\"was pretentious and arrogant\\", and had opposed the works of the North Korean Bureau for no other reason then that he was not elected its chairman. Kim Il-sung asserted that Choe Tal-hyon's opposition of the North Korean Bureau was also of a personal character, and criticized Choe Yong-dal of courting \\"former Japanese collaborators [those who had been imprisoned by the Japanese during the occupation]\\". He ended his speech by claiming that playing the workers' parties of North and South Korea against each other were a dangerous game, since the two parties would eventually become one. =4th session (30 March)= In his first confrontation with his rivals, Kim Il-sung managed to get the Soviet-Koreans to attack the domestic faction. The majority of cadres belonging to the domestic cadres still felt affinity with the party in Seoul and did not support Kim Il-sung's leadership. Cadres belonging to the Yanan faction did not speak out during the congress; with leading figures such as Kim Tu-bong and Choe Chang-ik remaining silent. O Ki-sop tried to get them involved, accusing Mu Chong of \\"individual heroism\\", but Mu Chong did not reply and Kim Il-sung condemned O Ki-sop for dragging Mu Chong into a discussion about himself. However, the fact is that it wasn't much the domestic faction could do to weaken Kim Il-sung's authority since he was supported by the Soviets, making him to a certain extent unremovable. At this congress, Kim Il-sung and his allies purged all those WPNK members who had collaborated with the Japanese in one way or another during the occupation‚Äîthe majority of those who had belonged to the domestic faction since the other factions were headquartered abroad during the occupation. On Ho Ka-i's suggestion, an 11-member committee (composed of five members of the Political Committee and six provincial chairmen) created a list of nominees for the 2nd Central Committee. With the work done, Kim Il-sung presented 63 nominees for full membership, and 20 for candidate membership. According to Kim Il-sung, the committee chose nominees based on four grounds; if they were outstanding cadres, what position in the government, socialist military or party apparatuses they held, if they were new cadres and at last, former reprimanded communists who were concluded to be \\"basically good communists.\\" In the order of ranking given to them the nominees stated their personal history to the congress before they were elected; all the nominees for full membership, with the exception of O Ki-sop, were elected unanimously. Of the 990 delegates present, five voted against his candidacy. Similarly, when electing the nominees for candidate membership, only Kim Tu-yong was not elected unanimously, with one vote against. A seven-member Central Auditing Commission was elected unanimously by the congress. The 2nd Central Committee was composed in total of 63 new members, 30 of which had served in the 1st Central Committee. Among those not reelected were Choe Yong-dal and Chong Tal- hyon. The position of the partisan faction was strengthened at this congress, with Kang Kon, Kim Kwang-hyop, Kim Kyong-sok and Pak Chum-kol being elected to the Central Committee. Despite this, the largest single group within the 2nd Central Committee were the domestic faction. 1st plenum of the 2nd Central Committee The 1st Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee convened after the 2nd Congress on 30 March. It followed procedure, and elected the 1st Political Committee (composed of seven members), of which the party's Chairman and two deputy chairmen had to serve in. Kim To-bong was reelected to the chairmanship, while Kim Il-sung and Chu Yong-ha were reelected deputy chairmen. All the members of the 1st Political Committee were reelected (the other two being Ho Ka-i and Choi Chang-ik), while two new were added; Kim Chaek, a partisan, and Pak Il-u from the Yanan faction.

He anchored the very first broadcast of the station from Norway to Nigeria on June 12, 1996. Encouraged to take part in nation building by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, Noah returned from exile in 2000. Career Noah has over 30 years‚Äô experience in virtually all aspects of the media. These include broadcasting (TV and radio), journalism (electronic and print), publishing, advertising, marketing and public relations. He accumulated this experience within and outside Nigeria. His first job in the media started with Insight Communications Limited, a major marketing communications group in the West African sub region.

In August 2011, the governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, appointed him as the managing director of Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) where he served between 2011 and 2015. The appointment heralded Noah's second stint in the public sector the first being the Greater London Council in the UK. Achievements and awards Building on the achievements of his predecessors, Noah accomplished several initiatives at LASAA, including making it the first institution in the country to introduce Skype as a customer service platform, implementing Africa's first water projection advertising in Lagos, part implementation of directional street signs and the House numbering project, audience measurement research for outdoor advertisers, spearheading collaboration with other outdoor advertising regulatory bodies and stakeholders. In 2014 Noah led the team that organized what turned out to be one of Africa's biggest outdoor advertising conference and exhibition and attracted key industry stakeholders including the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria, the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria, the Advertisers Association of Nigeria, the Media Independent Practitioners Association of Nigeria, and the Experiential Marketers Association of Nigeria and the Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria. In addition, outdoor regulatory agencies from Ondo, Kano, Ogun, Edo, Cross River and Kwara states took part. Similarly, LASAA's counterparts from Cameroon and Kenya were in attendance. The managing director of LASAA, George Noah, said it was a deliberate decision to invite students of Mass Communication in all higher institutions in the country for the conference. Our objective is to raise the profile of outdoor advertising right from the university. In all, over 500 delegates attended the outdoor conference and about 5,000 attended the exhibition. Perhaps the most significant of Noah's achievements at LASAA is the successful hosting of three editions of the Lagos Countdown.

Albe-Fessard (; 31 May 1916 ‚Äì 7 May 2003) was a French neuroscientist best known for her basic research into the central nervous system pain pathways, clarifying the distinction between lateral and medial thalamic pain processing. She graduated with a degree in engineering from the School of Physique et Chimie de Paris in 1937 and received a Doctor √©s Sciences degree from Paris University in 1950. She was a Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honour and an Officer of the Order of Merit. Early on, Albe- Fessard studied the electrical activity of electric fish. Her work on microelectrode recordings of a cat's cerebral cortex in the 1950s was one of the first intracellular recordings of a mammalian brain. She was the first president of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) between 1975‚Äì1978.  Education and early life  Denise Albe-Fessard was born in Paris, France during the First World War to parents from farmer and artisan backgrounds. Her father was a railway engineer who aided in the construction of tracks that carried soldiers and ammunition to the front lines. She was the youngest child out of four and had the opportunity to receive the same education as her two brothers since it was more acceptable in Paris than the provinces her family originated from. At the age of 10, she passed a competitive scholarship examination in her state primary school and received a free secondary education. She proceeded to study an engineering degree at ESPCI Paris, specializing in physics under the advice of her brother not to pursue medicine due to issues women in the field faced.  Career and research  After graduating ESPCI Paris in 1937, she struggled to find work as a female physicist and joined Rh√¥ne-Poulenc as a chemist. After a month, she quit and joined the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) as a technical assistant along with Daniel Auger, a plant electrophysiologist. Working with amplifiers to measure electrical potentials of Nitella introduced Madame Albe-Fessard to the limitations of recording bio-electric phenomena. During her work with Daniel Auger, she met Alfred Fessard, whom she'd marry in 1942.

It is located on the main road between Uppsala and Sala, and is the rural church closest to Uppsala city. History and architecture Although L√§by Church certainly dates from the Middle Ages, its history is not known in any detail. Its origins may have been a Romanesque church, and according to some sources the oldest part of the church are from the 13th century. The church has furthermore been partially reconstructed and expanded at later times, but as to the question of what was built when there seems to be no consensus. The tower roof lantern at least seems to have been built at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1890 the parish was merged with neighbouring V√§nge parish, and the congregation moved to V√§nge Church. L√§by Church was abandoned and left in ruin. In the 1920s however the congregation decided to move back to its old church, and reconstruction works in the National Romantic style were begun under the leadership of architect Birger Jonzon. Archbishop Nathan S√∂derblom was involved in bringing the old church back to life. The restored church was opened again in 1928. Furnishings which had been removed were returned and the church received a new decorated ceiling. The church is one of the smallest in the diocese. It is a simple hall church with a medieval nave and sacristy. The construction material is fieldstone, and the roof is made of shake. Internally, the church is characterised by the undecorated walls, the flat ceiling and the curious pulpit, built in 1753 on top of a medieval altar and constructed by carpenter Magnus Granlund. The latter reflects a pietist tradition within Lutheranism that places the oral sermon in the centre of the life of the church. A triumphal cross from the 12th century originally from L√§by Church is currently on display at the Swedish History Museum.

It is generally used in experiments studying hunger, eating or digestion, and is a predominant method used in studying binge eating disorder. In animal research it often involves inserting a tube into either the oesophagus or stomach, that leaks out anything that has been swallowed. Animals who are sham fed in this manner eat and swallow almost continually without becoming satiated. Chewing gum can also be considered sham feeding, as whilst very-little or no nutrients are being absorbed into the body, the process of chewing still stimulates digestive system nerves which trigger the release of gastrointestinal hormones, and also increase the production of both saliva and pancreatic secretions. In human studies a process known as modified sham feeding (MSF) is typically used, which involves smelling, tasting and chewing food, then spitting it out when it would normally be swallowed.

(debark: from the French des meaning \\"from\\", and, barque, meaning \\"small ship\\"). Civilian The loading and unloading of cargo has traditionally been handled by stevedores, also known as longshoremen, wharfies, etc. Today, the vast majority of non-bulk cargo is transported in intermodal containers, which are loaded and unloaded using specialized cranes. People normally board and depart a ship via a gangplank (gangway), a movable structure usually consisting of a ramp with stairs and railings. The gangplank may lead to either a dock or a small boat (or lighter) that connects to the shore. Accidents during disembarkation are most often due to being struck by a rope (line), railing or other item due to the ship's motion, or attempting to avoid such items. The second most common cause is slipping or tripping on the gangway. Military Military debarking procedures, even in non-combat zones, can be quite complex. In addition to routine operations, debarking can be conducted under fire as part of amphibious assaults, such as that of the Normandy landings during World War II. In such cases, it is vital that cargo be loaded so it can be unloaded in the order needed, rather than simply to maximize the use of space. This is called combat loading. Landing craft are used to transport both troops and cargo to the shore.The United States Service Magazine - Volume 2 1864 - Page 538 \\"The actual disembarkation is a matter of difficulty and labor under all circumstances, but in presence of the enemy it becomes one of extreme delicacy.

Letitia Landon included a memorandum on this poet in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835 together with an example of his work: The Boatmen's Song to Ganga. The memorandum is as follows: > THIS young Indian poet is a remarkable instance of the mind‚Äôs inherent bent > developing itself under the most adverse circumstances. It is curious in all > its history to observe, that poetry is a flower which is born and flourishes > on what would seem its most ungenial soil. Certainly our English verse is > the last accomplishment we should have expected in the youthful Hindoo. > Kasiprasad Ghosh is of high Braminical extraction, and of independent > fortune. At the age of fourteen he was sent to the Anglo-Indian College, > where he made rapid progress. He soon shewed a marked predilection for our > literature; indeed, he himself says, ‚ÄúI have composed many songs in > Bengalee, but the greater portion of my writing is in English, ‚Äî and, > indeed, have always found it easiest to express my sentiments in that > language.‚Äù An essay that he wrote at a very early period, on Mr. Mills‚Äô > History of India, attracted much attention ; and, since then, he has > published a volume of poems called ‚ÄúThe Shair,‚Äù the Indian word for > Minstrel.

Two dimensional sources and sinks =Line/point source= A line source is a line from which fluid appears and flows away on planes perpendicular to the line. When we consider 2-D flows on the perpendicular plane, a line source appears as a point source. By symmetry, we can assume that the fluid flows radially outward from the source. The strength of a source can be given by the volume flow rate Q that it generates. Streamlines of flow generated by line source coincident with Z-axis =Line/point sink= Similar to a line source, a line sink is a line which absorbs fluid flowing towards it, from planes perpendicular to it. When we consider 2-D flows on the perpendicular plane, it appears as a point sink. By symmetry, we assume the fluid flows radially inwards towards the source. The strength of a sink is given by the volume flow rate Q of the fluid it absorbs. Types of two-dimensional flows  =Uniform source flow= A radially symmetrical flow field directed outwards from a common point is called a source flow. The central common point is the line source described above. Fluid is supplied at a constant rate Q from the source. As the fluid flows outward, the area of flow increases. As a result, to satisfy continuity equation, the velocity decreases and the streamlines spread out. The velocity at all points at a given distance from the source is the same. Streamlines and potential lines for source flow The velocity of fluid flow can be given as - : \\\\bar{\\\\boldsymbol{v}}= v_r(r)\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}_r. We can derive the relation between flow rate and velocity of the flow. Consider a cylinder of unit height, coaxial with the source. The rate at which the source emits fluid should be equal to the rate at which fluid flows out of the surface of the cylinder. : \\\\int\\\\limits_S \\\\bar{\\\\boldsymbol{v}}\\\\cdot{d\\\\bar{\\\\boldsymbol{S}}} = 2\\\\pi r v_r(r)=Q, :\\\\therefore \\\\; \\\\; v_r(r)=\\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi r}. The stream function associated with source flow is ‚Äì :\\\\psi (r,\\\\theta)= \\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi} \\\\theta. The steady flow from a point source is irrotational, and can be derived from velocity potential. The velocity potential is given by ‚Äì :\\\\phi (r,\\\\theta)= \\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi} \\\\ln r. =Uniform sink flow= Sink flow is the opposite of source flow. The streamlines are radial, directed inwards to the line source. As we get closer to the sink, area of flow decreases. In order to satisfy the continuity equation, the streamlines get bunched closer and the velocity increases as we get closer to the source. As with source flow, the velocity at all points equidistant from the sink is equal. Fig 3 ‚Äì Streamlines and potential lines for sink flow The velocity of the flow around the sink can be given by ‚Äì :\\\\bar{\\\\boldsymbol{v}}= -v_r(r) \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}_r, :v_r(r)=\\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi r}. The stream function associated with sink flow is ‚Äì :\\\\psi (r,\\\\theta)= -\\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi} \\\\theta. The flow around a line sink is irrotational and can be derived from velocity potential. The velocity potential around a sink can be given by ‚Äì :\\\\phi (r,\\\\theta)= -\\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi} \\\\ln r. =Irrotational vortex= A vortex is a region where the fluid flows around an imaginary axis. For an irrotational vortex, the flow at every point is such that a small particle placed there undergoes pure translation and does not rotate. Velocity varies inversely with radius in this case. Velocity will tend to \\\\inf at r=0 that is the reason for center being a singular point. The velocity is mathematically expressed as ‚Äì :\\\\boldsymbol{v} = v_\\\\theta \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\\\theta, :v_\\\\theta=\\\\frac{K}{2\\\\pi r}. Since the fluid flows around an axis, :v_r = 0. The stream function for irrotational vortices is given by ‚Äì :\\\\psi=-\\\\frac{K}{2\\\\pi}\\\\ln r. While the velocity potential is expressed as ‚Äì :\\\\phi=-\\\\frac{K}{2\\\\pi}\\\\theta. For the closed curve enclosing origin, circulation (line integral of velocity field) \\\\Gamma = K and for any other closed curves, \\\\Gamma = 0 Fig 4 ‚Äì Streamlines and potential lines for an irrotational vortex =Doublet= A doublet can be thought of as a combination of a source and a sink of equal strengths kept at an infinitesimally small distance apart. Thus the streamlines can be seen to start and end at the same point. The strength of a doublet made by a source and sink of strength Q kept a distance ds is given by ‚Äì :\\\\Lambda = Q\\\\frac{ds}{2\\\\pi}. The velocity of fluid flow can be expressed as ‚Äì :\\\\boldsymbol{v} = v_r \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}_r + v_\\\\theta \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\\\theta, :v_r = -\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda}{r^2}\\\\cos\\\\theta, :v_\\\\theta = -\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda}{r^2}\\\\sin\\\\theta.

It is located on Prebend Street between Essex Road and the New North Road. The parish is bounded by Essex Road between the New North Road and Upper Street, Upper Street to The Angel, Islington, City Road to Wharf Road, Wharf Road to the Regent's Canal, and the Regent's Canal to the New North Road. History The Clothworkers' Company of the City of London built St James' Church, Islington to serve the surrounding Packington housing estate. The church was consecrated in 1875 and the surrounding estate had been built by around 1850. The land on which the church and the rest of the estate were built originally belonged to St Paul's Cathedral (hence St Paul's Street, Mary Street, Bishop's Street, Canon Street, Prebend Street and so on) but these 'prebends' were stripped from the cathedral at the time of the Reformation and were sold to the Clothworkers' Company, which shortly afterwards were bequeathed an additional 60 acres of land by Dame Ann Packington on her death in 1563 which had been used for archery practice. The church was endowed with a set of bells by Lady Burdett-Coutts. The full name for the church is St James' with St Peter and St Philip, Islington as the parish includes that of the former St Phillip's the Evangelist, Arlington Square, which was consecrated in 1857 but which was demolished in 1954 after a falling congregation made it redundant The Squares of Islington, Part II: Islington Parish, by Mary Cosh, Islington Archaeology & History Society, 1993 and that of St Peter which was located in Devonia Road but which was closed in 1981 St James' Church, Islington - A History, by Peter Baugh The church was built as the successor to the 16th century Lambe's Chapel, formerly St James in the Wall, in Monkswell Street in the City of London. Today the west wall of St James' Church, Islington contains a half figure of William Lambe, dated 1612, after whom Lambe's chapel was named. William Lambe acquired St James in the Wall, an ancient hermitage, on 30 March 1543,The London Encyclopaedia, edited by Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert became Master of the Company of Clothworkers in 1569 and in 1574 bequeathed the chapel to the Clothworkers' Company. The original Lambe's Chapel was pulled down in 1825, after which a new chapel was built, together with a number of almshouses, only to be finally demolished in 1872. The British Museum has a watercolour sketch dated 15 May 1851 of the same half figure of William Lambe from when it was located in the \\"Chapel of the Clothworkers' Almshouses, Cripplegate\\". The church was designed by the Clothworkers' Company's architect, F. W. Porter pp. 655-656, 'The buildings of England - London 4: north', Bridget Cherry & Nikolaus Pevsner. It is built in the style of 13th century French gothic, and Pevsner's architectural guide notes the \\"Good E[ast] window by Lavers & Baraud\\" at St James' Church, Islington, and that the window in the north chapel contains \\"four Flemish roundels, from Lambe's Chapel\\". On 14 December 2018 the church was used to film a short sequel to Four Weddings and a Funeral for Comic Relief which was aired on BBC Television in the UK on Red Nose Day, Friday 15 March 2019. The piece featured, amongst others, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Lily James and Kristin Scott-Thomas. On 16 December 2018 the church was visited by a 'mystery worshipper' from the Ship of Fools website who gave the church a broadly positive write-up/https://shipoffools.com/mystery- worshipper/st-james-islington-london, rating the sermon 8/10 and the likelihood of a making a return visit 7/10. Present day Today the Islington Proms organisation holds an annual series of mainly classical concerts exclusively at St James' Church, Islington. On Mondays the church provides a soup and sandwich lunch for members of the street community in its church hall. The church is in the Islington deanery in the archdeaconery of Hackney in the Stepney area of the Diocese of London. The congregation of St James' Church, Islington is extremely diverse, reflecting the community in which it is based. A part of the Church of England, the style of worship is 'modern catholic', with a balance of familiar and more contemporary hymns.

A. Maramis, was a politician involved in the struggle for Indonesian independence. He was a member of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence that drafted the Constitution. In the early stages of the Indonesian government, he served as both Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also served in several ambassadorships. Maramis was posthumously conferred the honorary title of National Hero of Indonesia in 2019. Early life and studies and practice in law Alexander Andries Maramis was born in Manado on 20 June 1897 to Andries Alexander Maramis and Charlotte Ticoalu.Sulistiyo (2012). Maramis' aunt was Maria Walanda Maramis, an Indonesian National Hero who sought to advance the circumstances of women in Indonesia at the beginning of the 20th century. Maramis attended the Dutch language elementary school (ELS or Europeesche Lagere School ()) in Manado.Nalenan (1981), p. 10. He then attended the Dutch secondary school (HBS or Hogere burgerschool ()) in Batavia (now Jakarta) where he met and became friends with Arnold Mononutu (also from Minahasa) and Achmad Subardjo.Idris (1982), p. 160.Nalenan (1981), p. 15. In 1919, Maramis left for the Netherlands where he studied law at Leiden University.Massier (2008), p. 139. During his time in Leiden, Maramis became involved with the association for Indonesian students in the Netherlands or Indische Vereeniging or Perhimpunan Indonesia. In 1924, he was elected as secretary of the organization.Nalenan (1981), p. 47. Maramis graduated with a law degree in 1924.Otterspeer (1989), p. 261. He then returned to Indonesia and began his career as a lawyer at the district court in Semarang in 1925.Lev (2000), p. 260.Parengkuan (1982), p. 42. A year later he moved to the district court in Palembang.Parengkuan (1982), p. 43. Preparing for Indonesian Independence Maramis (middle) behind Sukarno Maramis was appointed to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence or Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan (BPUPK) that was established on 1 March 1945. Maramis was part of a working committee consisting of nine members called the Panitia Sembilan. This committee formulated a constitutional preamble that sought to capture the main values of the ideological principles called Pancasila that was outlined by Sukarno in his speech on 1 June 1945.Elson (2009), p. 112. The preamble was called the Jakarta Charter or Piagam Jakarta. On 11 July 1945 during one of the BPUPK plenary meetings, Maramis was appointed to a commission to edit the Constitution (or Panitia Perancang Undang-Undang Dasar) before it was to be voted on by all members of the BPUPK.Massier (2008), p. 180. He would later be asked by President Suharto in 1976 to be part of a committee to provide an interpretation of Pancasila as its meaning was thought to have deviated at the time.Elson (2009), p. 123. Serving in the Indonesian Government Hatta I Cabinet members Maramis was appointed as Minister of Finance in the first Indonesian cabinet called the Presidential Cabinet on 26 September 1945. He replaced Samsi Sastrawidagda who was initially given the position when the cabinet was formed on 2 September 1945. Sastrawidagda resigned from the position after just two weeks due to his chronic illness.Anwar (2009), p. 115. Sastrawidagda was the first person to be appointed as the Indonesian Minister of Finance, but because of Sastrawidagda's very short time in office, Maramis could be considered, by de facto, as the first Indonesian Minister of Finance. As Minister of Finance, Maramis was instrumental in the development and printing of the first Indonesian currency notes or Oeang Republik Indonesia (ORI). It took a year before the notes were formally issued on 30 October 1946 to replace Japanese notes and notes circulated by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA).Anwar (2009), p. 116.Lindblad (2008), p. 62. These notes (Series 1) were in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 sen notes, plus ¬Ω, 1, 5, 10, and 100 rupiah notes. The notes include Maramis' signature as Minister of Finance or Menteri Keuangan. Maramis would serve again as Minister of Finance consecutively in the First Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet on 3 July 1947,Anderson (1972), p. 398. the Second Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet on 12 November 1947,Finch and Lev (1965), p. 12. and the First Hatta Cabinet on 29 January 1948.Aritorang and Steenbrink (2008), p. 192. During the Hatta administration on 19 December 1948, the Dutch started the military offensive called Operation Kraai or Agresi Militer Belanda II. Sukarno, Hatta, and other government officials in Yogyakarta were captured and exiled to Bangka Island. Maramis was in New Delhi, India at the time. He received a wire from Hatta before being captured with instructions to form a government-in-exile in India should Sjafruddin Prawiranegara not be able to form an emergency government in Sumatra.Pour (2010), p. 70. Prawiranegara was able to form the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Sjafruddin Emergency Cabinet in which Maramis was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. After Sukarno and Hatta were released, Prawiranegara returned control of the country to Hatta's cabinet on 13 July 1949 and Maramis returned to his position as Minister of Finance. Ambassadorships Between 1950 and 1960, Maramis represented Indonesia as ambassador to four countries: Finland, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, and West Germany. Prior to these appointments on August 1, 1949, he was appointed as a Special Ambassador who was responsible for overseeing Indonesian representatives abroad.Parengkuan (1982), p. 80. At that time, Indonesia had representative offices in Bangkok, Cairo, Canberra, Kabul, Karachi, London, Manila, New Delhi, Penang, Rangoon, Singapore, Washington, D. C., and at the United Nations (UN) office at Lake Success. Because his supervisory duties kept him abroad, he was included in the delegation of the Republic of Indonesia as an advisor to the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference that took place in The Hague.Parengkuan (1982), p. 83. On January 25, 1950, Maramis was appointed as the Indonesian Ambassador to the Philippines. He officially started the position on February 1, 1950.Parengkuan (1982), p. 83.Anwar (2009), p. 120. Maramis served as the Indonesian ambassador in Manila for three years. On 10 April 1953, Maramis was appointed as the Indonesian Ambassador to West Germany. He officially started the position on 1 May 1953.Parengkuan (1982), p. 86.Careers Institute (1953), p. 61. In early 1956, Maramis returned to Jakarta and served as Head of the Asia/Pacific Directorate at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He held this position for only a few months, because he was then given a new assignment as Indonesian Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1 October 1956.Parengkuan (1982), p. 86.Khrushchev (2007), p. 807. Two years later, Maramis was given the dual assignment as Indonesian Ambassador to Finland, but still based in Moscow.Parengkuan (1982), p. 86. After completing his service as ambassador to the Soviet Union and Finland, Maramis and his family settled in Switzerland.Parengkuan (1982), p. 89. When he was about to return to Indonesia in 1976, he was living in Lugano.Parengkuan (1982), p. 92. Family Maramis married Elizabeth Marie Diena Veldhoedt, whose father was Dutch and mother was from Bali. They did not have any children, but Elizabeth had a son from a prior marriage whom Maramis accepted and gave the name Lexy Maramis.Parengkuan (1982), p. 44. Maramis' father, Andries Alexander Maramis (the given names are swapped), was the older brother of Maria Walanda Maramis.Parengkuan (1982), p. 5. Death After almost 20 years living outside of Indonesia, Maramis expressed the desire to return to Indonesia. The Indonesian government arranged for his return and on 27 June 1976 he arrived in Jakarta.TEMPO (1977). Among the greeters at the airport were his old friends Achmad Subardjo and Arnold Mononutu, and also Rahmi Hatta (the wife of Mohammad Hatta).TEMPO (1976). In May 1977, he was hospitalized after suffering a celebral hemorrhage. Maramis died on 31 July 1977 at Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, just 13 months after returning to Indonesia.Joint Publications Research Service (1977), p. ii. He was laid in state in the Pancasila room at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then buried in the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery.TEMPO (1977). Honors Ratulangi A 100 Rupiah note with Maramis' signature on it The headquarters of the Indonesian Ministry of Finance is named after Maramis On 15 February 1961 Maramis received the Bintang Mahaputra Utama and on 5 October 1963 he received the Bintang Gerilya.TEMPO (1976).

He was born in 1929, studied History and German literature at Cluj University in the Transylvania area of Romania from 1960 until 1965; and obtained his Doctorate in Philosophy at the University of Cologne in 1984. For his many rich accomplishments he was awarded the Order of Merit of Germany in 2006. Since 1989 he is editor of the \\"Halbjahreschrift fur Sudosteuropaische Geschichte\\". His works bring a critical perspective to the rise of National Socialism among the ethnic Germans of south eastern Europe and the Balkans. His works are replete with detailed scholarship from primary sources.  Education  B√∂hm studied at the School on the Hill, graduated in 1952, then studied German and history at the University of Cluj (1960‚Äì1965). After emigrating to Germany, he studied political science, history and pedagogy at the University of Bochum (1971‚Äì1975) and at the University of Cologne, where he received his doctorate with the paper \\"Nazi Germany and the German Ethnic Group in Romania.\\"  Professional activity  B√∂hm lives in Dinklage, Germany, and has published numerous studies and books on the recent history of Romania. The central theme in the author's works is the Nazi period, the collaborationism of the German minority in Romania with Nazism and the enrolment of ethnic Germans in Waffen- SS. Dr. Johann B√∂hm has been publishing since 1989 the biannual journal \\"Halbjahresschrift f√ºr s√ºdosteurop√§ische Geschichte, Literatur und Politik\\" (Half-Yearly Publication of South Eastern European History, Literature and Politics), supported by William Totok, Dieter Schlesak, Klaus Popa and others. William Totok is in charge of the electronic edition of this magazine. \\"In addition to (...) awkward revelations, springing from a controversial start, B√∂hm offers the general public a comprehensive picture of the period 1933-1940\\", the note on August 5, 1999, the newspaper Rom√¢nia liberƒÉ in a review of a signed book by Johann B√∂hm. In a report on the awarding of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany to the historian, the newspaper Ziua of March 15, 2006 noted that \\"Johann B√∂hm's work is marked by two crucial moments that led him to deal with the history of the last century. He was born in Romania, where he lived the dictatorial system imposed on the German minority by the National Socialist Party, through the German Ethnic Group in Romania, and secondly, the post-war career of Nazi leaders in the Federal Republic of Germany. In all published works, the historian tried to find an answer to an obsessive question: to what extent was the situation of the German minority in Romania influenced by the evolution of the bad political processes in interwar and Nazi Germany.\\"  Works  Das Nationalsozialistische Deutschland und die Deutsche Volksgruppe in Rum√§nien 1936-1944, Peter Lang, Europ√§ischer Verlag der Wissenschaften, Frankfurt/M 1985, ; * Botsch.

During his manhunt he was regarded as the most wanted man in the history of Australian criminals. Early life David Everett was born in rural Tasmania in 1962 to a middle-class family and joined the Australian Army as an apprentice when he was aged 15. Military career =Australian Army= 1983 SASR Graduation Class Everett began his career as a mechanic fixing supply trucks and joined the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) at 18 where he spent three and a half years. He claimed the selection course was the hardest thing he had ever done in his life (including his prison sentence). However, because the Australian Army was not at war, he left for Burma and took great interest in the Karen people. =Karen National Liberation Army= After leaving the Army in 1986, Everett joined the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) in Burma as a mercenary, arms dealer and gun for hire using the alias \\"Steve\\". He used his skills to teach soldiers how to survive in combat, most notably instructing them in marksmanship and the planting of claymore anti-personnel mines. He told a correspondent \\"If I get sick of it I'll go and do a nine to five job\\". During his time in Burma in 1986 he went as far as meeting with General Bo Mya. In an interview with the Australian TV series A Current Affair words failed him when he tried to describe the atrocities committed against the Karen minority, but these atrocities inspired his cause. Return to Australia In 1987 he returned to Australia and married. Within the four years leading up to his crimes, Everett worked as a security guard, private investigator and owner-driver in a trucking business. In 1990 his wife, Amanda, gave birth to his first son Nicholas who was named after a Karen soldier he had fought with. By most accounts Everett was a devoted father and a hard-working husband. During those years he also spoke fervently of his wish to move to the US and work for the FBI or the CIA. Criminality Everett, 1991, at some stage during his pilot training. Realizing the funding of the Karen rebellion was too meagre, Everett took up pilot lessons so he could smuggle weapons back to Burma. To do this he needed money and turned to armed robbery involving former SASR comrade James Reynolds and another unknown accomplice who too was suspected by police to be ex-SASR. In 1991 in Perth, Western Australia, all three raided the home of a theatre manager and his pregnant wife of 6 months taking the couple at gun- point for three hours in order to open the safe to gain access to the funds. They stole the money but were later caught. Everett, however, was released on bail whilst Reynolds committed suicide in prison, the third accomplice escaped capture and remained unidentified. Afterwards he flew first to Cairns, and later to Magnetic Island off the North Queensland coast where he taught rappelling as part of a tour operation. Everett then fled when a police drug- raid took place by chance. He then returned to Western Australia and perpetrated two more robberies on two separate IGA shopping centres by surveying the owners, tracking them home and holding them hostage in two attempts to break into their safes, both of which were empty. Finally he went down to an explosives storage magazine in Baldivis, south of Perth, in order to get munitions for a gold robbery to pay for his mother's house that had been confiscated by the courts. In the process he set off one tonne of explosives in what is still the largest explosion in Australian criminal history that was audible from many miles away. =Prison sentence= Everett was caught in 1991 after the police were tipped off by an associate. While awaiting trial he faked his own abduction with a .22 automatic rifle he had buried in his backyard years earlier. He was recaptured 12 months later after a large police manhunt. =Release= Whilst in prison, Everett wrote his book and set his story straight in \\"Shadow Warrior\\". He used his time to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in international relations and journalism and in 1999 he graduated with Honours in Strategic Studies. Later life and death Everett was released in 2002 following ten and a half years in prison. He apparently maintained good relations with his children and married Australian Commonwealth government lawyer Darryl Wookey. He was diagnosed with suprabulbar palsy, the disease that killed his father. He died aged 51 on 13 May 2013 after a year long battle with cancer.

It was set up by Grant Shapps, Conservative Party Chairman, as a vehicle for organizing volunteers to campaign in the target 40/40 seats. The core leads of the team are Stella Kyriazis, Charles Spungin and the Party Chairman's Office. As of December 2014 there were approximately 40,000 volunteers who had joined the initiative. Background Prior to Team2015, volunteers were provided through the membership of the party. However, the Team2015 project was open to anyone who wishes to participate in campaigning, and being a Conservative Party member was not required. Team2015 was envisaged as a way of de-fragmenting the volunteer base of the Conservative Party, particularly those based in marginal seats, and to utilize the skills of these volunteers to the best of their ability. Also, the team encouraged many different ways to volunteer, including both frontline and background activities. Team2015 was set up in the spring of 2013 and ran up to the general election in 2015, in which the Conservatives gained an overall majority. Function The team operated on the following ideas: * Volunteer members of Team2015 did not have to be members of the Conservative Party * Personal contact * Analyzing peoples' skills and utilizing these to best campaigning practice * Offering different levels of rewards according to the degree of effort provided by the volunteer Reward scheme The team used a recognition scheme based on that successfully implemented for the London Olympics 2012 games, rewarding volunteers for the time and effort they put into the campaign. These rewards included a Team2015 badge, Team2015 certificate and a reception with the Party Chairman or a Government Minister. Top rewards included meeting the Prime Minister at a reception. Social media Team2015 utilised social networking platforms such as Facebook (Team2015Conservatives, and Twitter (@team2015). It enabled participants to access up-to-date information on news and events, as well as providing insights into the day-to-day lives of Team2015 volunteers with pictures and videos. Successes and failures The rationale for the usefulness of the team was initially derided, even within the Conservative Party. Although some campaigning activities were implemented during the May 2014 Local elections, it is widely believed that the activities of Team2015 volunteers were pivotal in winning the Newark by-election.

Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the jurisdiction. A related concept is constructive dismissal in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights. Forms of wrongful dismissal Being terminated for any of the items listed below may constitute wrongful termination: * Discrimination: The employer cannot terminate employment because the employee is a certain race, nationality, religion, sex, age, or (in some jurisdictions) sexual orientation. * Retaliation: An employer cannot fire an employee because the employee filed a claim of discrimination or is participating in an investigation for discrimination. In the US, this \\"retaliation\\" is forbidden under civil rights law. *Reporting a Violation of Law to Government Authorities: also known as a whistleblower law, an employee who falls under whistleblower protections may not lawfully be fired for reporting an employer's legal violation or for similar activity that is protected by the law. * Employee's refusal to commit an illegal act: An employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal. * Employer is not following the company's own termination procedures: In some cases, an employee handbook or company policy outlines a procedure that must be followed before an employee is terminated. If the employer fires an employee without following this procedure, depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction in which the termination occurs, the employee may have a claim for wrongful termination. The absence of a formal contract of employment does not preclude wrongful dismissal in jurisdictions in which a de facto contract is taken to exist by virtue of the employment relationship. Terms of such a contract may include obligations and rights outlined in an employee handbook. Many jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which that hear actions for wrongful dismissal. A proven wrongful dismissal will tend to lead to the award of one or both of the following remedies: *reinstatement of the dismissed employee; *monetary compensation for the wrongfully dismissed. Probationary employees One way to avoid potential liability for wrongful dismissal with newer employees is to institute an employment probation period after which a new employee is automatically terminated unless there is sufficient justification not to do so. The dismissed employee may still assert a claim, but proof will be more difficult, as the employer may have broad discretion with retaining such a temporary employee. United States In the United States, there is no single ‚Äúwrongful termination‚Äù law. Rather there are several state and federal laws and court decisions that define this concept. In all U.S. states except Montana, workers are considered by default to be at-will employees, meaning that they may be fired at any time without cause. Some employees have contracts of employment that limit their employers' ability to terminate them without cause. Other employees may be members of unions and benefit from a collective bargaining agreement that defines disciplinary proceedings and limits when an employee may be terminated. Employees who work for government agencies normally benefit from civil service protections that restrict termination. Those employees, if terminated, may attempt to bring wrongful termination claims under the terms of the contract or agreement, or civil service law. =Termination of at-will employment= Although at-will employees are protected from termination by civil rights laws and other laws that prohibit retaliatory termination, in the absence of a contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement, or civil service protections extended to government workers, they have few protections from being fired. In some situations an at-will employee may be able to claim wrongful termination. Three leading grounds for claiming wrongful termination are: #Implied contract: In some situations a court might find an implied contract of employment that restricts the employer's ability to terminate an employee without cause. For example, the terms of an employee manual may support an employee's claim that the employer must follow a defined disciplinary process prior to termination. #Public policy: In many states it is possible to argue that the employer's reasons for terminating an employee, although not in violation of a statute, violated the state's public policy such that a wrongful termination claim should be allowed. For example, a court might allow a claim by an employee who was fired for refusing to take an action that was in violation of the law, for reporting a violation of the law to an enforcement agency, or for otherwise exercising the employee's rights under the law. #Covenant of good faith and fair dealing: In what is in many senses an extension of public policy doctrine, some states allow an at-will employee to pursue a wrongful termination claim if the cause for the termination is deemed to reflect bad faith on the part of the employer. For example, a state might apply this doctrine to allow a claim against an employer that terminated an employee a week before that employee's pension benefits vested, for no reason other than to avoid paying the employee a pension. =Termination in violation of the law= In the United States, termination of employment is not legal if it is based on your membership in a group protected from discrimination by law. It is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee based upon factors including employee's race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, or age (over 40), pursuant to U.S. federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Many states also have civil rights laws that protect workers from discrimination. For example, those forms of discrimination are prohibited by the California‚Äôs Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). Many laws also prohibit termination, even of at-will employees. For example, whistleblower laws may protect an employee who reports a legal or safety violation by the employer to an appropriate oversight agency. Most states prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim, or making a wage complaint over unpaid wages. Canada In Canada, wrongful dismissal is generally about two things. Did your employer dismiss you fairly? And did they adequately compensate you when they terminated your employment? It boils down to whether the notice period, or pay in lieu was fair. When no written contract exist on how to end the employment relationship, the law implies that the relationship cannot end without \\"notice\\". Notice is advanced warning an employer must provide an employee that their employment will be terminated. It is measured in units of time. The employer has the option to provide one of two kinds of notice: # working notice, or # pay in lieu of notice If an adjudicator determines a dismissal was unjust, the employer may be ordered to reinstate the employee with or without compensation for lost wages, pay compensation for lost wages without reinstating the employee, or do anything that is equitable to remedy any consequences of the dismissal. = Working notice = Working notice is legal in Canada. Therefore, if the employee is provided a reasonable amount of working notice, the employer owes the employee no additional money. = Pay in lieu of notice = Pay in lieu of notice, sometimes referred to as termination pay, is the amount of money the employer must pay the employee if the employer seeks to immediately terminate the employee without working notice. There is a severance pay calculator based on common law \\"Bardal Factors\\" that predicts the amount of severance pay owed as determined by the court . = Notice is measured in two different ways: statutory notice and common law \\"reasonable notice\\". = Employees may be entitled to either statutory or reasonable notice, which ever is greater, but at the very minimum, must receive statutory notice. Provincial legislation such as Ontario's Employment Standards Act, delineates statutory notice by way of a formula. Reasonable notice, on the other hand, has no formula. The common law dictates how much reasonable notice an employee is entitled to. In this regard, the length of reasonable notice depends on a number of factors, best described by McRuer CJHC in the 1960 Ontario decision of Bardal v Globe & Mail: > There could be no catalogue laid down as to what was reasonable notice in > particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must be > decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the > character of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the > age of the servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard > to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant. As the so-called \\"Bardal Factors\\" feature in hundreds of cases, predictive modeling is now possible.Predictive Analytics: What are they? Notwithstanding the above, the courts are open to creative interpretations of reasonable notice. For example, if an employee was persuaded to leave a job to come to another (i.e. inducement), the courts may take that into account in calculating the employee‚Äôs length of service and thus drastically increase the notice period. The Supreme Court of Canada has significantly expanded the scope of wrongful dismissal in Canadian jurisprudence: :*Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd holds that extra damages will be recoverable when an employer handles a termination in circumstances that constitute bad faith; :* Honda Canada Inc v Keays incorporated Hadley v Baxendalewhere a breaching party is liable for all losses that the contracting parties should have foreseen, but is not liable for any losses that the breaching party could not have foreseen on the information available to him. into Canadian employment law, as well as holding that awards are not affected by the type of position an employee may have had; :* Seneca College v Bhadauria holds that human rights violations do not constitute independent actionable wrongs in wrongful dismissal cases, and they must be pursued through the separate schemes provided under human rights legislation. :* Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd provides that, where a jurisdiction provides a remedy for terminations arising from unjust dismissal, it cannot be displaced through severance packages (with connected releases) provided by an employer. An employer is entitled to dismiss an employee according to the terms of the employment contract. There are oral employment contracts, and written employment contracts, and combinations of oral and written employment contracts. In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behavior which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal. A wrongful dismissal will allow the employee to claim monetary damages in an amount that compensates the employee for the wages, commissions, bonuses, profit sharing and other such emoluments the employee would have earned or received during the lawful notice period, minus earnings from new employment obtained during the lawful notice period. In Canadian employment law, in those jurisdictions where a remedy for unjust dismissal is not available, it has long been the rule that reinstatement is not a remedy available to either the employer or the employeedamages must be paid instead. Although Canadian employment law provides some of the above remedies, each (provincial) jurisdiction may treat employment law differently. It is important to determine which jurisdiction the employment occurs in or is regulated by, then seek appropriate legal advice relevant to that jurisdiction and its particular employment laws.

There was communal tensions in the area after derogatory photographs of Shivaji and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray were uploaded to social media during which public buses were vandalized and arrests were made. The uploads were made through foreign proxy servers traced to sources in India. Home minister R R Patil said authorities know the identity of those that uploaded the offensive images and that Mohsin was innocent and died in the riots. Government of Maharashtra announced compensation to his family . Mohsin Mohammed Sadique Shaikh was an IT professional working as an IT manager in a private textile firm, he was attacked and killed while returning after prayer from Unnati Nagar. Police have made arrests including the leader of Hindu Rashtra Sena (HRS), a Hindutva group, for their alleged role in the incident. Dhananjay Jayram Desai, the founder president of Hindu Rashtra Sena (HRS), first came into prominence. Desai has denied that his outfit had anything to do with the murder and said, \\"We understand that circulating derogatory pictures is a cyber crime but the problem cannot be solved by killing innocent persons.\\". Before this, a 20-year-old Nikhil Tikone of Kasba Peth was target by both Muslim and Hindus during communal tensions. Rajya Sabha MP and Congress leader Hussain Dalwai on 1 July 2014 alleged that police officers investigating the Mohsin Shaikh murder case were trying to cover it up, and they should be dismissed for the failure to nab the masterminds of the crime. \\"The Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan assured us that government will make the investigation into this unfortunate incident a priority. We were also told that the organisation behind this ghastly act and the people involved in spreading communal disharmony will be taught a lesson,\\" he added. In March 2015 the Bombay high court denied bail to Hindu Rashtra Sena chief Dhananjay Desai maintaining that the prosecution had rightly submitted that Desai has taken advantage of poverty and unemployment in society and instigated such to satisfy his religious fanatic vendetta against a community. The judge noted most of the rioters were young men, one of them just 18. The High Court maintained that the statement of the witness showing that a plan had been hatched to attack members of a community as directed by Desai was sufficient to deny bail. Until 6 May 2017 the case was in the stage of framing of charges against all the 21 accused, at least 15 of whom are out on bail while Dhananjay Desai has spent almost three years in jail.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hrs- chief-seeks-bail-for-4-weeks/articleshow/58540414.cmsDhananjay Desai was granted bail on 17 January 2019.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/techie-murder-case- hindutva-leader-dhananjay-desai-walks-out-of-jail/articleshow/67918469.cms Referenceshttp://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pune-techie-murder-maharashtra- government-mulling-ban-on-hindu-rashtra-sena-578063 *http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/muslim-techie-beaten-to- death-in-pune-7-men-of-hindu-outfit-held/ *http://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/pune-techie-murder-maha-govt- mulling-ban-on-hindu-rashtra-sena/ *http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pune-techie-murder-A-communal- violence-case/articleshow/36228629.cms *http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pune-techie-murder-case-Another-man- was-attacked-by-same-gang-the-night-Mohsin-was-killed/articleshow/36118446.cms *http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pune-techie-s-murder-4-more-hindu- rashtra-sena-men-arrested/article1-1226319.aspx *http://www.firstpost.com/india/pune-techie-murder-who-is-bhai-chief-of-hindu- rashtra-sena-1558815.html *http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pune- techie-killed-sms-boasts-of-taking-down-first-wicket/article1-1226023.aspx *http://www.firstpost.com/india/attackers-referred-to-murdered-muslim-techie- as-first-wicket-1557263.html *http://twocircles.net/2016jun21/1466532729.html#.V-fEKoh97Z4 *http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/HC-grants-bail-to-accused-in- Mohsin-Shaikh-murder-case/articleshow/52859571.cms *http://www.firstpost.com/india/pune-muslim-youth-murder-is-the-bombay-hc- bail-to-accused-a-licence-to-kill-for-sake-of-religion-3207584.html Crime in Maharashtra 2014 crimes in India Persecution by Hindus Religiously motivated violence in India Anti-Muslim violence in India June 2014 events in Asia Murder in India 2014 murders in Asia 2010s murders in India ","title":"Pune techie murder case"},{"id":"42992130","text":"The is a large wooden stadium in ≈ådate, Akita, in the north of Japan.

He is a former commissioner for Information and Strategy in Lagos State between 1999 ‚Äì 2007 under the then Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. He got involved in active politics in Nigeria as the communication advisor and confidant of Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola  the winner of the annulled June 12 presidential election in Nigeria in 1993. In December 2014, Dele Alake resurfaced in national politics in Nigeria through its appointment as the director of Media and Communication of the Buhari Campaign Organisation to help Nigeria's former head of state, General Muhammadu Buhari to victory in the presidential election in Nigeria in February 2015.  Education  Alake had his primary education at Surulere Baptist Primary School, Surulere, in Lagos from 1961 to 1967. He later moved to Christ's School Ado Ekiti, where he earned the West African School Certificate. He obtained the General Certificate of Education in 1974 while pursuing his Higher School Certificate course at the Igbobi College, Yaba, Lagos, between 1973 and 1975. Later in 1975, he enrolled in the Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree programme in Political Science of the University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos and graduated in 1978. He later returned to the same university and obtained a master's degree in Mass Communications in 1981.  Journalism career  Alake began his journalism career when, as a fresh graduate, he served at the Ogun State Broadcasting Corporation (OGBC) for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme. After completing the one year national service as made compulsory by the Nigerian government, Alake secured an appointment at the Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation (LSBC) as Senior Sub-Editor in which capacity he served till 1980. He had served as Current Affairs Officer and Senior Current Affairs Officer. And was later made Principal Current Affairs Officer in 1983. Through his experience in broadcast media, Alake contributed to the establishment of Lagos Television (L TV 8), the sister station of his employers, the Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation. After a successful engagement in broadcast journalism, Alake moved into print media. In late 1985, he joined the Concord Press publishers of the Concord Group of Newspapers ‚Äì National Concord and Sunday Concord. as a writer and editor. A year after his employment, he became a columnist in the National Concord and served in that capacity until 1989. Later that year, he was appointed editor of Sunday Concord, a post he held till 1995. Before then he doubled as a columnist in the Sunday Concord. Later in 1995, he became editor of the National Concord, a post he retained till June 1999.  Politics  Alake was drawn into politics when he was made the Adviser on Information to his employer and mentor, late Bashorun M.K.O. Abiola (publisher of the Concord Group of Newspapers) to aid Abiola's presidential campaign and election in 1993. Even while he served as editor of Sunday Concord, Alake was in the thick of the electioneering campaign which paved the way for the eventual electoral victory of the business magnate, M.K.O. Abiola, in the controversial 12 June 1993 Presidential Election in Nigeria. in the wake of the arbitrary cancellation of the presidential election result, Alake was terrorised and tormented by the oppressive junta of Late General Sani Abacha for his candour and daring in pressing for the disannulment of the 12 June 1993 Presidential Election. Alake subsequently went into exile where he identified and joined forces with other patriots like Senator Bola Tinubu, Lt. Gen. Alani Akinrinade (Rtd.), Professor Bolaji Akinyemi, Chief John Oyegun and other chieftains of the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria, NADECO. From there, Alake kept up the grim battle for the restoration of democracy. He made a return to Nigeria in 1995 when the Concord Press was re-opened. In June 1999 Alake was named Special Adviser on Information and Strategy by the Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Tinubu. On 6 October 1999, Alake became the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy subsequent to the reversion of the former Bureau of Information and Strategy to ministerial status. He held this position and acquitted himself creditably till 2007. Before his appointment to lead the Lagos State Information machinery, the ministry was Ministry of Information, Sports and Culture. Alake on assumption of office sought and obtained the governor's approval to change the ministry of Information and Strategy, dispensing with culture and sports to make the ministry more relevant and dynamic to confront the challenges of modern Information management in an emergent democracy. Alake thus became the first Information and strategy commissioner in the annals of Nigeria. In 2010, Alake revealed his intention to contest the senatorial seat of Ekiti Central in Ekiti State. However his political aspiration was cut short by intra-party crisis which made him to quit the senatorial race. Recently Alake was wrongly featured in a news item in Nigeria in which it was reported that a traditional ruler had attempted to kill a certain Dele Alake. Following the confusion caused by the story, Dele Alake made a statement refuting the news story and asked all the news organisations that reported the story to publish a retraction.  Awards and associations  Alake is a former vice-president of the Nigerian Guild of editors. He belongs to several national, regional and international professional bodies such as the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), West African Union of Journalists. He has also received several honour and awards for his meritorious service in journalism. He was awarded the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) International Gold Award in 2000, Special Recognition Award, Radio Lagos and Public Service Award, ECHNONEWS amongst others. He was a former chairman Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation Chapel of the N.U.J and is currently a Fellow of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (E.N.G.E).

Founded in 2004 by Jeff Casazza at the age of 17 with a $1,000 loan, the label functioned as a small one-person bedroom operation in Brighton, until Casazza graduated Suffolk University in 2010. Known for working with undiscovered young bands from all over the world, RFC can be credited for helping launch the careers of Tigers Jaw, Modern Baseball, Title Fight, Citizen, Turnover, Pinegrove, Basement, Elvis Depressedly, and many more, as well as working with already notable acts like (Sandy) Alex G, Camp Cope, mewithoutYou, Teen Suicide, and Nothing. History =2004‚Äì2010= RFC was largely operated out of multiple apartments while Casazza attended Suffolk University. Releasing only 7\\" EPs and singles up until 2009, in 2010, the label released eight LPs, mostly from bourgeoning northeastern rock bands like Balance and Composure, Tigers Jaw, The Wonder Years, and Hostage Calm. The label started gaining traction quickly due to the rising DIY music scenes along the East Coast, most notably northeastern Pennsylvania, where Title Fight, Balance and Composure, Tigers Jaw, and other bands are from. =2011‚Äì2013= In 2011, the label moved into a downtown Back Bay apartment rented by Kevin Duquette, owner of Topshelf Records. At this time, the label officially hired its first employees, label manager Tom Chiari and high school friend Taylor Sullivan to handle mail- order. Later in the year, the label released Basement's debut LP I Wish I Could Stay Here, eventually hiring guitarist Alex Henery in 2012. Also in 2011, RFC released the Mixed Signals compilation consisting of exclusive material from RFC artists, as well as friends and affiliated acts, including songs from Balance and Composure, The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, The Menzingers, and Tigers Jaw. The album was sold in hundreds of stores across the country for $4.99. In 2012, RFC signed Citizen and Turnover, the first bands to officially sign 3 album deals with the label. The first release with the label for both bands was a split 7\\" EP that quickly became the label's fastest-selling release at the time. The label started a subscription vinyl singles series in 2013, consisting of split 7\\"s featuring Code Orange, Pity Sex, Adventures, Hostage Calm, The World Is a Beautiful Place, Tigers Jaw, and more. =2014‚Äìpresent= In 2014, RFC parted ways with distributors Revelation Records and Cobraside Distribution, signing a worldwide deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance, Warner Music Group's independent distribution arm. Later that year, RFC won \\"Record Label of the Year\\" from renowned Boston publication The Improper Bostonian. 2015 saw the release of Turnover's sophomore LP Peripheral Vision, which would go on to SoundScan over 100,000 copies. RFC launched Something In The Way Festival on December 14th, 2016, selling out all three rooms of Webster Hall in New York City, and the Royale in Boston. The festival featured artists and friends curated by the label, including Modern Baseball, Basement, Citizen, Turnover, mewithoutYou, Pinegrove, Nothing, Alex G, Elvis Depressedly, Teen Suicide, Nicole Dollanganger, Crying, Horse Jumper of Love, and Petal. Their YouTube channel, which features songs and videos from artists on their roster, has 112 thousand subscribers and 79 million views (as of September 9th, 2019).

Biography Robert Graham Bradley was born in Washington, D.C., on 26 September 1921. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 9 June 1939, and graduated on 19 June 1942. He completed instruction at the Atlantic Subordinate Command, Service Force, Norfolk, Va.

While steamed with Task Group 38.3 (part of Task Force 38) in Leyte Gulf off the east coast of Luzon, Philippines (24 October 1944), a Japanese plane, tentatively identified as a Yokosuka D4Y1 Type 2 [Judy], attacked the ship. Its bomb penetrated the flight, hangar, and main decks and exploded, igniting an inferno that swept across the hangar deck. Explosions rocked the carrier, but Bradley, the ship's assistant first lieutenant, led a repair party and battled the blaze on the second and third decks. Light cruisers and , and destroyers , , and , also fought the fire. The intense heat compelled Bradley and his men to abandon their efforts, and after verifying that no wounded men remained behind, he entered the water at 1005, rescued soon thereafter by . Their success in fighting the fire led many of the men to believe that if they could clear the smoke from Princeton's largely undamaged machinery spaces, they could raise steam and save the ship. Bradley thus valiantly returned to (1300) from ‚Äîwhich lay alongside Princeton's starboard quarter to play her hoses onto the flames and became temporarily wedged between two of the carrier's overhanging stacks. A submarine and air alert sounded 30 minutes later and and , the two closest ships, pulled away from Princeton to take their antisubmarine stations. The determined firefighting efforts had nearly controlled the fire, but it raged again during the ensuing lull. Following the alert, and closed and attempted to secure a line to .

In addition, a jeep (used to tow aircraft) fell from Princeton's flight deck, damaging Morrison's bridge. and scuttled . Bradley had repeatedly risked his life, entering the most dangerous areas below deck to ascertain the extent of the damage and to fight the fires blazing on board.

It is a re-imagining of the title characters from the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by Walt Disney Animation Studios, and their adventures prior to the introduction of Snow White. The first season consisted of 24 episodes. On December 2, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season. On April 25, 2016, Disney XD announced that the series was cancelled after two seasons. The show aired its final episode on November 5, 2016. Episodes Characters The 7D are a group of dwarves who protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats. They are the descendants of the dwarves that founded Jollywood. The members of the 7D are: * (voiced by Billy West) ‚Äì West describes Bashful as a sweet character who tries to catch up to the others. He also likes that Bashful has another side to him. * (voiced by Bill Farmer) ‚Äì Doc invents things, including the sky buckets transportation system for all of Jollywood. Farmer has been the voice of Goofy, and also Sleepy in other Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs projects. Farmer said that in making a new take on Doc, he pinches his voice and makes him a little scatterbrained. * (vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker) ‚Äì Dopey communicates with whistles, animal sounds, and visual gags. Baker said that portraying Dopey was easier and allows for more freedom because he uses only animal sounds and whistles. * (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) ‚Äì In portraying Grumpy, LaMarche drew inspiration from his friend who is a stockbroker, as well as parts of Danny DeVito's character Louie De Palma from Taxi and Jason Alexander's character George Costanza from Seinfeld. * (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì Richardson said that he drew inspiration from fellow voice actor Jim Cummings with a \\"country / New Orleans\\" voice where he is \\"always upbeat, always positive,\\" and as \\"if someone just handed him a beer.\\" Ruegger said that Richardson was the first one of the seven to be cast, and that his voice set the tone for casting the others. * (voiced by Stephen Stanton) ‚Äì In an interview with Variety, Scott Menville said that Stephen Stanton came up with over fifty different ways to snore. * (voiced by Scott Menville) =The Glooms= (voiced by Kelly Osbourne with a British Classy English Yorkshire accent) ‚Äì Hildy is a witch and Grim's wife. She speaks with a British Classy English Yorkshire accent. Hildy is Osbourne's first major voiceover role; Osbourne was asked after Disney had auditioned 300 girls. She said that she had not seen the character design, which was created before the auditions, until after she got the job. She describes Hildy as \\"bad with the best intentions\\" and calls her \\"my alter ego ‚Äì my Sasha Fierce\\". * (voiced by Jess Harnell) ‚Äì Grim is a warlock and Hildy's husband. Harnell describes him as \\"a bad-at-being-bad guy\\". Regarding his role as a Disney villain, he said that \\"there's a fine line ‚Äî especially in 7D, which is a broad comedy ‚Äî because you don't want to scare little kids\\". =Jollywood characters= (voiced by Leigh-Allyn Baker) ‚Äì the ditzy ruler of Jollywood. * (voiced by Paul Rugg)‚Äì Queen Delightful's personal assistant. In portraying Starchbottom, Rugg drew inspiration from Jerry Lewis, whom he and Ruegger both admire. =Recurring characters=Magic Mirror (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) ‚Äì The Magic Mirror serves Queen Delightful and resides in the castle's treasure room. *Crystal Ball (voiced by Jay Leno) ‚Äì The Crystal Ball is an artifact the Glooms use to spy on Queen Delightful. * (voiced by Bill Farmer) ‚Äì Sir Yipsalot is Queen Delightful's pet dog. His favorite treat is pickles. * (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) ‚Äì Squire Peckington is Queen Delightful's pet parrot who is seen perching in her crown. * (voiced by Leigh-Allyn Baker) ‚Äì Snazzy Shazam is a witch who was Hildy Gloom's rival in school. She frequently competes in the witch contests where Hildy feels like she needs to upstage her. * ‚Äì Peaches is a slow-moving warthog who pulls the Glooms' carriage. * (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) ‚Äì Grumpy's pet goat. In \\"Finders Keepers\\", Giselle develops a friendly rivalry with Peaches. In the episode \\"When Pigs Fly\\", it is revealed that Giselle's last name is Munchen. Production The 7D was placed into production in June 2012 for the Disney Junior channel with characters redesigned by Noah Z. Jones. In an interview with Indiewire, Gimeno said that the pilot episode was done in Flash, but the series was changed to traditional 2D which added production value as Flash was design heavy. The storyboards and pre-production were done at Disney. Animation was produced by Digital eMation in Korea and Toon City in the Philippines. Ruegger also said that the 2D is also better suited for the show's style. The theme song and many of the in- episode songs are done by Parry Gripp. He describes the song as \\"in kind of a punk rock style...It's pretty fast and has guitars and the tone of my voice is a bit nasal and aggressive. But the music in the show really varies.\\" In an interview with Geek Mom, Gripp said that he was asked to pitch song ideas for various Disney shows, and that The 7D clicked with his style. He estimates he wrote about 120 songs for the first season, although many are very short and their styles vary. Composer Keith Horn does the orchestration in the show. Entertainment journalist Jim Hill has noted that some have related the voice ensemble to Marvel's Avengers since it features actors who have voiced in popular cartoon shows. He also noted how many of the crew have worked on Animaniacs, including Tom Ruegger, Sherri Stoner, Paul Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Randy Rogel. Among the voice actors, LaMarche had voiced Brain, and Jess Harnell had voiced Wakko. Voice director Kelly Ward said \\"God forbid if anything were to happen when they were all in one place because the voice-over industry would be dealt a crippling blow.\\" The cast usually recorded in ensembles of two to four characters when possible, with Ruegger editing the timing afterwards for characters that recorded separately. Scott Menville, who voices Sneezy, said that the show takes place before Snow White was born so the Evil Queen from the film will not be there. He also said it is a contemporary take on the film as the characters are hip to the current generation and its pop culture references. Jevon Phillips of Hero Complex also placed the series 30 years or so before Snow White. Ruegger said that the show's demographic differed from his previous works with Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain; however, he was also encouraged by Disney Junior to expand the demographic to include parents. Broadcast The 7D debuted on July 7, 2014 on Disney XD, on the Disney Junior block on Disney Channel on December 26, and on the Disney Junior channel in 2015. In Canada, the series began broadcast on July 13 on Disney XD. It premiered on Disney Channel in Southeast Asia on September 7. In Australia, Disney XD began broadcasting the series on December 1. On December 2, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season, where Ruegger planned to make 39 half-hour episodes. The season premiered on Disney XD on January 23, 2016. The season is slated to have guest stars Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne to play Hildy's parents, Fran Drescher, Amy Sedaris, Jim Belushi, Jay Mohr, George Takei and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. On April 25, 2016, co-executive producer Mr. Warburton posted on his blog that the second season would be the series' final season and that the crew will be moving on to other projects. The series finale aired on November 5, 2016. Reception The 7D premiere broadcast ranked number 2 overall among Disney XD's animated original-series premieres for kids 2‚Äì11 and kids 6‚Äì11. Brian Lowry of Variety wrote poorly of the show, claiming that it has none of the charm of the source material, and that its plots \\"fall into a sort of No Kid's Land in terms of age groups\\". Rob Owen wrote in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the characters were blandly drawn, and that the show was just a chance to capitalize on the film. The 7D was selected by the Behind the Voice Actors staff for Best Vocal Ensemble in a New Television Series in 2015. Video games In June 2014, Disney Publishing Worldwide released \\"The 7D Mine Train\\", an endless-runner video game where the player chooses one of the redesigned 7D dwarfs as their game avatar to pilot a mine car through various levels of the mine, picking up gems. It is loosely associated with the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction at Walt Disney World which opened in May 2014. Disney also released an online game on their Disney XD website called \\"The 7D Dwarf Track Builder\\" where players can assemble a mine track or sky bucket course according to the dwarfs' specifications.

Background On 29 August 1745 a force of 300 Jacobite rebels marched on the Government held Ruthven Barracks. The barracks were under the command of Sergeant Terrance Molloy who had with him only 14 private soldiers. The Jacobites came to the gate of the barracks and demanded that Molloy surrender. Molloy was defiant and refused despite the Jacobites telling him that they would hang him and his men if he refused. The Jacobites then retreated some distance. The assault At nightfall around about 150 Jacobites returned and attacked the barracks. They set fire to the door gate but the defending soldiers managed to put it out. The man who started the fire was spotted and became an early victim. At about half past three in the morning the Jacobites withdrew. Sergeant Molloy then agreed to speak to two of the Jacobite leaders but he still refused terms of surrender. However, Molloy did agree to allow the Jacobites to remove their dead and wounded. The Jacobites had lost two men dead and several others wounded. The Government soldiers had only lost one man, who had been killed when he raised his head above the parapet, despite orders to keep his head down. Aftermath The Jacobites then left Ruthven but not without stealing many provisions from the residents of Ruthven Village. Sergeant Molloy was immediately promoted to the rank of lieutenant. On 10 February 1746, 300 Jacobites returned to attack Ruthven Barracks again and this time they had the advantage of having brought artillery with them.

As of 1997, many LGBT people live in Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge, and Royal Oak. Model D stated in 2007 that there are populations of gays and lesbians in some Detroit neighborhoods such as East English Village, Indian Village, Lafayette Park, and Woodbridge and that the concentration of gay bars in Detroit is \\"decentralized\\". History Before World War II, Downtown Detroit served as the center of the LGBT community. It later shifted to New Center. Around the 1970s the gay community in Detroit was centered in Palmer Park. Due to crime occurring around Palmer Park in the 1980s, the LGBT community moved to Ferndale. Wendy Case of Metro Times said \\"Ask three different people what happened to Palmer Park and you'll get three different answers. But all will eventually agree that crime is what dismantled Detroit's opportunity to have a gay renaissance akin to those of San Francisco and New York.\\" Craig Covey, who later became a member of the city council of Ferndale, said that most of the former gay residents of Palmer Park \\"tended to move up Woodward Avenue and they settled in Ferndale, Royal Oak and Birmingham depending on their economic abilities. The middle-class folks came to Ferndale and Pleasant Ridge, as I did.\\" Ferndale received the LGBT community because housing prices were higher in Royal Oak and typically LGBT communities move into lower priced neighborhoods which are then revitalized. A law against discriminating against homosexuals was enacted by the City of Ferndale. Covey first ran for a city council in the City of Ferndale in 1995. He won a city council seat in Ferndale in 1999 and later became Mayor of Ferndale. In 2003 the Farbman Group, a real estate company renovating loft apartments in the inner city, began targeting lesbians and gay men in an effort to get them to move into the complexes. Institutions LGBT Detroit (formerly KICK) is an organization that serves LGBT African-Americans. The Gay Liberation Front had a chapter in Detroit. Affirmations is a community center located in Ferndale. Affirmations is Michigan's largest LGBTQ community center and one of the 10 largest LGBTQ community centers in the country. The organization hosts a 15,000 square foot community space, art gallery, educational programming, health and wellness programming, cafe, youth center, and a resource desk. The Ruth Ellis Center is a non-profit organization located in Highland Park that provides short and long-term residential safe space and support services for runaway, homeless, and at-risk lesbian, gay, bi-attractional, transgender, and questioning youth. Many of the local universities, including Wayne State University, Eastern Michigan University, and University of Michigan, have on-campus LGBT resource centers. Equality Michigan (formerly the Triangle Foundation) is a statewide political advocacy organization located in Detroit working towards the LGBT community's social, cultural, political, and economic wellbeing. SAGE Metro Detroit (formerly the LGBT Older Adult Coalition established in 2010) was established in 2015 \\"to build awareness and promote change so that LGBT older adults may age with dignity and authenticity\\". The Detroit Regional LGBT Chamber of Commerce is located in Detroit and its mission is \\"to promote and empower our Metropolitan Detroit LGBT, allied business members, non-profit members, corporate partners and their employees through leadership, advocacy and education\\". Recreation Motor City Pride is held annually in Detroit. Ferndale Pride is held in Ferndale. Motor City Pride moved from Royal Oak to Ferndale in 2001, and it was held in Ferndale until 2011, when it moved to Detroit. Ferndale Pride was started that year. The \\"Hotter Than July!\\" annual LGBT festival, catering to black LGBT people, is held in the park Palmer Park in Detroit. In 1940s many gay men in Windsor, Ontario, went to Detroit as it had several gay bars, such as \\"Gay Paris\\". Some police officers in Windsor doing police work crossed the border and entered Detroit gay bars. Ruth Ellis, a black lesbian, held house parties at her residence, \\"The Spot\\". It became a socializing place for black lesbians and gay men, allowing them to avoid heterosexism and racism in their society. Ellis, who was featured in the documentary Living With Pride, was the oldest known black woman who identified as a lesbian until October 2001, when she died. She lived in Detroit until her death. Media The newspaper Between The Lines and the website PrideSource, published by Pride Source Media Group, LLC (PSMG), are headquartered in Livonia. The company opened in 1995. A collective named the Gay Liberator had formed itself from the Gay Community Center and the Detroit GLF; this collective published the Gay Liberator. An LGBT film festival, Reel Pride Michigan, ran from 2002 through 2008 in Royal Oak. Hotter Than July has hosted a film festival since 2008 as part of their annual festivities. The film festival continued through at least 2016. In 2017, a film festival for queer filmmakers, Trans Stellar Film Festival, was founded.

A thixotropic fluid is one that takes time to attain viscosity equilibrium when introduced to a step change in shear rate. When shearing in a thixotropic fluid exceeds a certain threshold, it results in a breakdown of the fluid's microstructure and the exhibition of a shear thinning property. Certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under static conditions will begin to thin and flow as they are shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. When stress ceases, they regress to their more viscous state after a passage of time. Some thixotropic fluids return to a gel state almost instantly, such as ketchup, and are called pseudoplastic fluids. Others, such as yogurt, take much longer and can become nearly solid. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming increasingly fluid when agitated. =Examples and Applications= Cytoplasm, synovial fluid (found in joints between some bones), and the ground substance in the human body are all thixotropic, as is semen.Hendrickson, T: \\"Massage for Orthopedic Conditions\\", page 9. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2003. Some varieties of honey (e.g.heather honey)can exhibit thixotropy under certain conditions. Some clays (including bentonite and montmorillonite) exhibit thixotropy, as do certain clay deposits found in caves (slow flowing underground streams tend to layer fine-grained sediment into mudbanks that initially appear dry and solid but then become moist and soupy when dug into or otherwise disturbed). Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Semi-solid casting processes such as thixomoulding use the thixotropic property of some alloys (mostly light metals, e.g. bismuth) to great advantage. Within certain temperature ranges and with appropriate preparation, these alloys can be injected into molds in a semi-solid state, resulting in a cast with less shrinkage and other superior properties than those cast in normal injection molding processes. Solder pastes used in electronics manufacturing printing processes are thixotropic. Many kinds of paints and inks (e.g. the plastisols used in silkscreen textile printing) exhibit thixotropic qualities. In many cases it is desirable for an ink or paint to flow sufficiently fast to form a uniform layer, but then resist further flow (which on vertical surfaces can result in sagging). Thixotropic inks that quickly regain a high viscosity are used in CMYK-type printing processes; this is necessary to protect the structure of the dots for accurate color reproduction. Thread-locking fluid is a thixotropic adhesive that cures anaerobically. Thixotropy has been proposed as a scientific explanation of blood liquefaction miracles such as that of Saint Januarius in Naples.Garlaschelli, Ramaccini, Della the swagg fights of air forces Sala, \\"The Blood of St. Januarius\\", Chemistry in Britain 30.2, (1994:123) Other examples of thixotropic fluids are gelatine, shortening, cream, xanthan gum solutions, aqueous iron oxide gels, pectin gels, hydrogenated castor oil, carbon black suspension in molten tire rubber, many floc suspensions, and many colloidal suspensions. Rheopectic fluids Basically the mirror of thixotropy, rheopectic fluids are an even rarer class of non-Newtonian fluids that exhibit a time-dependent increase in viscosity; they thicken or solidify when shaken or agitated. The longer they undergo a shearing force, the higher their viscosity becomes, as the microstructure of a rheopectic fluid builds under continuous shearing (possibly due to shear- induced crystallization). =Examples and Applications= Examples of rheopectic fluids include some gypsum pastes, printer inks, and lubricants. There is also aggressive ongoing research into rheopectic materials especially with regard to potential uses in shock absorption. In addition to obvious potential military applications, rheopectic padding and armor could offer significant advantages over alternative materials currently in use in a wide range of fields from sporting goods and athletic footwear to skydiving and automobile safety. Additional insights into rheopecty and the possible uses of rheopectic fluids can be gained through further research into the physics of hysteresis. thumbX Axis: Viscosity Y Axis: Shear Force See alsoFluid dynamics *Viscosity Notes ReferencesJ.

M√∫sicachilena.cl Biography =Early years= Waghorn studied at the Liceo de Aplicaci√≥n, a secondary school, where he was an active member of the choir. At age 12, he won a singing competition, representing his school on the television show \\"Hola Hola\\", hosted by Pablo Aguilera. In 1984, when he had not yet turned 18 and was a freshman studying law at the University of Valpara√≠so, he began composing his first songs. He participated in and won various festivals in the area, and also conducted several programs for the Valent√≠n Letelier Radio, where he interviewed many young musicians. Additionally, he was the opening act for Sol y Medianoche, Hugo Moraga, Rudy Wiedmaier, Eduardo Peralta and Payo Grondona, among others. =Transfer to southern Chile and trip to Argentina= In 1988, Waghorn moved from Vi√±a del Mar to live in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, working as a music teacher in several towns in the area: Santa Cruz, Peralillo, Poblaci√≥n and Ch√©pica. During that time, he composed such songs as Mu√±eco de Trapo, Si me hablaran las estrellas, Sobrevivo lentamente y Delia. In that year, he was in charge of two radio programs in Santa Cruz and Cauquenes, in the Maule Region. He also participated on the radio program Dimensi√≥n Latinoamericana at Valpara√≠so, hosted by Thelmo Aguilar. In the early 1990s, he traveled to Argentina, where his music was broadcast by various provinces. Back in Chile, from 1991 he started recording several demos, in order to release his first album on the market. However, the project was postponed. A similar situation occurred with Sello Alerce record company in 1998. Finally, he collected some of his best known songs and recorded them on his first official album, Mu√±eco de Trapo (Rag Doll). =Mu√±eco de Trapo= This album consists of 11 songs, all recorded at Santuario S√≥nico and mastered at Tarkus. Upon completion, Mu√±eco de Trapo immediately began to receive airplay in Santiago and various cities, starting in November 2010. In March 2011, Waghorn won second place in the Festival Virtual de la Voz (Virtual Voice Festival), held in Santiago, with his song \\"Mu√±eco de Trapo\\", the central theme of his self-titled album. In August 2011, his single \\"Sol\\" garnered more than 75,000 votes on the official website of Radio Uno, and his album was selected as \\"Album of the Day\\" by that radio station.

He was named head coach at Missouri State on March 21, 2018. Prior to coaching the Bears, he was the head coach at Tennessee State from 2014 through the 2018 season. Ford is a former basketball player, having played at Illinois State from 2002 to 2006. After not being selected in the 2006 NBA draft, the Tamms, Illinois native joined the Tennessee State Tigers coaching staff under head coach John Cooper. He has previously been with Wichita State and Illinois State through his coaching career, playing a key role in the teams' recruiting and overall success.  Playing career  Ford attended Egyptian Senior High School in Tamms, Illinois. He became one of the most dangerous high school guards in the area and broke the school record for points scored by the end of his final season. Ford was named First Team Class A All-State and a two-time conference player of the year. At the conclusion of his basketball years in high school, the shooting guard averaged 22 points per game. It was highly anticipated that he would bring his talent to the Illinois State Redbirds men's basketball team, choosing the school over other possibilities such as Evansville, Southern Illinois, and Southeast Missouri State. In his first season with Illinois State, Ford hardly made a significant impact on the team's backcourt scoring. He finished the season averaging 2.0 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 0.6 assists. Ford made eight starts in the entire year and scored his first points in his fourth collegiate appearance against Chattanooga. His sophomore year would be far less successful, with Ford playing just twenty games in the season. Similarly went the following season, but he scored double-digits in the team's postseason game against Creighton. In Ford's final season, he recorded over nine points eight times through the season and logged a career-high 16 points as a starting guard against Grambling State. By the end of his senior year, he ranked within the Missouri Valley Conference's Top 10 under the steals and blocks categories. Ford was also named the squad's defensive player of the year due to this success. Ford entered the 2006 NBA Draft, which turned unsuccessful after he was not selected by a single team at the conclusion of the event.  Coaching career  He began his career on the coaching staff at Winthrop, when he was named a graduate assistant. Under head coach Gregg Marshall, the team qualified for an NCAA Tournament berth. He continued holding the same position as he joined Wichita State with Marshall the next season. The Shockers continued to prevail and made another appearance in their postseason tournament. Ford's first year serving as an assistant coach was at Chipola College, where he led the Indians to an impressive 35‚Äì2 overall record and a third-place spot in the NJCAA National Tournament. The team also won its fifth consecutive FCCAA State Championship. His second team as an assistant coach was Tennessee State, where he helped John Cooper lead the team. The Tigers finished with a winning record and an exceptional performance against Murray State. Ford most notably helped in recruiting NBA player Robert Covington to his team roster. After Tennessee State, Ford returned to Wichita State to serve as an assistant coach under Gregg Marshall. This was his third time coaching alongside Marshall, who made the remark, \\"This is how much I think of Dana Ford. At age 26, this is the third time I have invited Dana to join my staff‚Ä¶he was first my graduate assistant at Winthrop, followed me to Wichita State, and then after sending him out into the world to Chipola, and to Tennessee State, where he has helped coach Cooper recruit a fine young group of players, I am inviting him back.\\" The Shockers finished the season and Ford was instrumental to their conference tournament victory and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Ford came back to Illinois State to become the team's assistant coach rather than a player. He was also named the recruiting coordinator to add on to his original coaching duties. Following his two seasons with his alma mater, Ford returned to Tennessee State for his first experience as a head coach. The position was secured after Travis Williams left the team following a 5‚Äì25 season. After going 5‚Äì26 in his inaugural season as head coach, Ford orchestrated the largest NCAA turnaround from 2014‚Äì15 to 2015‚Äì16 with a 15-win difference. In 2015‚Äì16, Ford was named the OVC Coach of the Year, led his team to 20 wins, and a berth in the CIT postseason tournament. He was also named the 2016 National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 19 Coach of the Year, CollegeInsiders.com's Ben Jobe Award Winner, and the BOXTOROW Coach of the Year.

Art√≠culo s√©ptimo de la Ley 4/1985, de 31 de mayo (BOLR n¬∫ 64, de 4 de junio) Its use is mandatory for official bodies and entities. It is considered, along with the coat of arms of La Rioja and La Rioja‚Äôs anthem, one of the ‚Äúsymbols of Riojan identity.‚Äù  History  = Plebiscite = Flag of the former Provincial Council of Logro√±o. It was not adopted officially, but was used institutionally. Once the provincial council declared its intent to take procedural steps towards regional autonomy, in June 1977 it opened a forum whereby the Riojan population could send its suggestions for the creation of a flag. The local newspapers -La Gaceta del Norte, among others- became interested in the idea and started a campaign from June to July 1977 to popularize the idea. Riojan politicians considered the proposal one of low priority or one that was premature. Of the 260 proposals that were received, eleven were pre-selected on the advice of the vexillologist Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent. On August 5, 1977, a general assembly was celebrated, and five of these eleven proposals were submitted for a popular vote. Between September 1 and 15, 1977, a plebiscite was carried out and directed by Felipe Abad Le√≥n, the official chronicler. Between 15,000 and 20,000 votes were submitted. Despite these efforts, the process went nowhere. Opinions and declarations that maintained that it was too early or too inappropriate to approve a flag won out; the process was stalled in part by the president of the provincial council, Julio Luis Fern√°ndez Sevilla. After this failed attempt, the question of adopting a flag was forgotten by politicians. = Popular movements = By the spring of 1977 the group of university students in Madrid known as the Colectivo Riojano had requested a flag design from the heraldic expert Jos√© Mar√≠a Oria de Rueda, who created various designs employing the five colors of the Riojan coat-of-arms: red, white, green, yellow, and blue. The designs were put to a vote in September 1977, and although a flag choice was not finalized by the vote, the process did popularize the issue, which became an issue for the general public rather than just for politicians. The design that did win was one of Oria de Rueda‚Äôs, but it was not officially adopted by the government. During the Week of La Rioja in Madrid (November 1977), organized by Colectivo Riojano, a flag was created, painted with a spray can with four colors: white positioned vertically and red, green, and yellow horizontally. Subsequently, in spring of 1978, the Colectivo Riojano also distributed some oval-shaped stickers with a four-colored design, which acquired its present form. In the same year, this flag began to appear in festivals in various towns, even though it lacked official sanction. It appeared, for example, in the revived street party of San Juan in Arnedo, where it appeared for the first time atop the Pe√±a Lubumbas. A major impetus for the flag‚Äôs adoption was its use during the celebration known as \\"I D√≠a de La Rioja\\", celebrated in N√°jera in October 1978. From that point on, various regional collectives adopted the flag for their use. In January 1979, some townspeople from Haro asked their mayor to fly the flag from the town hall, as other town halls already were flying it. The association \\"Amigos de La Rioja\\" sent a letter to the president of the provincial council asking that the flag fly from the Provincial Palace (Palacio de la Diputaci√≥n). The flag, already known by this time as the \\"cuatricolor\\", was flying from various corners of La Rioja and in many flag designs, the red colored part of the flag acquired a reddish color tone approaching that of the color of red wine. In May 1979, the flag flew from Mount Laturce during the celebrations of the \\"D√≠a de Clavijo\\". = Official sanction = Pressure from the public, as well as the support given by city councils across La Rioja, led to the flag being officially approved by the Riojan government. In August 1979, an inquiry on the flag was sent out to the city councils across the region, with the result that 115 approved of the flag, 51 abstained, and eight were against it. On August 14, 1979, a plenary meeting of the Provincial Council finally approved the flag, with 17 votes for the flag by the political parties UCD and PSOE, the abstention of the Coalici√≥n Democr√°tica (7 members). On September 15, at the festival of Our Lady of Valvanera the \\"cuatricolor\\" flew for the first time from the balcony of the Regional Council. Subsequently, with the creation of the autonomous community of La Rioja, the flag was designated as one of the symbols of Riojan identity.  Colors  = Tones = The four horizontal bands that form the flag of La Rioja (without the coat-of-arms). The colors of the flag are defined in the statute simply as ‚Äúred, white, green, and yellow,‚Äù without further specifications. In 1985, the specific tones and usage were detailed in the \\"Programa de Identidad Corporativa\\".Comunidad de La Rioja : Programa de Identidad Corporativa. Alberto Coraz√≥n. (1985) This specified the following: * Red: Pantone Warm Red * Green: Pantone 354 * Yellow: Pantone 109 * White: pure white, with no Pantone equivalent However, in 2003, a new manual on the specifications was issued by the government of La Rioja.Decreto 81/2003, de 18 de julio, por el que se regula la Identidad Gr√°fica Corporativa del Gobierno de La Rioja. (BOR n¬∫ 106 del 26 de agosto de 2003) This specified the following: * Red: Pantone 485 * Green: Pantone 368 * Yellow: Pantone 123 The manual explained that these specifications were an adaptation, not a dramatic substitution, and that the changes in Pantone specifications were meant to be made gradually. = Symbolism = The meaning of the flag‚Äôs colors is variously interpreted depending on the source, but the interpretation given in the official act of approval of the flag was: *Red: vineyards *White: light *Green: orchard *Yellow: fertility The official meaning of the colors is given as: * Red: wine * White: river, sky * Green: fields, orchards, mountains, forests * Yellow: lands, monuments The four colors appear, along with blue, in the coat-of-arms of the regional council.  Use  Flags of La Rioja and of Spain, during an official event featuring the community‚Äôs president. Statute 4/May 31, 1985 details in Title 1 (Articles 3, 4, and 5) the correct usage of the Riojan flag: *It will be used alongside the flag of Spain and it must fly from the outside of all public buildings in the territory of La Rioja and occupy a pre-eminent position in the interior of these buildings. *It will be used for all official acts celebrated in the autonomous community. *When the flag of La Rioja is used alongside that of Spain, the flag of Spain will always occupy the pre-eminent place over that of La Rioja, in accordance with the provision made in Article 6 of Statute 39/October 28, 1981. If there are an odd number of flags flying, the placement of the Riojan flag would be to the left of the Spanish flag ‚Äìto the left as one looks at it. If there is an even number of flags flying, the position of the Riojan flag would be to the right of the Spanish flag, as one looks at it. The size of the flag of La Rioja cannot be bigger than that of Spain, and it cannot be smaller than the size of other flags when shown or flown together. Article 10 states that the flag cannot be used as the principal symbol for any political party, union, business association, private entity, or person. Its use on commercial packaging and products requires authorization from the government of La Rioja.  The Riojan flag in the media  Although the flag has no official name, it is known unofficially as the \\"cuatricolor\\". An alternative name that has been proposed is the acronym \\"roblanvera\\", based on the Spanish words for the colors in the flag: rojo-blanco-verde-amarillo.184\\\\.

Gadlys was also one of the five electoral wards of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. The other wards were Aberaman, Aberdare Town, Gadlys and Llwydcoed. History 1889-1914 Blaengwawr first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of Aberdare Urban District Council. From 1895, Blaengwawr was also an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Glamorgan County Council following reorganisation of wards in the Aberdare area. =Glamorgan County Council= In 1895, John Howell, who was already a district councillor, became the first member to represent the ward. Howell was again elected unopposed in 1898 In 1901, Howell appears to have been again returned without opposition although the result cannot be traced. At the 1904 election, Howell was opposed by another Liberal candidate, Gwilym Treharne, who came within 71 votes of victory. Treharne intended to oppose Howell again in 1907 but withdrew before the poll. In 1910, however, Treharne finally succeeded in ousting Howell, who lost his seat after fifteen years. It can be seen, therefore, that Labour made no challenge for this seat at county level. The position in district election was, however, a different one. =Aberdare Urban District Council= Blaengwawr was also an electoral ward of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. In 1899, John Howell was again returned unopposed. In 1900, David Price Davies was returned without opposition. In 1901, Llewellyn was re-elected by a large majority. The 1902 result cannot be traced but in 1903, J.W. Evans was re-elected unopposed. In 1904 an additional seat was created, allowing T. Walter Williams to be returned alongside Rees Llewellyn.

Dr. Lozier was also a noted feminist and activist, and served as president of the New York City Suffrage League and the National Women's Suffrage Association.  Early life  Clemence Sophia Harned, daughter of farmer David Harned and Hannah Walker Harned, was born on December 11, 1812, in Plainfield, New Jersey. Before residing in Plainfield, the family lived in Virginia among Indian tribes. This is where Lozier's mother gained valuable information from the Indians that aided her in becoming an attendant to the sick. Lozier was exposed to medicine at an early age, observing her mother treat the sick in her town with traditional medicine.Marilyn Elizabeth Perry. \\"Lozier, Clemence Sophia\\" ; http://www.anb.org.turing.library.northwestern.edu/articles/12/12-00552.html; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. She was the youngest of 13 children and was orphaned at 11 years old. While living with relatives, she finished her schooling at Plainfield Academy. At age 17, she was married to Abraham Witton Lozier, an architect many years her senior. Both her father and husband were dedicated members of the Methodist Church, and she herself felt Methodism built women up and allowed for differences in opinion. Two of her older brothers were successful preachers in the Methodist church. Her father was also a well known presence in the church. This gave her the foundation for strong religious roots that she carried throughout her life. When her husband's health began to fail, Lozier started to study physiology. When she was 19 she began teaching classes from her home to educate girls in anatomy, physiology, and hygiene. She taught up to 60 students a year for 11 years. The students came from prominent families so Lozier was able to establish herself as a highly regarded teacher. She taught hygiene and anatomy which she learned from her older physician brother. He also helped guide her interest in medicine into her late thirties. She was one of the first teachers in the city to introduce the study of Psychology, Hygiene and Anatomy as branches of the female education. At the time, these topics were not included in women's education, and her classes quickly expanded. Among other topics, she educated women on the physiological consequences of fashion, like the deformities and breathing problems caused by corsets. She continued to teach these classes until 1843. Soon after, she moved to New York and continued giving lectures and visiting the sick. Her first husband died in 1837, and she later remarried to John Baker in New York. The marriage eventually ended in divorce, but little is known about what happened during the relationship. After her husband's death in 1837, Lozier continued with her medical training which she desired to devote herself  Education  Lozier attended Plainfield Academy and learned about medicine from her mother and brother as well as from caring for her ill husband. She wished to attend medical school, but women were not accepted at the time, so her brother continued to tutor her. She continued to apply to medical schools and experienced a lot of rejection, even from Geneva Medical College, which was attended by Elizabeth Blackwell. Eventually, she was allowed to attend classes at Central New York College of Rochester in 1849, and was later admitted to Syracuse Eclectic College. In 1850 the Central Medical College of New York moved to Rochester and became Rochester Eclectic Medical College. In 1849 the Eclectic Medical Institute merged with Randolph Eclectic Medical Institute and moved to Syracuse to become the Central Medical College of New York, which agreed to admit Lozier as a medical student. Ten years after graduation, Lozier founded the homeopathic New York Medical College and Hospital for Women. This became the most important institution for women's homeopathic education in the United States. Lozier struggled, even in her own institute, to promote gender equality. She began to replace male professors with competent women. There was an issue when Issac M. Ward in 1866 refused to leave his position when Lozier wanted to replace him with Ann Innman. She graduated top of her class in 1853 and dedicated herself to the teachings of Samuel Hahnemann and the new homeopathic movement in medicine.Pearson's magazine, October 1903. American ed. New York: The Pearson publishing co. Since her degree, in 1853 women could finally go to a hospital and be treated by a doctor of the same gender. Lozier studied medicine under the direction of her brother William Harned. William was a good reputable physician in New York and was partnered with Dr. Doane who was formerly a quarantine physician in a chemical laboratory. In 1860, she began a course of familiar lectures in her own parlor. This continued for three years during which a ‚ÄúMedical Library Association‚Äù was formed, for the purpose of promoting reading upon such subjects on the anatomy of women.5  Medical career  Before her acceptance to medical school, Lozier had extensive experience with observing disease in its worst forms among women and children. She had performed more than a hundred and twenty ‚Äúcapital operations‚Äù in the removal of vital tumors. When scholars were ill, she would be called before physicians. Her advice would be sole reliance in ordinary diseases. After graduating from medical school, Lozier began a private practice that focused on homeopathic treatments. She specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, but was also renowned for her surgical skills, especially the removal of tumors. Her practice became very successful and returned over $25,000 annually. She believed that women were better suited to become physicians due to the natural instinct and aptitude of their sex. She specifically advocated for more female obstetricians, citing her own large patient list as evidence of patient preferences‚Äîshe would often see over 50 patients a day. From 1860 to 1863 she taught private lectures in her home, which led to the formation of \\"A Ladies' Medical Association\\". Due to increasing enrollment, she collaborated with her friend Elizabeth Cady Stanton to petition for a charter for a women's medical college. Seeing high demand for the lectures and wasted talent from women getting turned away from medical school, Dr. Lozier, with the help from Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was able to persuade the New York State legislature to grant her a charter for a women's medical college. In 1863, the New York medical college for women opened with seven female students in the inaugural class and a faculty of eight doctors: four were women and four were men. In 1863, she founded the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, the first of its kind. She was president of the college and taught courses on the diseases of women and children. During its first year, seven female students were enrolled and taught by four male and four female physicians. For seven years, Lozier supported the college with her own income, and donated $10,000 in lump sum. After the Civil War, Lozier visited Europe in 1867 to observe hospitals and speak with physicians. Upon her return, she resumed teaching under the titles of dean of the school and professor of gynaecology and obstetrics. After practicing at thirty-sixth street for 11 years, shareholders and investors encouraged her to expand the Women's Medical College. However, after a large new building was purchased, the investors backed out, forcing Lozier to declare bankruptcy in 1878. Lozier lost everything, but the college survived and she threw herself back into practicing medicine on Thirty-fourth Street for the next eleven years. The Women's Medical College would eventually become a part of the New York Medical College in 1918.  Advocacy  Lozier was devoted to improving the lives of others, going beyond just treating patients. She hosted Anti-Slavery Society meetings monthly at her own home, and she provided refuge for African Americans during the July Riots of 1862. Once a month Lozier would host Anti Slavery meetings. During times of riots and violence, she would open her home to colored people as well as collect food and medicine for children of the Colored Orphan Asylum after it had burned down. Her son claimed \\"her house was a Mecca for all reformers, and bristled like a fortress from garret to cellar with ammunitions of war documents and pamphlets upon woman's disabilities under the law, arguments and petitions in behalf of suffrage, anti-slavery and temperance, sanitary reform, international arbitration, amelioration of the condition of the Indians, moral education, reform of prisons and insane asylums, etc.\\" She helped found the Female Guardian Society with Margaret Pryor, which visited prisons and poor areas of New York to help mistreated women and children. For 7 years Lozier and Pryor would visit the poor and abandoned in connection with the Moral Reform Society, and often prescribed for them in sickness. She was a well- known suffragist and was good friends with Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She fought for the rights of her female students to attend classes with men at the Bellevue Hospital College by swaying public opinion during public meetings. She further fought for women's rights in the courtroom and successfully advocated for the release of Hester Vaughan, who had been wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death for infanticide. Additionally, she fought for women's right to vote. When Susan B. Anthony was sentenced for voting, she called a public meeting to criticize Chief Justice Hunt who sentenced her. She served as the president of many prominent organizations including the Woman's American Temperance League, the Moral Education Society of New York, the National Woman's Suffrage Association for five years, and the New York Woman's Suffrage Society from 1873 to 1886. = Organizations = # Homeopathic County Society # WCTU # National Woman Suffrage Association # NY Suffrage League # City Ladies' Suffrage Committee # Universal Peace Union # NY Abolitionists' Reunion # American Female Guardian Society # Moral Education Society  Legacy  Image from Child-Birth Made Easy Lozier founded the first Medical College for women and trained over 200 female physicians. The hospital attracted over 2,000 female patients a year and was the first place a woman could be treated by a female physician, paving the way for women to regain control of childbirth. She, herself, gave birth to seven sons, but only Dr. Abraham W. Lozier survived. Nevertheless, by the time of her death, she had already inspired nine of her direct relatives to become physicians, including her daughter-in-law, Charlotte Denman Lozier, who graduated from the medical college she founded. She also increased the credibility of female physicians. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed \\"Physicians would not recognize her as a member of the profession... they tampered with her patients to see if they could find aught against her. But in spite of all the machinations of her enemies, she triumphed\\".Elizabeth Cady Stanton: Tribute to Dr. Clemence Lozier. The Woman's tribune. Volume 5, Issue 33 (1888), Pages 2-3. As the first woman to read a scientific paper before the New York State Medical Society, Lozier also blazed a trail for female scientists. She further advocated for the incorporation of physiology classes in schools and preached the importance of education at meetings and in writing. Dr. Lozier is the reason women in New York could finally study medicine. Before her, there were no institutes in New York that offered classes to women. She became president and clinical professor of diseases of women (1863-1867) and dean and professor of gynecology (1867-1888) and had a private practice (1853-1888) One of her most well-known documents was a short pamphlet, Child-Birth Made Easy, empowering mothers with knowledge. Lozier passed away from heart troubles two days after giving the 25th commencement speech in 1888 at the College she founded.

He also served as an enlisted man during World War II. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for actions 17 November 1965 over North Vietnam. He was the namesake of . Biography Jesse Junior Taylor was born in Wichita, Kansas, on 16 January 1925 to Jesse D. Taylor of Kansas and Mabel Taylor of Nebraska. In 1935 the family lived in the Kansas City area and in 1940 they lived in the Los Angeles metro area. Taylor enlisted in the Navy after high school on 26 October 1942. He joined Bombing Squadron 11 (VB-11) as an aviation radioman and enlisted Naval Aircrewman and was deployed with the squadron to the carrier in September 1944. Over the following four months, VB-11 carried out a highly successful combat tour, flying 490 strike sorties against a variety of enemy targets in the Pacific. Taylor, as an aviation radioman, earned a ribbon for Hornet's Presidential Unit Citation. He served with VB-11 until discharged from the Navy on 5 February 1946. Following his reentry into civilian life, he attended Long Beach City College for two years before going to work with several private concerns in the Los Angeles area. However, he returned to the college in 1950 and, while there, enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve shortly after Korean War began. Reporting for duty in January 1951, Taylor underwent flight training as a Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD) and was soon designated a Naval Aviator. Commissioned an Ensign in May 1952, he went on to receive further training until he joined Composite Squadron Four (VC-4) in January 1953 as a replacement pilot and Maintenance and Material Officer. Detached from that duty in July 1955, he then served as Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) instructor on the Los Angeles campus of the University of California. Following that tour, he went to Naval Air Station Pensacola for further flight instruction. The first half of 1956 saw Taylor as a flight instructor at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Milton, Florida. He then joined the staff of Chief of Naval Air Training at NAS Pensacola as Assistant Aviation Safety Officer. After his tour in Pensacola, Taylor journeyed to England, where, for a year, he attended the Empire Test Pilots' School at Farmborough. He then rejoined the fleet, serving as a replacement pilot in Fighter Squadron 174 (VF-174). Promoted to Lieutenant Commander while serving with the squadron, he then attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island for one year. Next, he represented the Bureau of Naval Weapons at St. Louis, Missouri, directing the Bureau's Flight Test Division for two years. =Vietnam War= In July 1965, LCDR Taylor was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 16 aboard the aircraft carrier , and sailed to the western Pacific. He flew 16 missions between September and November, earning an Air Medal and a gold star in lieu of a second award. Selected for promotion to the rank of Commander on 1 September 1965, at the time of his death he had not been officially given the rank. On 17 November 1965, Commander Taylor was flying his A-1 Skyraider during attacks on a key bridge near the North Vietnamese port of Haiphong. Anti-aircraft fire had downed one of the attacking aircraft and its pilot had ejected from his doomed plane in a densely populated and heavily defended area. Taylor heard the radio transmission about the pilot's plight. Although it was not his assigned mission, realizing that time was of the essence in any attempt to rescue the downed pilot, Taylor made a courageous decision. Having discovered that other rescue aircraft were occupied elsewhere, he took command of the rescue effort. Despite intense and accurate anti-aircraft fire, Taylor proceeded to the scene and found the downed pilot still in his parachute harness in shallow water. To cover the approach of the rescue helicopter, he attacked the anti-aircraft gun sites, despite the fact that his own plane had sustained damage. The storm of enemy ground fire soon made it obvious that the helicopter would not be able to extricate the man on the ground. Meanwhile, because of fire in his own aircraft, Commander Taylor was forced to break off his own persistent attacks. Rather than try to abandon his plane in enemy territory, he elected to try to ditch in the Gulf of Tonkin. However, the fire burned through the wing of his plane and it crashed before he had time to leave it. For his heroic determination to save a fellow pilot, even at great risk to his own life, Commander Taylor was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. Taylor and his wife Barbara had three children. Taylor's remains were returned by North Vietnam in 1975. He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California.interment.net Taylor is listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall on Panel 3E, Row 96.

Life  Although his parents were poor, they supported his desire to become an artist and a local sculptor helped him develop his woodcarving skills. When he was ten years old, he was apprenticed to an uncle who had a masonry workshop and remained there for ten years.* Constantin von Wurzbach: Zauner Edler von Falpatann, Franz. In: Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich. Vol.59, Verlag L. C. Zamarski, Vienna 1890, pgs.203‚Äì207. In 1766, he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where he became a Professor in 1782 and later director (1806-1815). One of his first projects after graduating involved a series of anatomical figures for the famed ophthalmologist Joseph Barth. He was offered a permanent position as an anatomical sculptor at a good salary, but had higher ambitions and turned it down. A commission from Prince Kaunitz for fountains at the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace enabled him to a stay in Rome from 1776 to 1781, initially under the sponsorship of Anton Raphael Mengs. While there, he became dissatisfied with what he felt were the superfluous mannerisms of the most popular sculptures and sought to create a purer Classical style. His equestrian statue of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, won him a knighthood from Kaiser Franz I. It later became the subject of a poem by Anastasius Gr√ºn. He is also well known for a monument to Leopold II in the Augustinian Church and the tomb of Field Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon at the Schloss Laudon. In the 1780s Zauner was a member of the Viennese Freemason lodge \\"Zur wahren Eintracht\\", where Joseph Haydn was also a member and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a frequent visitor.

A few hundred meters west of the church is Salnecke Castle, one of Sweden's best-preserved castles from the mid-17th century. History Christianity made inroads in areas already in the 11th century, as the Christian crosses on rune stones in the area suggest. The first church building was probably made of wood. The building material of this single-nave church with a rounded apse is fieldstone. The church was enlarged sometime later, probably circa 1250‚Äì1350. In 1578, the church was struck by lightning and consequently ravaged by fire; the rounded apse got its semicircular appearance probably from the time of reconstruction following this event. The bell tower has two bells, a large and a small one. The oldest surviving church council register from the mid-17th century mentions about repairs to the bell tower, built in 1752. In the 1770s the whole tower except the ground floor was demolished and the ceiling rebuilt so that the whole church might be covered by a flat-pitched roof. Originally the church had a stone tower, but the upper parts of this was dismantled in 1775 as it was in poor condition. Architecture To the north of the church a vestry is located and to the south a church porch. Inside, the ceiling is supported by 15th-century brick vaults. Most of the furnishings are Rococo in style, dating from the mid-18th century. The western part of the church is where the remains of the tower are. The oldest parts are located in the nave and are probably from the Romanesque era. To the west of the nave, erected around the 12th century, is a narrower part of the building which forms lower part of the former tower. The sacristy is located on the church's north side. and the pulpit, acquired in 1697, was probably made by a carpenter at the site after a model of some neighboring church's pulpit, for the type itself and ornaments were fashionable in the 17th century. =Interior= The pulpit is the oldest part of the church's fixtures, procured in 1697. This piece is probably made by a local carpenter and modeled after a pulpit in some neighboring church. The style of the pulpit and the soft, smooth character of the ornamentation was popular at the middle of the 17th century. The sacristy is located on the church's north side. Paintings The paintings preserved in the church are very well kept in the three-arched nave with the tower vault richly decorated with fragments of four scenes, although only two have been interpreted. The wall paintings are of course largely gone, partly as a result of the enlargement of the windows during the 1790s. The paintings are dated by an inscription on the south wall on the brackets atop the imposts of the first arches, which reads \\"Anno Domini 1487 die Marie (Mary's day)\\". The paintings have probably been made by a student of Albertus Pictor. They are painted in a style widely used throughout the M√§laren Valley during the second half of the 15th century. The most notable of these painters was Albert the Painter. =First arch= In the east part of the ceiling (to the left), is a painting of St. Gregorius and Mark the Evangelist, (to the right) and another of St. Ambrosius and Matthew the Apostle. In the south part of the ceiling (top part to the left), is the painting of St. Augustinus and John the Apostle and another (to the right) which depicts the creation of Eve. In the lowest part to the left stands the devil playing a bagpipe, and above this appears two pictures, the sacrifices of Cain and Abel, and Cain murdering his brother. To the right is the Moses and the burning bush. In the west part of the ceiling (to the left), Our Lord unites Adam and Eve and to the right is the Fall of man. In the bottom-most corner, as in the other arch, are found half-lengths of prophets coming out of a large bell shaped in flowers. In the upper part of the ceiling (to the left), is the depiction of the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and below the painting \\"When Adam dalf (dug) and Eve span (spun)\\". To the right of this is St. Hieronymus and Luke the Evangelist and below the Emperor Augustus kneeling before the Sibyls, heralding the birth of Christ. =Middle arch= In the east part of the ceiling is the painting Coronation of Mary including Christ with crown and orb with cross. In the south part of the ceiling (to the left) appears Delilah cutting Samson's hair. In the background is Goliath with his club, and to the right Samson Breaking the Lion's Jaw. Bell tower and bells The bell tower of Gryta church The bell tower at Gryta Church was built in 1752. In the oldest records of the church (from the middle of the 17th century), notations are made about repairs to the tower. In the modern records about the church, the bell tower, made of tarred wood, is noted to be of special interest since it is an original 18th-century tower. It has two bells, the Great Bell (Storklockan) and the Small Bell (Lillklockan). Cemetery A great part of the cemetery, surrounded by a gray stone wall with deciduous plants encrusted in it, is covered with grass and walkways all paved with gravel. Close to the north of the vestry lies two blocks of graves with stone frames. The oldest graves are located immediately south and west of the church. Some with cast iron tracery. The cemetery has been expanded several times to the north with the latest enlargement bounded to the north and east of the Gunnebo fencing. A newly built memorial is also situated here. About a hundred yards north of the church stands the belfry which is likely to have been built in 1752. The lower part of the belfry has inclined walls with tarred panels. These are contingent constructions with diagonal pledged works. The cemetery's southeast corner is occupied by the Spenska chapel, a building in neoclassical style with plastered facades colored in yellow lime build around 1802.

They can be regarded as algebraic expressions of a formal language over a finite alphabet. Definition Let R be a semiring and A a finite alphabet. A noncommutative polynomial over A is a finite formal sum of words over A. They form a semiring R\\\\langle A \\\\rangle. A formal series is a R-valued function c, on the free monoid A*, which may be written as :\\\\sum_{w \\\\in A^*} c(w) w \\\\ . The set of formal series is denoted R\\\\langle\\\\langle A \\\\rangle\\\\rangle and becomes a semiring under the operations :c+d : w \\\\mapsto c(w) + d(w) :c\\\\cdot d : w \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{uv = w} c(u) \\\\cdot d(v) \\\\ . A non-commutative polynomial thus corresponds to a function c on A* of finite support. In the case when R is a ring, then this is the Magnus ring over R. If L is a language over A, regarded as a subset of A* we can form the characteristic series of L as the formal series :\\\\sum_{w \\\\in L} w corresponding to the characteristic function of L. In R\\\\langle\\\\langle A \\\\rangle\\\\rangle one can define an operation of iteration expressed as : S^* = \\\\sum_{n \\\\ge 0} S^n and formalised as :c^*(w) = \\\\sum_{u_1 u_2 \\\\cdots u_n = w} c(u_1)c(u_2) \\\\cdots c(u_n) \\\\ . The rational operations are the addition and multiplication of formal series, together with iteration. A rational series is a formal series obtained by rational operations from R\\\\langle A \\\\rangle.

They received a standing ovation from both the audience and judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams for their rendition of the song \\"Stars\\" from the musical Les Mis√©rables. The judges were initially seen to have low expectations due to their styling and the fact that they had only been together for a month at the time. Cowell claimed that \\"Britain really has got talent\\" (a comment he repeated in the live semi-final) and they received a unanimous \\"yes\\" verdict from the judging panel, with Cowell also describing their performance as a \\"hit record\\", while Holden was reduced to tears. Collabro progressed to the live semi-finals. They competed in the first semi- final on 26 May, performing the song \\"Bring Him Home\\", also from Les Mis√©rables.

Suldal and R√∏ldal each had their own churches, but they shared a priest since R√∏ldal was a sparsely populated area and could not support their own priest. Suldal was located in Stavanger county and R√∏ldal was located in S√∏ndre Bergenhus county. This arrangement was not a problem until 1837 when the formannskapsdistrikt law was passed. The law called for each parish to become a municipality led by a self-governing council. It also said that each municipality must be within one county, not two. Therefore, Suldal and R√∏ldal had to be divided and starting on 1 January 1838, R√∏ldal became its own municipality in S√∏ndre Bergenhus county. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. The sparsely-populated municipality existed until 1 January 1964 when R√∏ldal (population: 676) was merged into the larger neighboring municipality of Odda (population: 9,487). =Municipal council= The municipal council of Kinsarvik is made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: Name The municipality was named after the main village in the parish, R√∏ldal. The village in turn was named after the valley in which it is located. The Old Norse form of the name might have been R≈ìrgudalr. The first element would then be the genitive case of the local rivername R√∏yrga (derived from r√∏yrr which means 'rocky ground') and the last element is dalr which means 'dale' or 'valley'.

The Museum focuses on historical achievements and culture of African Americans by serving as a resource center for the Greater Clemson Area to engage the local and upstate South Carolina communities in intellectual discourse about the past. CAAAM hosts independent and collaborative educational and informative presentations, workshops, innovative programs, and hands-on activities that serve the public, museum visitors and civic organizations. History The Clemson Area African American Museum was chartered by the City of Clemson, South Carolina in 2002 and first opened in 2007. The realization of the museum was brought one step closer to reality when the City of Clemson, fostered by the vision of Mayor Larry Abernathy, purchased and renovated the facility for community and cultural purposes. The Clemson Area African American Museum is located in the Calhoun Bridge Center and the center was formerly an all-black school that was known as the Calhoun Elementary School. It was the last school built for African American students in this part of Pickens County. Building The Clemson Area African American Museum is located in the old Morrison Annex Building. The site of the ‚ÄúMorrison Annex‚Äù building in the Goldenview community was home to the second African American School ‚ÄúCalhoun Elementary‚Äù during segregation. It was preceded by a one-room school house that stood near the Goldenview Baptist Church. The current annex building was built by Pickens County School district in the 1940s to serve the needs of the growing number of African American families in the Calhoun area. After desegregation both the name and the use of the Calhoun Elementary School building changed. In 1971, the building was converted to a kindergarten and first grade facility, with grades two through five, attending Margaret Morrison Elementary School and named Morrison Annex. After the opening of the Clemson Elementary School at its new location, the City of Clemson acquired the Morrison Annex property in August 2003 for $100,000 from the Pickens County school district. The building on Butler Street was refurbished at a cost of about $1.3 million, the overhaul finished in 2006. On April 16, 2007, the City of Clemson officially the name change for the Morrison Annex to the Calhoun Bridge Center. The Calhoun Bridge Center, not only houses the Clemson Area African American Museum, it also houses the Clemson Child Development Center and the Arts Center of Clemson. Collection CAAAM exists to research, collect, preserve and interpret for public enrichment, the history, art and culture of African Americans. The museum conserves objects of art, historical artifacts and memorabilia other reference materials available for limited public use.

The French word \\"fr√®re\\" in turn comes from the Latin word \\"frater\\", which also means \\"brother\\". One reason for the variation in spelling is that medieval English lacked definite spelling rules. Names were rarely spelled consistently during these times when most people were illiterate.

It premiered on June 8, 2014, on Fox and aired on June 9, 2014, on the National Geographic Channel. The episode was written by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, and directed by Ann Druyan, making this her series directorial debut. The episode explores the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter, as well as the contributions and theories of Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who furthered our understanding of \\"supernovae, neutron stars and 'standard candles.'\\" The finale reveals a recording of life on Earth - the final message on the golden record of the space probe, Voyager. The episode ends with Carl Sagan's (host of the original Cosmos) iconic speech on Earth as the \\"Pale Blue Dot.\\"  Episode summary  The Pale Blue Dot, taken by Voyager I from outside the orbit of Neptune Tyson begins the episode by noting how the destruction of the Library of Alexandria lost much of humanity's knowledge to that point. He then contrasts on the strive for humanity to continue to discover new facts about the universe and the need to not close off further discovery. Tyson then proceeds to describe the discovery of cosmic rays by Victor Hess through high- altitude balloon trips, where radiation increased the farther one was from the surface. Swiss Astronomer Fritz Zwicky, in studying supernovae, postulated that these cosmic rays originated from these events instead of electromagnetic radiation. Zwicky would continue to study supernovae, and by looking at standard candles that they emitted, estimated the movement of the galaxies in the universe. His calculations suggested that there must be more mass in the universe than those apparent in the observable galaxies, and called this dark matter. Initially forgotten, Zwicky's theory was confirmed by the work of Vera Rubin, who observed that the rotation of stars at the edges of observable galaxies did not follow expected rotational behavior without considering dark matter. This further led to the discovery of dark energy by Edwin Hubble to account for the known rate of expansion of the universe beyond the visible and dark matter mass. Tyson then describes the interstellar travel, using the two Voyager probes. Besides the abilities to identify several features on the planets of the solar system, Voyager I was able to recently demonstrate the existence of the Sun's variable heliosphere which help buffer the Solar System from interstellar winds. Tyson describes Carl Sagan's role in the Voyager program, including creating the Voyager Golden Record to encapsulate humanity and Earth's position in the universe, and convincing the program directors to have Voyager I to take a picture of Earth from beyond the orbit of Neptune, creating the image of the Pale Blue Dot. Tyson concludes the series by emphasizing Sagan's message on the human condition in the vastness of the cosmos, and to encourage viewers to continue to explore and discover what else the universe has to offer. The series concludes with the empty-seated Ship of the Imagination leaving Earth and traveling through space as Tyson looks on from planet Earth.  Reception  The episode received a 1.1/3 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 3.09 million American viewers watching on Fox.

The genus was circumscribed in 2014 by mycologists David Arora and Jonathan L. Frank to accommodate \\"butter bolete\\" species that were shown by molecular analysis to be phylogenetically distinct from Boletus. Butyriboletus contains 21 ectomycorrhizal species found in Asia, Europe, North America and north Africa. The group had earlier been classified as the section Appendiculati within the large genus Boletus. They were given the common name \\"butter boletes\\" as the color of their stalk, flesh and pores was similar to that of butter. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that these species are part of a regius clade (named for B. regius), distinct from the core group of the type species B. edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. The narrowing of Boletus to this latter group meant that this group would need to be placed in a separate genus, with Boletus appendiculatus (now Butyriboletus appendiculatus) designated as the type species. The genus name itself is derived from the Latin butyrum \\"butter\\". The butter boletes have red or brown caps, yellow pores and stipes that turn blue when cut or bruised in many species, and olive-brown spindle-shaped spores. Their flesh is usually mild tasting. Butyriboletus roseoflavus is a highly regarded edible mushroom sold in markets in southwestern and southeastern China, while two other species‚ÄîB. yicibus and B. sanicibus‚Äîare eaten to a lesser degree in Yunnan Province.

It was the second tallest freestanding structure in Canada for several years and the second tallest freestanding lattice tower ever built in Canada after the Cambridge Bay LORAN Tower. In addition it was tallest structure in Toronto for 15 years until the completion of the TD Tower in 1967. Owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the tower was located at 345 Jarvis Street in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood of Toronto. The tower was used by CBC stations CBL-FM, CBLT and CBLFT, as well as CJRT and CICA-TV, until 1976, when almost all broadcast signals in Toronto moved to the CN Tower. The adjacent studio complex was used for CBC Toronto's radio and television operations, including CBL, which only used the studios at Jarvis Street, broadcasting from its transmitter at Hornby. After the Jarvis Street transmitter was made redundant by the CN Tower, the CBC continued to use the studio facilities at that site until moving to the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in 1992. The tower was painted red and white as warning for aircraft as part of the requirement to warn aircraft flying near it.
