Founder Harland Sanders initially developed his \\"Colonel\\" persona as a low-cost marketing tool. The Colonel's image is still used extensively in the chain's advertising. The chain is well known for the \\"finger lickin' good\\" slogan, which originated in 1956. Colonel Sanders Colonel Sanders was a key component of KFC advertising until his death in 1980. He made several appearances in various B movies and television programs of the period, such as What's My Line? and I've Got a Secret. Jack Massey described him as \\"the greatest PR man I have ever known\\". KFC franchisee & Wendy's founder Dave Thomas credited Sanders' appeal to the fact that he \\"stood for values that people understood and liked\\". Since his death Sanders has remained as a key symbol of the company; an \\"international symbol of hospitality\\". In 1994, KFC hired actor Henderson Forsythe to portray the Colonel in a television campaign entitled \\"The Colonel's Way\\". The $18.4 million campaign from Young & Rubicam used black and white visuals. (Abstract only) The campaign was deemed unsuccessful and was ended. From May 1998, an animated version of the Colonel, \\"boisterously\\" voiced by Randy Quaid, was used for television advertisements. (Via HighBeam) KFC chief concept officer Jeff Moody said they \\"provide a fresh way to communicate our relevance for today's consumers\\". The animated Colonel was dropped in 2001 in the US, and in 2002 in the UK. In 2012, a UK advertisement entitled \\"4000 cooks\\" featured an actor made up to resemble Sanders. Beginning in May 2015, Darrell Hammond began playing a live-action Colonel Sanders in KFC commercials. Three months later, KFC launched a new campaign with comedian Norm Macdonald portraying Sanders; the first ad of the campaign makes direct reference to the Hammond campaign, with a brief piece of footage of Hammond followed by Macdonald's Colonel declaring his predecessor an impostor. Jim Gaffigan then began playing Sanders in February 2016, with his first ads stating that Macdonald's Colonel was another impostor. George Hamilton began appearing as \\"The Extra Crispy Colonel\\" in July 2016, with no transition referencing Gaffigan's Colonel. Later, in September 2016, Rob Riggle began appearing as a new Colonel Sanders, the coach of the fictitious \\"Kentucky Buckets\\" football team, again with no transition. In January 2017, Billy Zane began appearing as a Gold Colonel Sanders to promote a new Georgia Gold flavor chicken. In April 2017, KFC released a campaign featuring Rob Lowe as astronaut Colonel Sanders giving a JFK speech spoof/homage about launching the Zinger chicken sandwich into space.Rob Lowe as astronaut Col Sanders in JFK homage advert, This commercial also featured Wink Martindale. Lowe released a statement saying that when he was a child, his grandfather took him to meet Harland Sanders. In 2018, a \\"Value Colonel\\" was introduced, portrayed by Christopher Boyer, an intentionally obscure background character actor who was among those who auditioned for the part in 2015; Boyer's first commercial also featured a cameo from Wayne Knight as another celebrity Colonel. In January 2018, country music singer Reba McEntire was selected to be KFC's first female Colonel Sanders. In August 2018, former Seinfeld star Jason Alexander was named the new Colonel Sanders. Alexander had previously appeared in commercials for KFC in the early 2000s. Actor Craig Fleming portrays the Colonel in the 2018 ad featuring Mrs. Butterworth. KFC CMO Kevin Hochman told PRWeek, \\"The plan was always to rotate colonels. We always thought of it like James Bond. The actor that dons the white suit brings something of his own to the actual character.\\" Although the rotating \\"Real Colonel Sanders\\" campaigns have generated mixed reviews, analysts and company executive credit it with helping to boost sales. In late 2017, KFC introduced the \\"Value Colonel\\" portrayed by a lesser-known actor, Christopher Boyer, to advertise value meals. Boyer's portrayal of the Colonel makes a point to note that because he is not famous, he can advertise cheaply, even telling a Colonel Sanders suited Wayne Knight in one commercial, \\"Ah, ah, ah, no celebrities!\\" In 2019, a KFC themed dating sim featuring Colonel Sanders, titled I Love You Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator was released on September 24. The game received a 50% on Metacritic, and Polygon writer Nicole Carpenter gave it a negative review, citing its short playtime compared to advertised length and seeming mockery of the dating sim genre. The ubiquity of Sanders has not prevented KFC from introducing a mascot aimed at children. \\"Chicky\\", a young animated chicken, was first introduced in Thailand in the 1990s, and has since been rolled out across a number of markets worldwide, mostly in Asia and South America. Slogans Early official slogans included \\"North America's Hospitality Dish\\" (1956–1966) and \\"We fix Sunday dinner seven nights a week\\" from 1957 until 1968. The two slogans were phased out in order to concentrate on the \\"finger lickin' good\\" slogan. The \\"finger lickin' good\\" slogan was trademarked in 1956. After a local KFC television advertisement had featured Arizona franchisee Dave Harman licking his fingers in the background, a viewer phoned the station to complain. The main actor in the advertisement, a KFC manager named Ken Harbough, upon hearing of this, responded: \\"Well, it's finger lickin' good.\\" The phrase was adopted nationally by the company by the 1960s, and went on to become one of the best-known slogans of the twentieth century. The trademark expired in the US in 2006, and was replaced in that market with \\"Follow your taste\\" until 2010. In 2011, the \\"finger lickin' good\\" slogan was dropped in favor of \\"So good\\", to be rolled out worldwide. A Yum! executive said that the new slogan was more holistic, applying to staff and service, as well as food. Other slogans included \\"It's America's Country-Good Meal\\" and \\"It's Nice to Feel So Good about a Meal\\" (late 1970s), \\"We Do Chicken Right\\" (1980s) and \\"Everybody needs a little KFC\\" (mid 1990s). \\"Nobody does chicken like KFC\\" was first introduced by KFC Australia in 1998, and has continued to be used by the company in some markets. In 2015, along with a revamp of their U.S. advertising, KFC returned to using \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\". As of April 2016, KFC began using the slogan \\"Colonel Quality, Guaranteed.\\" The secret recipe is regularly identified with the phrase \\"eleven herbs and spices,\\" the amount and identification of which remain a trade secret. Logos The first KFC logo was introduced in 1952 and featured a \\"Kentucky Fried Chicken\\" typeface and a logo of the Colonel. It was designed by the Lippincott & Margulies corporate identity agency. Lippincott & Margulies were hired to redesign it in 1978, and used a similar typeface and a slightly different Sanders logo. The \\"KFC\\" acronym logo was designed by Schechter & Luth of New York and was introduced in 1991, and the Colonel's face logo was switched from brown to blue ink. Landor redesigned the logo in 1997, with a new image of the Colonel. The new Colonel image was more thinly lined, less cartoonish and a more realistic representation of Sanders. In 2007, the Colonel logo was updated by Tesser of San Francisco, replacing his white suit with an apron, bolder colors and a better defined visage. According to Gregg Dedrick, president of KFC's US division, the change, \\"communicates to customers the realness of Colonel Sanders and the fact that he was a chef\\". Television =United States= KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky KFC began to advertise nationwide from 1966, with a US television budget of US$4 million. In order to fund nationwide advertising campaigns, the Kentucky Fried Chicken Advertising Co-op was established, giving franchisees 10 votes and the company three when deciding on budgets and campaigns. In 1968, the budget was increased to US$9 million (around US$60 million in 2013). In 1969, KFC hired its first national advertising agency, Leo Burnett. John Hughes, later to become a filmmaker, worked as a copywriter on the account. A notable Burnett campaign in 1972 was the \\"Get a bucket of chicken, have a barrel of fun\\" jingle, performed by Barry Manilow. By 1976 KFC was one of the largest advertisers in the US. Young & Rubicam (Y&R;) was KFC's agency of record in the US from 1976 until December 2000. The tagline from 1976 to 1981 was: \\"It's nice to feel so good about a meal\\". It was chosen because KFC had identified consumer guilt as its core marketing obstacle. Meanwhile, KFC hired the Mingo- Jones agency to target African American audiences. Mingo-Jones coined the \\"We do chicken right\\" slogan, which was later adopted across the whole chain from 1981 until 1991. From 1991 to 1994, the television campaign focused on the fictional town of Lake Edna. When he took over the CEO role at KFC, David C. Novak ended the campaign, which he derided as \\"hokey\\". The campaign was replaced by one with the tagline, \\"Everybody needs a little KFC\\", which Novak credited with helping to boost sales at the company. BBDO took over the KFC US account in December 2000. Its first campaign, featuring Jason Alexander (who would later play Colonel Sanders for KFC ads in 2018), debuted on television in July 2001. It ran until May 2003 with the tagline, \\"There's fast food. Then there's KFC.\\" In September 2003, BBDO was replaced by Foote, Cone & Belding. Its first campaign aired in November, but was pulled after less than a month following complaints from the National Advertising Division and the Center for Science in the Public Interest that it advertised the health benefits of eating fried chicken. =International= In 1994, Ogilvy & Mather became KFC's international agency of record. From 1997 to 1999, Ogilvy & Mather used celebrities such as Ivana Trump, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Ulrika Jonsson to endorse KFC products in television advertisements in the UK. After this campaign, the agency simply adapted Y&R;'s American campaigns, such as the animated Colonel, for a British audience. In late 2002, BBH was appointed KFC's UK agency. In 2003, the \\"Soul Food\\" campaign was launched, aiming to capture the young urban market with 1960s and 70s African-American music. By 2005, this was believed to have been a failure, and KFC UK's marketing director left the company amid speculation that the US head office was unhappy with the campaign. In 2012, it was determined that a 2005 advert in the Soul Food campaign, featuring people talking and singing with their mouths full, had been the most complained-about advert in the fifty-year history of the Advertising Standards Authority. The complaints were not upheld at the time.\\"KFC advert is the most complained-about campaign of all time\\", The Independent, 2012-05-30\\" Marketing subsequently moved towards a more family- orientated line. In 2017, Mother London began producing ads for KFC UK. One campaign included a dancing chicken and rap music. 2018 print ad During a February 2018 food shortage that caused some restaurants to close and others to have limited selection, Mother London was given the job of helping KFC with its public relations. A print ad rearranged the KFC letters to spell FCK; the ad won awards at Cannes and elsewhere. Promotional tie-ins and corporate sponsorships In 2013, WPP's BrandZ valued the brand at US$10 billion. Between November 1998 and January 2000, KFC US teamed with Nintendo, Game Freak and 4 Kids Entertainment in a Pokémon tie-in. Pokémon themed promotional days were held, Pokémon Beanie Babies were sold, and Pokémon toys were given away free with children's meals. In 1999, PepsiCo signed a $2 billion agreement with Lucasfilm in order to market Star Wars themed meals in its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Since 2010, KFC has sponsored the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. In Australia, KFC has sponsored the Big Bash League Twenty20 cricket tournament and Twenty20 international matches since 2003. In December 2018, KFC, in partnership with Enviro-Log, created a firelog that smells like fried chicken with KFC's 11 herbs and spices. The logs sold out online within hours of their debut. = DC comics one-shots = Between 2015 and 2017, DC comics, in partnership with fast-food restaurant KFC published three one-shot comic books – The Colonel of Two Worlds, The Colonel Corps, and Across the Universe, each featuring KFC mascot Colonel Sanders working with popular DC superheroes such as Green Lantern and the Flash. Originally exclusively available at various comic cons, they were later made available for free download by DC. In The Colonel of Two Worlds, a new, evil version of Colonel Sanders, Colonel Sunder from Earth-3, teams up with Mirror Master and Captain Cold to tarnish the good name of everyone's favorite chicken chef, and it's up to Harland Sanders and the Flash to set things right! In Colonel Corps, Colonel Sunder, the Anti-Colonel, with the aid of Colonel Grodd (a Colonel version of Gorilla Grodd) returns to the Multiverse, who steals the secret recipe to KFC's chicken from the minds of various versions of the Colonel from across the Multiverse. Sanders teams up with 10 other versions of himself from other realities to defeat the duo. In Across the Universe, the Colonel goes cosmic in a star-spanning quest to bring crunchy, spicy satisfaction to a hungry universe, only to face a “thieving varmint” who steals his space-bound Zinger chicken sandwiches. Only Green Lantern can help the Colonel scan the universe to catch the thief! =NASCAR sponsorships= KFC has marketed with NASCAR, sponsoring several cars on a limited basis throughout the years. KFC's first appearance in NASCAR was in 1997 Cup competition with Darrell Waltrip Motorsports, as part of a one-race attempt for Rich Bickle and the #26 in the 1997 Brickyard 400. Several years later in 2004, KFC sponsored Dale Earnhardt Inc.'s #8 for some Busch races with Martin Truex, Jr. and a Busch race at Daytona International Speedway with Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. KFC stayed out of NASCAR for several years, returning to sponsor Front Row Motorsports for limited races in 2014 and 2015. KFC was seen on the #34 of David Ragan both years, and on the #35 of Cole Whitt in 2015 only. In 2016, KFC moved to Roush- Fenway Racing to sponsor the #16 of Greg Biffle, again for a limited number of races.

Early life  Soga was born in 1865 at the Mgwali Mission, in the former Transkei, South Africa, the fourth and youngest son of Reverend Tiyo Soga and Janet Burnside of Scotland. Soga's father Tiyo had been keen for his children to be educated in Scotland. After Tiyo's death in 1871, Janet relocated the family to Scotland and Jotello and his siblings were educated initially at the Dollar Academy. Jotello Soga went on to study veterinary medicine at Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine from 1882 to 1886. He qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 1886, with a gold medal distinction in botany.  Personal life  Like his father Jotello Soga also married a Scottish woman, namely Catherine Watson Chalmers in 1892: three daughters, Catherine, Doris and Margaret were born of this marriage. Soga died on 6 December 1906 in Amalinda, East London, Eastern Cape.  Early career  In November 1889 he was appointed as the second assistant to Duncan Hutcheon, Colonial Veterinary Surgeon to the Cape of Good Hope. The first assistant being John Borthwick. He was posted to Fort Beaufort and was also responsible for veterinary services for Victoria East, Stockenström and neighbouring districts. His immediate task was to inoculate against contagious lung- sickness, which was decimating cattle in South Africa. He conducted his own inoculation experiments on lung-sickness and his vaccinating method was accepted as standard thereafter.  Eradication of Rinderpest  The second phase of his career began when the threat of rinderpest was on the horizon in the early 1890s. To the north, cattle were becoming sick and dying by the thousands. \\"Like some belated biblical plague of Egypt . . . it left a trail of bleaching bones and poverty,\\" said one historian of that period. Dr. Soga was among the first to warn of the dangers rinderpest posed to the Cape Colony. \\"Our new Colonial enemy is rinderpest,\\" he wrote in 1892, \\"Lung Sickness and Redwater are simple fools to it.\\"  Memorial  The library at the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Pretoria was named in his honour on 5 May 2009  Publications  His publications include:   Notes and references   *  External links  * Dr. Jotello F Soga * Making history: UK’s first black vet * Category:1865 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Xhosa people Category:South African veterinarians Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:People educated at Dollar Academy ","title":"Jotello Festiri Soga"},{"id":"42425936","text":"William Alfred \\"Willie\\" Porter (born 1884) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Chelsea.

Early life Hoover was born in Lafayette, Indiana, the third of the three children of grocer and later Indiana Glass Company executive Wilbur C. and substitute school teacher Judith. He grew up in Anderson, Indiana, a General Motors factory town, graduating from Madison Heights High School in 1969. As a child, Hoover displayed an interest in business. He invented business games to play with friends. At the age of 12 in a quest to better understand General Motors he discovered and subscribed to Fortune Magazine. In 1969, Hoover entered the University of Chicago. There, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. Four of his teachers, including Milton Friedman, later won Nobel Prizes. Business career After graduating from college, Hoover spent two years as a security analyst at Citibank, New York, covering the retailing industry, followed by two years as a buyer for Sanger-Harris, the Dallas division of Federated Department Stores. In 1977 he joined the May Department Stores Company in St. Louis, where he spent five years in tasks ranging from financial analysis and planning to shopping center development and marketing. =Bookstop= In 1982, Hoover moved to Austin, Texas, after selecting it as the first city to launch his idea, Bookstop, the book superstore. Over seven years he and his colleagues developed the first chain of book superstores.

Rudzki i S-ka (Konstanty Rudzki & Co. Ltd.) was a Polish engineering and machinery company. Founded in Warsaw in 1858 as an iron foundry by a shipbuilding magnate Andrzej Artur Zamoyski and led by Konstanty Rudzki, it soon expanded into machinery, steel and engineering. By the end of the 19th century the company, with its seat in Warsaw and a large factory in Mińsk Mazowiecki, had become one of the largest and most experienced bridge construction contractors in Central and Eastern Europe, with roughly 20% of bridges constructed in the Russian Empire bearing the logo of K. Rudzki. After World War I the company declined and ceased its machinery production arm, but continued on as an engineering and construction business. It was nationalised and liquidated after World War II. Throughout its existence the company was responsible for some of the most innovative bridge undertakings in the world, including the 1914 Poniatowski Bridge, the 1916 Khabarovsk Bridge (for decades the longest bridge in Eurasia at over 2,500 metres in length) and the 1927 Maurzyce Bridge, the first welded road bridge in the world.  Names  Share of the K. Rudzki i S-ka, issued 1926 The original foundry that formed the core of the future company was named simply \\"K. Rudzki i S-ka\\" - \\"K. Rudzki and Co.\\" (S-ka being a contemporary abbreviation of the word \\"Spółka\\", meaning \\"Company\\"). When the firm expanded into engineering, machinery construction and other areas, its name was changed and until 1932 it was \\"Towarzystwo Akcyjne Fabryki Machin i Odlewów \\"K. Rudzki i Ska\\"\\", which could roughly be translated as \\"'K. Rudzki and Co.' Factory of Machinery and Casts, Joint-stock Association\\". The official name was then changed to \\"Towarzystwo Przemysłu Metalowego \\"K. Rudzki i Spółka\\" SA\\" - \\"Metal Industry Company 'K. Rudzki & Co. Ltd.'\\". Regardless of the official name of the company, the surname of its founder became almost synonymous with the company itself, especially once Konstanty Rudzki died in 1899, at the height of the company's expansion.  History  In 1858, Konstanty Rudzki, a Polish engineer with experience in Western European steel and mining industries, was tasked by Count Zamoyski with creating a foundry in Warsaw. Zamoyski needed a specialised local firm to cooperate with his expanding shipbuilding business, so he financed the creation of the foundry, named K. Rudzki and Company. Initially, the company was in fact a joint-venture of three parties. Zamoyski was the financial backer and principal client. The second party was a partnership of Jakub Baird and Samuel Hirsz Mühlrad, both managers of steel and iron mills in the Old- Polish Industrial Region. The third party was Rudzki himself, who provided the necessary know-how and whose share was to be repaid with future profits of the new company as he brought no money into the company. caisson works, pylons and bridgeheads. Pictured construction of bridge over Niemen, 1899alt=Sepia photo showing construction of a bridge across the Neman. On both sides completed parts of the bridge surrounded by wooden scaffolding are visible. In between a wooden pyramid-shaped floating crane is being assembled. The new factory, initially located at the intersection of Czerniakowska and Rozbrat Streets in Warsaw's borough of Czerniaków, in what was to become the Czerniaków Port, was among the most modern foundries in the Kingdom of Poland. The area was chosen both for its proximity to the port and the principal client, and for easy availability of workers, many of whom lived in nearby areas of Warsaw. The factory was equipped with a modern steam engine powering the fans of two cupola furnaces, while the steam in the engine was heated by the furnaces themselves. In addition, the steam engine also powered a turnery and several other mechanisms. The fuel was provided by six coke furnaces installed on the premises. In 1860 the factory had a crew of roughly 100 workers and produced all types of cast iron, copper and brass products, from agricultural machinery, through iron piping and weights, to machinery for wood, food and paper industries. In March 1860, Jakub Baird died and his assets in the company were taken over by Count Zamoyski. In 1862 he planned to unify the K. Rudzki steel works with his riverine shipyard and extend the company's existence for another 20 years, but the outbreak of the January Uprising prevented his plans from coming to life. In the aftermath of the Uprising, Zamoyski was exiled to France, and his riverine flotilla and the river shipyard were taken over by other companies. Although he remained a de jure owner of most shares of the company for a couple more years, already on 29 January 1863 both Zamoyski and Mühlrad were banned from any effective control over the company. This left Rudzki as de facto sole shareholder and the only member of the board to still have a vote. After the annexation of Congress Poland Rudzki's company survived the war and continued on without the support of its once principal client. In the late 1860s the company expanded into machinery production, with new mechanical workshops being opened. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia the \\"K. Rudzki i S-ka\\" company presented the Warszawianka, a revolutionary mechanical reaper, considered one of principal Polish inventions of the late 19th century. Workers and engineers on the construction site of a new railway bridge over the alt=A sepia photograph showing six workers standing under a wooden scaffolding erected over a pile of stones, with a trough for mixing cement visible in the centre. In 1866 Konstanty Rudzki donated part of the courtyard of the factory to the city of Warsaw and a new street was built there, since 1869 known as Fabryczna - \\"Factory Street\\". By 1873 Konstanty Rudzki was able to acquire all outstanding shares in the company for a price of 51,600 roubles. However, he over-invested and the company could not repay its debt of 12,000 roubles so in 1878 Konstanty Rudzki was forced to find new partners. Eventually he retained 52 percent of shares, with the remainder in the hands of Alfred Czarnomski, Władysław Mazurowski and Józef Korycki. Since then the company started to expand rapidly. In 1879 there were 221 workers employed in Rudzki's Warsaw works, by the end of the 19th century the number rose to 890, while value of production rose from 180,000 roubles to 2,132,000 roubles. In 1892 the company was also formally transformed into a joint stock company. alt=Sepia photograph of construction works in Vilna's borough of Zwierzyniec.

The steel, semi-circular truss construction is ready and is resting on two pylons erected in the middle of the river and surrounded by scaffolding. Under the bridge a paddle steamer is visible, as well as some wooden temporary causeways and pontoon bridges that allow access to the construction site. Initially the K. Rudzki i S-ka benefited from fast industrialisation of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1881 it obtained a patent for an innovative method of piping production, which allowed it to become one of principal contractors during the construction of Warsaw Waterworks and sewage system. Another major sector of K. Rudzki's activities was the rail roads of the Russian Empire. The company entered the market as a producer of sewage pipes for train stations, but soon expanded into bridge construction. Thanks to Konstanty Rudzki's innovative approach, his company became the only firm in the entire Russian Empire to be able to design a bridge, manufacture it, transport it to the construction site and build it in place, complete with caisson works and bridgeheads. It was also the only company in the Russian Empire to construct difficult bridges in remote locations. Between 1891 and 1899 the company constructed many railway bridges all around the Russian Empire, spanning Volga River, Amu-Daria, Amur River, Neva River, Nercha, Inga, Northern Dvina, Khor, Iman and Bikin, and many others. The main clients were the Warsaw–Terespol Railway, Siedlce-Płock Railway, Warsaw–Kalisz Railway, Perm-Kotlas Railway, Southwestern Railways in the Ukraine and Ussuri Railway. Most larger railway bridges constructed in Poland during that period were also built by K. Rudzki company, including Modlin Bridge across Bugonarew and the 1906 Zwierzyniec Bridge in Vilna (modern \\"Žvėryno tiltas\\"). Almost 20% of all bridges constructed in Russia in that period were built by Konstanty Rudzki and his engineers. The steel elements were produced entirely in a new factory constructed in Mińsk Mazowiecki. They were then transported to the final destination either by rail or by ship (from the port of Odessa, through the Suez Canal to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in the Far East, and then by river barges upstream), and then assembled by company's workers and engineers on site. To complement the bridge production, in 1897 the company founded a new bearing factory in Warsaw, along with a new cast steel factory, the first such facility in Warsaw. In 1893 Konstanty Rudzki retired from running day-to-day operations of the company, but remained its president until his death in 1899. In this last period he focused mostly on improving work and safety conditions. Among other actions he financed the creation of a shelter for elderly and disabled workers, and in 1895 he paid for all workers to be covered by an insurance policy. 20th century Poniatowski Bridge, Warsaw, built in 1904–14 In the early 20th century, the bridge construction activities expanded even further. In 1902 K. Rudzki i S-ka entered into a cartel agreement with several similar Russian firms and secured 17 percent of all bridge construction contracts in Russian Empire. Altogether in the first two decades of the 20th century the company built 5,000 metres of steel road bridges and 24,000 metres of various rail bridges for 37 different railway companies, in addition to providing them with a net of over 2 million metres of water pipelines. Among the steel bridges constructed by K. Rudzki were Warsaw's Poniatowski Bridge, but also most of Trans-Siberian Railway's river crossings, including the 1916 Khabarovsk Bridge (at over 2,500 metres of length for decades the longest bridge in Eurasia). The company also built bridges for the Orenburg-Tashkent Railway, Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, Amur Railway (all bridges on the eastern and middle sections of the line), Ussuri Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, among others. The company was also one of principal contractors during the construction of St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Warsaw (now St. Barbara's Church in Warsaw) (1894) and Hale Mirowskie (1899-1901), it also continued to produce machinery for railway companies, overhead cranes, elevators, artillery, boilers, centrifugal pumps, water turbines and many other types of machinery. It was also one of principal military contractors, producing artillery shells (since 1905), shrapnel ammunition (since 1909) and airship hangars (1914). Between 1893 and 1914 the equity of the company rose by a factor of 6, from 600,000 roubles to over 4 million. Total sale value for 1914 amounted to 11.6 million rubles. Maurzyce Bridge, built in 1929 Ralf-Stetysz car The growth of the company stopped due to the outbreak of World War I. After the war, the Russian Revolution and the Polish-Bolshevist War, the company was permanently cut off from its eastern markets and production branches of the firm never recovered. It continued as a construction and engineering company. Despite attempts at entering the automobile production market through Ralf-Stetysz cars, in 1933 the Warsaw factory was closed down completely and only the Mińsk Mazowiecki plant remained operational. The equity of the post-war company remained high nevertheless, with over 4.32 million Polish złoty in 1924. The company continued to participate in some of the most difficult engineering projects of the interbellum, including the construction of Maurzyce Bridge, the first welded road bridge in the world, in 1927. It also built the Transatlantic Radio Exchange in Stare Babice, one of the largest radio stations of the epoch. However, due in part to the Great Depression, the value of sales continued to drop, from 17.5 million złotys in revenue in 1929 to 5.7 million in 1936. The company, however, was still one of the principal bridge constructors in Poland, securing many prestigious contracts, such as the Ignacy Mościcki Bridge in Puławy. One of the last bridges completed by K. Rudzki i S-ka before the war was the Legions of Marshal Józef Piłsudski Bridge across Vistula in Płock. The difficult construction of the then-longest bridge in Poland was completed in under two years by K. Rudzki i S-ka and another company, Przedsiębiorstwo Robót Inżynieryjnych Leszek Muszyński. The bridge was opened for traffic in late 1938 and demolished only a year later, during the opening stages of the Invasion of Poland. During World War II, the factory was nationalised by Nazi Germans and given to the Krupp concern and renamed to Krupp Bridge Factory. Initially it housed a German POW camp for Polish, French and Soviet prisoners of war. With time the POW camp was moved to another place nearby, while the factory started to increasingly rely on slave labour, notably from the Mińsk Mazowiecki Ghetto. After the liquidation of the ghetto in 1942, several hundred Jewish workers remained in the former Rudzki plant, but the last 104 of them were mass murdered by the Germans on 5 June 1943. After World War II, the factory was nationalised and officially ceased to exist in 1948. Its production plant in Mińsk Mazowiecki was not damaged by the war, but was nationalised and then taken over by a new, state-owned company producing steel elements for bridge construction, overhead cranes and similar machinery. Its descendant now functions under the name of Fabryka Urządzeń Dźwigowych.

The film was directed by J.L. Freer Hunt and was a joint production among India, Germany and United Kingdom. Karma featured a four-minute kissing scene between the lead actors—Devika Rani and Rai—the longest in an Indian film. Plot The story is about a princess (played by Devika Rani) who falls in love with a neighbouring prince much to the disapproval of the latter's father. Cast * Devika Rani as The Princess * Sudha Rani as Her Companion * Himansu Rai as The Prince * Dewan Sharar as His Father, the Maharaja * Abraham Sofaer as The Holy Man * Kander as The Beggar * Anil Chakrabarti as The Beater * Ranabir Sen as His Father * Amal Banerji as The Snake Charmer Production The female lead Devika Rani, the grand niece of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore was professionally associated with Rai even before the two married in 1929. Impressed by her talent, Rai decided to cast her in the film alongside him. Abraham Sofaer was cast in a pivotal role as a \\"Holy Man\\". The screenplay was co-written by Rai and Freer Hunt. The music was composed by German composer Ernst Broadhurst. Devika Rani had recorded a song in the film including the Hindi version. Karma, an \\"Indo-German-British\\" collaboration, was released two years after the Alam Ara (1931), the first Indian talkie. Karma was made targeting the international audience. The film was entirely shot in India while the post-production process was carried out in Stoll Studios, London. The film was the first talkie produced by Rai. Release alt=Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai are seen sharing a full-mouth kiss, with Devika Rani lying on the top. The film initially premiered in London in May 1933. Devika Rani's performance was lauded by the critics in London. However, when the film was released later in Hindi as Naagan Ki Raagini, it failed to impress the Indian audience. The film was among the first in India to feature an on-screen kiss. The four-minute long scene between Devika Rani and Rai, her husband in real life, is also known to being the longest such scene in Indian cinema. Upon release, the film became controversial in the then \\"orthodox India\\" for featuring a kissing scene. Legacy Though largely ignored in India during its release, Karma is considered a landmark in Indian cinema due to its unprecedented kissing scene. In 2012, The Times of India described it as the \\"first Indian talkie with English dialogue which set all London talking\\".

It is unusual in that it is distributed over three baronies: Bunratty Lower, Clanwilliam and the barony of the City of Limerick. Besides the suburbs of the city, it also contains the villages of Ardnacrusha and Parteen. It is known for the Ardnacrusha power plant, a major hydroelectric plant. Location The parish lies on both sides of the River Shannon. As of 1845 the portion of the parish in County Limerick was partly in the borough of Limerick, where it included the Chapelry of Singland, and partly in the barony of Clanwilliam. The portion in County Clare was in the barony of Bunratty Lower, and was known as the Kilquane district. It contains the village of Ardnacrusha. The parish is and covers of the borough, of Clanwilliam and of Bunratty. The Blackwater river, which runs into the Shannon from the north, at one time powered flour mills. Ardnacrusha is the site of a major hydroelectric power plant driven by water diverted from the Shannon near Parteen Villa, and carried by canal to the site. Antiquities There are, or were, three castles. King John’s Castle was built by John, King of England (ruled 1199–1216) at Parteen on the bank of the Shannon. Castlebank, a stronghold of the Earls of Thomond that was completely ruined by 1897, was not mentioned in the list of Thomond castles of 1580. It had probably not yet been built. Dromin Castle is also not in the 1580 list. The bridge at Parteen has a Latin inscription saying it was made by Peter Creagh, son of Andrew, at the expense of the city of Limerick in 1635. In 1841 the total population was 4,132 in 656 houses. Catholic parish The name Kilquane (Cill Chuáin) means \\"church of Chuáin\\", the patron saint of the parish. The ruins of the church of Kilquane, with a graveyard beside it, stand in the townland of Kilquane near the Shannon. The site is about from the river on a low, sandy ridge that runs parallel to the river. It is flooded annually. It contains large tombs of members of the Holmes and Fitzgerald families. In 1849 Kilquane was part of the Catholic district of Parteen, which also includes the parish of Killely or Meelick. It contained the chapels of Ardnacrusha, a handsome building of hewn stone, and of Parteen. Kilquane is now in the parish of St. Patrick’s in Parteen, a parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick.

Another key aspect of anonymous social media is that content or information posted is not connected with particular online identities or profiles.  Background  Appearing very early on the web as mostly anonymous-confession websites, this genre of social media has evolved into various types and formats of anonymous self-expression. One of the earliest anonymous social media forums was 2channel, which was first introduced online on May 30, 1999, as a Japanese text board forum. With the way digital content is consumed and created continuously changing, the trending shift from web to mobile applications is also affecting anonymous social media. This can be seen as anonymous blogging, or various other format based content platforms such as nameless question and answer online platforms like Ask.fm introduce mobile versions of their services and the number of new networks joining the anonymous social sharing scene continues to grow rapidly.  Degrees of anonymity  Across different forms of anonymous social media there are varying degrees of anonymity. Some applications require users to sign up for an account, even though their profile is not linked to their posts. While these applications remain anonymous, some of these sites can sync up with the user's contact list or location to develop a context within the social community and help personalize the user's experience, such as Yik Yak or Secret. Other sites, such as 4chan and 2channel, allow for a purer form of anonymity as users are not required to create an account, and posts default to the username of 'Anonymous'. While users can still be traced through their IP address, there are anonymizing services like I2P or various proxy server services that encrypt a user's identity online by running it through different routers. Secret users must provide a phone number or email when signing up for the service, and their information is encrypted into their posts.  Controversy  Apps such as Formspring, Ask, Sarahah, Whisper, and Secret have elicited discussion around the rising popularity of anonymity apps, including debate and anticipation about this social sharing class. As more and more platforms join the league of anonymous social media, there is growing concern about the ethics and morals of anonymous social networking as cases of cyber- bullying, and personal defamation occurs. Formspring, also known as spring.me, and Ask.fm have both been associated with teen suicides as a result of cyberbullying on the sites. Formspring has been associated with at least three teen suicides and Ask.fm with at least five. For instance, the app Secret got shut down due to its escalated use of cyberbullying. The app Yik Yak has also helped to contribute to more cyberbullying situations and, in turn, was blocked on some school networks Their privacy policy meant that users could not be identified without a subpoena, search warrant, or court order. Another app called After School also sparked controversy for its app design that lets students post any anonymous content. Due to these multiple controversies, the app has been removed from both Apple and Google app stores. As the number of people using these platforms multiplies, unintended uses of the apps have increased, urging popular networks to enact in-app warnings and prohibit the use for middle and high school students. 70% of teens admit to making an effort to conceal their online behavior from their parents. Some of these apps have also been criticized for causing chaos in American schools, such as lockdowns and evacuations. In order to limit the havoc caused, anonymous apps are currently removing all abusive and harmful posts. Apps such as Yik Yak, Secret, and Whisper are removing these posts by outsourcing the job of content supervision to oversea surveillance companies. These companies hire a team of individuals to inspect and remove any harmful or abusive posts. Furthermore, algorithms are also used to detect and remove any abusive posts the individuals may have missed. Another method used by the anonymous app named Cloaq to reduce the number of harmful and abusive posts is to limit the number of users that can register during a certain period. Under this system, all contents are still available to the public, but only registered users can post. Other websites such as YouTube have gone on to create new policies regarding anonymity. YouTube now does not allow anonymous comments on videos. Users must have a Google account to like, dislike, comment or reply to comments on videos. Once a sign-in user 'likes' a video, it will be added to that user's 'Liked video playlist.' YouTube changed their 'Liked video playlist' policy in December 2019, allowing a signed-in user to keep their 'Liked video playlist' private. Historically, these controversies and the rise of cyberbullying have been blamed on the anonymous aspect of many social media platforms, but about half of US adult online harassment cases do not involve anonymity,http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/#fn-12035-1 and researchers have found that if targeted harassment exists offline it will also be found online, because online harassment is a reflection of existing prejudices.https://coralproject.net/blog/the-real-name-fallacy/  Prospective uses  There are also promising opportunities anonymous social media networks offer regarding the authentic human connection and semi-anonymous communication. For example, an app called, Memo, allows for employees of specific workplaces to anonymously tell employers and other employees how they feel in their respective workplace. This sort of safe, anonymous place allows for more transparency in the workplace among employers and employees. Other anonymous social media formats are not public and rely on controlled anonymity like tellM and Rumr. In this case, users only interact with their contact list, allowing people to connect with people they know anonymously. Another app, called Anomo, allows for users to start entirely anonymous and then as time progresses users get the option to reveal different aspects about themselves to other users. This type of range of anonymity allows users to try to get to know one another over time. With room for free expression and communication among semi-known identities, there is discussion that with this type of technology a market for political activism in other parts of the world is possible. Anonymous social media websites are used for political expression and platforms. Since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, anonymous social media websites are now a prevalent place in which political expression is asserted. Moreover, anonymous social media can also provide authentic connection to complete anonymous communication. There have been cases where these anonymous platforms have saved individuals from life-threatening situation or spread news about a social cause. Additionally, anonymous social websites also allow internet users to communicate while also safeguarding personal information from criminal actors and corporations that sell users' data. Another prospective use for anonymous social media is content creation. For example, a study done in 2017 found that about 700,000 unique images had been posted on 4chan's /pol/ board during their study period out of a 1 million studied imagesHine, G., Onaolapo, J., De Cristofaro, E., Kourtellis, N., Leontiadis, I., Samaras, R., . . . Blackburn, J. (2016). Kek, Cucks, and God Emperor Trump: A Measurement Study of 4chan's Politically Incorrect Forum and Its Effects on the Web. suggesting that anonymous social networks can serve as a platform for users to contribute unique digital content. Revenue generated by anonymous social media =Anonymous apps= Generating revenue from anonymous apps has been a discussion for investors. Since little information is collected about the users, it is difficult for anonymous apps to advertise to users. However some apps, such as Whisper, have found a method to overcome this obstacle. They have developed a “keyword-based” approach, where advertisements are shown to users depending on certain words they type. Another app named Yik Yak has been able to capitalize on the features they provide. Anonymous apps such a Chrends take the approach of using anonymity to provide freedom of speech.https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/want- freedom-of-speech-theres-an-app-for-that-9650215.html Telephony app Burner has regularly been a top grossing utilities app in the iOS and Android app stores using its phone number generation technology.https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/18/7414869/burner-phone-theres-an- app-for-that Despite the success of some anonymous apps, there are also apps, such as Secret, which have yet to find a way to generate revenue. The idea of an anonymous app has also caused mixed opinions within investors. Some investors have invested a large sum of money because they see the potential revenue generated within these apps. Other investors have stayed away from investing these apps because they feel these apps bring more harm than good. =Anonymous sites= There are several of sources to generate revenue for anonymous social media sites. One source of revenue is by implementing programs such as a premium membership or a gift-exchanging program. Another source of revenue is by merchandising goods and specific usernames to users. In addition, sites such as FMyLife, have implemented a policy where the anonymous site will receive 50% of profit from apps that makes money off it. In terms of advertisements, some anonymous sites have had troubles implementing or attracting them. There are several reasons for this problem. Anonymous sites, such as 4chan, have received few advertisement offers due to some of the contents it generates. Other anonymous sites, such as Reddit, have been cautious in implementing them in order to maintain their user base. Despite the lack of advertisements on certain anonymous sites, there are still anonymous sites, such as SocialNumber, that support the idea.

Prior to that, Kollam was considered one of the four early entrepots in the global sea trade around the 13th century, along with Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, the Chinese city of Quanzhou, and Malacca in the Malaysian archipelago. The port was founded by Mar Abo with sanction from Udayamarthandavarma the Tamil king of the Venad in 825 as an alternative to reopening the inland seaport of Kore-ke-ni Kollam near Backare (Thevalakara) also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and the Greeks and Thondi to the Tamils and is also the foundation of the new city. It is also believed that Mar Abo actually volunteered to the Chera king to create a new seaport town near at Kollam instead of his request for renewing the almost vanishing Tyndis or Nelcynda inland seaport ( kore-ke-ni) at Kollam, lying idle without trade for a few centuries because of the Cheras being overrun by Pallavas in the 6th century AD ending the spice trade from Malabar coast.

The Great Sea Shipping Company will also berth at the port soon, carrying cashew from Kochi.Shipping companies evince interest in Kollam Port After modernization of the port, the first foreign ship anchored in the port on 4 April 2014.Foreign Ship Reaches Kollam Port Now it is proven that huge foreign ships can easily operate from Kollam Port. The tugs MT Chaliyar and MT Kerala along with a new German-made Rs. 12 crore crane is used for the maritime operations in the port. A distant view of Kollam Port from Thangassery harbour  Layout  The wharf at Kollam Port is in length and wide with an available draught of , whereby vessels up to 15,000 DWT can berth directly. Dredging works are underway at the port to increase the draught to at a cost of Rs.5.7 crores so that ships of and above can easily anchor without the need to travel further to Kochi, Thoothukudi or Chennai. The wharf is protected from the waves by a seaboard breakwater and a leeward breakwater. The length of the wharf will be increased to in due course. In 2007, Kollam Port handled about 500,000 tonnes of cargo.V.S to Inaugurate Kollam Port  Hinterland and cargo  Capture of Kollam in 1661 Kollam in the 1800s The primary hinterland of Kollam Port extends to Pathanamthitta and the southern parts of the Kottayam and Idukki districts; the central and southern parts of Alappuzha district, Kollam district and Thiruvananthapuram district with the Kanyakumari-Tirunelveli- Madurai and Teni districts of Tamil Nadu. Commodities currently handled or planned for the port include marble, tiles, sand, titanium ore, cashew nuts, kernels and nut shell liquid, seafood, clay, timber logs, sillimanite, titanium dioxide, blood products, newsprint and waste paper, cement, urea and muriate of potash for fertilizer, rubber, food, agricultural products and cement as well as other commodities and products for local companies such as Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Trivandrum and Kerala Minerals and Metals.  Development and modernisation  A dredger ship washed ashore at Mundakkal Beach, 2km away from Kollam Port Several major modernization projects have been proposed for Kollam with Maldives port in order to transform it into the \\"port city of Kerala\\". Projects already planned are some of the largest ever mooted for the state. A facelift of the Maruthadi-Iravipuram area will be carried out by the government as part of the \\"Kollam Port City\\" project and will include facilities for sports, fishing, tourism and entertainment. Dredging works are going on for increasing the depth of the port, so that huge ships can easily anchor at the port. As part of the modernization, Government of Kerala have already established a Maritime Institute at Neendakara in Kollam city ;Funding Port of Kollam The Indian State Cabinet approved a detailed project report to develop the port in April 2012. Split into two phases, the first will require an investment of Rs 1.11 billion and the second Rs 12.5 billion. The government has already invested Rs 7.106 billion as part of the first phase. A wharf will be laid out to the southeast of the port in the second stage of development. A wharf with the capacity to accommodate six ships at a time is also planned. ;EDI and online customs clearance facilities Dredger ships anchored at Kollam Port Kollam Port is one of the two ports in Kerala that have the facility to provide online customs clearance at the port with the help of Electronic data interchange (EDI). Kollam Port's EDI locator code is INKUK1. The Electronic Data Interface (EDI) facility of the Customs at the Kollam Port was commissioned on 6 January 2016 and this had enabled importers and exports to handle consignments meant for Kollam from anywhere in the world. The facility with a particular code was available round the clock. It replaced the manual system for Customs clearance at the port. With the help of this technology, import and export details of goods, tax amounts and payments will be converted into electronic format. This will enable smooth and speedy transportation of goods through the port. To facilitate this move, a high-speed dedicated Multiprotocol Label Switching enabled internet connection has been implemented at the port. Kollam will become the second port in Kerala to offer EDI enabled technology allowing it to offer more convenient container handling and transportation activities than Kochi Port and Tuticorin Port as the export-import rates at Kollam Port are significantly lower. There is also a proposal to export food products to The Maldives from Kollam Port. Online Customs Clearance Facility for Kollam Port to be ready in a month ;Co- operation with Tuticorin Port As Kochi Port is approaching full capacity, the port department of Kerala and the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI) have decided to cooperate with Tuticorin Port to import raw cashews for Kollam based cashew factories. According to the plan, raw cashews will arrive at Tuticorin Port and then be trans-shipped to Kollam Port aboard small container ships. There is also a plan to set up a quarantine facility and cashew testing lab at the port with the support of CEPCI. Kollam Port for tourism enthusiasts too ;Vessel tracking and monitoring system (VTMS) The Ports Department of the Kerala Government has sanctioned Rs.28.8 million to install a vessel Tracking and Monitoring System (VTMS) at the port. Rs 2.88 cr Sanctioned ;Cruise ship and hovercraft services Water tank inside the Port The Ports Department together with Customs Officers and tour operators agreed to start Kollam-based cruise operations from April 2014. Initially, domestic only services are on offer although these may later be expanded to international services. Tour operators agree that the port has the potential for international cruise operations because of the tourism potential of the surrounding areas and have stated that the infrastructure of the port meets the requirements for cruise operations. They have also explored the possibilities of starting hovercraft services from the port. The plan is to start with a Kollam-Kochi service taking about three hours and 20 minutes to cover the distance. ;Industrial Development Zones The government of Kerala has decided on industrial development projects around airports and ports in Kerala. Projects in the port area will be carries out with the help of the Infrastructure Development Finance Company. Industrial Development Zones will be set up in districts such as Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur and Kollam, which have either ports or airports. Townships will also be built adjacent to these facilities ;New Passenger Terminal and Cargo Terminal Passenger terminal under construction Chief Minister Oommen Chandy inaugurated the construction works of new Passenger Terminal at Kollam Port on 14 August 2015. Opening of National Waterway-3 connecting Kollam city will invite more passengers to Kollam. Moreover, the new passenger terminal at Kollam Port aiming Lakshadweep Government's plans to start passenger ship services to Kollam city, as Kollam city is very close to Minicoy compared to Kochi. ;International ship arrived with raw cashews 'Intermarine', an international vessel from Singapore has anchored at Port of Kollam with 5,600 tonnes of raw cashew from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau on 30 August 2015, after a long gap of 47 years. This opened ways for Kollam Port to provide needed facilities for international huge vessels and has popped up the cashew industry in Kollam city. The direct deal between Kollam Port and international raw cashew exporters from Africa have given new hopes for giant cashew business groups in Kollam city, as a full load of raw cashew container can be transferred from Kollam Port to the processing units for a cost of Rs. 3000-4000. Earlier it was Rs. 17000-18000 for transferring from Kochi Port/Tuticorin Port to Kollam. ;Weekly service to Kochi International Container Transshipment Terminal In January 2016, a weekly service connecting Port of Kollam with International Container Transshipment Terminal in Kochi has been started in order to boost the cashew trade and other businesses in Kollam city and neighbouring places. The first feeder ship from Tanzania with 30 container loads of raw cashew had been docked at Kollam on 6 January 2016. The containers were loaded on the feeder vessel from a ship that arrived at Vallarpadam with the consignment from Tanzania. This service is expected to benefit customers as cargo landing in Kollam will ensure better visibility and control over inventory, besides saving cost. Since Kollam Port is the only modern port with all needed facilities in South Kerala, the feeder service will also benefit the traders and businessmen in Trivandrum, Pathanamthitta, Nagercoil, Marthandam and Kanyakumari with low-cost goods transportation and export-import facilities from Kollam Port. The introduction of the shipping facility from Kollam will enable processors to cut costs to some extent. It will also serve to ease congestion on roads. ;Port complex Minister K. Babu laid the foundation stone for the Kollam port complex worth Rs.5-crore on 14 January 2016. ;Commencement of Roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) ship service MV Maria, a 160-metre long Ro-Ro ship with a capacity to carry up to 150 loaded trucks and 210 cars, anchored at Kollam Port on 17 March 2016 from New Mangalore Port. This is the first ro-ro ship to call at any port in Kerala. ;Passenger ship service to Lakshadweep Islands In October 2016, Kerala Ports Minister Kadannappalli Ramachandran announced passenger ship services from Kollam Port and Azheekal Port to Lakshadweep for opening up two new spokes connecting the islands with the mainland. Officials from Government of Kerala and Kollam Municipal Corporation is expected to visit Minicoy, the southernmost atoll of Lakshadweep soon, to study the potential of the proposed ferry service to Kollam city. Plans of health department authorities are underway to bring visitors from Maldives and Lakshadweep to Kollam to make them aware of efficient but cheap medical facilities available here. ;Kerala Coastal Highway project Kollam Port Road at Tangasseri. This road would become part of the coastal highway once materialized The Government of Kerala has approved a 6,500 crores worth Coastal Highway project for the state. The highway will pass through almost all the major coastal cities in Kerala including Kollam. The coastal highway passes through nine districts of the state, connecting the major ports of Vallarpadom, Kollam, Vizhinjam in Kerala along with several minor ports. ;Kollam-Colombo ship service In 2018 October, Senior Director of the Singapore based X-Press Feeders Group, Nelson Sekera, met the Kerala Minister for Port Kadannappalli Ramachandran at Asramam Government Guest House and expressed their willingness to start Colombo-Kollam ship services. X-Press Feeders is owing nearly 100 ships.  Services available at port  Some of the international shipping service providers have already started operations at Kollam Port for facilitating freight transfer to-and-fro Kollam Port, Ship Chandling, Ship Husbandry Services, Ship Spares Logistics, Bunkering Services etc. Pax Shipping, a private Indian shipping company has already started their operations at Kollam city offering Shipping and Port agency services and Ship Chandling which are the prime services required by ships while anchoring at any ports.  Kollam Inland Port  There is an inland terminal of Inland Waterways Authority of India situated at Asramam on National Waterway 3 in Ashtamudi Lake. This port is mainly for handling barges. It has a 30 m RCC jetty for berthing and has an 18 T Mobile Hydraulic Crane and three fork lifts. It has an office space of 100 sq. metres and covered storage space of 280 sq. metres. The total open storage is 3500 sq. metres. It is yet to begin full fledged commercial operations. This terminal can be connected to sea port through inland waterways at Kochupilamoodu in Kollam Port Road through Kollam Canal.

This concept is frequently used to explain the degree of institutional diversity that can be observed across and within socio-economic systems, and its consequences on economic performance. In particular, the concept of institutional complementarity has been used to illustrate why institutions are resistant to change and why introducing new institutions into a system often leads to unintended, sometimes suboptimal, consequences.Gagliardi, F. (2014). A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature on Institutional Complementarities, Mimeo. Approaches, based on the concept of institutional complementarities, have found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity. After a brief description of the canonical formal representation of institutional complementarity, the most relevant domains of applications will be discussed. Models of institutional complementarity The concept of institutional complementarity has deep roots in the social sciences.Lachmann, L.M. (1979), The legacy of Max Weber, Heinemann, London. Whereas the sociological approach of the interdependence of different institutions has left the actions of the individuals largely outside the analysis, the modern approach, developed mainly by economists, has been based on the analysis of the constraints facing the actions of the individuals acting in different domains of choice. This approach has found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity. The canonical model of institutional complementarity is due to Masahiko AokiAoki, M. (2001), Towards a comparative institutional analysis, MIT Press, Cambridge. and relies on the theory of supermodular games developed by Paul Milgrom and John Roberts.Milgrom P, Roberts J (1990) Rationalizability, lerning and equilibrium in games with strategic complementarities. Econometrica 58(6): 1255–1277. The basic structure of the model takes the following form. Consider a setting with two institutional domains, and , and two sets of agents, and that do not directly interact with each other. Nevertheless, an institution implemented in one domain parametrically affects the consequences of the actions taken in the other domain. For instance, can be associated with the type of ownership structure prevailing in a given country and with the structure of labour rights. For simplicity we assume that the technological and natural environment is constant. Suppose that the agents in domain can choose a rule from two alternative options: and ; similarly, agents in domain can choose a rule from either or . For simplicity, let us assume that all agents in each domain have an identical payoff function or defined on binary choice sets of their own, either or , with another sets as the set of parameters. We say that an (endogenous) “rule” is institutionalized in a domain when it is implemented as an equilibrium choice of agents in the relevant domains. Suppose that the following conditions hold: : u(A^1; B^1) - u(A^2; B^1) \\\\geq u(A^1; B^2) - u(A^2; B^2) : v(B^2; A^2) - v(B^1; A^2) \\\\geq v(B^2; A^1) - v(B^1; A^1) for all and . The latter are the so-called supermodular (complementarity) conditions. The first condition implies that the “incremental” benefit for the agents in from choosing rather than increases as their institutional environment in is rather than . The second condition implies that the incremental benefit for agents in from choosing rather than increases if their institutional environment in is rather than . Note that these conditions are concerned with the property of incremental payoffs with respect to a change in a parameter value. They do not exclude the possibility that the level of payoff of one rule is strictly higher than that of the other for the agents of one or both domain(s) regardless of the choice of rule in the other domain. In such a case the preferred rule(s) will be implemented autonomously in the relevant domain, while the agents in the other domain will choose the rule that maximizes their payoffs in response to their institutional environment. Then the equilibrium of the system comprising and – and thus the institutional arrangement across them – is uniquely determined by preference (technology). However, there can also be cases in which neither rule dominates the other in either domain in the sense described above. If so, the agents in both domains need to take into account which rule is institutionalized in the other domain. Under the supermodularity condition there can then be two pure Nash equilibria (institutional arrangements) for the system comprising and , namely and . When such multiple equilibria exist, we say that and , as well as and , are “institutional complements”. If institutional complementarity exists, each institutional arrangement characterizes as a self-sustaining equilibrium where no agent has an inventive to deviate. It terms of welfare, it may be the case that possible overall institutional arrangements are not mutually Pareto comparable, or that one of them could be even Pareto suboptimal to the other. In these cases history is the main force determining which type of institutional arrangements is likely to emerge, with the consequence that suboptimal outcomes are possible. Suppose for instance that is a Pareto- superior institutional arrangement in which and . However, for some historical reason is chosen in domain and becomes an institutional environment for domain . Faced with this institutional environment agents in domain will correspondingly react by choosing reason . Thus the Pareto-suboptimal institutional arrangement will result. This is an instance of coordination failure in the presence of indivisibility. Obviously, there can also be cases where but . This is an instance where the two viable institutional arrangements cannot be Pareto ranked. Agents exhibit conflicting interests in the two equilibria and the emergence of one institutional arrangement as opposed to the other may depend on the distribution of decisional power. If for some reasons agents choosing in domain A have the power to select and enforce their preferred rule, arrangement is the most likely outcome. Alternatively, agents choosing in domain B will force the society to adopt . Applications Ugo Pagano and Robert Rowthorn Pagano U (1992) Organizational equilibria and production efficiency. Metroeconomica 43: 227–246.Pagano U, Rowthorn R (1994) Ownership, technology and institutional stability. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 5(2): 221–242. present one of the earliest analytical contribution to institutional complementarity. In their models the technological choices take as parameters property rights arrangements whereas the latter are made on the basis of given technologies. The complementarities of technologies and property rights create two different sets of organizational equilibria. For instance, strong rights of the capital owners and a technology with a high intensity of specific and difficult to monitor capital are likely be institutional complements and define one possible organizational equilibrium. However, also strong workers' rights and a technology characterized by a high intensity of highly specific labor can be institutional complements and define an alternative organizational equilibrium. The organizational equilibria approach integrate the approach of Oliver Williamson,Williamson O E (1985) The economic institutions of capitalism. The Free Press, New York. which have pointed out the influence of technology on rights and safeguards, and the views of the Radical Economists,Braverman H (1974) Labor and monopoly capital: The degradation of work in the twentieth century. Monthly Review Press, New York who have stressed the opposite direction of causation. The complementarities existing in the different organizational equilibria integrate both directions of causation in a single analytical framework. A similar approach has been used to explain organizational diversity in knowledge-intensive industries, such as software.Landini F (2012) Technology, property rights and organizational diversity in the software industry. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 23(2): 137-150.Landini F (2013) Institutional change and information production. Journal of Institutional Economics 9(3): 257-284. Institutional complementarities characterize also the relations between intellectual property and human capital investments. Firms owning much intellectual property enjoy a protection for their investments in human capital, which in turn favor the acquisition of additional intellectual property. By contrast other firms may find themselves in a vicious circle where the lack of intellectual property inhibits the incentive to invest in human capital and low levels of human capital investments involve that little or no intellectual property is ever acquired.Pagano U, Rossi M. A. (2004) Incomplete contracts, intellectual property and institutional complementarities. European Journal of Law and Economics 18(1): 55–67. Less formal approaches to institutional complementarities have also been adopted. In their seminal contribution Peter A. Hall and David SoskiceHall P A, Soskice D (2001) Varieties of capitalism: The institutional foundations of comparative advantage. Oxford University Press, New York. develop a broad theoretical framework to study the institutional complementarities that characterize different Varieties of Capitalism. Having a specific focus on the institutions of the political economy the authors develop an actor-centered approach for understanding the institutional similarities and differences among the developed economies.

Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 2(1): 43-80. In these works institutional complementarity is often presented as a conservative factor, which increases the stability of the institutional equilibrium.Pagano U (2011) Interlocking complementarities and institutional change. Journal of Institutional Economics 7(3): 373–392. In presence of institutional complementarity change requires the simultaneous variation of different institutional domains, which in turn demands high coordination among the actors involved. Sometime, institutions themselves can act as resources for new courses of action that (incrementally) favor change.Deeg R, Jackson G (2007) Towards a more dynamic theory of capitalist variety. Socio-Economic Review 5(1): 149-179. Alongside contributions on the distinct models of capitalism, the concept institutional complementarity has found application also in other domain of analysis.

A typical kawaii metal composition combines the instrumentation found in various types of heavy metal music with J-pop melodies and a Japanese idol aesthetic. Kawaii metal's lyrical topics are often less hostile than those of other heavy metal genres. The Japanese girl group Babymetal is often credited with the creation and success of kawaii metal. In addition to Babymetal, kawaii metal acts such as Ladybaby have garnered media attention, as well as minor commercial attention, for performing songs of this genre.  History and characteristics  Kawaii metal pioneers Babymetal, performing in The O2 Arena London in 2016. Japanese heavy metal idol group Babymetal are considered the inventors of the kawaii metal genre. Angelica Wallingford of City Times opined that Babymetal's eponymous debut album had pioneered the kawaii metal musical genre. Wallingford also defined the genre, and album, as a \\"mixture of varying genres including pop, rock, heavy metal, electronic dance music, industrial and symphonic death metal\\". A guest contributor at The Independent believed that the genre was a derivative of J-pop and various extreme metal genres, namely \\"speed metal, power metal, black metal, and industrial metal\\".

A few days later in an article in The Globe and Mail, Black described the changes he envisioned to the \\"overwhelming avalanche of soft, left, bland, envious pap which has poured like sludge through the centre pages of most of the Southam papers for some time.\\" Mills' plan called for less reliance on government and news-wire services in favour of original, authoritative content about local issues or industries that were of interest to readers. Neil Reynolds was hired as the Citizen's editor in December 1996 as part of the change. 2002 dismissal controversy In 2002, Mills (then 57) was dismissed from the Citizen by CanWest Global Communications Corporation, following a publication of a story critical of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and an editorial calling for Chrétien's resignation. The story was published the same day that CanWest Global chairman Izzy Asper had a meeting with Chrétien at the Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner. Mills claimed that he was dismissed because he failed to obtain approval from CanWest before publishing the editorial. However, CanWest's Leonard Asper, who was interviewed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, said that the termination of Mills was a result of multiple violations over a period of time of principles and policies that had been set out for, and developed collaboratively with, the editors & publishers of their newspapers. Also, that he had allowed his editorial opinion to affect the news coverage at the Citizen and that under his leadership, the paper had become \\"homogeneous\\". The dismissal generated a strong reaction in the Ottawa community and throughout Canada over concerns of press freedom and independence from corporate influence. On the day after the firing, former Councillor Karin Howard organized a protest in front of the Citizen building where five prominent individuals spoke against the firing.\\" Reporters at the Citizen withheld their bylines from stories, Ottawa city council members denounced the firing, and some members of Parliament called for an investigation into the relationship between CanWest and Chrétien's Liberal Party government. Within a week of his dismissal, 5,000 subscriptions were cancelled. In Parliament, NDP leader Alexa McDonough stated: \\"Russell Mills was fired because the Prime Minister's buddy happened to be his boss... That is downright dangerous to democracy. We need a full public inquiry into media concentration, ownership and convergence.\\" Post-journalism After dismissal from the Ottawa Citizen, Mills became a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. In 2002, Mills received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Carleton University for services to the community and the newspaper industry; he was also awarded with the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal for services to Canada. Mills joined Algonquin College in 2003 as Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Media and Design. In 2007, Mills was appointed (and reappointed in 2012) chairman of the National Capital Commission (NCC). The NCC is responsible for planning and participating in the development, conservation, and improvement of Canada's capital region. Before his appointment, Mills had criticized NCC for its secrecy. Mills is president of the Michener Awards Foundation for public service journalism, a director of the Canadian Film Institute and of the Canadian Battlefields Foundation and an adjudicator on the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council.

Biography Beattie-Brown was born in the parish of Haddington in 1831, was son of Adam Brown, farmer, and Ann Beattie. He removed at an early age to Edinburgh and was educated at Leith High School. Having early shown a taste for art, he was apprenticed as a glass -stainer to the well-known firm of Messrs. Ballantine, and here his artistic tastes were so rapidly developed that before his apprenticeship was completed he entered the Trustees' Art Academy, then under the charge of Robert Scott Lauder. Among his fellow- students of this period and companions of a later time were William Bell Scott, Horatio MacCulloch, Sam Bough, and George Paul Chalmers. In 1848, when seventeen years of age, he exhibited a picture, ' On the Forth,' at the Royal Scottish Academy, and from that time till his death he was always represented at the annual exhibitions. His skill and accuracy as a draughtsman led to his being employed to make illustrations for several medical works ; and his care and discretion as an artist brought him much employment in restoring pictures for Henry Doig, art-dealer, Edinburgh, whose daughter he married in 1858. To extend his experience he studied for a long time in Belgium, there using water-colour as his principal medium, though his chief work was done in oil- colour. He found English subjects for his pictures in Surrey, Kent, and Yorkshire, but his main themes were Scottish highland landscapes. He was a pioneer among the Scottish 'out-of-door' artists, frequently completing his pictures directly from nature a practice which explains his vigour and realism. In 1871 he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy, and in 1884 an academician. His diploma picture, dated 1883, is a characteristic highland landscape, 'Coire-na-Faireamh,' now in the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh. Representative works by him are in the public galleries at Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham, and Bolton. He was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy, London, and also at Glasgow and other Scottish exhibitions. In his later years he adopted a more glowing scheme of colour than in his earlier work ; but his pictures were always noticeable for their realistic line and tone, and for their technical excellence. Beattie-Brown died at Edinburgh on 31 March 1909. By his wife Esther Love Doig, he had three sons and six daughters. The eldest son, H. W. Jennings Brown (1862–1898), showed promise as a portrait and figure-painter.

Biography Crawford was born at Cowden, near Dalkeith, in 1806. He was the son of a land surveyor, and when a boy was apprenticed to a house-painter in Edinburgh, but having evinced a decided taste and ability for art, his engagement was cancelled, and he entered the Trustees' Academy under Andrew Wilson, where he had for fellow-students David Octavius Hill, Robert Scott Lauder, and others. William Simson, who was one of the older students, became his most intimate friend and acknowledged master, and from their frequent sketching expeditions together Crawford imbibed many of the best qualities of that able artist. His early efforts in art were exhibited in the Royal Institution, and his first contributions to the annual exhibition of the Royal Scottish Academy appeared in 1831, two of these being taken from lowland scenery in Scotland, and the third being the portrait of a lady. Although not one of the founders of the Academy, Crawford was one of its earliest elected members. His name appears in the original list of associates, but having withdrawn from the body before its first exhibition, it was not until 1839 that he became an associate. Meanwhile, he visited the Netherlands, whither he went several times afterwards, and studied very closely the Dutch masters, whose influence in forming his picturesque style was seen in nearly all that he painted. The ample materials which he gathered in that country and in his native land afforded subjects for a long series of landscapes and coast scenes, chiefly, however, Scottish; but it was not till 1848, in which year he was elected an academician, that he produced his first great picture, ‘Eyemouth Harbour,’ and this he rapidly followed up with other works of high quality which established his reputation as one of the greatest masters of landscape-painting in Scotland. Among these were a ‘View on the Meuse,’ ‘A Fresh Breeze,’ ‘River Scene and Shipping, Holland,’ ‘Dutch Market Boats,’ ‘French Fishing Luggers,’ ‘Whitby, Yorkshire,’ and ‘Hartlepool Harbour.’ He also painted in water-colours, usually working on light brown crayon paper, and using body-colour freely. He practised also at one time very successfully as a teacher of art. The only picture which he contributed to a London exhibition was a ‘View of the Port and Fortifications of Callao, and Capture of the Spanish frigate Esmeralda,’ at the Royal Academy in 1836. The characteristics of his art are those of what may be termed the old school of Scottish landscape-painting. This was not so realistic in detail as the modern school, but was perhaps wider in its grasp, and strove to give impressions of nature rather than the literal truth. In 1858 Crawford left Edinburgh and settled at Lasswade, but he continued to contribute regularly to the annual exhibitions of the Academy till 1877, maintaining to the last the high position he had gained early in life. He was at one time a keen sportsman with both rod and gun. He died at Lasswade 27 September 1885, after having for many years suffered much and lived in the closest retirement. He was buried in the new cemetery at Dalkeith. A ‘Coast Scene, North Berwick,’ and ‘Close Hauled; crossing the Bar,’ by him, are in the National Gallery of Scotland. He is buried in Dalkeith Cemetery against the west wall.

They work together in commercial and personal projects. Their work has been published in books and international fashion magazines. Paris by Luciana Val & Franco Musso  Biography  Luciana Val and Franco Musso first met while studying at the Manuel Belgrano Fine Arts School in Buenos Aires. They took part in several art exhibitions after graduating and became involved in photography both as a work of art and a line of work. They were soon introduced to the fashion world and began shooting both editorial and advertising in Buenos Aires, where they quickly became known for their unique style. Luciana worked as photography editor at Superlab magazine, an independent publication that appeared during the 90's while Franco Musso started a modelling career that sent him abroad to work in campaigns and fashion shows.  Paris  Val and Musso moved to Paris in 2002, following the economic crisis in their country. In 2004 they won the 19th Festival international de mode et de photographie à Hyères with a series of surrealist miniature still life. Since then, their work has been widely published in magazines such as: 10 Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue Italia, Japanese Vogue, Numéro, Numéro Tokyo, Russian Vogue, The Sunday Times, The New York Times, Vanity Fair UK, Vogue Turkey and V Magazine. Their style has been sought after for the advertising campaigns of luxury and fashion clients like Cartier, Chanel, Dior Joaillerie, Dom Perignon, Givenchy, Gucci, Kate Spade, Lanvin, L’Oréal Le Printemps, Louis Vuitton, Piper by Victor & Rolf, Repetto, Roger Vivier and Yves Saint Laurent, among others. In 2009 they were commissioned to create the photography for the sixth studio album by French electronic music duo Air. In 2012 Val and Musso shot the 111th Anniversary Collection for Bergdorf Goodman.  Alice in Wonderland  They collaborate frequently with Argentine fashion designers Vero Ivaldi and Pablo Ramírez, with whom they worked for the Alice in Wonderland project that accompanied the release of the film by Tim Burton of the same name. The resulting photographs were displayed during Buenos Aires Fashion Week and later auctioned for the Make a Wish foundation.  Buenos Aires' first fashion retrospective  Over the months of July and August 2013 the city of Buenos Aires held its first great fashion design retrospective at the Centro Cultural Recoleta by the name \\"De Gino Bogani al diseño de autor\\". Val and Musso were approached to create the images that would illustrate the exhibition, along with over 100 dresses and accessories. The show focused on the career of Gino Bogani, whose elaborate and over-the-top creations have dressed Argentine celebrities for the last decades and also included pieces from a wide array of designers, ranging from established and commercial to emerging and experimental ones. The exhibit was seen by over fifty thousand visitors and a book containing the photographs created by Luciana and Franco was published.  Recent work  The year 2014 found them showing their work at the Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires, in Eduardo Costa’s restaging of Fashion Fiction, and opening an individual exhibition called Lullaby at the Galerie Madé in Paris. In April 2015 they participated in a retrospective celebrating the 30th anniversary of Hyères’ International Festival of Fashion and Photography. Later that year, they prepared a huge exhibition showcasing their collaborations with fashion designer Pablo Ramírez. Under the name Magia Negra (Black Magic), this exhibit featured photographs, garments and video. It first opened at the Osde Foundation in the Argentine city of Rosario and afterwards it travelled to the foundation’s main building in Buenos Aires, gathering great levels of attendance and media coverage in both cities.

Biography Van der Lugt was born into a banker's family and grew up in Amsterdam. His father was Godefridus Wilhelmus Antonius van der Lugt, president of the Nederlandsche Landbouwbank. His brother Godfried van der Lugt became a top executive with the Postbank and later the ING Group. Van der Lugt studied as a psychotherapist but left the Netherlands for the Middle East in the 1960s, where he joined the Jesuits and spent two years in Lebanon where he studied Arabic. In 1966 he went to Syria, where he lived for nearly fifty years. Van der Lugt started a community center and farm in 1980, the Al-Ard Center, just outside the city of Homs. The farm had vineyards and gardens in which much of the work was done by people with disabilities, providing an unprecedented resource in a society in which such people are usually hidden from view. In reconciling people from different religious backgrounds, van der Lugt emphasised the humanity of people as the common ground, rather than stressing commonality in the theologies of different faiths. He saw connection with the earth as part of a common bond. To this end, he conducted annual eight-day treks across the mountains for teenagers of all faiths. After the siege of Homs, van der Lugt cared for the sick and the hungry. He gained international exposure at the beginning of 2014 when he made a number of YouTube videos, asking the international community for help for the citizens of the besieged city. He refused to leave, despite the dangerous situation. In February, The Economist reported that he was probably the last European in the city and stayed because he was \\"the shepherd of [his] flock\\": He declined being evacuated during a UN operation in 2014 that saved 1400 people from the besieged city. Van der Lugt was known for helping Christians and Muslims alike; the Al-Ard Center aimed to foster dialog between people of different faiths. In an interview in 2012, he explained how they held a church service after a bombardment; by this time, he said, all the Catholics had left, leaving only Orthodox Christians and Muslims to celebrate Palm Sunday in his church. The imam preached at the service. Van der Lugt later said that the sermon had removed from him any residual tendencies to place emphasis on dogma. =Death and reactions= He was shot around 09:30 am on Monday, 7 April 2014, aged 75. According to the governor of Homs Governorate, Talal al-Barazi, he was murdered by extremists from the Al-Nusra Front. He was the second foreign-born Jesuit in that area to fall victim to the Syrian civil war: Paolo Dall'Oglio was kidnapped in 2013. A Vatican spokesperson \\"expressed 'great pain' over his death\\", according to the BBC, and the Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans called his murder \\"cowardly\\". Pope Francis appealed to end violence in Syria upon van der Lugt's death, saying: > Last Monday in Homs, Syria, the Rev. Fr. Frans van der Lugt was > assassinated, a Dutch Jesuit brother of mine, 75 years old, who arrived in > Syria about 50 years ago; he always did good to all, with gratitude and > love, and therefore he was loved and respected by Christians and Muslims. > His brutal murder has filled me with deep pain and it made me think of a lot > of people still suffering and dying in that tormented country, my beloved > Syria, already too long in the throes of a bloody conflict, which continues > to reap death and destruction. I also think of the many people abducted, > both Christians and Muslims, in Syria and in other countries as well, among > which are bishops and priests.

Built about 1837, it is a well-preserved example of a mid-19th century Cape-style house, that is relatively architecturally undistinguished. It is significant for its association with George Hoyt Whipple (1878–1976), a Nobel Prize-winning doctor and pathologist who was born here. Whipple gave the house to the town in 1970, and it is now operated by the Ashland Historical Society as a museum, open during the warmer months. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Whipple House is located on a residential street in the village of Ashland, on the west side of Pleasant Street south of Main Street. It is a 1½-story brick building, with a gabled roof, two end chimneys, and a wood- frame ell to the rear. Its front facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance, and a pair of gabled two- window dormers in the roof face. The entrance is recessed under a segmented- arch opening, along with flanking sidelight and transom windows. The interior follows a center hall plan, with two rooms on either side of the main hall and in the attic. The ell houses the kitchen on the ground floor and bedrooms above. The house was built about 1837, and is a good example of a traditional colonial form, the Cape-style house, adapted to the then-modern heating method of wood stoves instead of open fireplaces. It is here that George Hoyt Whipple was born in 1878, and the house remained in the family until he donated it to the town for use as a museum. Whipple was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1934 (along with two others) for his work in developing an understanding and cure for pernicious anemia, and did much groundbreaking work to improve the understanding of human liver function.

He was a member of the noble family of the Aspietai, which claimed descent from the Arsacid royal dynasty of Armenia. Aspietes is first attested alongside Alexios I during the 1081 campaign against the Normans that led to the disastrous Battle of Dyrrhachium, where Aspietes himself was gravely injured. The scene is graphically narrated by Alexios' daughter Anna Komnene in her Alexiad, highlighting Aspietes' valour. The name \\"Aspietes\\" appears in two different portions of the Alexiad, and it is not entirely clear whether it refers to the same or different people. Most scholars identify the Aspietes of Dyrrhachium with the Aspietes who in 1105/6 was appointed governor of Tarsus by the Emperor. Shortly after, he succeeded Monastras as stratopedarches of the East, in charge of the campaign against the Principality of Antioch. In this capacity he failed to react effectively to Tancred of Antioch, who proceeded to recapture Mopsuestia and several other fortresses that Monastras had taken the previous year. Instead, Aspietes occupied himself with debauched revelries. More recently, Alexis Savvides argued that the two personages are usually treated as distinct people, and interpreted—erroneously, according to Alexandra Wassiliou-Seibt—the relevant passage in the Alexiad as indicating that the first Aspietes died of his wounds at Dyrrhachium. Aspietes is not mentioned again after 1105/6. Nevertheless, beginning with the 17th-century scholar Du Cange, many historians, including Ferdinand Chalandon, Steven Runciman, and Alexis Savvides, have traditionally identified him with Oshin of Lampron (1073–1112), the lord of Cilician Armenia, who in turn is identified with the Ursinus of Western sources. It was only in 1924 that Joseph Laurent rejected this identification, and this view has been followed by several modern scholars since.

Early life and education Born in Fredrikstad, Madsen demonstrated musical ability at an early age when he began to learn to play the piano at age six and first started composing aged seven. Madsen went on to study under Egil Hovland and Erik Werba, and developed an interest in everything from the Russian masters Prokofiev and Shostakovich to the works of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss, and Ravel. Madsen's personal interest in playing jazz piano and the influence that pianists such as Art Tatum, Erroll Garner and Oscar Peterson had on him can be heard in his use of the piano. Career Trygve Madsen has proven himself to be a prolific worker and particularly one of the most productive published by Musikk-Husets Forlag – in 2009, the company had 125 works by Madsen in their catalogue. The composer has become increasingly well known of late which has perhaps largely to do with the inclusion of his work in music syllabuses around the world - the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music included the Prelude and Fugue in C (Opus 101) as one of the optional pieces for Grade 8 pianists, and in 2009 The Dream of the Rhinoceros was used as an obligatory piece at a national horn competition in Poland. Aside from printed music, the composer has also had his work featured on thirty-six CDs, eight of which were solely dedicated to his work. Madsen’s compositions have seen performances in Argentina, Australia, Belgium Colombia, Denmark, England, France, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, USA and Austria. Several of his works are included in the curriculum at a number of educational institutions at home and abroad. Madsen has written a number of commissioned works, including the opera Circus Terra written for the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, premiered in Prague in 2002 and also performed at the 2002 Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival. In commemoration of Norway’s centenary marking of independence, Madsen received a commission from the Norwegian Parliament. The resulting work, the opera Aurora, was premiered at the Halden Fort in June 2005. For the 200th anniversary of the US Military Academy of Music in New York, Madsen wrote two commissioned works: Quintet for brass Op. 120 and Concerto Grosso for brass ensemble and percussion Op. 121. Madsen’s Concertino for Horn and Orchestra is a work commissioned by the French Government by the then Minister of Culture Jaques Lang and premiered in 1984 in Dijon.

Biography and academic career  Goodman was born in Watford, England. He was educated at the University of Manchester (politics and modern history) and the London School of Oriental and African Studies (Chinese language and Chinese politics). He also studied economics at Peking University. Goodman's university teaching since 1971 has focused on Chinese society, politics, history, and literature. He currently lives in Suzhou in China.

Goodman\\" and more than 100 academic journal articles and a similar number of academic book chapters.Google Books and Google Scholar searchers Since the late 1980s Goodman has been active in promoting a provincial (or more localised) approach to understanding China, both in his own work and in workshops organised by him around that theme. Through these activities Goodman has had a major influence on the development of China studies, prompting China scholars to address the implications of the wide variation in social and economic development across the country.

Built in 1843, it is a prominent precursor to the region's later grand resort hotels, and a distinctive example of Greek Revival architecture with a monumental temple front. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is now operated as Thayer's Inn. Description and history Thayer's Hotel is located in Littleton's downtown central business district, on the south side of Main Street near the post office. It is a 3-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof's front gable is fully pedimented, and projects beyond the building face, supported by massive three-story fluted Doric columns. Behind this portico, the facade is five bays wide, with doorways at the center of each level, those on the upper floors opening onto balconies supported by elaborate carved brackets. The building is crowned by an octagonal cupola. The interior has retained its basic floorplan and many original finishes. Its attic level, originally a ballroom, was converted into bedrooms in the early 20th century. The hotel was built in 1843, and was a precursor of the grand resort hotels that were later built in northern New Hampshire. It was built in anticipation of the arrival of the railroad, and was a social center of the town from its opening. It has served as a backdrop for political rallies dating from the Civil War to the late 20th century, and parts of its architecture were sought by Henry Ford for his museum of Americana in the 1930s.

His shield shows attributed armsThis coat of arms was attributed to Hamon retrospectively. English heraldry only originated in the twelfth century. of Azure, a lion rampant or impaling Argent, an eagle with two heads sable Hamon Dentatus (died 1047) was a Norman baron who was killed while rebelling with other Norman barons against William II, Duke of Normandy (r. 1035–1087) at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes. The epithet \\"Dentatus\\" or \\"Dens\\" was probably given to Hamon because he was born with teeth. Little is known about Hamon's life. Hamon's name appears in historical texts under several different spellings. William of Poitiers (c. 1020–1090), in an early account of the battle, rendered Hamon in Latin as \\"Haimonem agnomine Dentatum.\\" Orderic Vitalis (1075–c. 1142) said William the Conqueror explicitly recalled \\"Haymon-aux-Dents\\" as having been among the rebels. Wace's account of the battle, written around 1174, called \\"Hamon-As-Dens\\" the lord of \\"Thorignie,\\" \\"Mezi,\\" and \\"Croillie.\\" The locations of those lordships roughly correspond to present day Torigni-sur-Vire, Grandcamp-Maisy, and Creully. Benoît de Sainte- Maure, (d. 1173) called him \\"Hamun\\" and characterized him as an \\"antichrist\\" for rebelling against his lord the duke. Both Wace and Benoît said that Haimo used the name of Saint Amand as his battle cry. Saint Amand was the patron saint of Hamon's fiefdom of Thorigny, which was sometimes called \\"Saint Amand of Thorigny.\\" Pezet's history of the barons of Creully, claimed that \\"Haimon- Az-Dentz\\" was made the first baron of Creully. Pezet said that the feifdom of Creully was originally established in 912, according to a text that was destroyed in the French Revolution. Early in the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes, King Henry I of France (r. 1027–1060), who had sided with the duke, was knocked off his horse by Hamno. However, French forces killed Hamon before the baron could further harm their king. According to another source, it was not Hamon, but his uncle, Guillesen, who unhorsed the French king. William of Malmesbury (c. 1095–1143) wrote that King Henry commanded his men to give Hamon an honorable burial \\"in admiration of his valour.\\" Wace said that Hamon was buried near the church of Esquay-Notre-Dame. Family He left one known son, Hamo DapiferHollister Henry I pp. 363-364 (died circa 1100) (alias HaimoBarlow William Rufus pp. 188-189) an Anglo-Norman royal official under both King William the Conqueror (1066-1087) and his son King William Rufus (1087-1100). He held the office, from which his epithet derives, known in Latin as dapifer and in French seneschal, in English \\"steward\\", as well as the office of Sheriff of Kent. This younger Hamo was the father of Robert Fitzhamon (d. 1107), the conqueror of Glamorgan. Grenville family tradition A seventeenth century pedigree of the Grenville or Granville family of Stowe claimed that Hamon Dentatus had two sons: Richard de Grenville, who founded the Grenville family, and Robert Fitzhamon. This contradicted the chronicle of William of Malmesbury, which said that Hamon Dentatus was Robert Fitzhamon's grandfather (avus).Round, p.156 The Grenville pedigree also claimed that Hamon Dentatus was a younger son of Mauger, Count of Corbeil and thus grandson of Richard I, Duke of Normandy.Round, p.154 Historian and genealogist J. Horace Round contended that the Granville family had \\"hatched [the connection] in the seventeenth century... wishing to exalt Hamon Dentatus,\\" whom they claimed as their ancestor.Round, p.155 The Grenville family commissioned a depiction of Haimo Dentatus on a stained glass window that was installed in 1860 in the Granville Chapel of the Church of St. James the Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall, near the family mansion Stowe House. Likewise, Mauger himself was either a nephew or an in-law of the first attested count of Corbeil, Haymon de Corbeil, who would appear to be Hamon Dentatus' namesake, and thus adding a side of credibility to the claims.

NASA safety experts approved the mission because the satellite's 12 thruster-clusters burn an inert solid fuel, that only ignite when an electric charge is passed across it. In July 2012, DSSP won second place in the 2012 NewSpace Business Plan Competition in Silicon Valley, sponsored by the Space Frontier Foundation.

The film had its world premiere on 18 April 2014 at the Tribeca Film Festival and focuses on the break-in of an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania on Monday, March 8, 1971 to steal over 1000 classified documents. It was pitched at the Sheffield Doc/Fest 2011 MeetMarket preceding its debut. The break-in took place on the night of the first Ali-Frazier boxing title fight dubbed The Fight of the Century. Hamilton was inspired to create the film after learning that Betty Medsger was working on her book The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover’s Secret FBI, which discussed the 1971 events and revealed the identities of many of the participants, who had remained anonymous up to that point. Synopsis The film focuses on the events of March 8, 1971, when eight people orchestrated the burglary and public distribution of government files from an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania. The theft was altogether different than the numerous contemporary draft board office break-ins, in which activists (including many of the burglars) burned government draft paperwork to interfere with America's continued participation in the Vietnam War. The group, all of whom were ordinary citizens, called themselves the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI and stole every file in the office. The goal of the burglars was to gather tangible evidence of government surveillance of civilian political activists, which was infringing on First Amendment rights. The stolen files exposed that the FBI was indeed running extensive, illegal operations intended to spread paranoia and distrust among numerous New Left and black civil rights organizations. (Other files included training manuals, information about organized crime, and information about draft resistance.) Over time, the group mailed copies of the files to various newsrooms. Most news organizations returned the files to the FBI and refused to run stories regarding the stolen documents, but the notable exception was The Washington Post, which ran a front-page story on March 24, 1971 about the files which were mailed to journalist Betty Medsger. Arguably the most significant element in the stolen materials turned out to be a single file mentioning \\"COINTELPRO\\", a secret surveillance program that was run by J. Edgar Hoover. Subsequent investigations and freedom of information requests regarding COINTELPRO played a role in the 1975 Church Committee. Reception Site of the 1971 break-in in Media, Pennsylvania Critical reception for 1971 has been positive. Washingtonian and Variety both praised the work, which the Washingtonian described as \\"a compelling documentary that provides a powerful perspective on the current debate about the men and women who risk everything to disclose government secrets.\\" Indiewire also gave a favorable review, praising Hamilton's directing and stated \\"Her film is not celebratory, lingering on the notion that, with the public charade of COINTELPRO, ultimately the FBI won. While their post-break-in behaviors are mocked, the government credits itself with tactics specifically utilized to \\"enhance the paranoia,\\" creating a culture of fear that still exists today.\\" See also * List of films featuring surveillance References External links  Category:2014 films Category:2014 documentary films Category:American films Category:Films set in 1971 Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about United States history Category:Federal Bureau of Investigation Category:English-language films Category:1971 in American politics ","title":"1971 (2014 film)"},{"id":"42427451","text":"Metrolina Christian Academy (MCA) is a private Christian school in Indian Trail, North Carolina, affiliated to the First Baptist Church of Indian Trail.

Prince, 714 F.3d 694 (2d Cir. 2013) is a copyright case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on the question of whether artist Richard Prince's appropriation art treatment of Patrick Cariou's photographs was a copyright infringement or a fair use. The Second Circuit held in 2013 that Prince's appropriation art could constitute fair use, and that a number of his works were transformative fair uses of Cariou's photographs. The Court remanded to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for reconsideration of five of Prince's works. The Supreme Court denied Cariou's petition for a writ of certiorari, and the case settled in 2014.Brian Boucher, \\"Landmark Copyright Lawsuit Cariou v. Prince Is Settled\\", Art in America, March 18, 2014. Background Photographer Patrick Cariou published in 2000 Yes, Rasta a book of photographs of the Rastafarian community in Jamaica. Richard Prince in 2008 created Canal Zone, a series of art works incorporating Cariou's photographs. Prince's works involved copying the original photographs and engaging in a variety of transformations. These included printing them, increasing them in size, blurring or sharpening, adding content (sometimes in color), and sometimes compositing multiple photographs together or with other works. Prince exhibited his collection at Gagosian Gallery in New York as appropriation art. In 2009, Cariou filed a copyright infringement suit against Richard Prince, as well as Gagosian Gallery, Larry Gagosian (the founder and owner of the gallery), and RCS MediaGroup (which printed the exhibit catalog). Findings The Southern District of New York (SDNY), in March 2011, held that Prince's works were infringing. At that point, the Cariou v. Prince case received significant attention, because the SDNY ordered that Prince's unsold works, and Rizzoli's catalogs, be impounded and destroyed. The SDNY found that the works were not transformative, in part because Richard Prince did not claim to be \\"commenting upon\\" the original works. Prince, whose works often sell in galleries for many thousands of dollars, appealed to the Second Circuit. The case was of high interest to the art world, which largely favored Prince's position,See, e.g., the amicus brief submitted by the Warhol Foundation and the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, which sided with Prince. (Brief, October 2013). and to the photographic community, which largely favored Cariou's position. In April 2013, the Second Circuit reversed the SDNY's decision, finding that most of Prince's works were indeed \\"transformative\\" to a \\"reasonable observer\\" and therefore fair use. In particular, the Court found that the lower court erred in requiring that the appropriating artist claim to be commenting on the original work, and found works to be transformative if they presented a new aesthetic. The court found 25 of 30 works to be transformative fair use under its standard, and remanded the case to the lower court for reconsideration of 5 of the works under the Second Circuit's new standard. On March 18, 2014, Cariou and Prince announced that they had settled the case.

On October 17, 2014, Lifetime cancelled The Lottery after one season.'The Lottery' Canceled by Lifetime After One Season  Synopsis  It is the year 2025, and no children have been born on Earth since 2019 due to an infertility pandemic that first became noticeable in 2016. Dr. Alison Lennon and her assistant, Dr. James Lynch, make a breakthrough in their lab work for the Department of Humanity (DOH), and are able to successfully fertilize eggs to create 100 viable human embryos. Darius Hayes, Director of the DOH, strongly believes that the embryos should immediately become property of the U.S. government. But the President of the United States, Thomas Westwood, is fighting sagging poll numbers and sides with his Chief of Staff, Vanessa Keller, who suggests they hold a public lottery to select 100 women who will carry the embryos to term. The DOH is also looking to control all young children in the country, which includes Elvis Walker, the six-year-old son of Kyle Walker. Meanwhile, an anti- government group called the Second of May Resistance, or \\"MayTwos\\", is also trying to seize control of the embryos for its own purposes. In researching the egg and sperm donors that produced the embryos, Alison and James discover a common bond that leads them to uncover the cause of the global infertility crisis. The battle to affect the future of the human race, along with the need to keep secrets buried, becomes a life-and-death struggle, with many paying the ultimate price.

Sharief is also a former Miramar City Commissioner and Vice Mayor. Early life and education Sharief is a native Floridian. Born November 7, 1971 in Miami Beach, she grew up in Miami and Broward County, one of eight children of a self-employed clothing salesman and a retired schoolteacher. In 1985, at age 14, her father, James Muhammad Sharief, was shot and killed by a 15-year-old robber. She began work soon after to support her family. Sharief attended North Miami Senior High School. After high school she obtained an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) degree from Miami Dade Community College followed by an RN Diploma from Jackson Memorial Hospital School of Nursing. She later attained a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree and an Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) Certification from Florida International University. Professional career After graduation, Sharief worked for Jackson Memorial Hospital, followed by a national home health agency. In 2001, she founded South Florida Pediatric Homecare, Inc. The company provides home healthcare services for children and adults who would otherwise need to stay in a hospital or intensive care environment. Political career In 2009, Sharief was elected to the Miramar City Commission. She served as the Vice Mayor in 2010. While serving on the City Commission, she donated her annual salary to charities. In May 2010, Sharief filed to run for the Broward County Commission District 8 seat being vacated by Diana Wasserman-Rubin. In November 2010, she was elected to serve the residents of the cities of Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Weston, Southwest Ranches, Hallandale Beach, Pembroke Park and West Park. In 2012, she was named Vice Mayor of Broward County. In November 2013, the County Commission voted unanimously to appoint Sharief Broward's first African-American female Mayor. In November 2014, she was re-elected to a second four-year term on the County Commission. In November 2015, Sharief was named Vice Mayor for the second time. In November 2016, Sharief was re-appointed Mayor for the second time. As County Commissioner, Sharief served on several boards including the Broward County Metropolitan Planning Organization and on the Large Urban County Caucus and the Health Steering Committee for the National Association of Counties. In 2016, Sharief was elected President of the Florida Association of Counties. She is also a member of the National Democratic County Officials, the Urban League of Broward County, Miramar–Pembroke Pines Chamber of Commerce's Governmental Affairs committee, the Caribbean American Democratic Club, and Minority Women Business Enterprises. Over the course of her political career, Sharief has been focused on the financial health of her constituents, enacting programs to provide foreclosure assistance and help residents get through the economic slump. She created Commissioner on a Mission, a program focused on the elderly, foreclosure, and unemployment issues. In 2013, Sharief proposed a countywide ban on pit bulls, similar to the one implented in neighboring Miami-Dade County. She later withdrew requests for the ban in favor of calling for regulations on dog owners and new funds for animal control. Sharief was also instrumental in advocating for the completion of the Pembroke Road overpass off Miramar Parkway and Pines Boulevard. As Mayor, Sharief adeptly kept America up to date as events unfolded on January 6, 2017 when a lone shooter opened fire killing five people and injuring six more at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the deadliest airport shooting in U.S. history. Financial issues In 2013, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration concluded in a routine audit that Sharief's firm overbilled Medicaid for patient services by close to $500,000. The audit found that from June 2007 to March 2011, SFPH was overpaid for some services that were not covered by Medicaid. Sharief disputed the audit results, but agreed to \\"settle the matter rather than fight and continue to mount legal fees.\\" In May 2013, Sharief signed an agreement to repay $540,328 over three years, an amount that includes the Medicaid overcharges as well as additional fines and costs According to the Agency for Health Care Administration, the settlement agreement did \\"not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or error by either party with respect to this case or any other matter.\\" In April 2014, the Florida Commission on Ethics announced that it had found probable cause to believe that Sharief violated state ethics laws and the state constitution by failing to properly disclose her financial interests for three years. An ethics commission investigator recommended that the Commission rule against Sharief, finding that she had filed inaccurate financial disclosure forms in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Sharief disputed the claims, but agreed to settle with the Commission and paid a $1,000 fine for each violation. The Office of the State Attorney cleared Sharief of any wrongdoing stating there was no evidence that she \\"fraudulently falsified any document belonging to any public office in this state.\\" Personal life While Sharief has stated that she has not visited a mosque since she was a teenager, she considers her position as Broward County's first Muslim Mayor an important platform against prejudices against Muslim people. She has five children: Amanda, Alexander, Alyssa, Ashley and Hailey.

He is the inaugural holder of the Ursula Zoellner Professorship of Cancer Research at the University of Cambridge, a Professorial Fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and from 2006-19, was the Director of the Medical Research Council Cancer Unit In 2020, he will take up joint appointments as the Director of the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Distinguished Professor at the National University of Singapore, and Senior Principal Investigator at A*STAR, Singapore. Biography Venkitaraman learnt and practiced medicine at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, India, before earning his PhD at University College London supervised by Sir Marc Feldman. He was awarded in 1988 a Beit Memorial Fellowship to work with Michael Neuberger at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, before becoming a member of its research faculty in 1991. In 1998, he was elected as the first holder of the Ursula Zoellner Professorship Venkitaraman joined the MRC Cancer Unit in 2000, becoming its co-Director with Ron Laskey in 2006, and its Director in 2010. During his directorship, he developed a distinctive scientific mission for the MRC Cancer Unit focused on early intervention in cancer, through research that advances understanding of early steps in carcinogenesis, and utilizes this new knowledge for the early detection of cancer, and improvements in therapy or prevention. From 2020, Venkitaraman will take up joint appointments as the Director of the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Distinguished Professor at the National University of Singapore, and Senior Principal Investigator at A*STAR, Singapore. Venkitaraman is widely recognised for his contributions to understanding the genetics and biology of human cancer, particularly in elucidating the impact of genome instability on carcinogenesis and cancer therapy. He is best known for discovering how mutations affecting the breast cancer gene, BRCA2, and related proteins cause genome instability to trigger carcinogenesis. His work has helped to explain why carriers of BRCA2 mutations develop cancer, and has provided the scientific foundations for new cancer therapies by illuminating fundamental cellular mechanisms that control genome repair, duplication and segregation. Venkitaraman was amongst the first to discover that the breast cancer gene, BRCA2, is essential to maintain the integrity of the genome when cells divide. He and his colleagues soon uncovered that BRCA2 enables cells to repair DNA breakage in an error-free manner by precisely controlling the assembly of the RAD51 recombination enzyme on its DNA substrates, and revealed the structural mechanism underlying this process. He subsequently discovered that BRCA2 is vital to prevent DNA breakage when genome replication becomes blocked or stalled, helping to explain why BRCA2-deficient cells spontaneously exhibit genome instability during cell division, and why BRCA2-deficient cancers become highly sensitive to drugs that block genome replication by causing DNA cross-links or gaps. These discoveries have laid a scientific foundation for the development of new treatments for cancers arising in patients who carry BRCA2 mutations, and also provided a conceptual framework for understanding other human genetic diseases in which genome instability is connected with predisposition to cancer. Venkitaraman’s research continues to unveil new ways in which BRCA2 and related genes work to preserve genome integrity, and to explain how patients who carry BRCA2 mutations become more susceptible to early-onset cancers. He and his colleagues have recently discovered that cells carrying a single copy of mutant BRCA2 become more susceptible to the mutagenic effects of aldehydes, a class of chemicals found pervasively in the environment and generated in cells through metabolic reactions. Venkitaraman has developed technologies that help to identify and validate new targets for next-generation medicines against cancer and other diseases. Work in his laboratory laid the scientific foundations for the development of “protein interference” at PhoreMost, which he co-founded with Chris Torrance and Grahame Mckenzie. This new technology is now being widely applied in collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies. Venkitaraman’s laboratory has devised new approaches to interrupt intracellular signaling by blocking the molecular recognition of protein phosphorylation, now being pursued by industry for anti-cancer therapy. He has worked extensively with UK industry to develop new medicines. Having served for many years on the scientific advisory boards of companies such as Astex Therapeutics and Cambridge Antibody Technology/MedImmune, he currently holds appointments with Sentinel Oncology and PhoreMost. Venkitaraman has worked for many years to promote biomedical research in India. He leads a collaborative research initiative with the National Center for Biological Sciences and inStem in Bangalore, in which new technology is being applied to help develop drugs against cancer and other diseases. He has established an initiative for biological systems engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, where he holds the Mehta Foundation Visiting Professorship. Awards and Honours * In 2001, Venkitaraman was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, one of the four national academies of the United Kingdom. In 2004, he was elected a Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), awarded for research excellence and outstanding achievements in the life sciences. Venkitaraman was awarded in 2017 the Basser Global Prize in recognition of his discoveries concerning the breast cancer gene BRCA2.

Biography  Wilhelm Trute was born in 1836 in Sankt Andreasberg as the only child of Georg Conrad Trute and Johanna Henriette Trute (birth name Keitel). Not much is known about Trutes childhood and youth. It is very likely that he attended school in Sankt Andreasberg and worked in the local mineral processing unit as a teenager to supplement his family's income. He followed his father's footsteps and became a miner. He first got a job in Clausthal and later on in the Samson Pit in Sankt Andreasberg. He married Henriette Minna Charlotte Gödecke with whom he had one child, Carl Trute. While working as a miner, he pursued his passion for breeding of canaries, but rheumatism and, from 1889, gastric trouble which later turned out to be stomach cancer chained him to his bed. After a long period of suffering, he died on 20 October 1889 at 12:45 AM.  Canary Breeding  Wilhelm Trute's ancestors reached the HarzGottfried Drott: Die Trut'sche Legende. In: Der Vogelfreund. Ausgabe 10/98, S. 13. in the 15th century from the Ore Mountains, making his family one of the oldest in Sankt Andreasberg. It is not known when his ancestors began to bred canaries but, like others, his father Andreasberg already bred a race of canaries from the mainland called Japper. Around 1865, Wilhelm Trute got a pair of high quality singing canaries from the silver works supervisor Wilhelm Weiland, a relative. It is probable that the first Harz Rollers emerged from this cross-breed. These Rollers from the Trute branch had, other than later Harz Rollers, grey to grey-green feathering and excelled by their delightful song. Those birds brought worldwide fame to the breeder and his hometown. In distinction to other breeders, Trute used only birds from this one branch. He also did not sell his birds by mail. Whoever wanted to acquire one of his Rollers had to come to his home in Sankt Andreasberg. He bred canaries from the Trute branch in his home until his disease chained him to his bed in 1889.  Honors  To honor his achievement in canary breeding he was dedicated an outsized, stylised Harzbauer in a ceremonial service on 2 May 1999. To point out the special relationship between mining and canary breeding a vessel for ore processing was mounted in the cage as a symbolised drinking bowl. In 2001 the memorial was complemented with a Dennert Fir Tree which describes the breeders deeds. Another Dennert Fir Tree was erected in front of his former house.

Life Successful in business, Henrisoun traded with Middelburg in the Netherlands, and encountered the Protestant Reformation there. A Protestant convert in Catholic Scotland, he went to the Earl of Hertford during the 1544 English campaign in Scotland, the Burning of Edinburgh. He was taken back to London, and placed on a government pension. Works From 1547, by which time the young Edward VI was on the English throne and Hertford had become Protector Somerset, Henrisoun produced pro-union pamphlets. His major work was An exhortacion to the Scottes to conforme them selfes to the honorable, expedient, and godly union betwene the twoo realmes of Englande and Scotlande (1547). Views Henrisoun used the term \\"Great Britain\\", which may have been a neologism for the Scots language. His Godly and Golden Booke (1548) argued strongly that England and Scotland should become a single Protestant nation. He wished to abandon the terms \\"Scots\\" and \\"Englishmen\\", appealing to an underlying ethnicity of blood that was largely British. In dealing with the myth of origins of the Scots, Henrisoun attacked Hector Boece, and his credulity in the matter of the Gathelus myth. He managed the dating of the arrival of Gaels in what is now Scotland with fair accuracy. At this period the mythological setting was significant.

It required the closure of brothels (\\"maisons de tolérance\\"). The law bears the name of Marthe Richard, who was a municipal councillor of Paris but not a parliamentary representative. Build up to the law On December 13, 1945, Marthe Richard, elected councillor of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, presented to the Conseil municipal de Paris a proposal for the closure of Paris brothels. In her speech, she does not attack prostitutes as much as society, responsible in her view, of \\"organised and patent debauchery\\" and organized crime, which benefits from regulated prostitution. She also reminds the council that prostitution was complicit with the German occupation during WW2. The proposal was voted and on December 20, 1945, the police prefect, Charles Luizet, was authorised to close, without notice, the houses of prostitution in the Department of the Seine within 3 months (by March 15, 1946 at the latest). Encouraged by this success, Marthe Richard started a press campaign for a vote on a law generalising these measures to all France.On 19 December 1945, the editor of the Le Canard enchaîné, Pierre Bénard said in an article under the title of Acquisition of Tartuffe: \\"There is no electricity. There is no coal. There is no wine. There are no potatoes and the victims are still waiting for a roof (...). Fleeing these depressing debates, the Parisian city councilors devote two long sessions to discuss the suppression of brothels (177 in the capital, around 1500 in France). Mme Marthe Richard, the well known spy opened the debate!\\" It is supported by the \\"Ligue pour le relèvement de la moralité publique\\" (League of Social and Moral Action) and by the Minister of Public Health and Population, Robert Prigent. On April 9, 1946, MP Marcel Roclore presented the report of the Committee on the Family, Population and Public Health, and concluded that the closure of brothels was necessary. The deputy Pierre Dominjon, member of the Ligue pour le relèvement de la moralité publique, tabled a proposal for a law which was voted on April 13, 1946 in the Chamber of Deputies. The closure of brothels takes effect from November 6, 1946. Withdrawing the administrative authorizations without compensation marked the end of legalisation and the start of a policy of abolitionism. Consequences After the adoption of the law, Marthe Richard ensured that article 5, which ended keeping national files on prostitution, in which she was still recorded, was enacted. These police records were replaced by a health and social file for prostitutes (law of April 24, 1946) in order to prevent prostitutes with a STI trying to evade the treatment of their disease. This law was little applied and was repealed on July 28, 1960, the date of French ratification of the United Nations Convention of December 2, 1949 for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. (France's late ratification of the convention was due to the existence of brothels in its colonial empire). Approximately 1,400 establishments were closed, including 195 in Paris (177 official establishments): the best known were Le Chabanais, Le Sphinx, La Fleur blanche, One-Two-Two but also the maisons d’abattage (“slaughterhouses”) such as Le Fourcy and the Lanterne Verte. This law caused smiles at the Brigade Mondaine of the 3rd floor of 36, quai des Orfèvres since it emanated from Marthe Richard, who was herself a prostitute until around 1915, when she wanted to make a clean sweep of her past. The police do not like the law because it risks depriving it of one of its sources of information (from the prostitutes). Prostitution was still a legal activity, only its organization, exploitation (procuring), its visible manifestations and offense of soliciting are prohibited by law, however the police continue to tolerate bawdy houses. Many brothel owners turned themselves into owners of clandestine inns concentrated around French and American military barracks as well as in major cities. Whilst the law provided for the collection of prostitutes in \\"reception and outplacement centers\\", many continued their activities clandestinely. Critics of French prostitution policy, such as Mouvement du Nid, question how effective this was, its implementation, and whether it really closed the \\"maisons\\". For instance, they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960.

Description  Balato is a sword with large variety of blades, hilts and scabbards. Three types of blades can be distinguished, all broadening at the point: * with an almost straight blade back and straight edge. The cutting edge is rounded from place to back. * with an almost straight back and a straight or slightly concave cutting edge, while the back S-shape runs to the cutting edge at the site. * with a slightly convex back, a slightly concave edge and a strong concave section at the location (Bowie form). The hilts are very varied, but all can be reduced to an animal's head or mouth, most of the time the lasara (mythical creature), made in a plain stylized way or in a complex, richly decorated form. Most of this hilts are made from wood, but brass ones do occur. Wooden hilts have brass ferrule broadening towards the blade. The scabbard is made of wood with brass or rattan bindings along the scabbard. Often a round rattan basket is attached to the scabbard to keep various amulets in. Normally, the southern Balatos have more decorated baskets on their scabbards compared to the northern region.  Culture  A Faluaya dance or war dance of the Nias people, pre 1954. In South Nias, the locals practice a war dance called Faluaya (or Fataele) dance. In this dance, the dancers wore colorful clothing consists of black, yellow and red, fitted with a crown on the head. Like a knight in battle, dancers also carry Baluse (shields), swords and spears as a means of defense from enemy attack. The Baluse that were used are made of wood shaped like banana leaves and are held on the left hand which serves to deflect enemy attacks, while the sword or spear in the right hand serves to counter enemy attacks. Both of these weapons are the main weapons used for fighting by a Nias knight. In those days, young men in the village were required to leap over the rock of 2 meters in height during the Fahombo (or Hombo Batu) ceremony in order to attain adulthood. This would also signify that those men are able to protect and to defend their village once achieving adulthood. Therefore, the Si'ulu (village head) would form a Fataele team and recruit these men. In the past, the Nias people were feared for their headhunting practices. It is believed that the victims of headhunting will become their servants in the afterlife. Today, headhunting are no longer practiced as majority of the Nias population are Protestant Christians.

The first recorded evidence of Cucumispora dikerogammari was, as cited by Ovcharenko and Vita, in Germany, circa 1895, by Dr. L. Pfeiffer in the Dnieper Estuary. The Dnieper Estuary and lower parts of the Danube River are considered to be the parasite’s native range. As its host, D. villosus, began to invade novel habitats, C. dikerogammari followed, and has now expanded its range to be found in many of the main bodies of water in Central and Western Europe.Ovcharenko et al. 2009 At this time, only limited research has been conducted regarding the ecological implications of C. dikerogammari spreading beyond its native range. However, there is evidence to suggest that C. dikerogammari may cause imbalance to the male/female sex ratio of its host D. villosus.Terry, 2004 Classification Toward the broader end of its classification, C. dikerogammari falls within the phylum Microspora. Characteristics of phylum Microspora include a relictual mitochondrial structure and a complex life cycle involving both horizontal and vertical transmission. These characteristics suggest a host organism is necessary to sustain life and allow for reproduction of Microsporidia. The parasite was originally classified as Nosema dikerogammari. Through phenotypic, molecular, phylogenic, and host compatibility experiments, evidence has led to the reclassification of Nosema dikerogammari within the novel genus Cucumispora. Characteristics that define both genus Cucumispora and Nosema are diplokaryotic development and disporoblastic sporogony. Ovcharenko instated the novel genus Cucumispora to describe the presence a specific anterior structure to aid in attachment to a susceptible host, specific arrangements of isofilar polar filaments, substantial diplokaryon, and vacuole structure. These traits are unique to Cucumispora, and serve to differentiate it from Nosema. Host Several microsporidian parasites are known to infect Dikerogammarus villosus. C. dikerogammari reduces the survival rate in its hosts during the later stages of infection, leading them to reproduce earlier.

The composite of risk factors and early signs of injury for AKI, renal angina is used as a clinical adjunct to help optimize the use of novel AKI biomarker testing. The term angina from Latin (“infection of the throat”) and from the Greek ẚnkhone (“strangling”) are utilized in the context of AKI to denote the development of injury and the choking off of kidney function. Unlike angina pectoris, commonly caused due to ischemia of the heart muscle secondary to coronary artery occlusion or vasospasm, renal angina carries no obvious physical symptomatology (i.e., flank tenderness, suprapubic tenderness, pain with voiding or micturition). Renal angina was derived as a conceptual framework to identify evolving AKI. Like acute coronary syndrome which precedes or is a sign of a heart attack, renal angina is used as a herald sign for a kidney attack. Detection of renal angina is performed by calculating the renal angina index. Acute kidney injury =Background= Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been extensively associated with worsened morbidity and is an independent risk factor for mortality in adult and pediatric patients. AKI in the developed world occurs most commonly as a secondary injury to numerous disease processes. Sepsis and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are the most oft recognized and reported “causative” injuries leading to AKI. The pathophysiology of AKI can be broadly categorized into four main categories: ischemic injury – manifest by low glomerular blood flow or perfusion pressure to the renal capillary system, hypoxic injury to the renal interstitium, inflammation of the renal tubules, or necrosis and apoptosis of the renal parenchyma. There is increasing recognition that people are not just dying with AKI, but from AKI. =Epidemiology= The epidemiology of AKI has changed dramatically in the past 20–25 years. Advances made in the treatment of other diseases (e.g., sepsis and bone marrow transplant (BMT)) have placed more patients at risk of nephrotoxic therapies and medication leading to a spike in secondary AKI (mentioned above). Additionally, diagnostic criteria have become more standardized (mentioned below). Discharge coding data from a sample of United States Medicare beneficiaries demonstrated in increase in AKI prevalence from 14.2 to 34.6 AKI cases per 100 patient discharges and increase from 0.5 to 9.9 per 1,000 hospitalized children. In 49,518 patients, 11% had AKI. Two recent cohorts of critically ill children reported a 17.9% incidence in 2106 admissions and 10% of 3396 admissions. Incidence data for AKI is also commonly reported by association to the inciting disease processes or the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), otherwise known as continuous dialysis. An estimated 30-50% of all patients with sepsis suffer AKI while 20-40% of all patients after CPB suffer AKI. Other populations with high incidence of AKI include burn victims, trauma patients, and patients after BMT. Mortality for patients on CRRT exceeds 50% for adults and is 33-50% in children. Unfortunately, no singular therapy for AKI exists and trials of CRRT for AKI, even at varying doses, have proven to be ineffective at reducing AKI associated morbidity or mortality. =Diagnosis= The diagnosis of AKI encompasses tests of the blood, urine, and imaging of the kidneys. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is used as an index of kidney function and the most frequently used diagnostic test to calculate GFR is the serum creatinine level. GFR also factors in urine and plasma solute concentration. Unfortunately, serum creatinine is highly variable depending on age, sex, metabolic state, body composition (muscle mass), and rate of excretion by the kidney itself. The rate of urine production (i.e., urine output) is also interpreted as a marker of kidney function but the definitions of low urine output (oliguria) also vary by age. Urinalysis often provides clues about kidney health – hematuria, tubular casts, and proteinuria have been used as markers of injury. Unfortunately, the multiple ways used by different practitioners to diagnose AKI have made large scale population analysis difficult (Table 1 - Previous Diagnostic Tests for AKI) Laboratory evaluations used to diagnose acute kidney injury =RIFLE, AKIN, KDIGO= In 2004, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group standardized the definition of AKI using the “RIFLE” criteria. Based on GFR, serum creatinine values, and urine output plotted against time of admission, RIFLE, a mnemonic for three levels of severity – Risk, Injury, and Failure, and two outcomes, Loss and End-stage kidney disease, marks progressive degrees of injury in both ICU and non-ICU adult patients. In 2007, the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) devised strata which defined AKI based on time in relation to absolute creatinine increase, percentage increase, or documented oliguria, broadening the window for time of AKI diagnosis and creating an automatic “failure” designation for any patient placed on renal replacement therapy. In 2007, a pediatric RIFLE (pRIFLE) stratification system was established with weight based – pediatric specific cut-offs for estimated GFR and urine output. Most recently, the Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) collaborative issued newer severity based AKI stages (Table 2 - Staging Criteria for AKI). Since 2005, numerous studies in both adult and pediatric patient populations have demonstrated that, retrospectively, escalating severity of AKI stratified by these criteria are associated with increased in-hospital morbidity, hospital length of stay, persistence of kidney disease to chronic kidney disease, and mortality. Consensus criteria for diagnosing AKI based on serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (eCCl), and urine output (UOP) as defined by the RIFLE, pediatric RIFLE (pRIFLE), AKIN, and KDIGO collaboratives. =Early diagnosis and new biomarkers= AKI researchers have sought novel early, sensitive, and specific biomarkers for AKI. A number of biochemical markers are currently under study for established AKI, early detection of AKI, and prognosis of AKI. The most frequently studied new biomarkers include Cystatin C (CysC), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18, liver-fatty acid binding protein (l-FABP), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Children following cardiopulmonary bypass are often used to derive biomarker performance and validate optimal cut-off values given a known timing and duration of insult, relative homogeneity, and freedom from co-morbidities. Unfortunately, when these and other biomarkers are applied to a more heterogeneous patient population (the general intensive care unit, non- critically ill patients, patients in the emergency department), they demonstrate less robust predictive performance. Renal angina =Renal troponin= The inability to detect AKI in the early stages of injury may be a reason for the poor outcomes associated with the disease processes. The quest for the ideal biomarker(s) for early detection of injury has been dubbed “the search for the renal troponin I”. An apt analogy to the diagnosis of heart attack, or myocardial infarction, the discovery of serum troponin as a confirmatory biomarker for injury in patients with known risk factors and signs of injury (e.g., pain, chest tightness) revolutionized the survival for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Without correct context, the performance of troponin for detection of a heart attack is marginal. Renal angina was proposed as an empiric concept to create a threshold of AKI risk to identify patients who would most benefit from a confirmatory AKI biomarker test. Used to predict the development of severe and persistent AKI, defined as RIFLE Stage I or F three days after admission, renal angina is an easy to use, AKI predictive tool. Renal angina manages the heterogeneity of patient populations, directing biomarker testing only for patients who fulfill a combination of illness severity and changes in kidney function. Renal angina can be thought of in terms of a simple equation: Renal angina threshold = risk of AKI x evidence of AKI In short, renal angina is a clinical guide that identifies patients at high-risk for AKI by integrating baseline, contextual, and clinical evidence of kidney injury. When criteria for fulfilling renal angina are met, an AKI biomarker (a renal troponin) is optimally used (Figure 1 - Renal Angina Thresholds). As the risk of AKI increases, less evidence of AKI is needed to meet the threshold for renal angina. Conversely, a patient with few risk factors of AKI would require more evidence of AKI in order to achieve the threshold. Once patients fulfill renal angina (e.g. have chest pain for patients with a potential heart attack), the task of the clinician is to ‘rule out AKI’, using AKI biomarkers and other clinical investigation. Three tranches of risk groups have been proposed. The threshold for fulfilling renal angina depends on risk factors and signs of injury. The greater the risk of AKI, the less injury required to achieve renal angina. =Risk factors and injury level= The AKI risk factors used for renal angina criteria were derived from population literature of AKI in adults and children. The most common risk factors include sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and the use of inotropic or vasopressor support. Relatively common co-morbid risk factors can also be age specific (e.g. diabetes in adults and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in children. Early signs of kidney injury used for renal angina derivation are based on changes in serum creatinine and degree of fluid overload(FO). Small changes in serum creatinine have been demonstrated to be associated with a high rate of progression to severe AKI and associated with worsened in-hospital morbidity. Fluid overload (FO) is calculated as: FO = [(Fluid IN – Fluid OUT (L)) / (Admit weight in kilograms)] * 100 =Renal angina index= Discerning fulfillment of renal angina in children is done by calculating the renal angina index (RAI). The RAI was created to operationalize the renal angina construct. The logic behind the equation dictates that as a patient achieves higher risk they require less “clinical sign of AKI” early on to fulfill renal angina. Similarly, if a patient has less risk but shows more overt signs of clinical AKI signs, renal angina would also be fulfilled. Per the epidemiology of AKI, the risk of AKI increases in multiplicative fashion with increased risk factors. The incidence of AKI demonstrates fold-increases (5 to 10 to 50%) for higher risk patients. This same increase is seen retrospectively in the case of fluid overload. Risk of mortality in patients with AKI demonstrates similar fold-increases for increasing AKI severity. Thus, the creation of the renal angina index was done by a multiplicative index (instead of sum). The RAI score is a composite of risk strata and clinical signs. Risk strata were given point values that were essentially the epidemiologic risk compared to general pediatric risk divided by 10: 5 (very high risk), 3 (high risk), and 1 (moderate risk). Clinical signs of injury are based on changes in estimated creatinine clearance (eCCl) or % fluid overload (% FO). The assigned point values are: 1 (ICU status and no decrease in eCCl or <5% FO), 2 (> 5% FO or eCCl decrease of 0-25%), 4 (>10% FO or eCCl decrease of 25-50%), or 8 (>15% FO or eCCl decrease of > 50%). The composite range of the RAI is therefore: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 24, and 40. Patients who fulfill features of both the risk stratification and the associated threshold for clinical signs of kidney dysfunction are akin to the cardiac angina paradigm to guide troponin assessment. For instance, troponin would not be expected to function well for prediction of myocardial ischemia in an otherwise healthy 25-year-old that experienced chest pain after eating a fatty meal. Likewise, a troponin should not be drawn on every 85-year-old seen in an emergency room irrespective of the presence of chest pain just because myocardial infarctions are more prevalent in older individuals. Fulfillment of renal angina is determined by calculating the renal angina index. A value of > or = 8 is interpreted as positive for renal angina. =Biomarker incorporation= As mentioned earlier, novel AKI biomarkers have not demonstrated consistent predictive performance outside of the neonatal cardiac surgery (CPB) population. After assessment for optimal sensitivity and specificity (Youden's J statistic), the renal angina index level derived as positive for renal angina fulfillment is greater than or equal to 8. A positive biomarker result in the population with an RAI > or = 8 significantly increases the predictive discrimination for subsequent severe AKI. Judicious AKI biomarker assessment will increase their predictive performance and clinical effectiveness. AKI biomarkers need to demonstrate the appropriate balance of diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in order to gain widespread acceptance leading to implementation at the bedside. Indiscriminate biomarker measurement in every patient, regardless of size, age, and co- morbidities, for a given injury or syndrome will render any test virtually useless. Renal angina index assessment is early (day of admission), easy to practice (calculating RAI and measuring biomarkers is relatively simple compared to calculation of severity of illness scores), useful (high negative predictive value), and could potentially change initial resuscitation targets (fluid goals), use of medications (nephrotoxins), and timing of adjunctive therapies (renal replacement therapy). Renal angina studies =Derivation and validation= The fulfillment of renal angina, using the renal angina index, has demonstrated a high negative predictive value for subsequent severe AKI. In the initial derivation and validation study, the RAI demonstrated a NPV of 92-99% in four separate pediatric patient populations for Day 3 – AKI. In that study, the RAI outperformed standard illness severity scores such as Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) for prediction of AKI severity. Additionally, the RAI outperformed the prediction afforded by AKI risk factors or signs of injury alone. Adult studies of renal angina syndrome and predictive \\"sub-acute AKI\\" have also been published. =Biomarker incorporation= The incorporation of biomarkers into renal angina positive patients improves predictive performance for subsequent severe AKI. In the initial study of the RAI incorporating AKI biomarkers, a positive biomarker result (using matrix metalloproteinase-8, neutrophil elastase-2, or NGAL) in the population with an RAI > or = 8 significantly increased the predictive discrimination of renal angina for subsequent severe AKI. Improvement of AKI prediction by incorporation of biomarkers into the renal angina index occurred via correct classification of disease, improving the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), demonstrating net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The results demonstrate that a clinician can identify the absence or fulfillment of renal angina in any patient on admission and then appropriately allocate the use of an AKI biomarker test to those in whom the test may yield the greatest predictive benefit. The excellent negative predictive value (NPV > 90%) of the RAI allows a clinician to reliably ‘rule out’ AKI outside the window of ‘functional AKI’ and may afford more freedom of management for the acutely ill patient (i.e., higher volume resuscitation) with less concerns about developing the severe fluid overload consistently associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients. =CHERUB and AWARE= Several prospective studies are being performed to test the efficacy of the renal angina construct for prediction of severe persistent AKI in children. Studying AKI-CHERUB (AKI in Children Expected by Renal Angina and Urinary Biomarkers) is a 189 patient, single center, prospective study of children admitted to the intensive care unit. Urinary biomarkers tested include NGAL, IL-18, KIM-1, and l-FABP. The CHERUB study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01735162. The AWARE-AKI (Assessment of Worldwide AKI, Renal Angina, and Epidemiology) study encompasses 39 international pediatric intensive care units and is expected to study renal angina, the epidemiology of AKI, and urinary AKI biomarkers in over 5,000 children. The AWARE study is a collaborative effort of the Prospective Pediatric AKI Research Group(www.ppaki.org) and is also registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01987921.

It was a notable example of Tudor Revival architecture, and was one of the largest wooden structures in the United States. It was also the first hotel in Westchester County. Walter William Law had it built on his estate, and the Law family owned it until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom and dining room. For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff Table Water Company. In 1933, the lodge ended year-round service and housed a \\"health-diet sanitarium\\" until the Edgewood Park School for Girls began operation there from 1937 to 1954. From 1936 to 1939, the lodge was run again as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed. From 1955 to 1994, The King's College used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings. Abandoned and unmaintained after 1994, the Briarcliff Lodge was destroyed between 2003 and 2004.  History  = Hotel = alt=A large Tudor Revival resort Walter Law hired Pennsylvania architect Guy King to construct the Briarcliff Lodge on the highest point of Law's estate. At its June 26, 1902 opening, the Tudor Revival-style building was a premier resort hotel with 93 rooms. The Olmsted Brothers, sons of the eminent landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the lodge's surrounding grounds, including a large hillside landscape garden with shady walks, winding drives, green lawns, and flowers. In 1903, the lodge additionally began being used by Mary Elizabeth Dow as Mrs. Dow's School. Walter Law gave Dow a property on Elm Road (later the site of Briarcliff College and then a Pace University campus). In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw construction of a north wing, increasing the number of rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A mooring mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships. There were two sets of greenhouses near the property; one set behind Law's home produced decorations for Law's Briarcliff Farms, his house, the lodge, and workers' houses. The other set, the Pierson Greenhouses, were used for growing the American Beauty rose and rare carnations, producing between 5,000 and 8,000 per week. Foreman George Romaine first propagated the Briarcliff rose there. The lodge also ran an annual American Beauty carnival, with events including a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, cinema program, and a concert. During the lodge's service, carriage transportation was provided for guests from the Scarborough and Briarcliff Manor train stations to the lodge. The lodge had a large Roman-style pool; when it was built in 1912, it was the largest outdoor pool in the world and was used for the 1924 Olympic trials. The Briarcliff Lodge was noted for its cuisine (including Briarcliff dairy and table water), a golf course, fifteen tennis courts, a music room, theater, indoor swimming pool (measuring 30 by 70 feet, with a depth of 4 to 10 feet), casino, library, stable, repair shops and a fleet of Fiat automobiles. The water tower at the property was constructed by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company. The grounds were decorated with Japanese lanterns that Law had obtained from missionaries. The lodge had elevator service and electric lighting. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace held its National Conference on International Problems and Relations at the Briarcliff Lodge from May 10–14, 1926. In 1923, a year before Walter Law's death, the Law family leased the lodge to Chauncey Depew Steele for 20 years. Under Steele's management, the lodge reached its prominence. The lodge also was opened to a wider variety of clientele, but continued to be known as a resort for the wealthy and famous. A 18-hole golf course was completed in 1923, designed by Devereux Emmet. In May 1925, The New York Times reported that the Briarcliff Lodge installed the first artificial spa; using radioactive mineral torbernite to affect the water, believed to counter ailments associated with old age. United States Senators Chauncey Depew, James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr., and Royal S. Copeland were to each place a bag containing the minerals into the lodge's swimming pool. In June of that year, the newspaper mentioned in its report of an upcoming Briarcliff Lodge performance that the swimming pool was popular in the summer heat and that \\"the cool spring radioactive water gave considerable relief to several hundred guests\\". = Decline and lease = The hotel declined during the 1930s. Walter Law's son Henry (also village mayor from 1918 to 1938) attributed the decline to the 1920-1933 prohibition of alcohol. Another factor was the increasing usage of automobiles, as guests would be less inclined to stay throughout the summer. Steele ended up surrendering his lease in 1933; at the time the building was valued at $750,000 ($ in ). The lodge remained in use, housing a \\"health-diet sanitarium\\" until the Edgewood Park School for Girls, a nonsectarian Christian college- and occupational-preparatory school, leased the property in 1936, and purchased it a year later; at the time the lodge was valued at $1,000,000 ($ in ). The lodge was run as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed until 1939. The Edgewood Park School operated there until 1954. In September 1955, The New York Times reported that the lodge was being reopened as a 225-room resort; after being purchased by a partnership led by Emanuel Shapiro, counsel for then-New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey. It was assessed at $400,000 ($ in ) at the time. = College use, demolition, and present-day site = Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville Fire Departments fighting the lodge fire From 1955 to 1994, The King's College, a non-denominational coeducational Christian liberal arts college, relocated to the Briarcliff Lodge property. The school used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings. During that time, in 1985, the Lodge and the Briarcliff library were among 60 sites given historical markers by Westchester County Tricentennial Commission. The New York State Board of Regents closed the school in 1994 due to financial difficulties and a deficiency of qualified faculty. After it closed, the nonprofit Tara Circle planned to build an Irish-American cultural, education, and athletic center, which was approved by the village in November 1994. The site was again purchased in 1996 by Blue Lake Properties. The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building burned to the ground on September 20, 2003. The building was scheduled for demolition within 18 months (they had applied for demolition permits the week before the fire). The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the building and construct the Garlands, a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials, including Briarcliff's fire chief. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was the first to arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. The north wing was damaged but still standing. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Most that remained of the original section was the stone facade and chimneys. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished. From about 2010 to 2019, the site was redeveloped into a retirement home. Plans had existed for the site to be converted to senior living since 1999.https://westfaironline.com/89675/development-underway-168m-club- briarcliff-manor/ In 2010, the Club at Briarcliff Manor built model homes and an information center on-site. The main senior living facility was built from 2017 to 2019, although originally scheduled to open in 2013. Briarcliff Manor's village government took about five years to grant zoning changes, and several more years to approve the site plan. The senior living center has a luxury market, with plans for tennis courts, a health spa, gardens, a surround-sound theater, hiking trails, an indoor pool, a business center, a cocktail lounge, and multiple restaurants. The Club at Briarcliff Manor has sponsored a variety of village amenities, including a $2.25 million pledge for the village library's extension, sponsoring the extension's opening celebration, contributing $500,000 for a village fire truck, and replacing the water tower with a modern hydro-pneumatic pump station. In addition, the Club oversaw the former King's College football and soccer field replacement at a cost of $1.2 million, and transferred it to the village government around 2013.  Architecture  = Main building = The Briarcliff Lodge was located on a site on the highest point of Law's estate. The original wing was designed by Pennsylvania architect Guy King, on the highest point of Walter Law's estate, which was about 600 feet above sea level and north of New York City. The building's first floor exterior walls were constructed of stones from nearby forests, and Indiana limestone was used for trimmings. the second floor exterior walls were decorated with richly colored half timber and pebbledash. The roof had red shingles and tall red brick chimneys. The main facade of the building was two stories high, while the third and fourth floor had many gables and dormer windows present on the roof. The overall design of the building was in the Tudor Revival-style, and was described to be in \\"the fashion of the old English inns\\". The building was long and had 93 rooms. Each room had Colonial mahogany furniture, a long-distance telephone, concealed fire escape, electric lights, and suction ventilators. As well, each room had an exterior wall with a window. In 1902, the hotel's first floor held its reception rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to and north of the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and was based on a restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water. John Clark Udall oversaw construction of the north wing in 1907, increasing the number of rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. = Garage = The garage building In its first operating year, a stable was built for the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The front of the building held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs. = Other buildings = Nearby the lodge was the amusement building, with a dance hall, swimming pool, bowling alley, squash court, and billiard room.  Notable guests  Thomas Edison and Charles Proteus Steinmetz in the library of the lodge during a meeting of the Edison Lighting Company Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were guests at the Briarcliff Lodge. In the early 1930s, Eleanor spoke there several times on behalf of the Women's Democratic Club of Mount Pleasant; her daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted was chairwoman of the club at the time. In 1930, Franklin spoke there as New York Governor to the Westchester County Bankers Association. John W. Davis, US Representative and nominee for President against Calvin Coolidge, visited the lodge in 1924. US Senator Chauncey Depew visited in 1924 and 1927. Composer and pianist Percy Grainger gave a recital at the ballroom of the lodge in 1925. The final German emperor Wilhelm II's son Crown Prince Wilhelm was a guest at the Lodge for the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration. He led a Prussian regiment in a parade of fifty floats held in honor of the celebration in New York. Other notable guests have included Thomas Edison, Tallulah Bankhead, Sarah Bernhardt, Boris Bakhmeteff, Johnny Weissmuller, Jimmy Walker, Babe Ruth, Edward S. Curtis, George B. Cortelyou, Mary Pickford, F. W. Woolworth, J. P. Morgan, Warner Baxter, Vincent Richards, and Ernestine Schumann-Heink. Elihu Root, Al Smith, and a king of Siam were guests at the lodge in the 1920s, and John Campbell frequently hosted parties there. Ella Holmes White and her partner Marie Grice Young lived in the Briarcliff Lodge; an extension known as the Oak Room was constructed on the building's east side for them. The two held a long-term lease there before they boarded the RMS Titanic and survived its sinking; they continued to live at the lodge until later in their lives.  Influences  Southwest view of Law's train station in 1907 In 1906, Walter Law replaced the Briarcliff Manor railroad station and moved the original building to serve as Millwood's station. The new Briarcliff station, now part of the village library, was modeled in the style of his Briarcliff Lodge, and had Mission style furniture, rugs, and flowers decorating the interior. Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th-century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area. The Seven Sisters, a 1915 production, was filmed at the Briarcliff Lodge. See also * Walter W.

It is a designated monument historique. Rue des Déchargeurs entrance to the Hôtel de Villeroy next to the Cremerie de Paris. Description The hôtel de Villeroy is closely linked to the history of the Neufville family (Dukes of Villeroy) as well as the history of the Kingdom of France. The first of its buildings were erected circa 1370 on the rue des Bourdonnais side of its current location. Under Nicolas the 4th of Neufville de Villeroy (who at the time was one of the most important ministers of the Kingdom of France) the building was elaborated, progressively becoming a center for literature. His grandson Nicolas Villeroy the 5th razed the existing buildings to rebuild them in 1640 keeping the existing cellars. The Villeroy family sold the building in 1671 to the Pajot & Rouillé family, known for their postal service business. Much later under ownership of the department store À la Belle Jardinière and in disrepair with an open pit exposed during development of the adjoining Les Halles (the pit then known as \\"le trou des Halles\\") the building space nearly became a large automotive parking lot. Thanks in part to the work of a concerned citizen the building was given monument status protection by the French Ministry of Culture in 1984 and subsequently renovated. A key architectural feature of the building in the form of a grand staircase dating from 1640 has had its original character preserved. The building is one of the few remaining structures of the former aristocratic southwest Les Halles that during the late 16th and early 17th centuries became integrated into a dense network of bourgeois and common houses. It has a second entrance at 9 rue des Déchargeurs. At the time of its construction it bordered the rue de la Limace that was later razed to make way for the creation of the rue des Halles in 1868. Nicolas V de Villeroy era, 1617-1671 Marshal-duke Nicolas V de Neufville de Villeroy Detail of the number 5 symbol featured at the bottom of the lower railing of the grand staircase The grand staircase of the Hôtel de Villeroy. The building was constructed in 1640 by the Duke Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy, the then Marshal of France. The name of the building's architect remains unknown to this day. Nicolas V de Villeroy was raised in the court of King Louis XIII. After the death of the King Nicolas V became a tutor for the new King the young Louis XIV starting in 1646.Childhood places of King Louis XIVThe State in Modern France The young King and his brother Prince Philippe of Orleans resided in the Royal Palace but they often went to the Hotel de Villeroy where they could play with the children of Nicolas Villeroy V, Catherine Neufville de Villeroy and François de Villeroy. From this childhood spent between the Royal Palace and the Hotel de Villeroy a lifelong friendship formed between King Louis XIV and François de Neufville de Villeroy. Upon his passing King Louis XIV's will gave François de Neufville de Villeroy the role of educator for the King's great grandson King Louis XV. Evidence of Nicolas V's former presence at the Hotel de Villeroy can be found in the number '5' forged into the still existing railings of the grand staircase. This staircase figured in some of the photos of the celebrated French photographer Eugène Atget. Hôtel de la Poste era 1671 - 1738  From 1689 to 1738 the Hotel de Villeroy housed Paris' first post office. The Royal French Postal services were operated by Leon Pajot and Louis Rouillé. Book in French Historty of the Postal Services around the World / Histoire de la Poste dans le Monde by Camille Allaz The Pajot & Rouillé family operated 800 \\"relais postaux\\" all over France. The most southern ones were located in Venice and Rome. Horses were carrying mail from the Hotel de Villeroy to the different relais. Mail was also exchanged with the postal services of the Thurn and Taxis family. The company was run by 3 generations of the family. Their grandson Louis Leon Pajot Louis Leon Pajot on French Wikipedia, last \\"maitre des Postes\\", collected valuable scientific instruments which he left to the Académie des Sciences. His International mail exchange partner was Anselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis who disposed of a Postal service in the Habsburg territories and who was based in Brussels and in Francfort. Pajot & Rouillé became one of the wealthiest families in France but their Postal empire came to an end 21 mai 1738 upon a decision of King Louis XV to withdraw the postal license. After the French Revolution the story of the Pajot & Rouillé Post was forgotten in Paris, but it remained in the memory of the Thurn & Taxis family who did not want the same faith happen to their Postal empire. Les Halles foodmarket During the time of the Halles de Paris the building was used to store food products and on the side of the rue des Déchargeurs was put into place a cremerie. The building today constitutes one of the largest 17th century structures in the center of Paris. Its courtyard links the two sides of the building found at 34 rue Bourdonnais and 9 rue des Déchargeurs. The building was classified as a historic monument in 1992. Today the building houses a number of inhabitants and businesses. Return of Telecommunications - Phone Boutique - Internet cafe since 1986 Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis was very interested in his families postal history. 1986 he came to Paris for the fashion week where he met a young student that was also working as a fashion model. He showed him the old Postal mansion, the Hotel Villeroy Bourbon and told him about his ancestor Anselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis coming from Brussels by horse. The idea came up to reactivate the Spirit of Telecommunications that according to Thurn & Taxis must have remained in the still existing walls. The start was a small Phone Boutique located on 11 rue des Halles a few meters down the street (today Cremerie de Paris N°2). The Boutique was helped by a few Thalers Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis had received 1867 in compensation for the nationalisation of the Postal Company. Johannes Thurn & Taxis that loved to follow the project died 1990 but he left to the young student his passion for Telecommunications and a friend, Aimée de Heeren who had been a Secret Service agent during WW2. History of the Thurn & Taxis family and links to the Hotel de Villeroy Bourbon / Cremerie de Paris With the help of the phones and a little jewel left by Coco Chanel to Aimée de Heeren the student was able to get a loan to buy the historic Cremerie de Paris. Two hundred fifty five years after the departure of the postal services, communications returned to the Hotel de Villeroy. In 1993 the former \\"Cremerie de Paris\\", a milkstore located on the rue des Déchargeurs side of the Hotel de Villeroy became a Sony Technology center, eventually becoming one of the first Internet cafés. France's first Internet cafes at the Hotel de Villeroy, article in French The Internet cafe opened at a time Hotels were not yet equipped with a web connection. American tourist that were already online had difficulties to find a connection in Paris. This brought them to the Internet Cafe located at Cremerie de Paris, Hotel de Villeroy Bourbon. Among them many Tech pioneers which would have been difficult to meet, like the assistant of Jon Postel, inventor of the .com domain system, an astronaute that had been on the first flight to the Moon and several young people now in charge of major US Technology corporations. Their influence contributed to several websites invented at the Hotel de Villeroy web cafe. Whitepages in over 50 countries Postmaster Anselm Franz von Thurn & Taxis part of the logo of many Whitepages Whitepages and Yellowpages are expressions that came up in the 19th century shortly after the invention of the Telephone The first Telephone Directories. Phonecompanies were editing them on paper. With the arrival of the internet more and more directories went online. 1994 White Pages Australia published by a division of Telstra were the first to get online White Pages.com.au for Australia. They were soon followed by White Pages New Zealand published by Telekom New Zealand White Pages.co.nz for New Zealand . In Europe many Telecom operators started to put their directories online, most of the times using the translation of the english expression \\"white pages\\" into their local language like \\"pages blanches\\", \\"paginas blancas\\" or \\"pagine bianche\\" Used to the comfort of their Telekom Monopoly they were not realising that many international internet users would not understand expressions that are not in English. In other countries like Malaysia, Philippines, India phone directories never existed before. With the help of Aimée de Heeren who came to the internet cafe every week and who had met Alexander Graham Bell when she was a young woman, the expression \\"whitepages\\" was registered in over 50 different countries, a process which was very complicated during the early years of the internet as a local address or other requirements were needed in many countries. From the Hotel de Villeroy are now edited the Whitepages for France, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Poland, India, Mexico, Taiwan and 40 other countries making the old Paris Postal Building a unique place in Telecom history. Very few Buildings have a Technology history that goes through such a long period of time. The old Postmaster Anselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis and his Posthorn are part of the logo.

Palacio was granted political asylum in the United States in 2012.Strouse, Chuck (2011), “Ecuadorian journalist Emilio Palacio escaped to Miami”, Miami New Times (8 Sept 2011). He is the half-brother of former president of Ecuador Alfredo Palacio (born 1939). Biography =Youth and education= Palacio was born in Guayaquil into a middle-class family. =Career= Palacio was the opinion editor of the Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo. In 2005, Palacio chided Rafael Correa, then Ecuador's finance minister, in print for crudely rejecting a successful currency plan. Correa responded by calling Palacio a traitor. Their feud came to a head in a case related to unrest occurring in September 2010 in which Correa, now president, found himself trapped inside a hospital for several hours by police officers. Correa described the circumstances as an \\"attempted coup\\". In an opinion article from 6 February 2011 which appeared in El Universo (\\"No to Lies\\"), Palacio alleged that the president had ordered soldiers to fire on the hospital, which was full of civilians. The following month, Correa announced a lawsuit against the editorial writer and the directors of the paper. Correa alleged that several of Palacio's editorials were \\"accusations\\" and \\"slander\\", where Palacio stated Correa had \\"...ordered fire at will and without warning against a hospital full of civilians and innocent people...\\" In an official El Universo editorial it was explicitly said that he committed crimes against humanity reasons for which Palacio was sued. El Universo says the president’s suit was announced several hours after the newspaper published an article about an information access request denial. While Palacio claimed, he was sued for calling Correa a \\"Dictator\\". \\"We are not only suing the editorial writer, but also the newspaper El Universo’s directors,” said Correa, in a radio interview on Ecuadorinmediato, quoted by El Universo. According to an editorial published by The Washington Post on 27 July 2011: > Last week the president personally attended the trial while thuggish > supporters threw eggs and bottles at the defendants outside the courthouse. > To no one’s surprise, the provisional judge hearing the case quickly ruled > in the president’s favor, sentencing Mr. Palacio and the three El Universo > directors to three years in prison and awarding $40 million in damages to > Mr. Correa – an amount that exceeds the total value of the newspaper. Palacio and the three executives of the newspaper that published the article were sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of 40 million dollars, payable to Correa himself. On October 31, 2011, Human Rights Foundation (HRF) sent a letter to the National Court of Justice of Ecuador, asking them to overturn the decision, described as \\"abhorrent\\" by HRF president Thor Halvorssen. On 24 August 2011, Palacio fled Ecuador to avoid incarceration and currently resides in the United States where in the following year he was granted political asylum. As of 16 February 2012, the National Court of Justice (Ecuador's highest court) confirmed the lower court's award of $40 million in damages, as well as the three-year prison sentences against a journalist and three executives. By the end of February 2012, Emilio Palacio and El Universo were released from their charges and no other cause is currently active in the case, which implies there is no reason for Palacio to avoid returning to Ecuador.https://www.eluniverso.com/2012/02/28/1/1355/perdon-sin-olvido-otorga- rafael-correa-diario-calderon-zurita.html References Category:1954 births Category:Ecuadorian male writers Category:Living people ","title":"Emilio Palacio"},{"id":"42428512","text":"Kluyvera ascorbata is a bacterium, the type species of its genus.

Mark Reed (born 23 March 1971) is a British sculptor based in East Anglia. He works primarily in metal – bronze, forged steel and aluminium, his themes include nature, family and the passage of time.  Biography  Born in Colchester, he spent his early years in Suffolk, relocating with his family to a Fruit Farm in rural Norfolk in his teens. The trees in the orchards he once pruned and shaped have inspired much of Reed's sculpture and furniture. Mark studied Engineering at the University of Wales. Leaf Chair- Aluminium Reed launched his nature inspired range of furniture in 1999 at Decorex, London and it was at this time that Derek Pullen, Head of Sculpture Conservation, Tate Collections described Reed's Leaf Chair in cast aluminium as \\"a very well resolved and elegant design.\\" In 2002 Mark made Penshurst Dining Table for Fortnum & Mason, London. During this period he worked mainly within the sphere of furniture and interior design, but then turned his attention to sculpture, setting up a foundry in his studio and thus began casting his own bronzes. His initial sculptures explored his fascination with nature and he quickly became known for his tree sculptures in forged steel, the individual branches are heated in the forge and then tapered on the anvil, so the fluid shape of the tree begins to 'grow'. On the birth of his first son in 2004 Reed's own experiences of family life led to a new direction in his work, with his fork and spoon sculptures in stainless steel. In 2004 he worked on his first public commission- Bronze and Cast Iron Tree Planters for The Prince's Trust and the City of London, unveiled by the Lord Mayor of the City. Sidney's oak tree table – bronze and glass In 2005, Reed lost his daughter to cot death and his struggle to deal with her loss created Salvation, which is both a teardrop, where tears are the overflow for raging internal emotions and a droplet of rain or dew which is vital for the existence of life. All profits from the sale of this sculpture have gone to The Foundation for the Study of Infant Death Mark regularly uses recycled materials where possible and was actively involved in the Creative Partnership Initiative, working with local primary schools to engage and discuss in the creative process that evolved into his Spaceship (2011) sculpture and Spoon Seesaw 2012. He currently lives with his wife and four boys near Swaffham in Norfolk. Salvation Sculpture – Stainless Steel  Sculpture  Life Leaf- Bronze Ammonite Slice – Bronze & gold sculpture with verdigris patination Reed's sculptures have nature and his place within it at its roots, with his education in engineering and biology, he is interested in the workings of natural structures and the way they contribute to the artistic view of a plant or animal. With this knowledge, within Mark's work, trees become tables, and natural forms are channelled to become functional items in bronze, aluminium or forged steel. Mark is intrigued by intangible configurations as well, particularly in how an entity exists as an component in a hierarchy of cooperatives. In his bronze Life Leaf(2000) a solitary leaf is the \\"life giver\\", it gives energy to the entire tree, whilst being recycled into the organism. The rooks in Secret Garden Door are a group descending on the tree with giant spring nests, and therefore indicating the death of winter and new life for a tree. Meanwhile, there is a looking forward momentum in Reed's work, the door opens into the future or the viewers' imagination, the eroded holes within the leaf allow shards of life to permeate through. Secret Garden Door Reed's 4.5m x 3.5m forged and stainless steel Arbour Metallum tree sculpture, (inspired by the windswept trees in his native North Norfolk Coast), was unveiled at Chelsea Flower Show and was exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley in 2013. He sees it as \\"a protector, from the heat of the sun, creating a dappled shade, as nature protects and nourishes us.\\" Reed's family and children influence his other work -whilst Mark was feeding his baby, the unassuming spoon suddenly became massively significant, as a means of giving sustenance and independence. The same tool can be alienating as well as vital, as in an infant's hands, an adult spoon is huge and out of place. So the stainless steel Spoon Bench (2004) was conceived, at odds with its place and size, and as if levitating. In August 2013, Reed made a Spoon Sculpture to public commission for a hospital in Welwyn, Herts and in July 2013, he was commissioned to make A Bridge to Success for the Prince of Wales and The Prince's Trust at Sandringham Flower Show. Mark has produced many commissions and his work can be found in collections in four continents. In 2010, Reed created Ammonite Slice, inspired by a visit to the Natural History Museum in London and the juxtaposition of nature and the mathematical fractal spiral inside an ammonite shell. He is fascinated by the contrasts of the alien and familiar & the alliance of science and nature.

It was published between April 2010 and October 2013 in the magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, and has been compiled and published in a nine-volume book set. A French translation was published by Kana in July 2012.  Synopsis  Plagued by corruption and injustice, the country has fallen into the hands of the mafia. The big cities have become the theater of a war opposing two mafia currents: the first, traditional, tries to restore stability in its districts and to protect the inhabitants while the second, new, uses \\"force\\" only in their own interests. Hoping to suppress this escalation of violence, the government set up a special organization, Red Raven. The latter aims to uphold the law by methods ... not always orthodox. In order to apply their death sentences, they employ extraordinary fighters, reputed to be ruthless. But at the heart of the conflict, a mysterious group, called the White Mafia, feeds the traffic in dangerous and illegal weapons called Sccaggs to plunge the world into chaos.  Characters  = Red Raven = ; :Red Raven I, \\"The Hangman\\". Despite his air of intelligence and his glasses, he is the most brutal of the Red Ravens. His instruments of execution are handcuffs with the ties of which he strangles his victims. Blond with long hair, endowed with great physical strength, he has a tattoo representing a woman holding the scales of justice on the right hand and was in the past a rifleman (Italian policeman) with Joseph. He does not support injustice but is stubborn like a mule. He is a bit of a failed cop because he never managed to spare his Herculean strength, according to Joseph. ; :Red Raven II, \\"Merciless Undertaker\\". His execution instruments are a coffin and the crucifixes he stores there. 20 years old, the right lobe pierced with an earring in the shape of a cross, the red hair (of which he was ashamed (proof that he is a so-called child of the devil) until he meets Émilie , his best childhood friend, who complimented him on his \\"beautiful red hair\\"). In a jovial mood, he tends to \\"mother\\" Andy. He is someone who is attentive and very sensitive to other people's mood changes, often to his detriment. He loves motorcycles but only has an old bike that once belonged to Joseph and that he has refurbished. He looks like a kid and is sometimes rude (after Andy). An orphan from Castor Arte, he lost Emilie in a church fire 15 years ago, during the \\"5 Days of Blood\\" caused by the Sccaggs and the Caccini. As a result, Walter does not support the mafia nor forgive it for having caused the death of his friend. One of his reasons for joining the Red Ravens is his disdain for the Mafia system. ; :Red Raven III, \\"the Electric Chair\\". Qualified as a veteran by Carlo, he is accompanied by Sanson, his surveillance crow. His instrument of execution is, as his nickname suggests, an electric chair. He seems to like crows, especially Charles, but abandons his own, making him watch or simply leaving him behind. He has a habit of buying candy with an apparently foul taste every time he goes to a new city. He was a rifleman with Silvio. He was the one who found Andy in the street after he escaped from the laboratory where he was a prisoner. ; :Red Raven IV, \\"the one-eyed headhunter\\". His execution instrument is a guillotine. 15 years old, blond, decked out in a \\"bizarre\\" bowl cut. Quite cold by nature, he pays no attention to others (well, that's what he wants to believe), he has a deplorable sense of direction and a phobia of everything that relates closely or far in the field of medicine (both instruments and places), a consequence of its painful past as a guinea pig among the Sccaggs. His monitoring crow is called Charles, of which the Red Raven often complains and sows as soon as he can (that is to say quite often), much to the dismay of the poor robot. Under his headband hides in fact the \\"Brute Eye\\", eyeball made by the Sccaggs and bearing their emblem which was forcibly implanted when he was a child. It allows him to follow the trajectory of bullets from any firearm. Andy also has a number of Sccaggs tattooed on the chest: the reverse No.003. He wants to take revenge on the Sccaggs and this is clearly one of the reasons that led him to become a Red Raven, even if he always retorts the opposite. ; :Red Raven V, \\"the Thief of Spirits\\". She is known to date as the only female executioner. Insectophobic, she uses dominoes from which she releases neurotoxin. She can also heal thanks to her potions. She is albino-looking and has a crow called Henry. She doesn't get along with Ryan. Ryan Aubrey :Red Raven VI, \\"the Executioner Witch Hunter\\" or \\"the Inquisitor Enjoyer\\". Dark and long hair, his face covered with piercing, he prefers to burn his prey until death follows. As a result, his instruments of execution are explosives and the ordeal of fire. He sometimes goes too far, which is why Connie is sometimes forced to stop him with her toxic gases. He also gets along with the girl like dog and cat. Scotto Getty :Red Raven VII, \\"The Instigator of Heaven's Funeral\\". Short light hair, blase look, the lower half of his face is hidden by the collar of his coat. Described as \\"scary\\" by Longval, he takes care of monitoring and gathering information. In a sense, it is he who most resembles a red crow since he can communicate with real crows. ; :A government judge, he is the director of the Red Raven division. He is the son of one of the members of Parliament and is known to be the youngest judge in the country. He sometimes displays a devious smile and is, like Monica, bothered by his curly hair which gives the impression that he is not combed. ; :Subordinate to Carlo who is attentive and worried by nature, she has very poor eyesight and she cannot distinguish people's faces without her glasses. Like her supervisor, she is bothered by her hair for the same reasons. Eliana :Red Raven HQ nurse. Filippo :Employed at Red Raven HQ, he has been there for a while. Katy :Employed at Red Raven HQ, colleague of Filippo and subordinate of Carlo. ; :Robot in the shape of a crow, he is responsible for monitoring Andy. He shows common sense and great vitality. Since he was traumatized by a fight that went wrong, he has had the bad habit of running away at the slightest danger. His beak and claws are not sharp enough to be able to injure but it is so hard that it can easily pierce its target. Longval :Raven of Silvio, he is afraid of Scotto and has three spikes on his head. Sanson :Raven of Joseph, he is quite docile and rather imposing. = The Mafia =  Caccini family  ; : Current and first female head of the Caccini family, she is nicknamed \\"the Ghost Empress\\" because she has no criminal record, that no one had ever heard of her in the mafia world before she take the lead of the Caccini and that its origins remain unknown. She is Ricardo Caccini's older sister and, like all members of the Caccini family, she hates Sccaggs. ; : Laura's younger brother, he leads his sister's \\"Black Dogs\\" elite squad. He has a burn scar on his left eye and is 23 years old. He is wary of women because of his angry sister and Mela who's a yandere. He handles knives particularly well. He \\"freaks out at Laura\\" after Cresson and kept running away from him when he was a child. ; : This young girl with deceptive appearances is one of the \\"Dark Dogs\\" of the Ghost Empress. Sniper, she sticks Ricardo as soon as she can and does not take her eyes off him, so that when he is far away, she observes him with the rifle scope, which makes the poor leader of the \\"Black Dogs\\" fear that she might shoot him. She is very possessive and protective of him and is capable of sniping anyone who approaches or attacks her Ricardo. ; : Member of the \\"Black Dogs\\", he speaks little and handles the saber. ; : Friend of Ricardo since their childhood and member of the \\"Black Dogs\\", he uses a large knife as a weapon. He is from Sassi, the old city of Aretam, and knows all the alleys of the city like his pocket. As a child, he sometimes went to fly in the new city and met Ricardo there in yet another runaway from the latter, whom he considers a brother. ; : Calogero, nicknamed the \\"Dog eats dog\\", is a big hat of the Caccini. He did not see very well that the leader of his beloved family was a woman and decided to acquire a more powerful \\"force\\", that of the dangerous and illegal Sccaggs weapons. Vizzini family ; :He is the current head of the Vizzini family. What does he look like under his mask? Basil has heard that he has a big scar. Vizzini is a real pervert who devotes an exaggerated cult to beauty. It is him who chooses the clothes that Sfoglia wears. He is very large, which allows Sfoglia to always spot him easily. He is also the reverse No.008. Dragonetti family ; : He is the current head of the Dragonetti family. He is a bearded man with long hair. Gallo family ; : He is the current head of the Gallo family. He seems to be the oldest of the five generations of his line. Bagwell family ; :He is the current head of the Bagwell family. He is a very bearded man. He is involved in the transportation industry. He has no specialty. Giordani family ; :4th head of the Giordani family, she is around 16 years old and knows Andy well, having rescued him while he was being chased by mobsters. Her family is one of those who protect citizens. Sccaggs family or the White Mafia  ; : He's the head of the Sccaggs family. A true genius, he was only 20 years old when he set up his organization and it only took him two for the Sccaggs to become known worldwide through the manufacture and sale of powerful Sccaggs weapons. . He would have made the planet tremble more than once but was killed by the Caccini during \\"5 days of blood\\" by Castor Arte. This event destroyed the Sccaggs family. However, it turns out that the White Mafia and the Sccaggs are one and that Siegfried is still alive. He is the investigator of the experiments carried out on Andy as well as other subjects who joined his camp in order to adapt the man to the weapon, thus making the human body become a living weapon.Siegfried revives the Sccaggs by obtaining Vizzini's territory when he died. ; : Reverse No.004, he is a great maniac of cleanliness. 17 years old, blond, still in a white suit, his eyebrows have been arched since his birth. Despite his haughty and mocking smile, he remains courteous to people and never forgets to greet them. His weapon is Sccaggs No.004, the \\"Poisoned Scorpion\\". It is endowed with a power which allows it to gnaw at any matter just by touching it: the \\"Erosive Hand\\". ; : Reverse No.002, he is nicknamed the \\"Commander\\". His weapon is the Sccaggs No.002, \\"Rifle bullet ant\\", composed of six blades which he controls thanks to the magnetic power of his left hand, the \\"Main Guide\\". He claims to be able to hear the voices of arms, whatever they are. His ears are pierced with black earrings and his left eye has started to rot since he was a failed guinea pig for the Brute Eye. ; : Reverse No.005, she wields \\"the Scolopendre\\". Emilie and her are in fact one. Considered dead during the massacre of \\"5 days of blood\\" by Castor Arte, she was saved by the Sccaggs who used her as a guinea pig. The Sccaggs replaced her burnt skin so as to give her an ultra-sensitive epidermis allowing her to guess the positions of her enemies and their next attacks. It turns out that she sank into madness and got stuck on the past because she does not recognize the Walter of the present, remembering only the lonely little boy with whom she always held her hand. She loves Walter's hair to the point of dyeing hers red, the same color as him. She ends up dying in the arms of her childhood friend. ; : Reverse No.006, he is a dangerous man who only thinks of breaking everything he sees. He is very agile and speaks vulgarly despite his childish face. ; : Reverse No.007, she is a little doll- like girl. She has the “Voice of the Doctrine” and is very attached to Vizzini. She was collected by the Red Ravens at the death of him. Emilio Vizzini Reverse No.008, he is the head of one of the five great families of the Mafia, the Vizzini family. He has the \\"Pillaging Arm\\". He picked up Sfoglia when she was abandoned by Siegfried Scaggs. = Others = ; :Head of the Delvecchio family, he owned a numbered Sccaggs, which earned him to be executed by Andy. ; Head of the Bossi family, he was executed by Andy for the same reason as Don Delvecchio, in addition to having created false notices of judgment. ; : Former head of the Lonergan family, he was nicknamed \\"Lonergan the Repugnant\\" and known for not skimping on resources when he acted as head of the family. He was killed at home by a rival mafia. He was Tony's maternal grandfather. ; ; : Tony is the grandson of Dion Lonergan. ; ;  Manga  = Technical sheet = * Japanese edition : Square Enix ** Number of volumes released : 9 (complete) ** Date of first publication : September 2010 ** Serialized : Monthly Shōnen Gangan * French edition : Kana ** Number of volumes released : 9 (complete) ** Date of first publication : July 2012 ** Format : 115 mm x 175 mm = List of chapters = }  References  ; Japanese Edition ; French Edition External links *Official website References Category:Shōnen manga Category:2010 manga ","title":"Red Raven (manga)"},{"id":"42428684","title":"Elena Tice"},{"id":"42428685","text":"Pectinatus frisingensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria first isolated from spoilt beer.

Synopsis  In 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, are sent to Shutter Island to find a mass murderer who has escaped from Ashecliffe Hospital, a fortress- like federal institution for the criminally insane. As an intense hurricane bears relentlessly down on the island, the marshales are forced to piece together clues to a shocking puzzle hidden within Shutter Island, taking them on a dark, twisted journey, where paranoia assumes an air of cool rationality and the line between sanity and madness disappears.Browse inside Shutter Island's graphic novel, Harpercollins  Plot  Summer, 1954.

Solando's doctor, Dr. Sheehan, had left on vacation. And also, they are barred from searching Ward C and told that the lighthouse on the island has already been searched. The only clue is a note, which reads: \\"The law of 4; I am 47; They are 80; + you are 3; But who is 67?\\". A code that Teddy believes points to a 67th patient, when there are only 66.

Daniels, starts having migraine headaches, visions and disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was murdered in a fire set by a local arsonist named Andrew Laeddis, who is an inmate at Ashecliffe Hospital.

Dr. Cawley gives him pills and invite him to take a nap. Daniels has disturbing dreams of his wife again. Daniels and Aule decide to break into Ward C. While Daniels is searching for Laeddis, a patient in a solitary confinement calls him by the name of Laeddis. Daniels realizes he is his friend, George Noyce and question him to find where is Laeddis. But Noyce tells him that it is a setup and he has to accept that his wife is dead and let her go or else he will never leave this island. He finally tells him that Laeddis have been moved from ward C and Daniels deduces that he is at the lighthouse. While Daniels and Aule are searching for the lighthouse, Aule disappear and Daniels finds no sign of Aule. He returns to the hospital and ask Dr. Cawley if he has seen his partner. Dr. Cawley tells him that he has no partner and claims that he arrived alone.Book Review: Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane, Blogcritics During the night, Daniels tries to escape, but he finds the lighthouse, breaks into it and finds Dr. Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Andrew Laeddis is actually Daniels himself. He explains that Andrew Laeddis is an anagram of Edward Daniels and that he murdered his wife, who is Dolores Chanal (an anagram of Rachel Solando), two years ago after she drowned their 3 children. This is the answer of the code \\"the law of 4\\" and Laeddis is the 67th patient at Ashecliffe. Andrew refuses to believe it and shoot Dr. Cawley with what he thinks it is his gun, but it is a water pistol toy. Chuck then enters and revealing that he is actually Andrew's psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan. This setup has been designed to allow him to live out his elaborate fantasy, in order to confront the truth and accept the reality or else he will have a radical lobotomy treatment. Andrew does not admit the truth. They hold him down and give him medicine. Laeddis awakes in the hospital, under Dr. Cawley's watch. When questioned, Laeddis tells the truth in a coherent manner, which satisfies the doctors as a sign of progression. Nevertheless, Dr. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state a few months ago, but he had a regression and they cannot risk that again. Andrew swears it will not happen again. The next morning Andrew sits outside next to Dr. Sheehan and tells him he needs to find a way to get off the island and go home.

In the Middle East, one branch of religion dominates the geographical demography: Islam. Within these population, nonetheless, reside the small margin of those who are without faith, and who often face serious formal, and in some cases informal, legal and social consequences. In terms of atheism and apostasy, Islam does condemn the practice within the Quran (as it categorizes non-believers as kuffarWarner, Bill. \\"Kafir.\\" Political Islam, 17 June 2008. https://www.politicalislam.com/kafir/) and within the Sunnah (as Muhammad stated that \\"The blood of a Muslim . . . cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas [retribution] for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from [leaves] Islam and leaves the Muslims.\\",Bukhari 9:83:18 https://web.archive.org/web/20170610042948/http://cmje.usc.edu/religious- texts/hadith/bukhari/083-sbt.php#009.083.017 and commanded that, \\"Whoever changes his religion [from Islam], execute him.\\"Sunan Ibn Majah 3:20:2535 https://quranx.com/Hadith/IbnMajah/DarusSalam/Volume-3/Book-20/Hadith-2535/). While the Quran does not explicitly criminalize or pronounce a hadd (a specific criminal punishment) for apostasy, Muslim scholars have traditionally believed, by consensus (Ijma), that it should be penalized with execution, as per the Hadiths quoted.Mayer, Ann Elizabeth. \\"Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East.\\" The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Winter, 1987), pp. 127-184Maliki Fiqh: The Risala of 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al- Qayrawani A Treatise on Maliki Fiqh (Including commentary from ath-Thamr ad- Dani by al-Azhari)(310/922 - 386/996) Shafi Fiqh: Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri, Edited and Translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller (p. 595) and Ahmad ibn Naqib al- Misri, Edited and Translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller (p. 508, o1.1-2) Hanafi Fiqh: Shaybani's Siyar (The Islamic law of nations) Hanbali Fiqh: By Imam Muwaffaq Ibn Qudama (A.H. 541-620), page 309 Middle Eastern nations with some form of Sharia Law in court punish non-believers in varying ways, however, many outspoken humanitarians and especially atheists argue that these punishments are unreasonable and severe. Background In the World Values Survey conducted from 2010 to 2014, results show that in Yemen, Jordan, and Iraq fewer than 0.5% of those surveyed self-defined themselves as atheists; meanwhile, the highest percentage of self-defined atheists within the Middle East was in Kuwait, at 5.5%.Yearbook of International Religious Demography, 2015. Kuwait's comparatively high ratio can also be explained by the fact that when Kuwait Parliament passed a legislative amendment in 2011 that would have made it a capital crime to commit blasphemy, it was subsequently rejected by the Court of Ministers. However, it is still a punishable crime to commit blasphemy in Kuwait, especially for journalists.\\"KUWAIT 2012 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT\\" https://photos.state.gov/libraries/kuwait/63599/PDF/irf2012.pdf Despite the relatively low number of publicly atheist individuals in the Middle East, some media platforms have claimed that the Middle East is witnessing a new rise of outspoken secular and irreligious citizens. In a BBC News article that highlights a recent Arab Barometer survey on Middle East and North African citizens, Egypt was shown to have a comparatively significant increase in the proportion of people who say they are not religious from 2013 to 2019.BBC News, 24 June 2019. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48703377 Some of these citizens who come from a state with severe punishments for atheists, like the death penalty, have reported to living in fear. Regardless, transparent data on how many citizens in the Middle East are atheists, apostasy, or of other form of irreligious identity have been challenging for researchers to discover. In one report by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, atheists residing in Kurdish region of Iraq also have difficulties expressing their disbelief publicly—despite Kurdish government generally considered to be secular.\\"Iraq: Information on the treatment of atheists and apostates by society and authorities in Erbil.\\" Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 2013-September 2016. https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/902671/download Rise of the \\"New Atheists\\" One of the rising form of non-religious sectors within the Middle East have been labeled as the new atheists.

Ismail Mohammed, from Cairo, is a new atheist who utilized social media platform to vocalize atheism. The same article that interviewed Mohammed, also added that some atheists supporters have estimated that Egypt has 3 million atheists in their population of 90 million.Youssef, Nancy. \\"Meet The Middle East’s Atheist Preacher: In a region increasingly defined by its Islamic fundamentalism, Ismail Mohammed is vocal about his belief that there is no God.

Persecution of Non-Believers in the Middle East Like other non- Muslims, atheists suffer persecution in the Middle East. 64 percent of Muslims in Egypt are reported to approve of the death penalty for those who leave Islam. In one report by the International Humanists, in Article 121 of Iranian law, homosexuality is punishable up to death for a non-Muslim subject, while the Muslim active party is punished through 100 lashes.\\"Iran.\\" The Humanists International. https://fot.humanists.international/countries/asia-southern- asia/iran/ Though persecution of blasphemous atheist are often carried out by law in the Middle East, some states like Turkey and Lebanon do allow atheists to live rather safely though withstanding any promise of legal form of safety.\\"No God, Not Even Allah; Atheists and Islam.\\" The Economist Nov 24 2012: 67,n/a. ProQuest. Meanwhile, some scholars have been opposing the death penalty for apostasies in the Islamic realm. Writers Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed published a book claiming the history and fundamentals of Islam support freedom of religion, and that since the Quran does not explicitly state to punish apostasy with death it is unethical to support capital punishment for non-religious individuals.Saeed,Abdullah and Hassan Saeed. Freedom of Religion,\\"Apostasy and Islam.\\" New York: Routledge, 2004. And although the Quran does not state exactly how apostasy should be punished, it has historically been debated among the Islamic communities. Scholars Rudolph Peters and Gret J.J. De Vries document that some, like the Hanafite lawyers, did argue that under the penal law an Imam should execute the apostasy by a sword; meanwhile female and children have been seen as uniformly by the community as the exceptions to execution.Peters, Rudolph and Gret J.J. De Vries. \\"Apostasy in Islam.\\"Die Welt des Islams, Vol. 17, Issue 1/4 (1976-1977), pp. 1-25. Prevalence Though still uncommon, public acknowledgement of atheism is widely considered to be growing in the Middle East. Youth in the Persian Gulf countries have increasingly been expressing their atheism on the Internet in recent years, despite residing in heavily religious societies. Web and internet has been a popular tool where more than 50 atheist Facebook groups and pages, some with more than 130,000 followers,https://www.facebook.com/atheistsgotoheaven/ have formed in the last few years especially since the Arab spring. Also, a YouTube channel with over 36 thousand subscribers, called The Black Ducks, is run by the previously mentioned Ismail Mohammed.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuI0UMM0WaUXnlyEuo-6Ng The channel often conducts interviews with fellow non-believers from within the Arab Middle East, including former imams who left their faith. Though data on how prevalent atheism is can be difficult to measure where social desirability bias may obscure survey answers, there have been attempts to record potential trends. According to a BBC survey conducted by the Arab Barometer, the non- religious population of the Middle East and North Africa is estimated at 13% in 2019, a rise from 8% in 2013. Arabs are said to be increasingly turning their back on religion. Relevant Data In the 2012 Global Religious Index that rated a country's index based on the percentage of people who identify as religious, with the highest being 96, Iraq came in at 88 and Saudi Arabia at 75. Meanwhile, the Global Atheism Index for the same year show percent of self-identified atheist in Iraq at 0 and in Saudi Arabia at 5. In comparison, the Global Distribution of self-identified atheist was at 13 percent.\\"Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism\\" WIN-Gallup International, 2012.https://www.scribd.com/document/136318147/Win-gallup-International- Global-Index-of-Religiosity-and-Atheism-2012#download In another aspect of BBC New's survey conducted by Arab Barometer in 2013, which was shortly after the Arab Spring, Lebanese citizens have significantly declined in religious beliefs. According to a summary by Arab Weekly, the survey indicates that less than 25 percent of Lebanese identify as religious, but it is not clear how many are particularly atheist.\\"Poll describes Arabs as moving away from religion, Islamism: Trust in Islamist movements has declined dramatically since the 'Arab spring' revolts.\\" The Arab Weekly, 28 June 2019. https://thearabweekly.com/poll-describes-arabs-moving-away-religion-islamism In 2010 Pew Research study found that in Jordan and Egypt, where 58 percent and 74 percent respectively believe the Sharia Law should be imposed on both Muslim and non-Muslim citizens of their nation, had a high number of people who believe in death penalty for those who abandon their Islamic faith. The study found 86 percent of Egyptians, 82 percent Jordanians, as well as 66 percent from Palestinian Territory surveyed citizens support capital punishment for apostates; also 46 percent Lebanese and 42 percent Iraqis agreed to the capital punishment.\\"The World’s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society.\\" Chapter 1: Belief About Sharia.

It contains the village of Doolin. Location The parish lies in the northwest corner of the Barony of Corcomroe. It is and covers . It lies along the South Sound, opposite the Aran Islands. The land is mountainous and broken. The small bay of Doolin lies at the boundary between the schistose rocks that form the cliffs stretching southward to the Shannon Estuary and the limestone of the Barony of Burren. Doolin Castle was located near the bay, north of Fisherstreet. The parish is north of Ennistymon. Civil and Catholic parish In 1845 the parish was united with Clooney to form one Catholic parish. Today it is part of the Catholic parish of Lisdoonvarna and Kilshanny in the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora. Parish churches are Corpus Christi in Lisdoonvarna, Holy Rosary in Doolin, Our Lady of Lourdes in Toovahera and Saint Augustine in Kilshanny. Demographics The population in 1841 was 3,904 in 644 houses. Of these, 3,551 in 586 houses lived in rural districts. History Quarrying was once an important industry in the parish and in Kilmacrehy to the south. More than 500 men used to work for nine companies at four major quarries: Doonagore, Caherbana, Lough and Moher. The main shipping port was Liscannor. Flag stone from this area was used in English city pavements, the floor of the Royal Mint and for building the Redemptorist Church in Belfast. In 1904/5 a narrow gauge railway was operated by Watson's quarry, running for 3.5 miles. In the 1930s and 1940s, Judge Comyn operated an open-cast phosphate mine near Doolin. Around 85,000 tons were mined in total until, during World War II, the government compulsorily acquired them. The owner sued, arguing insufficient compensation. After a total of 41 days in court in 1949/50, the court awarded him in excess of £20,000. Antiquities =Prehistoric through early medieval= The parish contains remains of many old forts or settlements surrounded by embankments. A particularly large group of such remains, along with associated enclosures and stone walls are known as the \\"Glasha group\\", after the townlands north of Doolin in which they are located. A cromlech stands on the townland of Cahermacrusheen. At Teergonean townland, there is a court cairn, one of several such structures in the Burren. Most examples of this type of structure are found in the north of Ireland, however. Although the history and migration patterns of the people who built these tombs are still the subject of debate, the tomb likely dates to the period 3500 to 3200 BC. There is also uncertainty over the origin of the townland's name. T. J. Westropp suggested a relationship to the three ruined cashels (or ringforts) in the area. He also gave possible variants as: Tregownine, Tirgouinene and Tirgearnine. Frost translated Tír gan Éan as \\"the birdless district\\". Another fort is located at Cnoc na Stúlaire in Doolin townland. It consists of a circular ditch and embankment. Inside are two standing stones, one of which has fallen. However, absent excavations it is uncertain whether the stones are contemporaneous with the surrounding earthen structure or were added later. Claims that one of the stones features Ogham writing have been discounted. Other antiquities include several ring cairns, likely from the Iron Age, around Doolin. One of them was reportedly the site where in 1588 170 survivors of an Armada wreck were hanged. Where the Aille river flows into the Atlantic, southeast of Doolin Harbour, lies the so-called \\"Doolin axe factory\\". At this site, stone tools (axes, scrapers) were manufactured. The findings' origins likely are Neolithic (there is a tomb from that period at Teergonean, see above) or even Mesolithic, as those earlier hunter-gatherer groups often used river mouths as locations for their base camps. =Churches= The origins of the parish name are unknown. There is no recorded saint with a name like Oighleach. The only holy well was one at Toomullin dedicated to Saint Breccan of Arran, a disciple of St Patrick. In 1897 the church of Killilagh was well preserved. In addition to Toomullin Church, there was another ancient church in ruins at Oughtdarra. Killilagh Church is a large parish church with a side chapel, substantially rebuilt around the 15th century. The main wing is almost 20 meters long. Killilagh was one of the wealthiest and most populous parishes in Kilfenora diocese. Not much of the original pre-14th century church remains today. The church has been the subject of much damage from the weather.In 2013 restoration work to the side chapel by Doolin Heritage and Conservation Builder Tom Howard of Kilnaboy under the guidance of Dick Cronin and with the permission of the National Monuments, further work is planned. A storm in 1903 blew over the eastern gable wall. A carved stone head from the church is now at the Burren Centre at Kilfenora, after it was stolen in 1971 and later recovered. A mausoleum to the south of the church was intended as the Macnamara family vault, but was not used. Toomullin Church was in use at the same time as Killilagh Church and was reportedly founded by St Breccan. The church was originally much smaller than it is today. If it was founded by St Breccan, it must have initially been a wooden structure. The church is mentioned in taxation lists in the early 14th century, but at the time was one of the poorest in the Diocese of Kilfenora. The vicinity to Killilagh, the richest church in the Diocese, makes it unlikely that it was a parish church. Toomullin likely served as a family chapel to the MacClancy family of nearby Toomullin Castle (see below). In 1941, a bronze brooch from around 200 to 300 AD was discovered by workers at Judge Comyn Phosphate digging a new watercourse, the hoard also included a stone ring, two tusks and skull now lost. Today, much of the south wall of the church has collapsed, but several 15th-century features can still be identified. The graveyard, the tomb of Conogher MacClancy and the holy well noted by Frost in 1897 are no longer extant. =Castles= The 1580 inventory of Thomond castles lists five in the parish. Doonagore Castle belonged to Sir Daniel O'Brien of Dough of the powerful O'Brien family Knockfin, Doonmacfelim and Ballinalacken were owned by Teigue MacMurrogh O'Brien. Doonmacfelim, close to Fisherstreet, is a tower house from the late 15th or early 16th century. After the Cromwellian settlement it passed to one John Fitzgerald. Toomullin Castle was the property of Conogher (or Conor) MacClancy (or sometimes McClancy, MacGlanchy) and Hugh MacClancy in the middle of the 15th century. Hugh's direct descendant, Boetius Clancy (died April 1598), High Sheriff of Clare, owned Knockfin Castle in 1580. He hanged the survivors of the September 1588 Spanish Armada wreck and had a table made from some of the ship's timber. It was later given to the owners of Leamaneh Castle, Conor O'Brien and Máire ní Mahon. Today, it is on display in Bunratty Castle. The MacClancy family were the brehons (or hereditary lawyers) of the Earls of Thomond. Their famous law school was at the site now occupied by the Church of the Holy Rosary (Roman Catholic, c. 1830) at the intersection in Knockfin, about a mile north of Doolin. Ballinalacken Castle stands on a rocky eminence near the sea. Given the prominent position, it is likely that the location was used for previous fortifications, but no traces of them are visible today. The name probably derives from Baile na leachan (town of the flagstones/tombstones/stones) or Beal Áth na Leacha (ford-mouth of the flagstones). In the late 14th century, Lochlan MacCon O'Connor reportedly built a fortress at the site. The current tower house resembles Leamaneh Castle in that it was constructed over a prolonged period. The oldest part is the tall eastern tower, likely built in the 15th century. Doolin House, or Doolin Castle, was a property of the MacNamaras of Ennistymon. After likely having served as their main residence in the 19th century, by the early 20th century it was a summer home. The poet Francis MacNamara used it this way in the 1910s. His daughter Nicolette Macnamara later described life there in detail in her autobiographical book Two Flamboyant Fathers. Among Francis' regular guests at the house were writer George Bernard Shaw and painter Augustus John. In the 1920s the house was destroyed by fire. Subsequently, the stones were carried away by locals as construction material and the Land Commission redistributed the land.

Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne (25 March 1862 – 23 September 1938) was a French engineer and mathematician. He founded the field of nomography, the graphic computation of algebraic equations, on charts which he called a nomogram.  Biography  Philbert-Maurice Ocagne was born in Paris on 25 March 1862. He attended high school at the Lycée Fontanges school in Paris, and studied at Chaptal college. In 1877, he published his first mathematical work. In 1880, he entered the École Polytechnique. He published many articles on math. Starting in 1885, he served for six years as engineer, supporting waterworks projects in Rochefort and Cherbourg, then worked at Seine-et-Oise, at the residence of Pontoise. From 1882, continued to published articles on mathematics in the Academy of Sciences. Several major journals publish his work, including Journal of the École Polytechnique, Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France, Acta Mathematica, Archiv der Mathematik und Physik, and American Journal of Mathematics. He became a répétiteur at the École Polytechnique in 1893, then in 1894 a professor at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. In 1891 he began publishing papers on nomography. In 1901, he was appointed deputy director of general survey of France. Ten years later, he became chief of maps and plans and precision instruments for the Department of Public Works. He was appointed chief engineer in 1908. In 1912 he was appointed professor of geometry at the École Polytechnique, and became Inspector General of roads and bridges in 1920.

In 1901, he became president of the Mathematical Society of France. In 1922, he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences.  Family  Originally from the province of Alençon in Normandy, his family can be traced to the 8th century. D'Ocagne's lineage came from the du Plessis family, and he used the pseudonym Philbert du Plessis in some of his scientific publications. Mortimer d'Ocagne, Maurice's father, published widely on economic and financial topics and wrote a book on French higher education Les Grandes Ecoles de France.

It is currently in the permanent collection of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1898, the portrait was acquired by a New York art dealer from a private collector in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1899, the portrait was sold to Boston businessman Frederick Sears. The painting was purchased by the Joslyn Museum in 1942 from a private collection. Initially believed to have been painted by Rembrandt himself, the painting was later reclassified as a painting from the \\"School of Rembrandt\\"; the likely work of one of Rembrandt's students. In the spring of 2012, under the guidance of Ernst van de Wetering, one of the world's foremost authorities on Rembrandt, the museum sent the painting to Amsterdam for further study and treatment. Martin Bijl, former head of restoration at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, worked with van de Wethering on the painting's conservation. The determination that the painting was a true Rembrandt was made during the conservation process. The subject depicted in the painting is Dirck van Os III (1590-1668), a prominent Dutch citizen. He was the son of Dirck van Os (Antwerp 13 March 1556 – Amsterdam 20 May 1615), an Amsterdam merchant, insurer, financier, and shipowner. The elder van Os was one of the founders of the Compagnie van Verre, the Amsterdam Exchange Bank, and the United East India Company (VOC). The painting shows van Os as an elderly man, seated holding a cane in his left hand, donning a black robe with white collar and cuffs, and wearing a cap. During the restoration process, it was determined that later additions to the painting included lace around the collar and a chain with a cross hanging from the subject's neck. The embellishments were removed during the restoration process. The restored painting was unveiled in the Joslyn Art Museum's Hitchcock Foundation Gallery on May 5, 2014 and is part of the museum's permanent collection. In November 2016 the Joslyn Art Museum unveiled a newly commission frame for the painting. The painting was originally displayed in an ornate gilded Louis XIV frame, which framed the portrait when it was acquired by the museum in 1942. The new frame is less ornate. The frame, as described by the Joslyn's associate curator of European art, \\"It is a restrained style of framing that corresponds with the conservative Protestant sensibility of the age and to the strong mercantile culture of the Netherland, which profited from importing exotic woods through the Dutch East India Company.\\" The frame was paid for by the Joslyn Art Museum Association.

Location Chadoora is a big town, and under this tehsil, there are more than one hundred villages such as Zoohama, Ranger, Sursyar, Dadaompora, Hanjora, Sogam, Bogam, Gundi Maqsood, Batpora, Lolipora, Daulatpur, Dooniwari, Panzan, Porwar to name a few. The other nearest localities include Wathora, Bulbulpora, Hussipora, Gopalpora, Kralpora, Bagat Kanipora. The pincode is 191113. History Chadoora has a rich history. Famous Malik Hyder hailed from Chadoora. Malik was a very influential landlord and a close friend of Emperor Jahangir. The emperor reposed great trust in him. It is said that after the death of her first husband, Nur Jehan (Jahangir’s wife) was given in Malik’s custody by the emperor, before he finally married her and the woman became powerful enough to influence the decisions of the state. Malik Hyder also chronicled the history of Kashmir. He was honoured and rewarded by the Mughals for his talents. Jahangir has eloquently praised the beauty of Chadoora and mentioned in his 'Tuzk-e-Jahangiri', about a tree which would tremble all over, if only a branch of it was pulled. The tree, he says was known as Halthal. There is no such tree present in the area or anywhere else, but going by the description of the emperor, it seems that it must have been a delight for him to see the tree. At Chadoora, there lies a grave of Mir Shams-ud-Din Araqi, a Shiite scholar. Ali Dar, the counsellor of the last native ruler of Kashmir, Yusuf Shah Chak and his son, Yakub Chak’s tutor also belonged to Chadoora. The present Chadoora town was once a Karewa or Vudr (terraced or high end plateau). That is why almond orchards are found plentiful in Chadoora because they grow best in Karewas. Jahangir used to visit this place for hunting. He rechristened the place as Noorabad after his beloved wife, but the name was not popular, so the king had ordered reversion to its older name. Chadoora held a place of prominence during the Mughal period. The Mughals had constructed some buildings here, including a small palace and an ammunition depot.

In this context, \\"nature\\" means formal nature. Thus, \\"natural minimum\\" may be taken to mean \\"formal minimum\\": the minimum amount of matter necessary to instantiate a certain form. Speculation on minima naturalia in late Antiquity, in the Islamic world, and by Scholastic and Renaissance thinkers in Europe provided a conceptual bridge between the atomism of ancient Greece and the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers like Descartes, which in turn provided a background for the rigorously mathematical and experimental atomism of modern science. Aristotle's initial suggestion According to Aristotle, the Pre- Socratic Greek philosopher Anaxagoras had taught that every thing, and every portion of a thing, contains within itself an infinite number of like and unlike parts. For example, Anaxagoras maintained that there must be blackness as well as whiteness in snow; how, otherwise, could it be turned into dark water? Aristotle criticized Anaxagoras' theory on multiple grounds, among them the following:Aristotle, Physics 1.4, 187b14–21. *Animals and plants cannot be infinitely small according to Aristotle; thus the relatively homogeneous substances of which they are composed (e.g., bone and flesh in animals, or wood in plants) could not be infinitely small, either, but must have a smallest determinate size—i.e., a natural minimum. *On Anaxagoras' argument in which all things contain all others infinitely, water could be drawn from flesh, then flesh from that water, and water from that flesh, and so on. However, as above, because there is a smallest determinate size beyond which a further divided substance would no longer be flesh, any further cycle of such drawings out would be impossible. *Moreover, \\"[s]ince every body must diminish in size when something is taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively definite in respect both of greatness and smallness, it is clear that from the minimum quantity of flesh no body can be separated out; for the flesh left would be less than the minimum of flesh.\\" Unlike the atomism of Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, and also unlike the later atomic theory of John Dalton, the Aristotelian natural minimum was not conceptualized as physically indivisible--\\"atomic\\" in the contemporary sense. Instead, the concept was rooted in Aristotle's hylomorphic worldview, which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (Greek hyle) and a substantial form (Greek morphe) that imparts its essential nature and structure. For instance, a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like Aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form). Aristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh, or bone, or wood, or some other such organic substance that (for Aristotle, living before the microscope) could be considered homogeneous. For instance, if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum, what would remain might be some elemental water, and smaller amounts of the other elements (e.g., earth) with which water was thought to mix to form flesh. But whatever was left, the water (or earth, etc.), would no longer have the formal \\"nature\\" of flesh in particular – the remaining matter would have the form of water (or earth, etc.) rather than the substantial form of flesh. This is suggestive of modern chemistry, in which, e.g., a bar of gold can be continually divided until one has a single atom of gold, but further division of that atom of gold yields only subatomic particles (electrons, quarks, etc.) which are no longer the chemical element gold. Just as water alone is not flesh, electrons alone are not gold. Scholastic elaboration Aristotle's brief comments on minima naturalia in the Physics and Meteorology prompted further speculations by later philosophers. The idea was taken up by John Philoponus and Simplicius of Cilicia in late Antiquity and by the Islamic Aristotelian Averroes (Ibn Rushd). Minima naturalia were discussed by Scholastic and Renaissance thinkers including Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Siger of Brabant, Boethius of Dacia, Richard of Middleton, Duns Scotus, John of Jandun, William of Ockham, William Alnwick, Walter Bury, Adam de Wodeham, Jean Buridan, Gregory of Rimini, John Dumbleton, Nicole Oresme, John Marsilius Inguen, John Wycliffe, Albert of Saxony, Facinus de Ast, Peter Alboinis of Mantua, Paul of Venice, Gaetano of Thiene, Alessandro Achillini, Luis Coronel, Juan de Celaya, Domingo de Soto, Didacus de Astudillo, Ludovicus Buccaferrea, Francisco de Toledo, and Benedict Pereira. Of this list, the most influential Scholastic thinkers on minima naturalia were Duns Scotus and Gregory of Rimini. A chief theme in later commentary is reconciling minima naturalia with the general Aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility. Commentators like Philoponus and Aquinas reconciled these aspects of Aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and \\"natural\\" divisibility. For example, in his commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Aquinas writes of natural minima that, \\"although a body, considered mathematically, is divisible to infinity, the natural body is not divisible to infinity. For in a mathematical body nothing but quantity is considered. And in this there is nothing repugnant to division to infinity. But in a natural body the form also is considered, which form requires a determinate quantity and also other accidents. Whence it is not possible for quantity to be found in the species of flesh except as determined within some termini.\\" Influence on corpuscularianism In the early modern period, Aristotelian hylomorphism fell out of favor with the rise of the \\"mechanical philosophy\\" of thinkers like Descartes and John Locke, who were more sympathetic to the ancient Greek atomism of Democritus than to the natural minima of Aristotle. However, the concept of minima naturalia continued to shape philosophical thinking even among these mechanistic philosophers in the transitional centuries between the Aristotelianism of the medieval Scholastics and the worked-out atomic theory of modern scientists like Dalton. The mechanist Pierre Gassendi discussed minima naturalia in the course of expounding his opposition to Scholastic Aristotelianism, and his own attempted reconciliation between the atomism of Epicurus and the Catholic faith. Aristotle's mininima naturalia became \\"corpuscles\\" in the alchemical works of Geber and Daniel Sennert, who in turn influenced the corpuscularian alchemist Robert Boyle, one of the founders of modern chemistry. Boyle occasionally referred to his postulated corpuscles as minima naturalia.

Established in Turin in 1906 by the pioneering filmmaker Arturo Ambrosio, assisted by cinematographers Giovanni Vitrotti and Roberto Omegna, the company initially produced large numbers of documentary and fictional short films, but its output quickly grew more ambitious. In 1908 the company made The Last Days of Pompeii (directed by Ambrosio and Luigi Maggi). The film was a major success, further enhancing the company's status and creating a fashion for Italian historical epics which other studios copied. In the wake of this, Ambrosio oversaw the production of a series of literary adaptations.Moliterno p.7 The company built a large studio and picture house in Turin, and the city emerged as a major centre of the early Italian film industry. In February 1909 Ambrosio took part in the Paris Film Congress, an attempt by leading European producers to form a cartel similar to that operated by the MPPC in the United States. However this plan fell through when Pathe, then the largest film company in the world, withdrew from the group. The same year one of his employees Ernesto Maria Pasquali left to form his own Pasquali Film. The company enjoyed success exporting its films to lucrative foreign markets such as Britain and America (Ambrosio opened an affiliate in New York). Ambrosio struck co-production deals with Russian and Germany companies.Moliterno p.8 It remained a leading producer during the 1910s, but was hit by the slump that overcame the Italian film industry after the First World War.

Panish (born April 8, 1929) is an American physical chemist who, with Izuo Hayashi, developed a room-temperature continuous wave semiconductor laser in 1970. For this achievement he shared the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology in 2001. Early life Morton Panish was born in Brooklyn on April 8, 1929 to Isidore Panish and Fanny Panish (née Glasser) and grew up in Brooklyn. A brother, Paul, was born six years later. He went to Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1947. For two years he attended Brooklyn College, then transferred to the University of Denver \\"because of a desire to be on my own, to get away from the hay fever I suffered from in NY, and because Gary was there.\\" (Gary Baden was one of his best friends in high school.) Initially, Panish specialized in organic chemistry. He had been strongly influenced by a book he read at the age of 12, Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif, which left him with the impression that a scientific career is exciting; and in his final year of high school, he had a substitute teacher for chemistry who was a chemistry graduate student from Columbia University. Panish was fascinated by the teacher's description of his Ph.D. work, which involved synthesizing new organic compounds. He met his future wife, Evelyn Chaim, in an organic chemistry class at Denver University. However, he was attracted to the more mathematical discipline of physical chemistry, which he thought more challenging, and in the end this is what he specialized in. He graduated in 1950. Panish enrolled in graduate school at Michigan State University, majoring in physical chemistry and minoring in organic chemistry. His master's thesis involved a \\"series of measurements of the electric dipole behavior of some organic compounds,\\" and he did not consider it very challenging. His advisor was Max Rogers, a Canadian and former student of Linus Pauling, and Rogers supervised his Ph.D. work as well, which was on interhalogen compounds. Used to process reactor fuels, these compounds are highly reactive and dangerous, and after Panish had completed his experiments another student was badly injured in an explosion. Panish resolved to work with less dangerous materials in future. From 1954 to 1957 Panish worked for Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, studying the chemical thermodynamics of molten salts. Then he moved to Massachusetts and worked in the Research and Advanced Development Division of AVCO Corporation. The primary contract of this division, with the United States Air Force, was to develop vehicles for the reentry of thermonuclear weapons into the atmosphere. Panish was unwilling to do this work, but the government allotted 5% of the budget to basic research. From 1957 to 1964 he worked on the chemical thermodynamics of refractory compounds, but then decided to leave because the government terminated the funding for basic research. Bell Labs Before the Oak Ridge job, Panish had applied to Bell Labs and been rejected, but now they hired him. He started work in June 1964 in the Solid State Electronics Research Laboratory, a group headed by physicist John Galt. He was part of a department working on III-V semiconductors, compounds in which elements from group III and group V of the periodic table are combined, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs). He planned a series of experiments to look into controlling the impurity elements that determine the electrical properties of the semiconductors. In 1966, Galt asked Panish and Izuo Hayashi, a physicist from Japan, to investigate a problem involving laser diodes. The first such lasers, also known as injection lasers, were developed independently in 1962 by General Electric groups in Syracuse and Schenectady as well as the Thomas J. Watson Research Center of IBM and the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. These early lasers, mostly made out of a single chunk of GaAs, required high current densities to operate, so they could only run continuously at very low temperatures; at room temperature, they could only operate for a fraction of a second. For them to be used in a practical communications system, they would need to operate continuously at room temperature. A solution to the problem was proposed theoretically by Herbert Kroemer in 1963 - a double heterojunction laser but failed to suggest a suitable (lattice matched) combination semiconductors. The combination of such materials used for the first CW lasers was GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) and Aluminum Gallium Arsenide. The idea was to place a material like GaAs, with a smaller band gap, between two layers of a material such as aluminum gallium arsenide (a solid solution of AlAs and GaAs) that had a larger band gap; this confined the charge carriers and the optical field (the light) to this layer, reducing the current needed for lasing. Panish and Izuo Hayashi independently developed first the single heterostructure laser and then the double heterostructure laser. However, publication of the announcement of the first room temperature continuously operating double heterostructure laser was by Zhores Alferov in 1970 one month before Hayashi and Panish published similar results. Although there was some degree of contact between the group in Leningrad and the group in New Jersey including a visit by Alferov to the New Jersey lab, the two achievements were obtained independently. Panish experimented with making wafers using a new form of liquid-phase epitaxy while Hayashi tested the laser properties. Panish and Hayashi observed what they thought might be CW operation in several wafers in the weeks before their final demonstration. That had to await a laser that lived long enough for a complete plot of the lasing spectrum to be achieved. Over the Memorial Day weekend in 1970, while Panish was at home, Hayashi tried a diode and it emitted a continuous-wave beam at just over 24 degrees Celsius and he was able to plot the complete spectrum with the very slow equipment available at the time. He left a note on Panish's door: \\"C. W. definite!! at 24°C 10:30 A.M. June 1, 1970.\\" A top manager, in violation of lab rules, brought a couple of bottles of champagne to celebrate. Room-temperature lasers were soon duplicated at RCA Laboratories, Standard Telecommunication Laboratories and Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC). Over the next few years, the lasers became longer-lasting and more reliable. At Bell Labs, the job of creating a practical device was given to Barney DeLoach. But in January 1973, they told him to cease all work on the problem. As he recalled, their view was \\"We've already got air, we've already got copper. Who needs a new medium?\\" The continuous wave semiconductor laser led directly to the light sources in fiber-optic communication, laser printers, barcode readers and optical disc drives; but it was mostly Japanese entrepreneurs, not AT&T;, that ended up profiting from these technologies. After the work on double heterostructure lasers Panish continued to demonstrate variants of the laser structures with other collaborators in work done through the late 1970s, but the major thrust of his work for the rest of his career (until 1992) was to exploit the new opportunities presented by the use of lattice matched semiconductor heterostructures for other devices (detectors, transistors) and for the study of the physics of small layered structures.

Life  Born in Dresden, Götzloff was the youngest of three children born to Friedrich Adrian Götzloff, a town constable. From 1814 to 1821, he attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Caspar David Friedrich and Johan Christian Dahl, among others. As early as 1820, he was awarded a prize for his landscape paintings at an Academy exhibition. A scholarship enabled him to undertake a study trip throughout Germany and Switzerland, eventually travelling to Rome with fellow-student Anton Josef Dräger. From 1822 to 1824, several more trips to Italy and the surrounding regions followed. Towards the end of that year, he accompanied Baron Karl Friedrich Emich von Üxküll-Gyllenband (1755–1832), an art collector, on a trip to Sicily and Malta. = Moving to Naples = View of Naples (1837) As it turned out, the Baron and his family became Götzloff's employers and he relocated permanently to Naples in 1825, where he shared an apartment with Antonie Sminck Pitloo, Giacinto Gigante and Teodoro Duclère. That same year, he was named an honorary member of the Dresden Academy. In 1827, he served as art teacher to Prince Leopold I. In 1835 he was appointed Court Painter to Ferdinand II, King of the Two Sicilies. Before taking up that position, he briefly returned to Dresden where he became a full member of the Academy and married Louisa Chentrens. In 1846, Friedrich Wilhelm IV appointed him the \\"Agent for Antiquities\\" for the museums of Berlin. His reputation had spread so far at this point that he began to receive commissions from the Royal Family in Russia. = Financial difficulties = In 1848, he and his family moved to Sorrento to escape the political unrest, which also forced him to seek employment in Berlin with help from his friend August Kestner. He accompanied the 4th Bernese regiment during its conquest of Catania in April, 1849. The next year, he returned to Naples and, in 1852, became a Knight in the Order of Leopold. His wife died in 1855, and he made more desperate efforts to secure employment back home. His hopes of returning to Germany were dashed in 1861, when several paintings he sent to an art exhibition in Dresden failed to be sold. His finances were strained to the breaking point in 1864 when he had to pay a ransom to bandits for the release of his son Guido. He died poor in 1866 in Naples.

Award of the medal was discontinued when it was superseded by the Territorial Force Efficiency Medal in 1908. The grant of the medal was extended in 1896 by the institution of a separate new medal, the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies, that could be awarded to other ranks of all Volunteer Forces throughout the British Empire and India. Institution More than sixty years after a medal for long service was introduced for the Regular Army upon the institution of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in 1830, the first such awards were instituted for the part-time Volunteer Force. The Volunteer Long Service Medal was established by Queen Victoria in 1894 and its regulations were published in Special Army Order no. 85 of June 1894, as amended. The medal could be awarded to other ranks in the part-time Volunteer Force of the United Kingdom, as well as to officers who had served in the ranks but who had not qualified for the award of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. Award criteria The qualifying period of service was twenty years and the medal could be awarded upon the recommendation by an individual's present or, if retired, former commanding officer. Service had to have been consecutive, with allowance being made for special circumstances. Officer recipients who were subsequently awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration would have to surrender the medal. Colonial version On 13 June 1896 the grant of the Volunteer Long Service Medal was extended by Queen Victoria to members of Volunteer Forces throughout the British Empire, defined as being India, the Dominion of Canada, the Crown Colonies and the British Protectorates. A separate new medal was instituted, the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies. Institution of this medal was not, as usual, by Royal Warrant but in terms of a special Army Order. This medal was similar in design to the Volunteer Long Service Medal, but bore different inscriptions on the obverse of each monarch's version to include India, the Dominion, the Colonies and the Protectorates as subjects of the reigning monarch. Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Volunteer Long Service Medal takes precedence after the Volunteer Officers' Decoration and before the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies. Description The Volunteer Long Service Medal was struck in silver and is a disc, in diameter, with a raised rim on each side. It is suspended from a straight swivelling silver bar, affixed to the medal by means of a claw and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. ;Obverse The obverse of the medal depicts the reigning monarch. Two versions of the Volunteer Long Service Medal were struck. King Edward VII version * The original version of 1894, created by George William de Saulles, shows the effigy of Queen Victoria wearing the Crown, a veil and the Star of the Order of the Garter. The effigy is circumscribed \\"VICTORIA REGINA\\". This version's suspender is affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw. Some Queen Victoria versions of the medal were awarded up to the Army Order of July 1902, post-dating her death.The Military Archive - Volunteer Long Service Medal (Accessed 30 June 2015) * The King Edward VII version, introduced after his succession to the throne in 1901, displays his effigy in Field Marshal's uniform and is circumscribed \\"EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR\\". This version's suspender is affixed to the medal by means of a single-toe claw. ;Reverse The reverse shows a palm and laurel wreath that supports a scrolled banner bearing the inscription \\"FOR LONG SERVICE IN THE VOLUNTEER FORCE\\" in four lines. ;Ribbons The medal's regular ribbon is plain dark green and wide. An administrative oversight resulted in members of the Honourable Artillery Company, reckoned as the oldest regiment of the Royal Army, not being made eligible for the Volunteer Long Service Medal until 1906. To compensate the venerable regiment for this omission, the medal was awarded to its members with a special ribbon to distinguish it from regular awards. This ribbon is dark blue and red, wide and edged with 2½ millimetres wide yellow bands, the household colours of King Edward VII. This special honour was extended in respect of the medal's successors and subsequent incarnations to the present day. Recipients More than 45,000 Volunteer Long Service Medals were awarded in the United Kingdom. Discontinuation The Volunteer Force was the precursor of the Territorial Force, which was established in the United Kingdom in 1908. At the same time, the award of the Volunteer Long Service Medal was discontinued and superseded by the new Territorial Force Efficiency Medal.

The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders. The exemption would allow water transfers to go ahead and happen. The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Lacey Act of 1900, or simply the Lacey Act () is a conservation law in the United States. Introduced into Congress by Rep. John F. Lacey, an Iowa Republican, the act was signed into law by President William McKinley on May 25, 1900. The Lacey Act protects both plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for a wide array of violations. It prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken, transported or sold. The law is still in effect, although it has been amended several times.\\"Nation marks Lacey Act centennial, 100 years of federal wildlife law enforcement. US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Invasive species, also called invasive exotics or simply exotics, is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native habitats, with several definitions. The first definition, the most used, applies to introduced species (also called \\"non-indigenous\\" or \\"non-native\\") that adversely affect the habitats and bioregions they invade economically, environmentally, and/or ecologically. Such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region, wilderness areas, particular habitats, or wildland-urban interface land from loss of natural controls (such as predators or herbivores). This includes non-native invasive plant species labeled as exotic pest plants and invasive exotics growing in native plant communities.Exotic Pest Plant Council.

Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014 would make the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 and provisions of the federal criminal code prohibiting importation of injurious animals inapplicable to any water transfer by the North Texas Municipal Water District and the Greater Texoma Utility Authority using only closed conveyance systems from the Lake Texoma raw water intake structure to treatment facilities at which all genera and species prohibited in accordance with such Act and the criminal code provision are extirpated and removed from the transferred water. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on March 18, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4032 would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) from prosecution under the Lacey Act for transferring water containing invasive species from Oklahoma to Texas. The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders. Based on information provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Under current law, federal agencies, including the USFWS and the Department of Justice, have the authority to negotiate agreements that would allow the NTMWD to make these transfers without being prosecuted. Enacting H.R. 4032 could reduce revenues from penalties under the Lacey Act; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any such reductions would be negligible. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending. H.R. 4032 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 11, 2014 by Rep. Ralph M. Hall (R, TX-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. It was reported by the committee alongside House Report 113-413 part 1. On April 28, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. On May 22, 2014, the United States Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, making it . Debate and discussion Rep. Pete Sessions supported the bill, arguing that it was necessary to prevent \\"more than 1.5 million customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District\\" from facing \\"restricted access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in Lake Texoma.\\" According to Sessions, there are existing precautions to remove and extirpate invasive species.

In practice however, Chinese citizens participate in state-run lotteries, regularly travel to legal gambling centers overseas or in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and access gaming through offshore based proxy betting and online gambling companies. Mainland China The Chinese government operates two lotteries: the Welfare Lottery and the Sports Lottery set up in 1987 and 1994 respectively. The Chinese government does not legally consider the lotteries a form of gambling. Illegal gambling in China remains common, including unofficial lotteries, clandestine casinos, and betting in games such as mahjong and various card games. In 2010, The Daily Telegraph (UK) reported that an estimated one trillion yuan are wagered in illegal gambling every year in China. Problem gambling exists in the country, and may be more prevalent than in countries with legalized gambling. Online gambling is another outlet for illegal gambling in the country. Various attempts have been made to establish legal casinos in mainland China, although these have been unsuccessful. In June 2018, the Chinese Government banned all online poker applications. App stores had to remove all poker related applications, and the promotion of poker in general via all social media channels in China (Wechat, Weibo) became forbidden. Hong Kong While some aspects of mainland Chinese law apply in Hong Kong, certain forms of gambling are legal and regulated in Hong Kong. The Law of Hong Kong is based on English common law, having been a British territory until 1997. Gambling in Hong Kong has been regulated since 1977. The Hong Kong Jockey Club organizes much of the legal betting in the region. Macau Gambling in Macau has been legal since the 1850s, when it was a Portuguese colony. The region has a history of gambling on traditional Chinese games. Gambling in Macau now primarily takes place in Western-style casinos; in 2007, Macau overtook the Las Vegas Strip in gaming revenues. ,2016 Wynn 10-K 38 casinos operate in Macau, and the region's annual gambling revenues exceed US$27.9 billion. Offshore gambling Legal restrictions on onshore gambling in Mainland China have contributed to the growth of overseas and online gambling sites that cater to Chinese nationals. Integrated gaming resorts in Singapore, Australia, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines welcome growing numbers of Chinese tourists. =Proxy betting= As in person visits to offshore gambling venues can be both time consuming and attract the attention of law enforcement, proxy betting has grown in popularity, especially for VIP clients wishing to discretely place high stakes bets. In proxy betting, clients communicate with staffers wearing headsets at baccarat tables in offshore casinos. Proxy betting was outlawed in Macau in 2016 and has never been permitted in Australia or Singapore casinos, but now accounts for 40 percent of the $1 billion VIP gaming market in the Philippines, according to brokerage CICC. =Online gambling= Online gambling in Mainland China remains illegal, however internet traffic routed via VPNs, underground banking networks and payment platforms enable Mainland Chinese customers to access and remit funds to online gaming sites. According to 2019 estimates published in Economic Information Daily, an affiliate of state-owned news agency Xinhua, the annual amount bet through online gambling in the Mainland is more than one trillion yuan (US$145 billion), equivalent to nearly twice the annual income of China’s officially sanctioned lotteries. In the Philippines alone, where Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) can register and legally operate, over a three year period from 2016 at least 100,000 Chinese nationals were estimated to have moved to Manila to work for online gambling operators as marketing agents, tech support specialists and IT engineers to serve Mandarin- speaking clientele. To side step restrictions on direct marketing of online gambling in Mainland Chinese print or social media, many online gaming sites seeking to attract Chinese customers have become shirt sponsors for English Premier League football teams. Dafabet’s sponsorship of Fulham FC and W88’s sponsorship of Wolverhampton Wanderers are just two examples of this trend.

The game was developed and published by South Africa-based indie developer studio RuneStorm and was released on 4 April 2014 through Steam Early Access. The full release became available on 23 October 2015.  Gameplay  In Viscera Cleanup Detail, players are given the role of \\"Space- Station Janitors\\", tasked with cleaning and repairing facilities that have been the scene of bloody battles during an alien invasion or other form of disaster. Tasks include gathering and disposing of debris, including, dismembered bodies of aliens and humans, spent shell casings and broken glass, restocking of wall-mounted first aid kits, repairing bullet holes in walls, and cleaning of blood splatter and soot marks from floors, walls and ceilings, as well as secondary bonus tasks. These include stacking items like crates and barrels in a designated stacking area, and filing disaster reports on the events and deaths that took place in a corresponding level. To accomplish these tasks, players carry with them a mop, to help clean up any blood pools or soot found around the station, a sensor device, to detect traces of biological or non-biological messes, and a small PDA to take notes on the level. Players may also interact with debris and other items with their empty hands. Another addition in a recent patch added to the game is a broom, which players could find lying around every map of the game to help sweep up bullet casings or other trash deemed worthy of sweeping. Deployed throughout each level are janitorial machines in which the player must make use of to complete the cleaning operation: An incinerator for disposal of debris, a bucket dispenser which is the only source of clean water, a dispenser for bins that can be used to carry multiple smaller items such as cans, casings and even body parts, a welding device for repairing bullet holes in the walls, and an item vending machine where the player can get additional items such as lanterns, first aid kit restocking supplies, \\"wet floor\\" signs and flares. Occasionally, bucket and bin dispensers may malfunction and instead dispense one or more pieces of bloody debris, resulting in additional debris and blood stains to be cleaned up. It is also possible to spread blood by dropping debris, spilling used buckets, or by the player tracking blood on the bottom of their boots, so some amount of care and planning is necessary to avoid re- cleaning the same area multiple times. After punching out of a level, players are taken to a small collection of rooms known as \\"The Office\\". The Office acts as an interactive way for players to see how well they may have performed on the previously completed level. As well as a large report screen displaying the player's score in the form of a percentile, several news articles can also be found scattered around The Office's main room. These detail events caused by the player's oversights, such as employees consuming viscera, tripping over buckets, or choking on discarded bullet shells, and show the player what they may have missed upon completing a level. The Office also serves as a place to collect items, which can be brought from successfully completed levels via the \\"Janitor's Trunk\\". Players may \\"punch out\\" at any time to end the level. There is no set time limit, but there are penalties for not fully completing the level. If the player has not sufficiently cleaned a level and scored less than 75%, they will be \\"fired\\", causing The Office to reset and any items or changes made within will be lost.  Stand-alone expansions  During the development of Viscera Cleanup Detail, RuneStorm created two stand-alone expansions of their own game, which featured the same mechanics but different settings. * Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is set in the first chapter of Flying Wild Hog's Shadow Warrior, cleaning up the mess Lo Wang left in the original game. It was released on 11 October 2013 and published by Devolver Digital. * Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage takes place on the North Pole, inside Santa's workshop. The players find themselves in the aftermath of Santa gone crazy, murdering his elves and reindeer. It was released on 13 December 2013.  Downloadable content  On 17 July 2015, during the game's Early Access phase, RuneStorm released a DLC for Viscera Cleanup Detail, which includes the complete soundtrack that is played by the in-game radio in the main game and both stand-alone expansions. On 29 October 2015—just six days after the game's full release—a Halloween DLC pack entitled Viscera Cleanup Detail: House of Horror was put up on Steam, featuring a crime scene of a house, where an unsolved mass murder has happened, while the player gets to uncover it during the gameplay. On 10 December 2018, a new DLC entitled Viscera Cleanup Detail: The Vulcan Affair was released, where players must clean up the secret island lair of a supervillain whose plans for world domination had just been foiled.  Reception  The early access version of the game received several previews. At Eurogamer, Dan Whitehead wrote that while many video games revolve around the concept of clearing a screen, such as killing all the enemies or collecting all the tokens, Viscera Cleanup Detail literalises the metaphor. Writing for The A.V. Club, Chaz Evans called it a commentary on first-person shooters that focuses on the consequences of violence. After the game's commercial release, Philippa Warr of Rock, Paper, Shotgun included it on her list of the top games of 2015 and later described the game's multiplayer as not only a way to keep in touch with people but also to learn about them through how they approach the game's seemingly mundane tasks.

The population was 605 at the 2010 census. Geography Enterprise is located in the western part of Morgan Valley, along Interstate 84. Peterson is just to the west, across I-84 and the Weber River. Mountain Green is about to the northwest, and Morgan, the county seat, is some southeast. Most of the homes in Enterprise are clustered along the main street, Old Highway Road (part of the former Highway 30), which roughly parallels I-84 to the north on the benchland between Morgan and Mountain Green. The community's northern boundary is the crescent of foothills from Dry Hollow on the north to Roswell Canyon on the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. History The first settlers in Enterprise were Henry and Stephen Hales, who arrived in 1861. They found fertile land on the bench, but little water for irrigation. They dug a ditch from the Weber River to water their farmland. A canal company was organized in 1863 to irrigate the whole area, but Enterprise was short on water for many years as thieves diverted water upstream. The first schoolhouse was built in 1863. A townsite with official blocks was surveyed and laid out in 1865. A sawmill operated in Roswell Canyon in the 1870s. Although it was not an official census precinct, the 1880 census enumerated 81 residents in Enterprise. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 605 people, 147 households, and 133 families residing in the CDP. There were 155 housing units, of which 147 were occupied. The racial makeup of the population was 96.2% White, 0.5% Black or African American, 1.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.3% Asian, 0.2% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 0.2% from some other race, and 1.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.0% of the population. There were 147 households, out of which 62.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them. 84.4% had married couples living together. 8.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.12, and the average family size was 4.38. The population was 50.6% female, and the median age was 22.9 years.

The table stone is almost in dimensions, supported by upright flagstones and rising about above the ground. \\"Market cross\\" A stone pillar near the church is said to be a market cross, and some lines drawn on were used as measures of length. The shaft is octagonal and stands on a stepped dais. There are three ringforts in the parish, which in the 19th century were held to have been built by \\"the Danes\\". The ruins of the old church stand on the glebe in Noughaval. There are ruined castles at Banroe, Ballymurphy and Ballyganner. These were the property of the O’Loghlen family in 1580. O'Davoran chapel The medieval church was built and rebuilt from the 12th to the 14th centuries. A later memorial chapel of the O'Davoran family nearby was built (or, according to Thomas Johnson Westropp, repaired) in 1725 by James Davoren. History In 1841, the population was 450 in 65 houses. The hamlet of Noughaval had 64 people in 10 houses. In 1845, the Noughaval and Carran chapels were united. St. Mochua, new RC church In 1941, the former Church of Ireland church in Ballyvaughan was sold for £25, dismantled and moved here. In 1943, it was reconsecrated as a Roman Catholic church, St. Mochua's Church. Townlands Townlands are Ballyganner North, Ballyganner South, Ballymahony, Ballymurphy, Cragnarooan, Deerpark, Kiltaan, Kiltennan North, Kiltennan South, Knockavoarheen, Lismoher, Noughaval, Rusheen and Sheshymore.

Several findings from Cordon-Cardo's research at Sloan Kettering have had specific implications for the treatment of cancer and experimental cancer treatment and have led to more personalized therapies, particularly for cancers of the genitourinary system. While it had been previously thought that P-glycoprotein was unique to cancer cells, Cordon-Cardo showed in 1989 that it is also present in normal cells and is exploited by cancer cells to survive chemotherapy. In 1990, he was among the first to show that the mutated gene (RB) which causes the childhood cancer retinoblastoma is also present in some adults with sarcomas but no history of retinoblastoma. He also found that the presence of the mutated gene in adult cancers was associated with a poor clinical outcome. His 1994 research in collaboration with Arnold J. Levine was one of the first examples of how mutations in the gene which regulates the tumor suppressor p53 can lead to cancer by inactivating all the normal p53, thus allowing cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. A later study by Cordon- Cardo in 1997 found that when mutated p53 and RB are both present in a tumor, it becomes very aggressive and resistant to most treatments.

In contrast to normal polynomials, multiplication of these polynomials is not commutative, but satisfies the commutation rule : \\\\tau x=x^p \\\\tau for all x in the base field. Over an infinite field, the twisted polynomial ring is isomorphic to the ring of additive polynomials, but where multiplication on the latter is given by composition rather than usual multiplication. However, it is often easier to compute in the twisted polynomial ring — this can be applied especially in the theory of Drinfeld modules. Definition Let k be a field of characteristic p. The twisted polynomial ring k\\\\\\\\{\\\\tau\\\\\\\\} is defined as the set of polynomials in the variable \\\\tau and coefficients in k. It is endowed with a ring structure with the usual addition, but with a non- commutative multiplication that can be summarized with the relation \\\\tau x=x^p\\\\tau for x\\\\in k. Repeated application of this relation yields a formula for the multiplication of any two twisted polynomials. As an example we perform such a multiplication : (a+b\\\\tau)(c+d\\\\tau)=a(c+d\\\\tau)+b\\\\tau(c+d\\\\tau)=ac+ad\\\\tau+bc^p\\\\tau+bd^p\\\\tau^2 Properties The morphism : k\\\\\\\\{\\\\tau\\\\\\\\}\\\\to k[x],\\\\quad a_0+a_1\\\\tau+\\\\cdots+a_n\\\\tau^n\\\\mapsto a_0x+a_1x^p+\\\\cdots+a_nx^{p^n} defines a ring homomorphism sending a twisted polynomial to an additive polynomial. Here, multiplication on the right hand side is given by composition of polynomials. For example :(ax+bx^p)\\\\circ (cx+dx^p)=a(cx+dx^p)+b(cx+dx^p)^p=acx+adx^p+bc^px^p+bd^px^{p^2}, using the fact that in characteristic p we have the Freshman's dream (x+y)^p=x^p+y^p. The homomorphism is clearly injective, but is surjective if and only if k is infinite. The failure of surjectivity when k is finite is due to the existence of non-zero polynomials which induce the zero function on k (e.g. x^q-x over the finite field with q elements). Even though this ring is not commutative, it still possesses (left and right) division algorithms.

She trained with Xavier Miserachs i Ribalta and Oriol Maspons i Casades, and began her professional career in 1961 as a lab technician and stylist for Miserachs. Initially, she demonstrated great interest in dance photography—almost always flamenco music—and later she also specialized in portraits and journalistic photography. She has had numerous exhibitions with photographs of Catalan artists and singers from the Nova Cançó era to the present Joan Manuel Serrat, Guillermina Motta or Núria Feliu. She is considered one of the top portrait artists in this genre. She has published many books.  Biography  Colita is one of the most important Catalan and Spanish photographers of the last quarter of the twentieth century. She began in the world of photography with Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, for whom she worked as an assistant; in these early years, she was a follower and disciple of Francesc Català Roca and Julio Ubiña. From 1963 to 1975 she focused on creating a series of portraits of Flamenco dancers and singers. Since she is linked with the Catalan cultural movements of the era, she is considered the official photographer of Barcelona's Gauche Divine, a movement of writers, photographers, models, architects, film directors, and many other professionals who began to stand out in that area in their respective fields. She created a series of projects between 1967 and 1979, at the Escola de Cine [Film School] of Barcelona, with directors such as Cinto Esteva, Vicente Aranda or Jaime Camino, who belonged to a film movement that was born with the idea of creating European, progressive movies in contrast with the official cinematography of the francoist regime. She collaborated in the promotion of the Nova Cançó, making portraits of the singers in the movement, including Joan Manuel Serrat. Colita's work in the press has been published in magazines such as Siglo XX, Destino, Fotogramas, Interviú, Boccaccio, Primera Plana and Mundo Diario. Throughout her career, Colita has put on more than forty exhibitions and has published some fifty books of photographs. Stylistically, she is closer to the ideas of the Barcelona School, although she is considered an all-purpose photographer. Her work is part of the collections of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

Colita Collection  Her work from 1962 to 2002 is conserved at the Museu de les Arts Escèniques (Museum of Performing Arts) of Barcelona. It contains 900 negatives and contact sheets, approximately 32,000 photographs of shows, portraits of artists and celebrities related to the performing arts, and related events. Her collection is registered and catalogued in an internal data base and is not accessible via the internet.Inventari del Fons A part of her collection is also conserved in the National Archive of Catalonia. The collection comprises the portraits that Colita has made throughout her career as a professional photographer. It is the result of her collaboration with various magazines, of assignments made by the subjects themselves, or simply, for the friendship she shared with them. Among the great collection of personalities portrayed, we can highlight, among others, those dedicated to musicians and singers. Some of these portraits came out of special assignments. It's also important to point out the photographs taken, mostly in the seventies, of the members of the Barcelona \\"Gauche Divine\\" movement. In addition to the portraits, Colita's collection also contains a series of journalistic photographs covering the social movements of the time. For example, the sit-in at Montserrat, the attack against the Enlace bookstore, the self-mutilations of the COPEL (Spanish inmates group), Catalonia's National Day of September 11, 1978, the ceremony and acts arounds Franco's death in Madrid, the burial of the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Josep Tarrardellas, and various events of the Socialist Party of Catalonia that took place during the eighties. Another part of her personal collection is conserved in the Arxiu Fotogràfic de Barcelona (Barcelona Photography Archive). This part of her collection includes Colita's photography from the sixties to the nineties. It contains black and white negatives that represent the Nova Cançó musical movement, color photographs that portray community festivals throughout Catalonia, cultural personalities and celebrities and the evolution of architecture in the city of Barcelona.

It is native to most of Europe from Spain and Ireland to Ukraine, with the exception of Scandinavia, Russia, Belarus and the Baltic Republics. It is also considered native to Turkey, Iran and the Caucasus. It is naturalized in Denmark, South Australia, New South Wales, Nova Scotia and much of the eastern United States. Description Leucojum aestivum is a perennial bulbous plant, generally 35–60 cm tall, but some forms reach 90 cm. Its leaves, which are well developed at the time of flowering, are strap-shaped, 5–20 mm wide, reaching to about the same height as the flowers. The flowering stem (scape) is hollow and has wings with translucent margins. The pendant flowers appear in late spring and are borne in umbels of usually three to five, sometimes as many as seven. The flower stalks (pedicels are of different lengths, 25–70 mm long. The flowers are about 3–4 cm in diameter and have six white tepals, each with a greenish mark just below the tip. The black seeds are 5–7 mm long. After flowering, the fruits develop flotation chambers but remain attached to the stem. In England, it has been recorded that flooding causes the stems to break and the fruits to be carried downstream and stranded in river debris or on flood-plains. The bulbs can also be transported during heavy floods and deposited on river banks.

The epithet aestivum means \\"of the summer\\". Two subspecies have been recognized (sometimes as varieties rather than subspecies): the nominate L. aestivum subsp. aestivum and L. aestivum subsp. pulchellum. The latter has also been treated as a separate species, L. pulchellum. L. aestivum subsp. pulchellum is differentiated by its generally smaller dimensions. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families does not recognize any infraspecific taxa. Distribution and habitat Leucojum aestivum is native to most of Europe, with the exception of Scandinavia, Russia, Belarus and the Baltic Republics, and is also native to Turkey, the Caucasus and Iran. It is naturalized in other parts of Europe, including Denmark, in South Australia, New South Wales, Nova Scotia and much of the eastern United States. L. aestivum is found in damp places, such as wet meadows, swamps, and ditches. Cultivation Leucojum aestivum is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its flowers. It requires a damp position, growing well on clay soils, where it increases rapidly. The cultivar 'Gravetye Giant' is robust, growing to with up to eight flowers on each scape. It is named after Gravetye Manor, an Elizabethan manor house in West Sussex, England, the former home of the gardener William Robinson. 'Gravetye Giant' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Toxicity All species of Leucojum are poisonous, as the leaves and bulbs contain the toxic alkaloids lycorine and galantamine. Galantamine is used for the treatment of cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various other memory impairments.

He has been called the \\"Jeff Bezos of China\\" and his company JD.com has been compared to Amazon due to its business model. Liu founded Jingdong as a business-to-consumer single retail store for magneto- optical products in June 1998 and later moved the company into an e-commerce website known as JD.com in 2004. Liu is the company's chief executive officer and expanded its e-commerce products from selling consumer electronics to less specialized items, which grew JD.com into one of the largest retailers in China. According to Forbes, Liu's net worth is US$9 billion as of May 2020 with a 15.8% stake in JD.com. He was included on the \\"China Rich List\\" for 2019. In April 2020, Liu was in talks with the government of China regarding shipment of 5 million masks and 600,000 pairs of gloves for the Covid 19 relief efforts.  Early life and biography  Liu Qiangdong was born on 10 March 1973 or 14 February 1974 in Suqian, Jiangsu province. His parents are in the business of shipping coal from north China to the south. As a young man, Liu Qiangdong had an interest in politics. He graduated from primary school in the Jiangsu province and enrolled in the department of sociology in Renmin University of China, known for its connection to China's political elites, in 1992. However, finding the degree would not guarantee good job opportunities, Liu spent all his spare time learning computer programming. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1996, and later earned an EMBA from the China Europe International Business School. As a college student, Liu invested his income earned from programming work and family loans into a restaurant venture. The business failed in a few months, losing more than US$200,000, which left Liu in debt.Lessons from an Early Failure (Archived Article on FT.com) After graduation, Liu was employed by Japan Life, a Japanese health product enterprise, and successively served as the director for computers, the director for business, and the logistics supervisor.  Personal life  Liu Qiangdong has a son who was born in 2006. The name of the child's mother is not publicly known, Liu Qiangdong may have had a marriage with her. In 2008, Liu volunteered as part of Red Cross efforts and drove to Pingwu County to help the victims of the Sichuan earthquake. In August 2015, Liu married Zhang Zetian, an internet celebrity better known as \\"Sister Milk Tea\\". Their relationship started in early 2014 when Liu studied at Columbia University and Zhang was an exchange student at Barnard College, affiliated with Columbia University. Their early romance was spotted in New York City and when pictures were posted online. On April 10, 2014, Liu confirmed this relationship to the public through his Weibo account. On August 8, 2015, Liu Qiangdong and Zhang Zetian registered for marriage in Beijing. They held their wedding ceremony on October 1, 2015 in Sydney, Australia. Their daughter was born in March 2016. Controversies On 23 July 2018, Liu Qiangdong was named as the billionaire host of a private dinner party in Sydney that was the focus of a rape trial. Party guest Xu Longwei was found guilty of seven charges, including having non-consensual sex with a woman he met at Liu's apartment on 26 December 2015. Liu was not charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing in that case. As a result, he asked for a suppression order from the Australian court to prevent the release of his name in connection with the case, a request which was rejected. On August 31, 2018, Liu was arrested in Minneapolis, Minnesota with the charge of \\"rape\\". The complainant is a 21-year-old Chinese student who attended a dinner party with Liu on the night of August 30. After the party ended at 9:30 PM, the complainant and Liu returned to her apartment, where she alleges the rape occurred at 1:00 AM. Liu was released pending further investigation and returned to Beijing. On September 2, 2018, JD.com issued a statement that the company would take legal action against \\"false reporting or rumors\\" after the local police found \\"no substance to the claim against Mr. Liu\\". Three American law firms have alleged that this statement was misleading and announced a class-action lawsuits in response. Liu's attorneys denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the charges are not supported by evidence. On December 21, 2018, The office of the Hennepin County Attorney said they had not found enough evidence to charge Liu. On April 16, 2019, Liu Jingyao, a student at the University of Minnesota, formally filed a civil lawsuit against Liu Qiangdong, claiming Liu forced himself upon her in his vehicle after the dinner and later raped her at her apartment. The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $50,000.. In April 2020, the judge overseeing the case declined the motion to dismiss JD.com from the litigation; both the company and Liu are named defendants.  Career  In June 1998, he started his own business Jingdong in Zhongguancun High-tech Industrial Park in Beijing as a distributor of magneto-optical products, focusing on selling authorized products when counterfeit products were widely sold. Upon foundation, Jingdong () company was named after Liu Qiangdong himself and Gong Xiaojing (), his then-girlfriend who also graduated from Renmin University of China. They broke up in 2003. Liu had opened 12 brick-and-mortar stores under the Jingdong brand by 2003. The SARS outbreak in 2003 kept staff and clients of Jingdong at home and forced Liu to rethink the business model and divert to online business. Due to the outbreak, Liu's business lost over 8 million yuan. Liu launched his first online retail website in 2004, and founded JD.com (short form for Jingdong) later that year. In 2005, Liu closed off all brick-and-mortar stores and became an e-commerce business. In 2005, Liu received an offer to sell JD.com for 18 million yuan, which he rejected. In 2007, Liu employed a full- category strategy for JD.com, changing the company's business model from selling consumer electronics to large variety of goods. The company has become one of the leading e-commerce businesses in China. JD.com has been compared to Amazon because of similar business models, and Liu has been compared to Jeff Bezos as a self-made individual. JD.com applied to go public in the US in January 2014. On 22 May 2014, the date of JD.com's IPO, the stock price rose about 15% JD.com is the second largest internet-company in the world (by revenue) and is the largest e-commerce company in China.

The flowering stem (scape) has a small central cavity and two narrow wings. The pendant flowers appear in spring and are usually solitary, rarely in an umbel of two. The flowers have six white tepals, each with a greenish or yellowish mark just below the tip. Each tepal is 15–25 mm long. The whitish seeds are about 7 mm long.

The epithet vernum means \\"of the spring\\". =Varieties= Two varieties are accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: *Leucojum vernum var. carpathicum Sweet – Carpathian Mountains (Czech Republic, Romania, Ukraine) *Leucojum vernum var. vernum L. vernum var. carpathicum is distinguished by presence of yellow rather than greenish markings at the tip of each tepal. Some botanists also recognize var. vagneri, with two flowers per scape. Distribution and habitat Leucojum vernum is native to central Europe and parts of southern and western Europe, including Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, France, Italy, Romania, former Yugoslavia and the Ukraine. It has become naturalized in other parts of Europe, including Great Britain, the Netherlands and parts of Scandinavia, and in Georgia and Florida in the United States. It is found in damp and shady habitats, including woods, up to elevations of 1600 m. Cultivation Leucojum vernum is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its white flowers in spring. It is described as \\"easy to grow\\", either in sun or partial shade, particularly in moist soil and in grass. The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Toxicity All species of Leucojum are poisonous, as the leaves and bulbs contain the toxic alkaloids lycorine and galantamine. Galantamine is used for the treatment of cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various other memory impairments.

It was written by Ray Davies. Background \\"A Gallon of Gas\\", like many songs by The Kinks from this period, tells of economic problems of the time, in this case the gas shortage. The singer laments about how he \\"can't buy a gallon of gas\\", even \\"for any amount of cash\\". Author Nick Hasted describes it as \\"a heavy electric blues.\\" The song was the second single released from \\"Low Budget\\", and is one of two singles from the album to be released in America but not in Britain (the other being \\"Catch Me Now I'm Falling\\"). The single version was longer than the album version. It was backed with \\"Low Budget\\". In addition to its release as a single in America, the single was also released in Japan that same year. \\"A Gallon of Gas\\" also appears on the greatest hits albums Come Dancing with The Kinks and the live album To the Bone. An alternate edition of the song appears on Picture Book. Reception The track was praised by AllMusic as well as Rolling Stone, who said that \\"A Gallon of Gas\\" is \\"no great poetic achievement, but its slow, bluesy arrangement—meant, no doubt, to re-create the effect of a snail's pace gas line — heightens the good-natured irony of a situation in which drugs are easier to come by than gasoline.\\" Hasted also refers to the song's humor in that it is easier to buy drugs than gas. Hasted further notes that Davies, who years earlier wrote \\"Apeman,\\" a song about abandoning the city to live in the jungle, \\"can't disguise his pleasure\\" in the fact that without gas there are no planes in the sky or cars on the road so that \\"the air smells unnaturally clean.\\" Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Rob Sheffield calls it an \\"embarrassing novelty.\\" Critic Johnny Rogan commented on the song's comedy and wryness.

Like many other local governors, he also was a priest of the native deity Wepwawet. It is generally assumed that Khety I was the earliest of a trio of related nomarchs datable to the Herakleopolite period; he was likely followed by his son Tefibi and then by his grandson Khety II.Donald B. Spanel, in Donald B. Redford (ed), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 154-6. Biography He was member of a long line of nomarchs in Asyut with strong bonds of loyalty and friendship towards the Herakleopolite dynasty: as a child he was raised along with the herakleopolite royal princes and their father – the pharaoh – appointed Khety as nomarch and also joined the mourning for the death of Khety's grandfather.William C. Hayes, in The Cambridge Ancient History, vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, , p. 469. Khety ruled his nomos during a peaceful period, and is known that he ordered the realization of many new irrigation canals and imposed the maintenance of the existing ones, thus expanding the cultivable land. During a period of famine caused by a particularly small Nile flood, he bestowed grain to the people of his district, although he denied the grain to the inhabitants of the neighboring nomoi, also affected by famine, by closing the borders of his district. Although he ruled during peaceful times, Khety boasted his ability as a warrior and ordered the organization of a provincial defence militia.Hayes, op. cit., p. 468-469. After his death Khety was buried in Asyut (tomb V) and his titles passed to his son Tefibi, who is likely to have lived during the reign of Wahkare Khety and Merykare.

Chemically clays are defined by crystal structure and chemical composition. Sometimes fine grain sediments are mistakenly described as clays, this is actually a description of the “clay- size fraction” rather than the mineralogy of the sediment. There are three crystallographic clay groups: platy clays (phyllosilicates), fibrous clay minerals, and amorphous clay. Phyllosilicates are the most abundant clays and are categorized based on the layering of a tetrahedral and an octahedral layer. For most clays, the octahedral layer is centered with Al3+, Fe3+, or Mg(OH)2, but sometimes Zn2+, Li+, and Cr3+ can substitute as well. Si4+ is normally the center of the tetrahedral layer but Al3+ will often partially substitute and create a charge imbalance. Two-layer clays are composed of a tetrahedral layer and an octahedral layer (T-O) while three-layer clays contain an octahedral layer sandwiched by two tetrahedral layers (T-O-T). When substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ creates a charge imbalance, an interlayer cation will fill in between tetrahedral layers to balance the charge of the clay. X-Ray Diffraction and Clays Structure of a two-layer clay, kaolinite (T-O) and pyrophyllite (T-O-T) with red arrow to represent the Z dimension. T-O-T clays are naturally larger in the Z direction because of the extra layer provided by the additional tetrahedral layer. Typically, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an average of randomly oriented microcrystals that should equally represent all crystal orientation if a large enough sample is present. X-rays are directed at the sample while slowly rotated which produce a diffraction pattern which show intensity of x-rays collected at different angles. Randomly oriented XRD samples are not as useful for clay minerals because clays typically have similar X and Y dimensions. The Z dimension differs from clay to clay and is most diagnostic because the Z dimension represents the height of the tetrahedral-octahedral (T-O) or tetrahedral- octahedral-tetrahedral (T-O-T) layer. The Z dimension can increase or decrease because of substitution of the central cation in both the tetrahedral and octahedral layers. The presence and size of a charge balancing cation in the interlayer of T-O-T clays will also affect the Z dimension. Because of this, clay minerals are typically identified by preparing samples so that they are oriented to increase basal (00l) reflection . D positions are calculated using Bragg’s law but because clay mineral analysis is one dimensional, l can substitute n, making the equation l λ = 2d sinΘ. When measuring the x-ray diffraction of clays, d is constant and λ is the known wavelength from the x-ray source, so the distance from one 00l peak to another is equal. =Identification of Clays using XRD= Basal reflections give d-spacing of the basal layer which represent the thickness of the silicate layers and the unit cell often contains multiple layers. Clay mineral peaks can generally be distinguished by the width halfway up the peak (i.e. the full width at half maximum, FWHM). Well-defined crystalline minerals have sharp peaks while clays, which range from crystalline to noncrystalline, produce broad peaks with noticeable width on both sides. These broad peaks make it easy to pick out which peaks are contributed by clays. These peaks can be compared to known diffraction patterns for better identification but if some peaks are broader than others, it is likely that multiple clays are present. The Clay Mineral Society maintains a collection clays for the purpose of comparison to unknown clays. Because the majority of the clays available from the Clay Mineral Society are naturally formed, they can contain minerals other than the desired clay. Diffraction patterns calculated using theoretical methods do not generally match with experimental diffraction patterns, so using diffraction patterns from known samples to help identify a clay is preferable to calculation. Some minerals can be eliminated from identification using background information or prior analysis. Well-crystallized and pure samples are ideal for x-ray diffraction, but this is rarely the case for clay. Clay minerals are almost always mixed with very small amounts of nonclay minerals which can produce intense peaks, even when there is very little of the sample is not a clay. If additional minerals are known to be presents, attempts should be made to separate clays from nonclays otherwise additional peaks should be expected. Some common minerals associated with naturally occurring clays are; quartz, feldspars, zeolites, and carbonates organic matter is sometimes present. Synthesis of clays can reduce the presence of some of these associated materials but does not guarantee pure samples as quartz or other associated materials are still commonly produced alongside synthetic clays. X-ray diffraction pattern of a Nontronite standard purchased from the clay mineral society. Red boxes represent a wide peaks attributed to nontronite. Blue box represents a sharp peak attributed to quartz present in the standard. =Mix Layered Clay Minerals= Mixed–layering, interlaying, and interstratification are all terms that refer to clay minerals that form with two or more types of clays that with intergrown layering. Mixed-layering does not refer to clays that have been physically mixed. Mixed-layering in clays make add difficulty to interpretation so multiple analysis are usually necessary. Two component clays are most common with multicomponent clays containing more than two components are very rare. The entire diffraction pattern contributes to the identification and peaks should be considered as a whole rather than individually. Mixed layer clays with two equal components (50% of each clay) are the easiest to identify. These clays are thought of as one, non-mixed clay with a 001 spacing that is equal to the sum of the 001 spacing of both components. Some commonly occurring 50/50 mixed-layer clays are even given unique names such as dozyite, a Serpentine/Chlorite. Mixed clays that have unequal components with random stacking produce aperiodic 00l diffraction patterns known as irrational patterns. The coefficient of variation (CV) is the percent standard deviation of the average of d(001) calculated from various reflections. If CV is less than 0.75% then the mineral is given a unique name. If CV is greater than 0.75% then mixed-layered nomenclature is used. Preparation for Clay Mineral X-ray diffraction Clays should be separated from the nonclay minerals to reduce interference of 00l peaks. Nonclay minerals can usually be separated by sieving samples at a small enough mesh. Samples should be lightly crushed but not pulverized because nonclay minerals will be reduced to clay sizes and become impossible to separate from the sample. Lightly crushing breaks apart the soft clays while keeping harder nonclays intact for easier removal. Samples should be as homogeneous as possible, both in grain size and composition before mounting them for X-ray diffraction and long, flat, and thick samples are ideal. Four methods are commonly used for sample preparation and vary in difficulty and appropriateness of use. =Glass Slide Method= Easiest and fastest of the four commonly used methods but also the least accurate. A glass microscope slide is covered with a suspension of sample in water then placed in an oven at 90 °C and left to dry. For some samples, drying at temperatures this high can damage the clays. In that case, drying at room temperature is an option but will require more time. Orientation is usually fair and particles are segregated with the finest particles toward the top. This method produces thin films which provide inaccurate diffraction intensities at moderate and high angles. =Smear Method= This is a quick method that is good identifying bulk sample constituents. The sample is crushed with a mortar and pestle until the powder is able to be brushed onto a glass slide. The powder is then mixed with a few drops of a dispersant solution, usually ethanol but others are available, and spread evenly over the slide. Both large and small grain size fractions can utilize this method. =Filter Membrane Peel Technique = This technique prevents size segregation by using either quick filtration or rapid stirring to overcome settling velocities. Sample is poured into a vacuum filter apparatus and filtered quickly but some liquid is left remaining so that air is not drawn though the sample, the remaining is liquid is then decanted. The damp sample is then inverted onto a glass slide and the filter paper is removed. Fast filtration allows a representative particle size to collect on the filter paper which is then inverted and exposed when mounted on a slide. =Centrifuged porous plate= Produces the best diffraction patterns out of the four most common methods but requires the most skill and is most time consuming. Upon completion, samples have thick aggregates and preferred orientation. A special apparatus designed to hold a porous ceramic plate is placed into a centrifuge container and filled with suspended sample. Centrifuging forces the liquid through the porous plate leaving the sample behind to be dried below 100 °C. An advantage of this method is that exchangeable cations can be removed by passing a chloride solution through the plate once the sample has been dried. Exchanging cations can be useful when establishing peaks for standards with variable interlayer cations. For example, nontronite has an interlayer which can contain both calcium and sodium. If an unknown sample was suspected to only contain one of these cations, a more accurate standard could be prepared by exchanging the undesired cation.

Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days (November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981), after a group of Iranian students supporting the Iranian Revolution took over the US Embassy in Tehran.Iran–U.S. Hostage Crisis (1979–1981) President Carter called the hostages \\"victims of terrorism and anarchy,\\" adding that \\"the United States will not yield to blackmail.\\"State of the Union Address by President Carter, January 23, 1980 The crisis was described by the western media as an entanglement of \\"vengeance and mutual incomprehension.\\"The Long Ordeal of the Hostages By HP-Time.com; John Skow, January 26, 1981 In Iran, the hostage taking was widely seen as a blow against the United States and its influence in Iran, its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution, and its longstanding support of the recently overthrown Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Following his overthrow, the Shah was allowed into the U.S. for medical treatment. The Iranians wanted the United States to return the Shah to them for trial of the crimes committed by him during his reign on ordinary citizens with the help of his secret police, the SAVAK. In Iran the asylum granted by the U.S. to the Shah was seen as American complicity in the atrocities meted by the Shah on the Iranian people. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as an outrage violating the principle of international law granting diplomats immunity from arrest and diplomatic compounds' inviolability.\\"Doing Satan's Work in Iran\\", New York Times, November 6, 1979.Kinzer, Stephen.

The episode reached a climax when, after failed attempts to negotiate a release, the United States military attempted a rescue operation off ships such as the and that were patrolling the waters near Iran. On April 24, 1980, Operation Eagle Claw resulted in a failed mission, the deaths of eight American servicemen, one Iranian civilian, and the destruction of two aircraft. On July 27, 1980, the former Shah died; then, in September, Iraq invaded Iran. These two events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with Algeria acting as a mediator. The hostages were formally released into United States custody the day after the signing of the Algiers Accords, just minutes after the new American president, Ronald Reagan, was sworn into office. Considered a pivotal episode in the history of Iran–United States relations,Inside Iran's Fury, Stephen Kinzer, Smithsonian magazine, October 2008 political analysts cite the crisis as having weighed heavily on Jimmy Carter's presidency and run for reelection in the 1980 presidential election.Reagan's Lucky Day: Iranian Hostage Crisis Helped The Great Communicator To Victory, CBS News, January 21, 2001 In Iran, the crisis strengthened the prestige of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the political power of those who supported theocracy and opposed any normalization of relations with the West.Mackey, Sandra, The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation, New York: Dutton, c. 1996 (p. 298) The crisis also marked the beginning of U.S. legal action resulting in economic sanctions against Iran, to further weaken ties between Iran and the United States.History Of U.S. Sanctions Against Iran Middle East Economic Survey, 26-August-2002 Provisions of the law This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The law amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to direct the President of the United States to deny U.S. admission to any representative of the United Nations (U.N.) who: (1) has been found to have been engaged in espionage activities or a terrorist activity against the United States or its allies, and (2) may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests. Procedural history 113th S.2195 was introduced into the United States Senate on April 1, 2014 by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. On April 7, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill by unanimous consent, and the United States House of Representatives voted likewise three days later. The bill was signed into law on April 16, 2014 by President Barack Obama. Debate and discussion Identical legislation was introduced in the House by Representative Doug Lamborn (R-CO) who said that the selection by Iran of Aboutalebi as their U.N. ambassador was \\"unconscionable and unacceptable.\\" He argued that this legislation was needed in order to give the President the \\"authority he needs to deny this individual a visa.\\" On April 10, 2014, it was still unclear whether President Barack Obama would choose to sign or veto the bill. White House press secretary Jay Carney said that \\"we've made it clear and have communicated to the Iranians that the selection they've put forward is not viable, and we're continuing to make that understood,\\" but had no comment about what the president was expected to do about the legislation. Newspaper The Hill described the possibility of vetoing the bill as \\"politically unthinkable.\\" President Obama's position was complicated because he was currently in negotiations with Iran regarding their nuclear program. An additional problem was that refusing Abutalebi's entry to the United States would violate a 1947 treaty agreement that was a prerequisite for the United Nations to locate their headquarters in New York City.

The Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh) once was identified as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but has since been elevated to a full species. Description Head of grey parrot The grey parrot is a medium-sized, predominantly grey, black-billed parrot. Its typical weight is , with an approximate length of , and a wingspan of . It has darker grey than its body over the head and both wings. The head and body feathers have slight white edges. The tail feathers are red. Due to selection by parrot breeders, some grey parrots are partly or completely red. Both sexes appear similar. The colouration of juveniles is similar to that of adults, but typically their eyes are dark grey to black, in comparison to the yellow irises around dark eyes of the adult birds, and their undertail coverts are tinged with grey. Adults weigh . Grey parrots may live for 40–60 years in captivity, although their mean lifespan in the wild appears to be shorter — approximately 23 years. Distribution and habitat The grey parrot is native to equatorial Africa, including Angola, Cameroon, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. The species is found inside a range from Kenya to the eastern part of the Ivory Coast. Current estimates for the global population are uncertain and range from 630,000 to 13 million birds. Populations are decreasing worldwide. The species seems to favor dense forests, but can also be found at forest edges and in more open vegetation types, such as gallery and savanna forests. A population study published in 2015 found that the species had been \\"virtually eliminated\\" from Ghana with numbers declining 90 to 99% since 1992. They were found in only 10 of 42 forested areas, and three roosts that once held 700–1200 birds each, now had only 18 in total. Local people mainly blamed the pet trade and the felling of timber for the decline. Populations are thought to be stable in Cameroon. In the Congo an estimated 15,000 are taken every year for the pet trade, from the eastern part of the country, although the annual quota is stated to be 5,000. The grey parrot has escaped or been deliberately released into Florida, USA, but no evidence indicates that the population is breeding naturally. Behaviour and ecology =Wild bird behaviours= Little is known about the behaviours and activities of these birds in the wild. In addition to a lack of research funding, it can be particularly difficult to study these birds in wild situations due to their status as prey animals, which leads them to have rather secretive personalities. Nevertheless, it has been shown that wild greys may also imitate a wide variety of the sounds they hear, much like their captive relatives. Two greys were recorded while roosting in Zaire and researchers reported that they had a repertoire of over 200 different sounds, including nine imitations of other wild bird songs and one of a bat. =Diet= A pet grey parrot eating a cucumber slice They are mostly frugivorous, most of their diet consists of fruit, nuts, and seeds. The species prefers oil palm fruit and they eat flowers and tree bark, as well as insects and snails. In the wild, the grey parrot is partly a ground feeder. In captivity, they may be fed bird pellets, a variety of fruits such as pear, orange, pomegranate, apple, and banana, and vegetables such as carrot, cooked sweet potato, celery, fresh kale, peas, and green beans. They also need a source of calcium. =Breeding= Two eggs and a newly hatched chick One-day old chick Grey parrots are monogamous breeders who nest in tree cavities. Each mated pair of parrots needs their own tree for their nest. The hen lays three to five eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. The adults defend their nesting sites. Both parents help take care of the chicks until they can go off on their own. Grey parrot chicks require feeding and care from their parents in the nest. The parents take care of them until 4-5 weeks after they are fledged. Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behavior of this species in the wild. They weigh at hatching and when they leave their parents. Diseases Young African grey parrots are more commonly infected by psittacine beak and feather disease than adults. Infected birds may show symptoms such as loss of appetite, fluffy feathers, sluggishness, and reduced walking abilities due to brittle bones. Conservation The natural predators for this species include palm-nut vultures and a number of raptors. Monkeys target eggs and the young for food. Grey parrots in captivity have been observed to be susceptible to fungal infections, bacterial infections, nutritional insufficiency, malignant tumors, psittacine beak and feather disease, tapeworms, and blood-worms. Humans are by far the largest threat to wild grey populations. Between 1994 and 2003, more than 359,000 grey parrots were traded on the international market. Approximately 21% of the wild population was being harvested every year. Mortality rates are extremely high between the time they are captured and they reach market, ranging from 60–66%. Mortality among imported birds is high. This species also is hunted for its meat and for its parts, which are used in traditional medicines. As a result of the extensive harvest of wild birds, in addition to habitat loss, this species is believed to be undergoing a rapid decline in the wild and therefore, has been rated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In October 2016, the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Fauna and Flora (CITES) extended the highest level of protection to grey parrots by listing the species under Appendix 1, which bans global and domestic trade in the species. Relationship to humans The species is common in captivity and regularly kept by humans as a companion parrot, prized for its ability to mimic human speech, which makes it one of the most popular avian pets. An escaped pet in Japan was returned to his owner after repeating the owner's name and address. Skeleton They are notorious for mimicking noises heard in their environment and using them tirelessly. They are highly intelligent birds, needing extensive behavioral and social enrichment as well as extensive attention in captivity or else they may become distressed. Feather plucking is a common symptom seen among such distressed grey parrots. They also may be prone to behavioural problems due to their sensitive nature. Social isolation hastens stress and aging. Their ability to reproduce noises has led to them exercising their vocal abilities in front of humans; for example in the metal band Hatebeak. Greys are highly social species and rely on a flock-type structure, even when raised in captivity. Because they are so dependent on the other birds within their flock, much of their speech and vocal ability is acquired through interaction with the humans with whom they reside. Both wild and captive parrots have been shown to use contact calls, which allow them to interact with their flock mates and communicate information about their location, detection of predators, availability of food, and safety status. In addition, contact calls are used to form strong social bonds with their flock mates, or in the case of captive greys, with their human house mates. In captivity, African Grey parrots have been shown to display communicative competence, meaning they not only use human language correctly, but also in such a way that is appropriate for the social situation in which they are in. Intelligence and cognition African grey parrots are highly intelligent and are considered by many to be one of the most intelligent species of psittacines. Many individuals have been shown to perform at the cognitive level of a four- to six-year-old human child in some tasks. A number of studies have been conducted with African Greys, indicating a slew of higher level cognitive abilities. Experiments have shown that grey parrots can learn number sequences and can learn to associate human voices with the faces of the humans who create them. The American scientist Irene Pepperberg's work with Alex the parrot showed his ability to learn more than 100 words, differentiating between objects, colours, materials, and shapes. Pepperberg spent several decades working with Alex, and wrote numerous scientific papers on experiments performed, indicating his advanced cognitive abilities. One such study found that Alex had the ability to add numbers as well as having a zero-like concept, similar to that of young children and apes. In addition to their striking cognitive abilities, grey parrots have been shown displaying altruistic behavior and concern for others. Researchers found that while blue- headed macaws were unlikely to share a nut with other members of their own species, grey parrots would actively give their conspecific partner a nut, even if it meant that they would not be able to get one themselves. When the roles were reversed, their partners were overwhelmingly likely to return the favor, foregoing their own nut to their partners benefits. This indicates not only a display of selflessness but also an act of reciprocity. Some research has shown that foot preference can be linked to the number of words a particular Grey parrot may know and use. Researchers found that African Grey parrots who prefer to use their right foot showed a marked increase in the number of words within their lexicon as compared to parrots who were left- footed. Scientists postulate that parrots may have lateralization of brain function, much like mammals do. Mutations Grey mutations occur naturally in the wild, such as the Blue Ino (albino), the Incomplete Ino, and the Blue varietals. The Blue Ino is all white. The Incomplete Ino has light pigmentation. The Blue has a white tail. Breeders from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia have bred greys intensively since the 1800s. These bred varieties include the Red Pied, F2 Pied, Grizzles, Ino, Incomplete, Parino, Lutino, Cinnamon, and Red Factor. South African bird breeder Von van Antwerpen and New Zealand partner Jaco Bosman selected F2 Pieds and created the first Red Factor Greys. They are rare, may be predominantly red-pigmented, and vary in price depending upon the extent of the red plumage displayed.

It serves as the provincial cathedral of the Church of Uganda and the diocesan cathedral for Namirembe Diocese, the first diocese to be founded in the Church of Uganda province, in 1890. Between 1919 and 1967, the Cathedral served as the provincial cathedral of the Church of Uganda, Anglican Communion. In the 1960s, the headquarters of the Church of Uganda moved to All Saints Church in Nakasero then moved back to Namirembe later. Location Namirembe church, 2005 The cathedral is located on Namirembe Hill, in Lubaga Division, in Kampala, the capital and largest city in Uganda. Namirembe is located approximately , by road, west of Kampala's central business district. The coordinates of Namirembe Cathedral are:0°18'54.0\\"N, 32°33'35.0\\"E (Latitude:0.315000; Longitude:32.559710). Overview Namirembe Hill has been the location of the main Anglican place of worship in Buganda since Bishop Alfred Tucker established the offices of the Diocese of Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1890. Tragedy befell the first four church structures: # The first church building, constructed in 1890, with a capacity of 800 people, was abandoned in 1891 because it was located in a swampy area at the base of Namirembe Hill. Also, a bigger building was needed to accommodate the ever-growing congregation. # The second church building was constructed between July 1891 and July 1892, with a seating capacity of more than 3,000. In October 1894, strong winds during a thunderstorm blew the roof off the church and it was ruined. #Former church building, probably the fourth church (1904-1910)The third church building was built between 1894 and 1895. It had a seating capacity of about 4,000 worshippers. That building, constructed with traditional African materials, was abandoned in the early 1900s due to fear that termites would destroy it. # The fourth church building was constructed with earthen brick walls and a thatched roof, between 1900 and 1904. At the opening ceremony, on Tuesday 21 June 1904, an estimated 10,000 people were in attendance. The congregation included Kabaka Daudi Chwa II, then aged seven years. On the afternoon of Friday 23 September 1910, the roof was gutted by a fire which started when lightning struck the building. Within less than thirty minutes, the entire roof was destroyed and the church was ruined. # The current St. Paul's Cathedral was constructed between 1915 and 1919 using earthen bricks and earthen roof tiles. The cathedral is still standing, but needs repairs from time to time. Organ The organ in St. Paul's Cathedral Namirembe, the oldest cathedral in the Church of Uganda, Anglican Communion, was built in 1931 by The Positive Organ Company (1922) Limited. In 1952, after twenty years of service the organ was in need of an overhaul and this work was entrusted to Alfred E. Davis of Northampton, England. The organ gave a further twenty years of service, but after Idi Amin seized power in 1971 it deteriorated seriously during the years of unrest. Eventually in 1998, Peter Wells from the United Kingdom was sent to inspect what remained and advise on the rehabilitation. Several schemes were considered and the organ today operates to a specification drawn up with Michael Sozi, then chairman of the Organ Committee, in 1999. Due to limited funds, it was decided to stagger the work of restoration. The first phase commenced after Easter 1999 when Peter and Ann Wells travelled to Uganda to install new manual keyboards and action to the manual soundboards. The full scheme was realized in 2006 and 2007 with the installation of the Great Mixture and Pedal Trombone. Recent events On 16 December 2012, the cathedral hosted the enthronement of the Most Reverend Stanley Ntagali, as the 8th archbishop of the Church of Uganda. The ceremony was attended by an estimated 3,000 people, including several other luminaries from the Anglican Communion, including The Most Reverend Robert Duncan, Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America, and The Most Reverend John Sentamu the Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom. Other attendees included Archbishops from Burundi, England, the Indian Ocean, Kenya, the Middle East, Nigeria, Rwanda, Scotland and Sudan. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, the President of Uganda, was also in attendance.

Inheritance Upon Margaret's death on August 16, 1949, her two nephews Eugene Mitchell (April 6,1931 - August 8,2007) and Joseph Mitchell inherited $500 each from her estate. Mitchell was fourteen years old at the time and later stated he was in his thirties before he read Gone with the Wind. John R. Marsh, Margaret's husband, gained the rights to the estate upon her death. When Marsh died in 1952, the rights passed to Margaret's brother Stephens Mitchell, and then when he died the rights passed to Eugene and Joseph. When Mitchell and brother Eugene inherited the estate, it was worth multi-millions. Mitchell was not a public figure, however, and stayed out of the limelight that came with the inheritance. Life Joseph Reynolds \\"Joe\\" Mitchell was born the second son of Stephens and Carolyn Reynolds Mitchell in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 27, 1935. Mitchell attended the University of Georgia for his undergraduate studies in literature, then went on to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. for his Master's Degree in English Literature. After graduating, he worked at the MGM publicity office in New York for two years, but after this stint did not work regularly until his death. His closest friends were listed in England, and he traveled to Europe as often as twice a year. Like his older brother Eugene, Mitchell had no children and died from complications with diabetes at the age of 76 on October 11, 2011. He was survived by several cousins and his sister-in-law Virginia Mitchell. Legacy Mitchell bequeathed 50 percent of trademark and literary rights of the Mitchell Estate to the Archdiocese of Atlanta, along with personal items of Margaret's. Some of the items included a collection of signed Gone with the Wind first editions published in various languages in countries around the world; an unpublished history of the Mitchell family, handwritten by Margaret's father, Eugene Muse Mitchell; Margaret's wallet, press card and library card; furniture from her apartment; a library of books, including signed first editions of the late Georgia Catholic author Flannery O'Connor's novels and short stories. He also donated millions of dollars and his home on Habersham Road in Atlanta to the archdiocese. The archdiocese set aside $7.5 million for the cathedral’s building fund, $3.75 million to Catholic Charities and other service groups, and several million more went to disadvantaged parishes, parish endowments, a retirement fund for priests, and a Jesuit high school. Deacon Steve Swope of the archdiocese stated of Mitchell \\"His mission was to protect the dignity of the work, and we are going to carry that on. We are going to fiercely protect it from infringement. We have an obligation to do that.\\" Swope continued with \\"I am probably more a fan of Margaret Mitchell and Joseph Mitchell, since I have learned so much about them through this process. Margaret's simplicity and humility are pretty well known, and now Joseph will be remembered for his simplicity and generosity. Margaret's legacy is the greatest novel written about the South during the time of the Civil War. Joseph's legacy is the help he has provided to so many through his generous nature. For me, while Gone With the Wind is great, Margaret and Joseph Mitchell through their actions are far greater.\\" Mitchell was posthumously mentioned in the press in early April, 2014, when the Atlanta Catholic Church was caught up in a scandal. Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory of Georgia came under media scrutiny for building a $2.2 million mansion on land donated by Mitchell with funds earmarked for charitable donations and religious purposes. Originally Mitchell's one-story home had been on the property, but it was razed to make room for the mansion. Mitchell's land contributions in relation to the mansion were mentioned in CNN, the Washington Post, Boston Globe, Huffington Post, and many other outlets.

As of 2013, Muffin Break had 275 stores worldwide: 190 in Australia, 37 in New Zealand and 46 in the United Kingdom. Muffin Break is the sister company of Jamaica Blue, which is also a franchise of Foodco.  History  The Muffin Break concept originated in Canada in the 1970s but was acquired by Foodco and refined for contemporary conditions. The first of the new style Muffin Break stores opened in 1989 in Coolangatta, Queensland. The first Muffin Break store in New Zealand opened in Auckland in 1994. Muffin Break entered the UK market in 2001. In December 2015, a partnership was made between Foodco and Croc's Playcentres, an Australian family entertainment centre franchise. The partnership saw Muffin Break cafes included in all new Croc's Playcentres and existing Croc's franchisees given the opportunity to convert their cafes to Muffin Break cafes.  Partnerships  = Share the Dignity = In 2018, Muffin Break announced Share the Dignity as their national charity partner and has since raised over $30,000 that makes a real, on-the-ground difference to homeless women and victims of domestic violence. Share the Dignity is a not- for-profit that provides homeless and at-risk women Australia-wide with sanitary items to alleviate period poverty. Founded by Rochelle Courtenay in 2015, more than 5,000 volunteers and some of Australia’s biggest corporates support the charity, which has collected almost 2.5 million packets of sanitary items since forming in 2015. It’s important work. After reading that homeless women Australia-wide were making sanitary pads out of public restroom toilet paper because they couldn’t afford to buy them, Rochelle Courtenay felt a call to action. It’s staggering to think that on any given night in Australia, one in 200 people are homeless. Of those, 44% are female and 27% are children under the age of 18. According to Share the Dignity, Family violence is the number one reason people contact homeless services. They need your help. Muffin Break is proud to be supporting Share the Dignity in their campaign. We want to help eliminate period poverty in Australia, where women and girls experiencing homelessness or those fleeing domestic violence suffer the indignity of having to choose between food and sanitary products. = Wakakirri = In 2018, Muffin Break joined forces with Wakakirri as a major sponsor supporting Wakakirri’s mission to bring the benefits of performing arts and storytelling to every school in Australia. As part of the partnership, Muffin Break have committed to sponsor disadvantaged schools to create their own Story Dance productions to perform at the national Wakakirri Story Dance Challenge. “Partnering with Wakakirri has presented us at Muffin Break, an opportunity to give back and support regional communities, offering Aussie kids the chance to do what they love most,” said Muffin Break’s General Manager Natalie Brennan. Wakakirri Founder and Festival Director Adam Loxley announced the partnership at Wakakirri’s Performing Arts Careers Day on May 28th, a free event for secondary school students in Melbourne where Aussie entertainment stars including Michala Banas, Joshua Horner and Alex Papps shared career advice and insights. “Wakakirri is excited to embark on this new partnership and we are grateful to Muffin Break for recognising the work we have been doing for over 25 years and committing to support us,” said Loxley. = Simply Cups = Simply Cups partnered with the brand from August 2018, in an effort to reduce the amount of disposable cups used in Australia. Muffin Break pays Simply Cups to have a cup recycled for every takeaway hot beverage bought at their stores. Starting in August 2018, Muffin Break will pay Simply Cups to have a cup recycled for every takeaway hot beverage bought at their stores. Most takeaway coffee cups can’t be recycled easily, due to the combination of paper and waterproof plastic. Simply Cups works with innovators to solve this problem. They’re collecting disposable coffee cups from all over the country and giving them a second lease on life as a new recycled, and recyclable, product. The coffee brand have also signed up to the Responsible Cafes Movement, joining cafes and coffee fans that promotes the use of reusable cups.  Awards  Muffin Break has been a recipient of many awards to acknowledge their achievements to include: * In 2019, rated “High Performers” by FRANdata – the independent Australian Franchise Rating Scale. Ratings are given after an independent and fact-based examination. * In 2019, Muffin Break makes the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies as nominated by the Australian Financial Review * In 2019, Muffin Break won QSR's Best Sustainability Initiative * In 2019, Muffin Break is named Socially Responsible Franchisor Winner by the Franchise Council of Australia * In 2018, Muffin Break won Squad Team of the Year by QSR * In 2017, Muffin Break was awarded Coffee Shop of the Year by Roy Morgan * In 2017, Muffin Break won many categories with the Golden Bean Awards * In 2016, Muffin Break was awarded Coffee Shop of the Year by Roy Morgan  Unofficial Bean Poll  Every election since 2007, Muffin Break’s Unofficial Election Bean Poll has accurately predicted the results of the Federal election, with 100% track record. Once the date was announced, 200 stores across the country hosted a bean poll counter, encouraging customers to vote for their preferred party, with a coffee bean. Muffin Break’s Election Poll predicated what no other poll had and continues to reflect an unblemished record. Even the exit polls did not reflect the results once all the votes were counted! Regardless of social media reaching greater masses, combined with the traditional marketing leading up to the election, it seems Muffin Break’s reach of its 200 stores stretching from suburbia to regional towns right across Australia, prove to truly reflect the voice of the country’s residents. More recently with the May 2019 Australian Federal Elections, it was no surprise to Muffin Break that they were able to predict the trends Australians are asking for from being the only poll to predict the election results correctly, to being first to market with plant-based milks for customers and sustainability initiatives to upcycle takeaway coffee cups.  Labour practices  In 2014, an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman found a 24-year-old student working at two Victorian stores had been underpaid almost $20,000. The store owners agreed to repay the employee and entered into an enforceable undertaking with the Ombudsman. In 2016, the former owners of a Hobart store were investigated by the Ombudsman and found to have underpaid two employees over $46,000 between April 2014 and December 2015. The store owners agreed to repay the employees and entered into an enforceable undertaking with the Ombudsman. On 23 February 2019, Muffin Break General Manager made headlines when she spoke about young people not wanting to work unpaid internships, telling a journalist: \\"There’s just nobody walking in my door asking for an internship, work experience or unpaid work, nobody.\\" These comments were later refuted by the journalist who wrote the original story as being misinterpreted “She never said she expected all of her employees to work for free, as many online seem to be suggesting, only that those who put themselves forward to do unpaid work were more likely to get a job” In September 2019, the Australian Fair Work Ombudsman found that franchisees of Jamaica Blue and Muffin Break cafés had underpaid 166 employees a total of over $26,000.

The INTAR acronym is for International Arts Relations.https://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/141/intar-international-arts- relations History INTAR Theatre was founded in New York in 1966 as Asociación de Arte Latinoamericano (ADAL) by a group of Cuban and Puerto Rican writers and artists. Cuban-born Max Ferrá served as INTAR's artistic director since its founding until 2004, when Cuban-American playwright Eduardo Machado assumed artistic leadership of the organization. In its early years, INTAR focused on producing in Spanish the works of significant European and American playwrights. In the 1970s, the organization began producing works in English by Ibero-American and Latino writers. The theater company has built on this strength and emphasizes in new works that reflect the cultural heritage and concerns of the Hispanic community in the United States. Works have included drama, musicals, children's theater, collaborative visual arts and theater creations, and traveling productions. In 1977 it was of first eight theaters that replaced adult entertainment venues on 42nd Street to form Theatre Row. INTAR has historically focused on four program areas. The theater program has resulted in over 125 theater productions by more than 175 playwrights and composers. The developmental theater program has hosted various writing labs and workshops designed to support the creation of new theater works by Hispanic artists. Almost every Latino playwright working today has participated in one of INTAR's workshops. Cuban-born, avant-garde playwright María Irene Fornés directed the Hispanic Playwrights-in-Residence Lab from 1981 to 1991. Graciela Daniele ran a Music Theater Lab from 1985 to 1989, and in 1991, INTAR hosted an Actors Lab. The New Works Lab was founded in 1994 under the direction of Michael Garces and is designed to support the creative development of emerging directors, writers, actors and other artists from the Latino theater community. Most recently, INTAR launched the Actor's Collective as part of its developmental theater program. Inverna Lockpez founded INTAR's Latin American Gallery in 1979, serving as curator through the 1990s. The Gallery was established as an alternative space to provide exposure for emerging and established Latino and Latin American artists, producing bilingual catalogs and posters for its exhibitions.

The minerals contained in the deposit include copper, nickel, platinum, silver, palladium, and titanium. Background The NorthMet Deposit is located at the eastern end of the Mesabi Iron Range in St. Louis County, Minnesota near the cities of Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, United States Army Corps of Engineers, and United States Forest Service, NorthMet Mining Project and Land Exchange Geologists have discovered that the deposit contains copper, nickel, silver, platinum, titanium, and palladium.John Meyers, Digging Into the Promise of Copper Geologists estimate that the deposits totals about four billion tons and could be worth of one trillion dollars. The precious metals contained within the deposit are essential for items such as computers, cell phones, and cars.Renee Richardson, Getting the details behind copper-nickel mining in Minnesota The rights to this deposit can be privately leased and are currently being leased by Polymet Mining Corporation. Controversy Although PolyMet controls the rights to the deposit, there is much controversy about whether they should be able to mine it. These minerals would be harvested through the traditional Polymet Mining Corporation process. The problem with mining these types of minerals using this process is that the minerals contain sulfites which can cause acid mine drainage or mercury related problems. This causes the water from the surrounding areas to not be up to Minnesota water standards. Therefore, the water must be treated before it will be usable and safe to drink. The amount of time that this water will need to be treated is unclear, as it can't be modeled. Proponents of mining the deposit think that the economic benefit would outweigh the possible environmental costs.UMD Labovitz School of Business and Economics Bureau of Business and Economic Research, Economic Impacts of PolyMet's NorthMet Project The debate is the largest Minnesota's DNR has ever seen, with the public filing more than 49,000 comments on the issue.Steve Karnowski, EPA says PolyMet mine review shows improvements Associated Press References External links *Minnesota DNR PolyMet site: http://dnr.state.mn.us/input/environmentalreview/polymet/index.html *Mining Truth site operated by opponents: http://www.miningtruth.org *Go PolyMet company-sponsored site: http://www.gopolymet.com Category:Mining in Minnesota Category:Environmental impact of mining Category:Geology of Minnesota ","title":"NorthMet Deposit"},{"id":"42430735","title":"One Love, One Rhythm – The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album"},{"id":"42430761","text":"Inspector De Luca may refer to: *Inspector De Luca (novel series), a trilogy of Italian crime novels by Carlo Lucarelli, and its protagonist, Achille de Luca *Inspector De Luca (TV series), a 2008 TV series based on the novels ","title":"Inspector De Luca"},{"id":"42430769","text":"Alkayida (also spelt Ashanti ), also known as Akayida, is a Ghanaian dance with an emphasis on side to side moves, incorporating upper and body gestures, and encouraging group routines as well as individual competition. Alkayida dance is intensively relaxed, intensively free-form, intensively involves footwork, and incorporates vast arrays of hip-life dance moves. It involves the swaying of the body along with hand and shoulder movements in a certain pattern. According to hiplife artist Guru who had a key role in popularizing the dance, the name of the dance should be written \\"Akayida\\" Choreography The dance, spelt Alkayida, began as a slower dance with moves that seemed to be replicating the extremist group and more recently, the dance and rhythms have picked up pace and delivered colourful choreography and the “Alkayida”—often misspelled “Al Qaeda”—not only vies in unseating the azonto, but it inadvertently embeds the Ghanaian hip-life culture levity into the name of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda. Viral hit The Alkayida dance craze has been associated with hip-life music icon Guru after he popularized the term in his hit song \\"Akayida (Boys Abrɛ)\\". \\"Brɛ\\" in the Ashanti language means \\"tired\\". In Guru’s song titled Alkayida, the response to the word Akayida is \\"boys abrɛ\\", and this catch phrase has gradually crawled its way into the vocabulary of the Akan youth. Asamoah Gyan and the Black Stars squad were scheduled to showcase the \\"Alkayida\\" dance on the global stage at the 2014 World Cup. Gyan and the rest of the team danced after scoring a goal in the Germany vs. Ghana group stage match. It was, however, an Azonto dance and not Alkayida. During 2014, Panamanian dancehall deejay Japanese alongside Honduran dancehall artist AlBeezy released the song \\"La Caída\\" (, \\"The Tumble\\"), using a similar instrumental to Guru's track but with unrelated lyrics (a common practice among Panamanian dancehall songs, which are often modeled after existing Jamaican dancehall songs. This is sometimes discouraged and deemed plagiarism), and featuring the same dance moves. This gave the dance a brief, minor raise of popularity in Panama and, to a much lesser extent, Guru's music and Azonto music overall.

The gunfight, which lasted several hours and resulted in the death of at least one man and the wounding of seven others, began when Tilghman and his raiders attempted to take the county records from the Old Gray County Courthouse back to Ingalls. Background In the late 1880s, Cimarron and its neighbor to the west, Ingalls, were locked in a contest to decide which town would become the new county seat. Because towns in the 19th century often relied on their county seat status to survive, the county seat contests often resulted in violence. After an election to decide the contest ended with accusations of fraud and protests from both sides, the matter was sent to the Kansas Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a man from Ingalls named Newt Watson became the new county clerk, and he demanded that the county records in Cimarron be taken from the courthouse and brought to him. When the citizens of Cimarron refused to turn over the records, the Ingalls faction organized a group of raiders to go into town and take them by force. The raiding party, led by Bill Tilghman, also included Jim Masterson, brother of the famous Bat Masterson, Ben Daniels, \\"Neal\\" Brown, and Fred Singer, who were all former Dodge City peace officers, in addition to some \\"cowtown mercenaries,\\" George Bolds, Ed Brooks, and Billy Allensworth. To give them \\"semi-official status,\\" all of the men in the group were deputized by Tilghman, who was appointed temporary Gray County Sheriff by Watson after the current sheriff, Joe Reynolds, was put in a hospital with a gunshot wound to the stomach. The battle Bill Tilghman posing with his Winchester rifle. The raid was set to take place on January 12, 1889. That day, Tilghman and the others arrived in Cimarron with a wagon to carry the records. After pulling up to the courthouse, Watson, Masterson, Singer, and Allensworth quickly entered the building to begin loading the documents into the back of the wagon, while the rest of the men waited outside. In the meantime, some armed Cimarron men were moving into position to attack. Suddenly, the Cimarron men opened fire on the raiders waiting by the wagon. Tilghman was hit in one of his legs, Brooks \\"doubled over\\" with a gunshot, and Bolds was struck three times, once in the leg and twice in the abdomen. The wagon driver, a man by the name of Charlie Reicheldeffer, was also hit, but somehow they all managed to climb back onto the wagon and drive it out of town without being killed. Masterson and the others were left inside the courthouse, so they immediately took up positions on the second floor to return fire. The Cimarron men attempted to storm the building by rushing the front door, but were beaten back by \\"deadly shots\\" from the remaining raiders. After that failed, the Cimarron men attempted to breach the building by raising a ladder up to a window in the back of the building. This plan was also thwarted when Masterson found out and kicked down the ladder. Eventually the townsfolk made it into the first floor of the building and from there they fired up through the ceiling and into the second floor. The raiders, however, climbed on top of the filing cabinets, desks, and a steel safe to protect themselves. Ultimately, the battle lasted for about six hours and finally came to an end when the Cimarron faction received a telegraph from Bat Masterson in Dodge City warning that unless his brother and his friends were allowed to leave town, he would \\"hire a train and come in with enough men to blow Cimarron off the face of Kansas.\\" After that, the raiders put down their guns and were briefly taken prisoner. Aftermath According to Richard M. Patterson's Historical Atlas of the Outlaw West, only one man - a Cimarron resident named J. W. English - was killed in the entire shootout, although other sources say that as many as three men died as result. Patterson also says that in total one man was killed and three wounded on the Cimarron side, and that four men were wounded on the Ingalls side. The raiders were later tried for the killing of English, but they were eventually acquitted. The dispute over the new county seat did not end either, although there was no further violence. It was finally settled in February 1893, when Cimarron became the permanent seat of Gray County. The Old Gray County Courthouse, which was replaced in 1927, is now open to the public and serves as a meeting hall. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2009 for its association with the Kansas County Seat Wars.

In this episode, with Rumplestiltskin as her slave, Zelena challenges Regina to a fight to the death and shocks the Evil Queen with the revelation of their familial connection, even while the town lays Neal to rest. Meanwhile, back in the past, in the land of Oz, a jealous Zelena asks the Wizard to send her to Enchanted Forest after discovering she has a sister, Regina, and that Rumplestiltskin is training her to become a powerful force to be reckoned with. Plot =Opening Sequence= The four fire geysers from The Wizard of Oz shoots up at the series' title. =In the Characters' Past= While travelling down a road, a woodcutter and his wife notices a tornado coming. After it disappears, the two see a basket on the ground, discovering a baby girl inside. As they pick it up, a tree branch is about to fall on them but the baby makes it move out of the way, saving the couple. The woodcutter believes there is something that is not right about the baby, but his wife believes that she might be special and wants to keep the child, as they head for a place that is revealed to be the Emerald City of Oz. They keep the child, naming her Zelena. Fast forward to the years before the first curse, as Zelena shaves her father perfectly until she gives him a bloody nick, leading him to reveal to her that she is not his daughter and is nothing but a \\"witch.\\" Zelena, who then lashes out at him for being a drunk, decides to go to the Wizard to find out the truth about her past, where upon her entry into the chamber she finds a curtain that covers a shadowy Wizard. He then asks her to look into a visionary portal and she discovers her mother Cora abandoning Zelena because she couldn't give her the one thing she wanted: royalty. But as she continues to watch, the Wizard tells her that Cora would later groom her younger sister Regina for royalty and would be later trained in sorcery by Rumplestlitskin. Zelena is then given a pair of silver slippers by the Wizard. When she clicks her heels three times they will bring her wherever she wants to go, but in return he wants something of Rumplestiltskin's, and then cautions Zelena that her actions will make her green with envy. She then uses it to take her to the Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin. Zelena feels that with Rumplestiltskin teaching her, she now feels happy with him. Unfortunately, this would all change when he skips out on a feast that she made for him in order to continue teaching Regina, making her more envious than ever. This prompts her enter to Regina's bedroom to kill her with a blade, only to find out that she was tricked by Rumplestiltskin (disguised as Regina). Zelena discovers that she had failed his test because the curse demands giving up the thing you love most, and that was her love for Rumplestiltskin, who then responds \\"It's OK. I have that effect on women.\\" She also discovers that Rumplestiltskin has already trained Regina to become powerful, and Zelena's throat turns green. Rumplestiltskin then tells Zelena that unless she can take him to a land without magic, Regina is the one for the job. Zelena says bitterly that she could have, thanks to her slippers, but tells him it's too late for that, since he had already chosen Regina. Then, Zelena tells Rumplestiltskin that the only way he could get the slippers from her was to kill her, only to teleport away when he tries to. She says \\"The next time, you will choose me.\\" Using her slippers, she then returns to Oz. Back in Oz, Zelena demands that the Wizard help her to travel back in time to stop Cora from abandoning her, but he claims that it's impossible, even for him. Suspicious, she uses her power to bring the curtain down. It turns out that the \\"Wizard\\" is none other than Walsh (Emma Swan's boyfriend and ex-fiance), a circus barker from Kansas. Walsh says he does not have magic, but he collects it. Zelena decides that she has no use for him, but what she could use is a trained circus animal. And after seeing a flying monkey poster, she drags Walsh and transforms him into the very first one, and uses him thereafter to do her bidding. Zelena then uses the magic viewer in the floor to watch Rumplestilskin train Regina. She literally turns green with envy and becomes wicked as ever, vowing that by the time she is done with her plan, Regina would have never even been born. =In Storybrooke= At Neal/Baelfire's funeral, Everyone takes turns at burying his casket, while back at the farm Zelena taunts Gold about losing his son. Later on at Granny's, Emma makes bulls eyes and scores perfectly while playing darts which Hook suspects is her way to exact revenge on Zelena. Hook then tells Emma that he wants to spend some time with Henry as way to make up for Neal's loss, and Emma lets Henry go with Hook. Meanwhile, Tinker Bell notices the crest on Robin Hood's arm and asks Regina if it's the man from her prophecy, which Regina confirms, but when Robin comes over to talk, Regina changes the subject. Unfortunately, this gathering at Granny's is interrupted by Zelena, who bursts into the diner to confront Regina. She tells her again that they are half-sisters and that Cora is their mother, then challenges her to a duel at sundown, demanding no interference whatsoever. Regina agrees to the challenge saying that “This isn’t the Wild West,” while Zelena counters with, “No, dear. It’s the Wicked West,\\" and departs. At the Vault, Regina finds a letter from Cora, affirming that Zelena is telling the truth. She is later tracked down by Robin, who, after pickpocketing it from her jacket, is allowed to read the letter. Regina learned that the letter about Rumplestilskin praising Cora's first-born was about Zelena and not her. Also, Regina tells Robin Hood that if Rumplestiltskin, the one who taught her everything she knew about magic, thinks that Zelena is more powerful than Regina (and Cora), she will have no chance of winning the fight. Meanwhile, as Mary Margaret, Emma, David, Tinker Bell, and Belle discuss how to stop Zelena, Belle thinks that she can get through to Gold without using his dagger. As a result, they head to the farmhouse, and as Belle runs down to the cellar to free Gold, Zelena appears from the background, dagger in hand. Belle runs back upstairs, with Gold warning the others that Zelena wants them to know that if they interfere, he will kill them. In the meantime, Hook is tasked with distracting Henry/keeping him safe, so he takes him down to the docks, looking at the sky with Hook's sextant. Henry gets suspicious about Hook after he says that he taught Neal when he was a boy, although they are the same age. Henry demands the truth. Hook then tells him Emma is trying to protect him, saying that Neal had just lost his father when he met him, and Henry has more in common with him than he realizes. Later that night at Main Street, everyone gathers to see the sisters' showdown. Zelena shows up first and means business; she threatens to use Gold to kill anyone after five minutes if Regina doesn't come, and she proves it after Emma steps in by throwing her into her parents. Regina then finally steps up to battle, but not before slapping her older sister over the subject of their mother. Zelena responds by throwing her sister into a car; Regina counters by conjuring up a fire ball which Zelena extinguishes quickly. Zelena then throws Regina into the clock tower, and as Zelena flies up to take the one thing that she needs from Regina, The Evil Queen reveals she has known what it was all along, telling Zelena “Our mother taught me one thing. Never bring your heart to a witch fight.” (It turns out that Regina gave her heart to Robin Hood back at the forest for safekeeping prior to the battle). A furious Zelena tells Regina that she will find her heart, and also vows to destroy her, before flying off on her broom. As everyone races to check on Regina, Regina divulges that if Zelena has David's courage and is after Regina's heart, Zelena might have something big planned. And as it turns out, Zelena is indeed planning something that will change the courses of everyone involved, telling Gold back in his cage that what she is planning isn't a curse... but a second chance.

His first prominent role in government began in 1985, when he was made leader of the United Front Work Department for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He held the position until the CCP expelled him for inadequately following the party line in his dialogues with students during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.Josephine Ma, \\"Taiwan post marks former aide’s return to the fold\\", South China Morning Post, October 30, 2007. Yan returned to government work in 1991 when he became a vice minister of Civil Affairs.“Ex-Allies of Purged Leader Zhao Are Assigned New Posts in China,” The Asian Wall Street Journal, June 3, 1991, 22.  Early career  Yan was born in Liaoning province in 1931. In 1949, he graduated from the Harbin Foreign Language College. He then became the official Russian translator for Mao Zedong, before being promoted to a high-ranking party position sometime in the late 1950s.Lawrence R. Sullivan. “Yan Mingfu,” Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Communist Party (Plymouth: Scarecrow Press, 2012), 293. During the Cultural Revolution he was arrested and did not reappear in a state position until 1985. His father, Yan Baohang, had been a member of both the Kuomintang and the CCP.Rana Mitter, “Complicity, Repression, and Regionalism: Yan Baohang and Centripetal Nationalism, 1931-1949,” Modern China 25.1 (1999): 44. Before Yan Mingfu was appointed head of the United Front Work Department in 1985, his father had held the position from the department's inception during the Chinese Civil War. When students began protesting China's corruption and economic problems after the death of Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989, Yan was also serving as a Secretary in the 13th Politburo of the Communist Party of China.Han Minzhu, “[Parting Words] of a Hunger Striker,” Cries for Democracy: Writings and Speeches from the 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement, ed. Han Minzhu and Hua Sheng (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), 203.  Participation in 1989 Tiananmen Square protests  From the beginning of the protests at Tiananmen Square, the Politburo's members had been working towards finding a resolution that would pacify the students. Some officials favored engaging with their demands, but others, such as Li Peng, felt that most pressing issue was to “get students back into their classrooms” before the situation escalated.Zhang Liang, “Opinions divide in the Politburo,” The Tiananmen Papers, ed. Andrew J. Nathan and Perry Link (New York: Public Affairs, 2002), 136. At a meeting held on May 10, the Politburo, under the leadership of Zhao Ziyang, decided that holding discussions with every group involved in the protests would be an ideal path to resolving the students’ issues; along with Hu Qili and Rui Xingwen, Yan was asked to speak to journalists from various papers throughout the capital.Zhang, “Opinions divide in the Politburo,” The Tiananmen Papers, 138. According to Zhang Liang, the compiler of the document collection The Tiananmen Papers, the three officials saw in the protests “an opportunity to move decisively toward fuller, more truthful reporting.”Zhang, “Authorizing a liberal press policy,” The Tiananmen Papers, 146-7. Yan held his dialogue with Beijing's journalists from May 11 to May 13; throughout these discussions, he repeatedly voiced his support for the students’ goals, downplayed the condemnation of the protest expressed in the April 26 Editorial, and maintained that Zhao was fully in favor of reforming the press. After the students commenced their hunger strike on May 13, the Politburo sent Yan to Tiananmen Square to call for an end to the protests and implore students to return to class.Zhang, “Authorizing a liberal press policy,” The Tiananmen Papers, 152. For the most part, the meeting went badly. In his discussion with the student leaders, he acknowledged that the decision to protest was justified while reaffirming the Politburo's desire to see the students return to their classrooms. He also condemned the decision to begin a hunger strike, telling the students that it “accomplishes nothing, either for the country or your own health. If you present your demands and suggestions through proper channels, I can responsibly tell you the door to dialogue is always open.”Zhang, “The hunger strike begins,” The Tiananmen Papers, 159. The meeting ended with both groups feeling misunderstood; when Yan reported back to Zhao, he noted that the student leaders “are in disagreement among themselves.” On May 14, Yan returned to the Great Hall of the People and told students that a dialogue to be held later in the day would be recorded and broadcast on national television. During the discussion that afternoon, Zhang claims, Yan and Li Tieying maintained that their aim was “not to negotiate policy decisions but to exchange views and information.”Zhang, “Li Tieying and Yan Mingfu hold dialogue with students,” The Tiananmen Papers, 165. After the dialogue broke down, Dai Qing and a group of eleven other intellectuals notified Yan that they were willing to meet with the students and urge them to stop their hunger strike. When the intellectuals returned from the dialogue, they claimed that the students would listen if the government would compromise first. For Yan, this indicated that the “students are getting greedier, their demands are getting stiffer, and they’re getting less and less unified among themselves.”Zhang, “The intellectuals appeal,” The Tiananmen Papers, 165-6. The intellectuals resumed the discussion, but it again ended without either party reaching a resolution. On May 16, Yan arrived at Tiananmen Square to advocate an end to the hunger strike. He offered himself as a hostage to demonstrate the sincerity of his belief that all issues would soon be resolved. The students believed his speech to be genuine, but they did not think that the government would truly capitulate.Han, “Transcript of May 18 meeting between Premier Li Peng and students,” Cries for Democracy, 244. By May 18, Yan had grown tired of the disagreements between the students and the government. At a meeting between Li Peng and the student leaders that day, he stated that the “only issue I am concerned with is that of saving the children who are hunger striking in the Square, who are now in a very weakened state, their lives gravely threatened.” When Zhao was ousted on May 21, Yan lost his major source of political support;Zhang, “The Conflict Intensifies,” The Tiananmen Papers, 268. on June 23, the Politburo voted to eject him from his government positions.Zhang, “The Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee,” The Tiananmen Papers, 438. An article from The Asian Wall Street Journal contends that Yan “was criticized as handling the talks badly.” According to Zhang, Yan's speech to students on May 16 also “became a major count against him” when the government began to expel its reform-minded members.  Return to government and retirement  Yan did not reappear in Chinese politics until 1991, when he was named vice minister of Civil Affairs. The promotion occurred almost exactly two years after the June 4 Massacre, but a New York Times article claims that Yan and other recently rehabilitated officials “did not mention their 1989 political disgrace or say why they were given new jobs.”\\"Beijing Promotes 3 Officials Who Were Allies of Purged Party Chief\\", New York Times, June 2, 1991. According to Josephine Ma, Yan “lost his political clout” in 1996 and retired from all government work, although he remained involved in charity work and continued to serve as chairman of China's Charity Association. In 2007, Yan became China's chief negotiator with Taiwan for a brief period. While Yan's promotion to vice minister of Civil Affairs indicated that he was “partially rehabilitated,” Ma reports that “observers” regarded his tenure as chief negotiator as “the famous liberal’s full rehabilitation.”Josephine Ma, \\"Top Taiwan negotiator chosen\\", South China Morning Post, October 30, 2007. Apart from these positions, Yan has maintained a “low profile” since his retirement. In November 2018, former Chinese primer Wen Jiabao visited him in hospital at his 87th birthday.

Raymond House was erected in 1897 in response to the popularity of Strong House, and was promptly designed by Francis R. Allen. Named after the second president of Vassar College, John Howard Raymond, this dormitory has five floors and is one of the residence halls that was paid for by the college in entirety. History Due to the immense success of Strong House, built just four years prior, Raymond House was erected in 1897. The dormitory was built at the same time as the nearby Rockefeller Hall. Unlike Strong and Davison Houses, which were funded by money donated to the college by trustee John D. Rockefeller, Raymond was paid for completely by Vassar College. Raymond was the third dormitory built on campus and was named after Vassar's second president, John Howard Raymond. The first cooperative living plan that the college ever offered was in Raymond from its construction until the 1942-1943 academic year. A $115 deduction in annual bill was given to students living in Raymond in exchange for performing housekeeping duties throughout the year. Architecture and features Designed by architect Francis R. Allen, Raymond House is the second of Vassar's five quadrangle dormitories. The red brick dormitory has five floors above ground, as well as a basement. There are two main entrances to the building, one on the east to the quadrangle, and one on the west to the road. The building's name, Raymond House, is inscribed over the dormitory's entrance. The staircase to the west entrance was entirely rebuilt in 2005. The roof of Raymond is made of green slate, and the building contains six chimneys; each with two wythes, or internal flues, of brick and with bluestone caps. Raymond has a current capacity of 200 students. References =Bibliography= External links * Vassar College panoramic tour — Select Residential from the righthand column, then Raymond House.

It was named by Matthew Flinders in memory of George Lewis who was one of the eight crew lost from a cutter that capsized sometime after being launched from HM Sloop Investigator to search for water on 21 February 1802. Since 2004, the island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Description Lewis Island is located approximately south-east of Port Lincoln, south of Little Island and north of Smith Island. The island has a maximum height of above sea level. Access is possible by boat on the island's north east coast during calm weather subject to tidal conditions, particularly in the channel separating it from Little Island. Formation, geology and oceanography Lewis Island was formed about 8400 years ago when sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The island's structure consists of granite outcrop finished with a capping of calcarenite. Unlike the neighbouring islands, the island's cap finishes in a peak at its southern end rather in lieu of a flat plateau. The island rises from the seabed at over a distance of within on its west, south and east faces. Flora and fauna =Terrestrial plants= As of 1996, the island was dominated by a shrubland of marsh saltbush on its deeper soil. It also supported at least 19 other species including sea celery, karkalla, grey samphire, Australian hollyhock, native juniper, austral stork's bill and pointed twinleaf. Disturbance of the island's surface by guano mining was suggested as the opportunity for weeds, particularly the African box thorn, to spread onto the island. =Terrestrial animals= As of 1996, a breeding colony of white-faced storm petrels was present on the higher southern section of the island. Also, the presence of \\"relatively high number\\" of silver gulls and Pacific gulls also suggested the possibility of the island being a breeding site for these species. Black-faced shags were also observed roosting at the island's water line. Reptiles are represented by marbled geckos, four-toed earless skinks and bull skink. As of 2013, the island is reported as being a breeding site for flesh-footed shearwaters. =Marine animals= As of 1996, observations of burrows immediately below the island's calcarenite capping suggests that it may have supported a colony of little penguins. As of 2007, a breeding population of Australian sea lions is reported to be present on the island. History The island was one of several first sighted by Europeans on Saturday, 20 February 1802, from HMS Investigator whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders entered what is now Spencer Gulf. Flinders named the island on Wednesday, 24 February 1802, in memory of George Lewis who lost his life, presumably drowned, along with seven other members of the crew on Sunday 21 February 1802 when one of HMS Investigator’s cutters capsized near Cape Catastrophe. Economic activity = Gauno= Lewis Island is one of the island sites from which guano was mined under licence from the South Australian Government prior to 1919. Protected areas status Since 30 September 2004, Lewis Island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Previously, it had been part of the Lincoln National Park. It originally obtained protected area status as a fauna reserve under the former Fauna Conservation Act 1964 in 1965 and gained status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967. As of December 2012, the waters surrounding the island are in the Thorny Passage Marine Park.

Description  UC CEISMIC is a project of the Digital Humanities department at the University of Canterbury, which focuses on principles of openness and collaboration. The project was founded by University of Canterbury Professor Paul Millar following the 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. It was inspired by the September 11 Digital Archive project developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. The purpose is to preserve earthquake-related material for future generations, researchers, and other communities that experience disasters. UC CEISMIC is a federated archive, providing public access to a wide range of earthquake-related content, including images, videos, interviews, stories and research material from many content partners. Metadata from each of the content partners is harvested by DigitalNZ and fed through to the federated search tool at ceismic.org.nz using DigitalNZ’s API. Content providers include UC QuakeStudies, Kete Christchurch, Ross Becker & Moira Fraser and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The total number of items publicly available is over 55,000. Lessons learned from the project are shared in chapter 10 of the book Crisis and Disaster in Japan and New Zealand: Actors, Victims and Ramifications.  Consortium  The UC CEISMIC Consortium includes core content contributors, as well as providing members of the programme board. It exists to ensure the programme is sustainable and well managed, and that the digital repository meets international standards.

It was built from 1914–1916 along with a jail. Together, the buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History The 1916 courthouse is the fifth to serve Covington County. The fourth courthouse was built of brick in 1896 in the center of Courthouse Square (which sits in front of the current courthouse). When the Central of Georgia Railway reached Andalusia in 1899, followed shortly by the Alabama and Florida Railroad, the town saw massive growth; population rose from 270 at the 1890 census to 2,480 by 1910. Having outgrown the prior courthouse, construction on a new courthouse began in 1914 and was completed in 1916. A jail was built behind the courthouse. See also: Architecture =Courthouse= The courthouse is designed in a Beaux-Arts style, common among public buildings in the early 20th century. The original portion of the building is rectangular and built of combed granite. Two wings were built onto the rear of the building, which were later enclosed in the middle. At the center of the façade is a hexastyle portico with Corinthian columns supporting a denticulated triangular pediment. A medallion with a clock adorns the pediment. Three entry doors, since replaced with modern medal-frame doors, are separated by Corinthian pilasters and topped with a simple lintel. The doors are flanked by semi-domed niches. On the second floor, three sets of three stacked windows sit above the entry. Windows on the front of the building outside the portico are sets of three one-over-one double-hung windows on each floor. The second floor windows each have decorative sills, and relief panels sit below. Windows on the east and west sides of the building, including the wing additions, have only two windows per set. Entries are finished similarly to the front, Corinthian pilasters supporting a bracketed cornice. The interior is centered on an octagonal atrium, with floors of white marble and walls of grey marble with gold leaf accents. A Y-shaped staircase at the rear of the atrium leads to a second floor gallery and offices. =Jail= The jail is a two-story, T-shaped, red brick structure with Italianate details. It features a parapet roof with a bracketed eave, simulating a mansard roof. Quoins on the building corners, dentils between the brackets, and decorative green and white tile panels provide ornamentation to the building. The main entry, facing the rear of the courthouse, is on a porch treated similarly to the rest of the building.

Life  Breymann's father was a pastor who, along with his fellow preachers, provided Adolf's earliest education. When his father was transferred to Watzum (near Wolfenbüttel), he entered the Gymnasium, where his artistic inclinations first expressed themselves. His father still desired a practical career for him and wanted him to study architecture, but he had no talent for mathematics. Sculpture was their second choice, so he was apprenticed to Theodor Strümpell (1818-1890), the Royal Sculptor of Brunswick. In 1859, he went to the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and continued his studies with Georg Ferdinand Howaldt. He entered the workshop of Johannes Schilling in 1861. After several years there, he was able to make a long-awaited study trip to Italy and remained for two years. In 1873, his statue of Henry the Lion was awarded a Silver Medal at the Universal Exposition in Vienna. He personally supervised the installation of two angels he had designed for Prince Albert's Mausoleum at Frogmore House. In 1878, he was stricken with an incurable stomach ailment and was taken to his family's home in Wolfenbüttel, where he died shortly thereafter. = Other selected works = * Siegesdenkmal (Victory Monument), 1881, in Braunschweig, which was completed by Robert Diez after Breymann's death. * Kriegerdenkmal (War Memorial), 1870/71 (unveiled 1876), in Göttingen on the Bahnhofstraße, by the \\"Alleetor\\".

He directed television broadcasts of 10 Super Bowls, 18 NBA Finals, 5 Stanley Cup finals and Olympic hockey matches. He won eight Emmy Awards for his directing. He was born on June 12, 1935, in Newark, New Jersey. After graduating from Weequahic High School, he studied broadcasting at the University of Alabama, where he called football games for the school radio station. He graduated in 1957 and wanted to pursue a career in the communication industry, but believed he did not have the right voice to be a broadcaster. Grossman worked as an usher for the Ed Sullivan Theater for several years before obtaining employment at the local CBS station, Channel 2. In 1963, he became a production assistant for CBS Sports. He was the chief director of broadcasting NBA games during the early 1970s and soon became the main N.F.L. director. Grossmann innovated using music at the break of basketball games, and after he played The Hustle by Van McCoy, McCoy sent him a gold record in thanks of his promotion. Grossman began working alongside John Madden and Pat Summerall on CBS in 1981, and their partnership lasted 21 seasons. Madden insisted that Grossman and producer Bob Stenner watch coaches’ films of the NFL teams, which helped Grossman choose the best shots to pair with Madden's commentary. Madden credits him for being the first director to widen the camera shot to incorporate footage of outside linebackers. He created these broadcasts out of a production truck crammed with television monitors that formed a screen shot. During a Giants-Bengals game in 1991, Stenner and Grossman made 1,100 decisions about camera angles and the like. Summerall and Madden decided to move to Fox Sports after that network acquired broadcasting rights to NFL games in 1994, and Grossman followed suit. He retired in 2012. That year, the Elite Football League of India hired Grossman to teach its camera crews how to cover the American sport. “There were some guys who couldn’t follow the players,” he said. “I said, ‘Get the kicker,’ and some of them didn’t know where to find him.”. Grossman died on April 2, 2014 in Boca Raton, Florida. The stated cause of death was cancer. He was survived by his wife, Faithe; sons Bobby and Dean; daughters, Jodi Grossman Rose and Bari Grossman Rosenholtz; and eight grandchildren; Alexa, Jordyn, Kaylie, Paige, Adam, Reese, Eliya, and Zachary. John Madden said about Grossman: “Sandy became like a defensive coordinator, the way he looked at stuff. If they go slot, if they bunch their receivers on one side and they break off — he had a plan for everything, and when it happens, boom, boom, boom, you’re right there. Sandy took the knowledge he got from the film and transferred it to the cameramen, who carried it over to the game.” References External links * Category:American directors Category:1935 births Category:2014 deaths Category:People from Newark, New Jersey Category:University of Alabama alumni Category:Weequahic High School alumni ","title":"Sandy Grossman"},{"id":"42431400","text":"Max Landa (; 24 April 1873 – 8 November 1933; born Max Landau) was a Russian- born Austrian silent film and stage actor.

The party represented interests of zamindars (land owners), and contested the elections of 1951-52. The party was formed to oppose the Indian National Congress policy of abolition of the zamindari system. The idea to set up a conservative political party emerged in early 1950. An 'All India Democratic Convention' was organised in Lucknow on 14–15 May 1950, which sought to highlist property ownership rights as a civil liberties issue, and this conference set up two committees. A seven-member team was charged with drafting the constitution of the new party; this group would collaborate with a 28-member 'Programme Committee'. Moreover, the conference named regional organisers to build up branches of the new party. At the conference Sir Jagdish Prasad (who had organised the event) spoke of the need for a pro- Western foreign policy as integral component to resist communism and land reform. However, these committees and organisers proved ineffectual and no real progress was made to found a political party as such. A zamindar conference was held in August 1950, and debated the issue of setting up a political party on similar lines as the Lucknow convention. By November 1950 Jagdish Prasad took lead in the party-building process and announced a conference to take place on 19 December 1950. The group of Jagdish Prasad began to be known informally as the 'Praja Party'. The Praja Party was formally founded at a conference of the Zamindar Union on 5–6 April 1951. Jagdish Prasad was appointed president and Guru Narain Seth was named secretary of the new party. Jagdish Prasad was given the authority to appoint a 30-member Working Committee of the party, which would oversee District Electoral Boards. A 250-member State Council was to be set up, with each district of Uttar Pradesh having at least four delegates. The conference declared that the goal would be to recruit 2.5 million levy-paying party members. Whilst the April 1951 conference had set out ambitious goals for the new party, followed by a number of party meetings and an agitation tour of Guru Narain Seth and the Raja of Oel, its hopes were soon dashed. Extensive powers had been vested in Jagdish Prasad, but his health was increasingly weak. In his absence Guru Narain Seth emerged as the main leader of the party. Many zamindars opted to not support the party and it found itself unable to field the number of candidates it had set out to do. A party meeting was held in Lucknow in January 1952. The party won two seats in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in the 1951-52 election, Birendra Bikram Singh in Nanpara East and Virendra Shah in Kalpi-cum-Jalaun North. The party had fielded a total of 55 candidates, who together mustered 301,322 votes (1.80% of the total votes in the state).Election Commission of India.

This area takes in the City's most popular shopping street on calle Colon, Marques del Turia Avenue and Russafa. It is also the most important commercial area, where popular department stores and shops are located. Moreover, it is very close to important points like the Mercado de Colón, the City Hall, Paz street, etc. It also has excellent public transport communication. Architecture and design The Eixample is characterized by long straight streets, a strict grid pattern crossed by wide avenues, and square blocks with chamfered corners (named illes in Catalan, manzanas in Spanish). Facade of the North Station The Bullring has been the centre of Valencia's bull fighting. It was built in 1841. It is a large, impressive structure in the style of a Roman Coliseum but employing Doric ornament. With only the ring itself measuring 52 m in diameter, it is much larger as a whole, with 4 levels of colonnades and balustrades. Access to the interior is via the Bullfighting Museum only. When there are no bull-fights the bullring hosts an occasional fair, concert or circus, and closes the rest of the time. The North Station () is the main railway station, 200m from the town hall and has connections with Metrovalencia lines 3 and 5, and the city bus network. It was built in 1917 with Neo-Gothic influence in the structure, it hosts an entire caleidoscope of typically Valencian mosaics and ceramics on the themes of Valencian countryside, making it a glimpse into the local culture. It was declared Good of Cultural Heritage in 1987. The main railway station is built in modernisme (the Spanish version of Art Nouveau) style. Mercado de Colón (Columbus Market) Mercado de Colón is another market shown off by Valencia. A gorgeous elaborate structure, spacious modernity, sort of simplified a-la- Valencia Gaudi, with a nave shooting into the sky and the colourful decorations depicting Valencian country life with Valencian ceramics. The architecture is so interesting it is surprising that the market was built in 1914, it is quite avant-garde for those time. The market is plenty of souvenir shops and coffees, and also hosts concerts every few days. Neighbourhoods There are three administrative neighborhoods: *Pla del Remei: Porta de la Mar Pla del Remei is a popular area to live in Valencia and a luxury location. Its proximity to the administrative center of the city (the Town Hall), the Turia river and Colon. Colon is one of the main streets in the city center. It is also the most important commercial area, where popular department stores and shops are located. Moreover, it is very close to important points like the Mercado de Colón, Paz street, etc. The Porta de la Mar square is a vital point in the Centre of Valencia. It is located between the River Turia and the La Glorieta gardens, near the Calle Colon and very close to the Calle de la Paz *Gran Via Gran Via Marqués del Turia Gan Via Marqués del Turia is the most expensive residential area of Valencia. It is placed in the very centre of the city and offers numerous shops and services, including schools. Canovas is the vibrant mainstream nightlife hub of Valencia. That is to say it is preferred by people who are not after the alternative or underground, who, after a week in the office, want to pass a noisy weekend in \\"normal pop\\" and surrounded by a general Valencian crowd dressed for the weekend nightlife. Canovas is a lot more mainstream than Carmen. It is a vibrant and lively area located very close to the centre. It is very compact - most places are located on the main street (Calle serranos), although there are also a few scattered between Gran via Marques del Turia and avenida del Reino de Valencia. The main drag to the north of the circular Plaza de Canovas hosts a few vibrant disco-bars where you can dance until 4am with free entry. Salamanca Street to the south of the Plaza has a lower key pub life with international pubs and lounge cocktail bars. Canovas nightlife offers some of the most typically Valencian places, as well as a more trendy / cosmopolitan selection. A good number of venues will play solely Spanish pop, also known as \\"musica Espanola\\" or, more derogatory by those who are too cool for it, \\"pachanga\\". It is basically soft happy rock of local origin. This will usually be mixed with the latest (and sometimes by far not so latest) foreign pop and commercial electronic dance that has been in charts. This music will attract a predominantly local public of mixed age. *Ruzafa Street lighting in Carrer de Sueca (from junction with Literato Azorín), a small part of Ruzafa's Falles Founded as a country estate by a Moorish ruler, Russafa was an independent town until the 1870s and today lies just five minutes outside the historic centre, the Barrio del Carme (Ciutat Vella). The word Ruzafa has Arab origins and means \\"garden\\". Having undergone a renaissance in recent years, it has become a hotbed of dining, shopping, and cultural activity, especially of the more alternative sort, so the type of people who helped revive El Carme not so long ago are now moving here to escape the tourists. And the resulting mix of young creatives, the older folks who've been here forever, the African immigrants down at the public telephone centres and the Chinese market vendors is one of the great things about the neighbourhood these days. Main church – historically Baroque, since it was built in the 15th century, but fairly restrained for all that - the Iglesia de San Valero, and dubbed the “cathedral of Russafa.” Ruzafa, one of the old parts of the city, is located behind the North Station (, ), and is particularly famous for being a meeting place for the most modern bohemian people. Many of the old houses and palaces have been rebuilt and adapted as bars or pubs, restaurants. Many of this music bars and pubs have the attraction of including live music performances (rock, jazz, blues...). Ruzafa has overtaken Carmen as the city's hippest area. It is a working-class, ethnically diverse quarter that is being colonised by young creatives – Valencia's version of Brixton and Candem in London. It is full of vintage clothes shops, bike shops, homeware stores which sells work by contemporary Valencian artist, art gallery/wine shop. Restaurants range from traditional tapas and bocadillos to oysters, South American restaurants, and fusion. The park on Plaza Manuel Granero is a green space in Ruzafa, where kids play in a Wendy house, on swings and slides, or kick a football around, while adults beef up their muscles on the machines in the open-air gym or take a beer in the dappled sunlight outside Bar el Parque. Ruzafa's Market Valencia has a bit over 800,000 inhabitants, of which some 25,000 live in Russafa. Ruzafa district in its closest area to Reino de Valencia avenue, and offers many advantages: it is very centric, very easy to locate, it has a comfortable and very quick access to the old river Turia gardens and it has all kind of services, not only shops, bars and restaurants, but also schools, banks, medical centres, etc. An extra advantage is being so close to the Mercado de Ruzafa, specially for those fresh food lovers. The “mercat de Russafa” (Ruzafa's market) is more than a market. It is the center of the economical and cultural life of this neighborhood.

The key statute is the LGA. It states the purpose of local government as being to enable democratic local decision-making and action by, and on behalf of, communities.Local Government Act 2002, section 10(1)(a) It requires local authorities to act in an open, transparent and democratically accountable manner.Local Government Act 2002, section 14(1)(a)(i) Participation in local government Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) outlines the democratic rights of citizens, which include rights to take part in the conduct of public affairs and to vote and be elected at periodic elections. The electoral rights of New Zealand citizens are further outlined in section 12 of NZBORA. However, these rights only relate to parliamentary elections. New Zealand citizens have a right to participate in the conduct of local government in two direct ways: by voting in triennial elections, or standing for election to a local body. There are also opportunities provided under the LGA for citizens to indirectly exercise democratic rights. =Representation and participation= Research indicates that there is not a diverse range of candidates seeking election to local authorities in New Zealand. The numbers of women, Māori, other ethnic minorities and young people standing for election are low.http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/Local_Authority_Candidates_Survey_2007.pdf/$file/Local_Authority_Candidates_Survey_2007.pdf Voter participation in local elections is also relatively low, with turnout in the 2013 election being particularly low, prompting consideration of how to increase participation, possibly through the introduction of online voting.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=11139617 Māori representation Minority rights are an integral part of international human rights law. Efforts have been made by central government and other organisations to increase Māori participation in local government. The LGA specifically requires local authorities to maintain and improve opportunities for Māori to contribute to local government decision-making processes, and to facilitate participation by Māori in decision-making.Local Government Act 2002, section 4 In October 2010, the Human Rights Commission (HRC) produced a report that looked at Māori representation and participation in local government.Maori Representation in Local Government, The Continuing Challenge - Human Rights Commission The publication of the Report was prompted by the Government's failure to adopt a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance that three councillors representing Māori sit on the new Auckland Council, established in November 2010.Maori Representation in Local Government, The Continuing Challenge - Human Rights Commission, page 22 The HRC was particularly critical of the decision given Māori representation in local government was one of the top ten race relations priorities for 2010.Maori Representation in Local Government, The Continuing Challenge - Human Rights Commission, page 2 In 2004, the Bay of Plenty Regional Council (Environment Bay of Plenty (EBOP)) introduced direct Māori representation via a system that operates on the same basis as that providing for Māori seats in Parliament.Bay of Plenty Regional Council (Maori Constituency Empowering Act) 2001, section 6 Māori voters in the region can choose to participate in local body elections as a voter on either the general or Māori electorate rolls. Once elected, Māori councillors have the same roles and responsibilities as other councillors. Despite the system and attempts to increase Māori representation, the number of Māori elected has remained disproportionately low compared with the region's total Māori population.Maori Representation in Local Government, The Continuing Challenge - Human Rights Commission, page 9 Since the passage of the Local Electoral Amendment Act 2002, all New Zealand councils have had the option of establishing Māori constituencies or wards, by resolution of council, challengeable by a poll of all voters.Local Electoral Act 2001, section 19Z A number of councils have considered the option; none have taken it up. =Environment Canterbury legislation= In 2010 the government enacted the Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Act 2010) to affect the replacement of Canterbury Regional Council's democratically elected representatives with government- appointed Commissioners.Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Act 2010, section 10 The changes to Environment Canterbury (ECan) were made based on a perceived need for improvement of water management in the region. The decision was controversial, as it was largely perceived as removing local government democratic voting rights. Such rights have been described as \\"ingrained in the national psyche and a legitimate expectation of the citizenry.\\" PA Joseph, \\"Environment Canterbury Legislation\\" [2010] NZLJ 193 The ECan Act also removed the access of Canterbury citizens to the Environment Court for proposed changes to the Regional Policy Statement and regional plans, and in respect of applications for Water Consent Orders.Environment Canterbury (Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management) Act 2010, section 52 The right of access to justice is guaranteed under Article 14 of the ICCPR, and in section 27 of NZBORA. The implications of this decision were controversial, with public law academic Professor Philip Joseph questioning, \\"why should citizens in the Canterbury region be forced to accept lesser rights of local government than other citizens?\\"PA Joseph, \\"Environment Canterbury Legislation\\" [2010] NZLJ 193 =Indirect democracy: decision-making requirements= The LGA states, “A local authority should make itself aware of, and should have regard to, the views of all its communities.”Local Government Act 2002, section 78(1) Section 78 of the LGA specifically requires local authorities to have regard, in making decisions, to the views and preferences of persons likely to be affected by or have an interest in the matter. However, under that provision alone local authorities are not required to undertake any consultation process or procedure. A number of principles of consultation are outlined in the Act.Local Government Act 2002, section 82 These focus on the need to encourage people who may be affected by, or have an interest in decisions, to present their views. Human rights response to local government reform In early 2012, the National Government announced a programme of local government reform, “Better Local Government.” The first phase of review culminated in the passing of the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2012 (the Amendment Act). The Amendment Act made a number of changes to local government, including altering the statutory purpose of local government and giving greater powers of intervention to the Minister of Local Government. The Bill introduced a new purpose statement for local governmentLocal Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2012, section 7 that excluded provision for promotion and protection of four previously listed community well-beings; social, cultural, environmental and economic well- being.Local Government Act 2002, section 10 The new purpose statement was proposed as a means of helping to clearly define the role of councils and assist them to plan and prioritise activity. Many perceived the amendment as a response to a perception of overspending by local authorities. Key stakeholders made submissions to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee criticising the Amendment Act. Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) was concerned about the impact of the changes on local democracy. In particular, it expressed concern that the Bill undermined democratic accountability of elected members to their communities, and gave the Minister too much power vis-à-vis elected representatives.Local Government New Zealand Submission on Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill 2012 The HRC was concerned that the extension of Ministerial discretion would erode the autonomy of elected representatives, and would “conflict with a central purpose of local government which is to enable democratic local decision- making and action by, and on behalf of, communities.”Human Rights Commission Submission on Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill 2012 The HRC also expressed to the Select Committee its concern that the new purpose statement did not seek to supplement the existing purposes of local government, with their references to community well-being, but to replace them.Human Rights Commission Submission on Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill 2012 The Commission stated it considered reference to the well-beings as important for clarifying and confirming the role and responsibilities of local government in relation to economic, social and cultural rights. The Commission's submission referred to New Zealand's ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and consequent obligations to respect, protect and fulfill related rights. It stated that it considered “any erosion of recognition of these human rights obligations risks undermining New Zealand’s international commitments.”Human Rights Commission Submission on Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill 2012 The Commission specifically recommended that the four well-beings be retained alongside the proposed new purpose statement. Local government and NZBORA NZBORA applies only to acts done “by any person or body in the performance of any public function, power, or duty conferred or imposed on that person or body by or pursuant to law”,New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, section 3(b) in addition to the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. This means NZBORA is applicable to acts done by local government bodies, since law confers functions, powers and duties on them. This means local authorities must guarantee all of the rights contained in NZBORA for citizens. It means local authorities must ensure all citizens are guaranteed the right to be free from discrimination on the grounds listed in section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 (HRA). A local authority will act or omit to act in a manner inconsistent with section 19 NZBORA if it limits the right to freedom from discrimination, and this is not, under section 5 of NZBORA, a justified limitation on that right. Local government and ICESCR rights Human rights instruments guarantee the right to be free from discrimination on ethnic and cultural grounds.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Articles 2(1), 18 and 27; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 2(2) The HRC has engaged in relationships with local authorities as part of its own work to promote human rights and encourage harmonious race relations, through initiatives such as the New Zealand Diversity Action Programme. The HRC through its engagement with local communities has sought to demonstrate its belief in the value of local partners addressing local issues and fostering local communities’ well-being on behalf of central government. The HRC worked alongside Nelson City and Tasman District Councils to develop a reporting system for local incidents of racism. Article 6 of ICESCR concerns rights to work. The Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs (MTFJ) is a local government initiative addressing issues relating to employment and livelihood. MTFJ was founded in 2000, when 200,000 New Zealanders remained unemployed, despite 2000 being the deadline set by the 1994 Prime Ministerial Taskforce on Employment, which had a goal that no New Zealander would be out of work or training for more than 6 months.Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs Now a national network of 100% of Mayors, MTFJ has a vision that all young people under 25 be engaged in appropriate education, training, work or positive activities in their communities.Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs MTFJ decided that communities, led by their Mayors, could play a crucial role in fostering youth employment opportunities by working with local employers, iwi and training institutions. Article 15 of ICESCR outlines the right of all citizens to take part in cultural life. The LGA makes it an obligation on all territorial authorities to provide free library membership to all community members.Local Government Act 2002, section 142 Article 12 of ICESCR recognises the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. There is a focus on the right to health in New Zealand's system of local government. In 2001, legislation created 21 District Health Boards (DHBs) with responsibility for the oversight of health and disability services within communities.New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, section 19 There are now 20 DHBs. DHB representatives are democratically appointed in triennial elections. Local government and human rights internationally Local government is one of 15 thematic issues currently being considered by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee (the Committee). In 2014, the Committee at its Twelfth Session recalled the Human Rights Council's Resolution 24/2.Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights - Local Government and Human Rights This Resolution requested that the Committee prepare, from within existing resources, a research-based report on the role of local government in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Resolution required the Committee to look at human rights mainstreaming in local administration and public services, and to compile best practices and main challenges for local government and human rights in its report. The result of the Resolution is that the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner is now engaged in a research-based review of how local government bodies around the world promote and protect human rights, and how they could improve in this area. =International Council on Human Rights Policy= The International Council on Human Rights Policy (ICHRP) is currently undertaking research as to how human rights policy can help local government bodies become more effective and legitimate. It has expressed a view that while legally states are primarily responsible for enforcing human rights standards (because of having ratified them), accountability extends to all levels of government and institutions with devolved authority.Local Government and Human Rights: Doing Good Service, ICHRP, page 1 The ICHRP's research has found few local authorities use human rights explicitly. It has suggested the human rights framework is relevant to local government since decentralisation of government activities increases access to and availability of public services, which relate to economic and social rights.

The subtitle of the (translated) work already explains, that it wants to offer a \\"complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing.\\" The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design. In the preface Armengaud characterized this field: :\\"INDUSTRIAL DESIGN is destined to become a universal language ; for in our material age of rapid transition, from abstract, to applied, Science — in the midst of our extraordinary tendency towards the perfection of the means of conversion, or manufacturing production — it must soon pass current in every land.Armengaud et al. (1851) The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design, Preface, p. ii-iv Armengaud was convinced that the study of Industrial Design is an \\"indispensably necessary as the ordinary rudiments of learning. It ought to form an essential feature in the education of young persons for whatever profession or employment they may intend to select, as the great business of their lives; for without a knowledge of drawing, no scientific work, whether relating to Mechanics, Agriculture, or Manufactures, can be advantageously studied.\\" About the mission of the Practical Draughtsman’s Book of Industrial Design, Armengaud summarized: :\\"It is intended to furnish gradually developed lessons in Geometrical Drawing, applied directly to the various branches of the Industrial Arts : comprehending Linear Design proper ; Isometrical Perspective, or the study of Projections ; the Drawing of Toothed Wheels and Eccentrics ; with Shadowing and Colouring ; Oblique Projections ; and the study of parallel and exact Perspective ; each division being accompanied by special applications to the extensive ranges of Mechanics, Architecture, Foundry-Works, Carpentry, Joinery, Metal Manufactures generally, Hydraulics, the construction of Steam Engines, and Mill-Work. In its compilation, the feeble attraction generally offered to students in elementary form has been carefully considered; and after every geometrical problem, a practical example of its application has been added, to facilitate its comprehension and increase its value.\\" One of the examples published in the 1860 edition was the design of the Nicholas Chain Bridge, designed by Charles Blacker Vignoles and pictured by John Cooke Bourne.See The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design, 1860, Plate 45 (online)  Legacy  The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design was published mid 19th century in a time that a new type of technical manuals for students emerged, which contained instructions for self-teaching for the drawing of technical objects. This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Two popular and influential writers of these works in Britain were Robert Scott Burn and William S. Binns. According to Romans (2005) in this genre The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design, might have been the most influential publication. Later in the 19th century a whole range of manuals on technical drawings were published. In the United States another notable art educator and author of drawing books was Walter Smith (art educator) (1836 - 1886), who had significant influence of the American industrial art education.Maurice Rickards, Michael Twyman (2000) The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: : A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian. p. 127  Selected publications  ;French publicationsOtto Henri Lorenz, Daniel Jordell, Henri Stein.

Today, a human rights-based approach is viewed by many as essential to achieving development goals. Historically, the \\"minority clauses\\" guaranteeing civil and political rights and religious and cultural toleration to minorities were significant acts emerging from the peace process of World War I relating to a peoples rights to self-determination. Overseen by the League of Nations Council the process allowed petitions from individuals and was monitored under the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice. The 'clauses' are an important early signpost in both the human rights and development histories. Human rights history The initial impetus of the current human rights legal regime and movement was in reaction to the Nazi atrocities of World War II. Human Rights are importantly referred to in the United Nations Charter in both the Preamble and under Article 1 though only sparingly. The preamble of the UN Charter reaffirms \\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women\\". Article 2(4) however prohibits the use of force and has ever since be used to block humanitarian actions though Chapter VII provides for Security Council enforcement measures. The Charter established the Economic and Social council which set up the UN Human Rights Commission now the United Nations Human Rights Council. Chapter VI of the Charter entitled International Economic and Social Cooperation provides Article 55 (c) the \\"universal respect for, and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion\\". Article 56 requires States to take joint and separate actions in cooperation with the UN to achieve their mutual aims. Human rights are inherent in the progress of economic social and cultural goals and therefore to Human Development as such. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 is not binding law and reflects an unwillingness of Allied powers to codify an International Bill of Rights where fears that colonial interests would be negatively affected were still influential. Human rights are viewed as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. René Cassin one of the architects of the declaration conceived the rights as divided into 4 pillars supporting the roof a temple, \\"dignity, liberty, equality, and brotherhood\\". Articles 1 & 2 comprising the first pillar relates to human 'dignity' shared by all individuals regardless of religion, creed, ethnicity, religion, or sex. Articles 100-19 the second pillar invokes first-generation rights civil 'liberties' fought for during the Enlightenment. Articles 20-26 the third pillar are second-generation rights, relating to political, social and economic equity, championed during the Industrial Revolution. Articles 27-28 the fourth pillar are third-generation rights associated with community and national solidarity advocated from the late 19th. These pillars support the roof of the temple Articles 29-30 representing the conditions in society under which the rights of individuals can be realized Certain civil and political rights converging with development aims include Article 2 which entitles everyone to rights with distinction as to race, colour, sex, or language; Article 3 the rights to life, liberty and security of person; Article 8 the right to effective remedy and Article 9 the right to an independent tribunal; Article 19 entails freedom of expression and Article 20 freedom of peaceful assembly; Article 21 is the right to participate in government and Article 26 provides rights to education. Article 28 importantly signifies ' Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration can be fully realized. The right calls for enforcement mechanisms and echoes Chapter VII of the UN Charter permitting security council intervention for human rights violations on a scale that threatens world peace. The UN Charter allows for a limit to state sovereignty were Human Rights are threatened. Two critiques of the declaration are that it did not make political rights dependent on multi-party democracy and there is a lack of protection for ethnic minorities, protecting individual rights do not necessarily protect group rights. The nexus between grave human rights violations and international security is significant as atrocities within a sovereign state are of concern to international law, when they upset neighbouring states in a manner disturbing to world peace. Article 55 of the Charter states \\"promotion of the respect for human rights helps create conditions of stability\\" and \\"recognition of ... equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation ... of peace in the world\\". Taken together the United Nations Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights provide a legal mechanism which may challenge the sovereign rights of States to oppress people within their own jurisdiction The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (VDPA) reaffirms the right to development under part 1, paragraph 10 and was adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights1993. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was created by the declaration and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) under resolution 48/121. The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development sought solutions to poverty, the growing gap between industrialized and developing countries and environmental problems. All elements were accorded equal weight and the declaration defined the rights and obligations of nations in 27 principles and recognizes \\"the polluter pays\\" as its guiding tenet. The Action 2 Plan of Action and work plan stems from the UN Secretary General report Strengthening of the United Nations; An Agenda for Further Change. Integrating human rights into humanitarian, development and peace keeping work throughout the UN system. The plan introduces the UN Common Learning Package and a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) which builds on the experience of all agencies. The emphasis of the HRBA is based on common understanding and requires that 1) all programmes of development co-operation, policies and technical assistance should further the realisation of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments; 2) human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process and 3) development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of 'duty-bearers' to meet their obligations and/or of 'rights-holders' to claim their rights. The major human rights principles guiding the programme are regarded as universality and inalienability; indivisibility; interdependence and interrelatedness; non- discrimination and equality; participation and inclusion; accountability and the rule of law. The Declaration on the Right to Development The Declaration on the Right to Development was proclaimed by the UNGA under resolution 41/128 in 1986. with only the United States voting against the resolution and eight absentions. The United Nations recognizes no hierarchy of rights, and all human rights are equal and interdependent, the right to development then is not an umbrella right that encompasses or trumps other rights nor is it a right with the status of a mere political aspiration. The Right to development is regarded as an inalienable human right which all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development. The right includes 1) people- centred development, identifying \\"the human person\\" as the central subject, participant and beneficiary of development; 2) a human rights-based approach specifically requiring that development is to be carried out in a manner \\"in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized\\"; 3) participation, calling for the \\"active, free and meaningful participation\\" of people in development; 4) equity, underlining the need for \\"the fair distribution of the benefits\\" of development; 5) non-discrimination, permitting \\"no distinction as to race, sex, language or religion\\"; and 6) self-determination, the declaration integrates self-determination, including full sovereignty over natural resources, as a constituent element of the right to development. The right is a third generation right viewed as a group right such that it is owed to communities as opposed to an individual right applying to individuals \\"It is a people, not an individual, that is entitled to the right to self-determination and to national and global development\\" One obstacle to the right is in the difficult process of defining 'people' for the purposes of self- determination. Additionally, most developing states voice concerns about the negative impacts of aspects of international trade, unequal access to technology and crushing debt burden and hope to create binding obligations to facilitate development as a way of improving governance and the rule of law. The right to development embodies three additional attributes which clarify its meaning and specify how it may reduce poverty 1) The first is a holistic approach which integrates human rights into the process 2) an enabling environment offers fairer terms in the economic relations for developing countries and 3) the concept of social justice and equity involves the participation of the people of countries involved and a fair distribution of developmental benefits with special attention given to marginalised and vulnerable members of the population. =Sources= The right was first recognised in 1981 under Article 22 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and subsequently in the Arab Charter on Human Rights. It is now recognised in numerous international instruments, with the Rio Declaration asserting under principle 1 \\"Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development, they are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature\\". Other instruments include the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action the United Nations Millennium Declaration,, Millennium Declaration the 2002 Monterrey Consensus,Montery Report the 2005 World Summit, Outcome Document and the 2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples., DRIP =Duty bearers= Article 3 provides that \\"States have the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development\\" and this encompasses three main levels 1) States acting collectively in global and regional partnerships; 2) States acting individually as they adopt and implement policies that affect persons not strictly within their jurisdiction and 3) States acting individually as they formulate national development policies and programmes affecting persons within their jurisdiction. Article 6 importantly provides \\"States should undertake, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to development, echoing Article 2.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) which states that \\"each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources. Furthermore, the Maastricht Guidelines on violations of economic, social and cultural rights provides that a state is in violation of the Covenant if it fails to allocate the maximum of its available resources to realizing human rights. =UN mechanisms= The Intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to Development was established in 1998 and meets once a year reporting to the Human Rights Council (HRC) and the General Assembly. Its mandate is to globally (a) monitor and review progress made in the promotion and implementation of the right to development as elaborated in the Declaration, providing recommendations and analyzing obstacles to its full enjoyment; (b) to review reports and other information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, relevant international and non-governmental organizations, on the relationship between their activities and the right to development; and (c) to present a report to the HRC including advice to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) The mandate of the High Commissioner (HC) and the OHCHR as stated in resolution 48/141 4 (c) seeks \\"to promote and protect the realization of the right to development and to enhance support from relevant bodies of the UN system for this purpose.\\" The right to development is highlighted in the General Assembly and the HRC which both request the UN Secretary-General and the HC to report annually on progress in the implementation of the right to development including activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development between Member States, development agencies and international development, financial and trade institutions. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted by consensus a resolution on the Right to Development 1998/24 .\\" Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and, in particular, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development\\". The Commission recommended a follow up mechanism consisting of an open ended working group (OEWG) and an Independent Expert, Arjun Kumar Sengupta and Indian economist who was selected to the post . The purpose of the working group was to monitor and review the progress of the Independent Expert and report back to the Commission. The Independent Expert presented to the working group at each of its sessions a study on the current state of progress in the implementation of the right to development. Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) were first introduced in 1999 as a condition of eligibility for debt relief among Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). The rationale of the process was to promote national and local 'ownership' of macroeconomic policies ensuring that they were sufficiently adapted to relieving poverty in the poorest countries. The process represents an embrace of the values of participation and transparency in the formulation of macroeconomic policy, and thus has the potential to shape the content of these policies in order to meet the needs of the poor. (PRSP's) are prepared by member countries in a participatory process with domestic stakeholders and development partners like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund. These are updated every three years with progress reports describing the country's macroeconomic, structural and social policies and programs over a three-year or longer period to promote growth and reduce poverty. Interim PRSPs (I-PRSPs) summarize the current knowledge and analysis of a country's poverty situation, describe the existing poverty reduction strategy, and lay out the process for producing a fully developed PRSP in a participatory fashion. Country documents, along with the accompanying IMF/World Bank Joint Staff Assessments (JSAs), are available on their websites by agreement with the member country as a service to users of the IMF and World Bank websites. The introduction of PRSPs was a recognition by the IMF and the World Bank of the importance of country ownership of reform programs as well as the need for a greater focus on poverty reduction. PRSPs aim to provide the crucial link between national public actions, donor support, and the development outcomes needed to meet the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are centered on halving poverty between 1990 and 2015. PRSPs guide policies associated concessional lending as well as debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Five core principles underlie the approach. Poverty reduction strategies should be 1) country-driven, promoting national ownership of strategies through broad-based participation of civil society; 2) result- oriented and focused on outcomes that will benefit the poor; 3) comprehensive in recognizing the multidimensional nature of poverty; 4) partnership- oriented, involving coordinated participation of development partners (government, domestic stakeholders, and external donors); and 5) based on a long-term perspective for poverty reduction. In 2001 The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights commissioned the 2001 guidelines for the integration of human rights into poverty reduction Strategies which were further developed in the 2005 guidelines The Commissioner in a concept note also states that the human rights framework is \\"a useful tool strengthening the accountability and equity dimensions of the Poverty Reductions Strategies. In 2008 specific strategies were introduced in regards to Poverty Reduction and Health that affirmed the place of Human Rights in the achievement of the Millennium goals.  Human rights and the Millennium Development Goals In September 2000, world leaders made commitments in the Millennium Declaration UN resolution 55/2 on topics that included peace, security, human rights, the environment and development targets which were later configured into the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These goals are sets of development targets that center on halving poverty and improving the welfare of the world's poorest by 2015. The IMF contributes to the goals through advice, technical assistance, lending to countries and mobilizing donor support. The Millennium Declaration considers six fundamental values necessary for international relations 1) freedom to raise children in dignity, freedom from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression and injustice, including democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people. 2) equality, no individual or nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development. 3) solidarity, global inequities must be managed to distribute costs and burdens fairly in accordance with the principles of equity and social justice, while those who benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most. 4) tolerance, differences within and between societies should not be feared or repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity, while cultures of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be promoted. 5) Respect for nature. Prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources, through sustainable development and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption must be changed in the interest of the future welfare of our descendants and 6) shared responsibility, responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally. Human rights have played a limited role in influencing MDG planning, though there are strong similarities between them and the content of the MDGs which resemble many economic and social rights. MDGs provide benchmarks for economic and social rights, while human rights strategies offer enhanced legitimacy, equity and sustainability to the MDG policies. The Millennium Declaration substantially refers to human rights and leaders have committed themselves to respecting recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development. Economic, social and cultural rights, the rights of women, migrant, minorities, and participation are all emphasized in the declaration yet the pursuit of the MDGs has been in isolation from it. MDG targets are not sufficiently focused on inequalities within a country and human rights instruments require a minimum core level of economic, social and cultural rights to be immediately realized for all and for all discrimination in the exercise of rights to be eliminated. Inequalities within countries lead to violent conflict and countries focus on the relatively well-off among the poor in order to reach a particular MDG target. The MDGs are accompanied by 18 targets measured by 60 indicators though the relationship between the goals, targets and indicators is not always clear. A range of activities are promoted as a means of achieving the MDGs such as tailoring the MDGs to the regional, national and local context and undertaking national needs assessments and monitoring progress through yearly MDG reports. Non-State actors also carry human rights responsibilities with at least a minimum duty of not interfering with human rights such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises provides a complaint system for violations by companies. A specific critique of MDGs is that they place emphasis on the mobilization of financial resources and technical solutions, but less on transforming power relations that are partially responsible for levels of poverty. The World Bank has observed that in many situations the real barriers to progress on the MDGs are social and political. The realization of human rights therefore may be a precondition to fulfilling development goals =Poverty= The present global institutional order is foreseeably associated with avoidable severe poverty and its impositions may constitute an ongoing human rights violation. There are many measures of poverty and it is now regarded that poverty is more than the measure of a low income. Amartya Sen argues that individual physical characteristics, environmental and social conditions as well as behavioural expectations all play a role. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defines poverty as \\"human conditions characterised by chronic deprivation of resources capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living\\" Jeffrey Sachs place poverty in an historical trajectory with the ending of slavery, colonialism, segregation and apartheid but do not link these human rights movements to current causes of poverty elimination. Policy economists discuss minimum standards, transparency, and participation unrelated to the human rights framework where poverty is seen to increases social wastage distorting economic and service delivery outcomes. Joseph Stiglitz in Making Globalization Work refers to a gap between economic and political globalization and that a growth oriented economic analysis disregarding the impact of income on the realization of rights such as health or education and focusing instead on making choices in a world of limited resources. There is debate whether attention to civil and political rights makes way for economic development or whether economic growth is more likely to create institutional and political development. The G-20 2005 Statement on Global Development Issues does not mention human rights or human development and good governance is referred to only in relation to economic policy. In the 2009 the Global Plan for Recovery and Reform also fails to mention human rights or human development. The ingrained philosophy is a world economy based on market principles and effective regulation. A strand of economics embraces human rights language such as the International Development Ethics Association who apply a normative approach to development theories. The Mérida Declaration provides \\"the absolute respect for the dignity of the human person regardless of gender, ethnic group social class, religion age or nationality. The UN Development Programme UNDP which is promoted by the Human Development and Capability Association (HDCA) is open to a human rights perspective as stated in the Human Development Report of 2001 \\"human development and human rights are mutually reinforcing helping to secure the well-being and dignity of all people\\". The Economic and Social Council put out a statement in May 2001 specifically addressing poverty as a human right concern and Special Rapporteur Mohammed Habib Cherif reported to the Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights at its 58th session now the Advisory Committee on Human Rights and extreme Poverty. Human rights under these development perspectives revolve around the concept of freedom with expanding choice. The World Conference on Human Rights the Vienna Declaration confirmed that extreme poverty and social exclusion constitute a violation of human dignity and urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes. The first MDG is to Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger. Economic growth is regarded as the principal mechanism to achieve this goal while a human rights approach requires a focus on poor growth and a consideration of groups seeking development paths other than the conventional free market, export-driven model. The targets here are 1) To halve, between by 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day comparable to the Right to adequate standard of living; 2) to achieve full employment and decent work for all is comparable to the Right to work and 3) to halve by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, comparable to the Right to food, and correspondingly rights to life and health. South-eastern Asia is the first developing region to reach the hunger reduction target ahead of 2015. Undernourished people in the total population of the region decreased from 29.6% in 1990-1992 to 10.9% in 2010-2012. However, globally the slowing of growth brings continual job losses. Unemployment has increased by 28 million since 2007, and an estimated 39 million people have dropped out of the labour market, leaving 67 million people without jobs as a result of the global financial crisis. Though the number of workers living with their families on less than $1.25 a day has declined dramatically over the past decade by 294 million, new estimates show that 60.9% of workers in the developing world still live on less than $4 a day. In Yemen the World Food Programme (WFP) Food For Girls Education Programme has been tackling hunger and enrolment challenges, where more than 60% of primary school children not in schools are girls. Families who send their girls to school are eligible to receive an annual ration of wheat and vegetable oil. Since 2010 the programme has reached almost 200,000 girls. Whilst in India the UNDP is supporting the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Program, promoting laws passed in 2005 which guarantee the right to a minimum of 100 days of paid work a year for landless labourers and marginal farmers. The scheme now provides 50 days work a year to around 50 million households where almost half of the beneficiaries are women. The Zero Hunger Challenge another UN initiative with numerous NGO partners has as it aims 1) 100% access to adequate food all year round; 2) zero stunted children less than 2 years old; 3) where all food systems are sustainable; 4) a 100% increase in smallholder productivity and income; and 5) a zero loss or waste of food. =Education= Varun Gauri argues that economic and social rights, such as the right to health care or education, may be understood not as legal instruments for individuals, but as duties for governments and international agencies such that everyone bears some responsibility for their fulfillment. Economists accept that the realization of high standards of health and education are conducive to economic growth. The human rights approach regards transparency and empowerment as ends in themselves, while an economic approach sees them as instrumental to a welfare outcome. The second MDG is to Achieve Universal Primary Education. The target is to ensure that by 2015, children everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling comparable to the Right to education, the goal however ignores the requirement of free primary education as conceived by the human right. Even after 4 years of primary schooling, as many as 250 million children cannot read and write undermining the basis for all future learning. Going to school is not enough and improving actual learning is critical. Early school leaving is a major factor, 137 million children entered first grade in 2011, with 34 million likely to leave before reaching the last grade, an early leaving rate of 25%, the same as in 2000. Poverty, gender and residential location are key factors keeping children out of school. Children from the poorest households are three times more likely to be out of school than children from the richest households. Globally 123 million youth aged 15 to 24 lack basic reading and writing skills whilst 61% of them are young women. Positive developments have occurred in Afghanistan and Bangladesh where the Let Us Learn initiative has overcome barriers to education. UNICEF enrolled 3,917 five-year-olds in school programmes, including 153 disabled children from the most disadvantaged region of rural Bangladesh, 60% of which were girls. In Afghanistan 9,339 children and youth participated in community based learning programmes with 84% being girls. UNICEF and partners responded to 286 humanitarian crises in 79 countries in 2012 and helped some 3.56 million children and adolescents gain access to formal and non formal basic education. The Secretary-General's Global Education First initiative (GEFI) has a commitment with companies and private foundations making pledges of over $1.5 billion ensuring that all children have a quality, relevant and transformative education, whilst the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) helped more than 19 million children go to school since 2003. Leading donors promised an initial $1.5 billion over three years, with the fund aiming to secure another 25 million children in school as of 2014. =Gender equality= The third MDG is to promote gender equality and empower women. Eliminating gender inequality is supported by international human rights instruments, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The goal sets women's empowerment as the objective but the related target is narrowly concerned with education. Eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2015 is narrowly conceived but comparable to Women's Right to equality. Of note the share of women employed outside of agriculture rose to 40% in 2013 but only by 20% in Southern Asia, Western Asia and Northern Africa while the global share of women in parliament continues to rise and reached 20% in 2012. Gender gaps in access to education have narrowed but inequalities remain in all levels of education, girls face barriers to schooling, particularly in Northern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia. Access to secondary and university education remains unequal with disparities at universities the most extreme. In Southern Asia, 77 girls per 100 boys are enrolled in tertiary education while in sub-Saharan Africa the gender gap in enrolment has widened from 66 girls per 100 boys in 2000 to 61 girls per 100 boys in 2011. Poverty is the main cause of unequal access to education with women and girls in many parts of the world forced to spend many hours fetching water and girls often do not attend school because of a lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Child marriage and violence against girls are also significant barriers to education. Women still enter the labour market on an unequal basis to men, even after accounting for educational background and skills. Women are often relegated to vulnerable forms of employment, with little or no financial security or social benefits. Regarding women's rights and land empowerment, Kerry Rittich notes that programmes which promote the formal real property rights of women, in place of customary laws or other informal mechanisms, have the potential to both improve and retard women's access to land. The programmes promoting property rights tend to go together with measures to formalize, commodify, and individualize landholdings, and that these three processes often intensify the dispossession of women who may have had access to land under informal arrangements or customary law. The promotion of property rights from an economic perspective may well undermine the social rights of women in developing countries. Legal conceptions of property, treat property not as a mere resource but as a set of relations between individuals and groups. This approach may highlight otherwise unforeseen distributive consequences for women, moving from an informal property regime to a formalized and individualized one. Mason and Carlsson note that, unless gender inequality in land holding is taken into account when implementing land tenure reforms, improved land tenure security may diminish women's land holdings. A variety of factors can lead to this result, including discriminatory inheritance laws, the application of an androcentric definition of 'the head of household', and inequalities in women's capacity to participate in the market for land. Costa Rica and Colombia land reforms were undertaken in a way that improved women's ownership of land. Women who own the land they work have greater incentives to raise their labour productivity, and women who earn more income are more likely than men to invest in the household and in their children's education and nutrition stressing the importance of applying a human rights lens such that norms of non-discrimination and equal property rights are required when implementing economic reforms. =Children's rights= The fourth MDG is to reduce child mortality. A human rights approach emphasizes the State's obligations regarding the availability of functioning health systems and making sure that all groups can effectively access them by addressing obstacles like discrimination. The target here is the reduction of two-thirds of the mortality rate of children under five by 2015 comparable to the Right to life. Around 17,000 fewer children are dying each day, yet 6.6 million children under five died in 2012, mostly from preventable diseases. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in ten children dies before the age five. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounted for 5.3 million 81% of the 6.6 million deaths The main killers are pneumonia, prenatal and intrapartum complications, diarrhoea and malaria. The first month, particularly the first 24 hours, are the most dangerous in a child's life. Newborns now account for almost half 44% of under-five deaths and undernutrition contributes to 45% of all under-five deaths. Over the past two decades in Bangladesh UNICEF has supported local efforts training community health-care workers leading to a decline in maternal and child mortality. Infant mortality declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 33 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012. In the same period under five mortality dropped by 72% from 144 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 41 deaths per 1000 births in 2012. The development goal is related to Child Labour. Rights advocates regard child labour as a violation to numerous rights of a child such that it must be eradicated to ensure children's human rights are ends themselves while development economics views child labour as an inter-generational loss of potential income. Children suffer diminished human capital where reductions in health and education affect their future productivity. The International Labour Organization's (ILO's) estimates that current levels of child labour will result in an income foregone of $5 trillion between 2000 and 2020. Currently 23% of the world's children aged between 5 and 17 are engaged in some form of work. Betcherman demonstrates the important insights that economic analysis can provide in understanding how best to reduce child labour. Factors contributing to child labour can be seen in terms of incentives that encourage child work, constraints that compel children to work, and decisions that may not be made in the best interests of the children. Other factors must also be considered, direct (books, transport) and indirect (poor quality, loss of household labour) costs of education leading parents to regard education as not providing sufficient immediate returns to the household or child. Elizabeth Gibbons, Friedrich Huebler, and Edilberto Loaiza consider how, at the level of statistical analysis, the application of the human rights principle of non- discrimination can affect our understanding of child labour. Existing methods of calculating the extent of child labour under report the degree of work done by girls, because the measures exclude household chores. By failing to consider 'female work' within the definition of child labour, the impact of child work on the educational and health attainment of girls is made invisible. Gibbons, Huebler, and Loaiza also investigate some factors affecting school attendance; labour and household poverty are generally constraints on attendance but a mother's educational attainment correlates positively with school attendance, revealing the inter-generational payoff from investments in girls' education. Household wealth and the level of education of the primary caretaker also have a significant effect on educational attainment In India the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act has led to the inclusion of a justiciable right to education in relation to children between the ages of 6 and 14 and provides an impetus to government to address critical problems in the provision of education. The idea of education as a 'fundamental right' focuses local political action and agitation among oppressed communities, who rely on the new constitutional provision as a way of pressing demands on local and regional government. =Maternal health= The fifth MDG is to improve maternal health. The target is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio and to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015 comparable to right to life and health. Complications during pregnancy or childbirth are one of the leading causes of death for adolescent girls, 140 million women worldwide married or in civil union would like to delay or avoid pregnancy, but have no access to family planning. 47 million babies were delivered without skilled care in 2011. Maternal mortality is lower in countries where levels of contraceptive use and skilled attendance at birth are high. sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio with a contraceptive use of 25% and low levels of skilled attendance at birth. Education for girls is vital to reducing maternal mortality. The risk of maternal death is 2.7 times higher among women with no education, and 2 times higher among women with one to six years of education than for women with twelve plus years of education. Supported by UNFPA, Bangladesh is training midwives according to international midwifery standards. Hundreds of nurses have upgraded their knowledge with practical and theoretical training. In India more than two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in impoverished states due to the inability to get medical care in time. UNICEF and its partners are working to avoid these preventable maternal deaths through innovative schemes such as a conditional cash transfer programme for women who deliver in health facilities. In Sierra Leone a year after the launch of the Free Health Care 2010 initiative there was a 150% improvement in maternal complications managed in health facilities and a 61% reduction in the maternal mortality rate. Launched at the UN MDG Summit in 2010, Every Woman Every Child mobilizes global action to save the lives of women and children and to improve their health and lives. Partners in this area include The GAVI Matching Fund for Immunization, a private-public initiative in which the UK Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation match contributions from the private sector to deliver critical vaccines to the lowest income countries. Furthermore, UN Women is implementing a joint programme in Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea, Haiti, Mali, Niger and Togo highlighting links between violence against women and maternal health, promoting funding and training midwives and health workers. =Combating disease= This sixth MDG is to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The goal has three targets 1) to halt and reverse HIV/AIDS, 2) to achieve universal treatment for HIV/AIDs 3) to halt and reverse Malaria and other Diseases unquestionably reflecting the Right to health. To date 2.3 million people are newly infected by HIV each year, with 1.6 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Tuberculosis (TB) mortality rate decreased 41% between 1991 and 2011, yet TB killed 1.4 million people in 2011, including 430,000 among people who were HIV-positive. Multidrug-resistant TB is a major global challenge and the rate of people accessing treatment is slow. In 2008, reports appeared that malaria parasites in Cambodia and Thailand were resisting artemisinin, the most effective single drug to treat malaria. The countries launched a joint monitoring, prevention and treatment project in seven provinces along their shared border, with support from WHO. In Thailand more than 300 volunteer village malaria health workers were trained to provide free services to test for malaria and directly observe the treatment of patients. Use of a smart phone to capture data on patients and to monitor treatment has accelerated progress. An electronic malaria information system (e-MIS) uploaded on the health workers' mobile devices shows malaria volunteers where to find patients, the status of their treatment, the situation and trends. In Ethiopia a programme, supported by UNICEF and its partners, is preventing transmission of the virus from HIV-positive mothers to their children, a critical measure in ensuring an AIDS-free generation. The Getting to Zero initiative has ten Southeast Asian nations committed to making Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination and Zero HIV- Related Deaths a reality. =Environmental sustainability= The seventh MDG is to ensure environmental sustainability. A human rights approach to sustainable development emphasizes improving accountability systems, access to information on environmental issues, and the obligations of developed States to assist more vulnerable States, especially those affected by climate change. There are four targets in this goal 1) To integrate principles of sustainable development into country policies and reverse the loss of environmental resources comparable to a Right to environmental health; 2) to reduce biodiversity loss by achieving a significant reduction in the rate of loss; 3) to halve by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation comparable to the Right to water and sanitation and 4) to achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, comparable to the Right to adequate housing. Of note a staggering 2.5 billion people still do not have access to toilets or latrines. Open defecation is a practice that poses serious health and environmental risks and stopping it is a key factor in the progress of sanitation goals. In 2013, UN Member States adopted the Sanitation for All resolution calling for increased efforts to improve access to proper sanitation. The number of slum dwellers however continues to grow, due to the fast pace of urbanization. The number of urban residents living in slum conditions was estimated at 863 million in 2012, compared to 650 million in 1990 and 760 million in 2000. Species are moving towards extinction at an ever-faster pace, and reduced biodiversity has serious consequences for the ecosystem services upon which all people depend. The largest loss of forests occurs in South America, around 3.6 million hectares per year from 2005 to 2010. Deforestation threatens global sustainability and the progress towards hunger and poverty reduction as forests provide food, water, wood, fuel and other services used by millions of the world's poorest. Brazil's northeast the most densely populated semi-arid region in the world has limited rainfall and cyclic drought forcing many of the 22 million residents to resort in illegal charcoal production, stripping the region of forests. A project by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote agro-ecology is showing farmers how to make a living from the land while conserving the environment. Nearly one-third of marine fish stocks have been overexploited and the world's fisheries can no longer produce maximum sustainable yields due to continuing expansion of the fishing industry in many countries. The Montreal Protocol has led to a 98% reduction in the consumption of ozone- depleting substances since 1986 yet carbon dioxide emissions have increased by more than 46% since 1990. Africas first transboundary biosphere reserves in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Senegal are set up with funding from the Global Environment Facility, working with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UNESCO in 2002. The reserves prevent desertification, testing sustainable economies and integrating local communities. The development goal is strongly related to rights to Food, Water & Sanitation. Defined as 'freedom from hunger', the right to food may be seen as a right to 'nutrition'. Nutrition is achieved not through food alone but with clean water, health-care, hygiene, and other inputs. In India despite constitutional protections of certain economic and social rights, including the right to food, and relatively stable democratic institutions, the underprivileged are excluded from actively participating in democratic politics, with the result that their aspirations and priorities are not reflected in public policy. The elitism of public policy further disempowers the poor by perpetuating their deprivations. The state bearing primary responsibility for the right to food, there is also responsibilities on local communities and families to ensure basic nutrition is equally available to all members. Dre\`ze accepts that this complicates the question of how the right to food can be enforced, additionally the right to food cannot be realized in isolation from other social and economic rights, such as the right to health. The Rio +20 Conference took place in 2012 produced the Future We Want outcome document and created the UN High-level Political Forum on sustainable development which issued the Global Sustainable Development Report in 2013 its special theme the convergence of climate, land, energy, water and development issues. \\"The unabated rise in the scale of materials consumption has increased global environmental, social and economic pressures. There is increasing evidence that we are jeopardizing several of the Earth's basic life support systems. Countries and people trapped in persistent poverty have probably suffered most from these impacts. And future generations will most likely face much greater challenges to meet their own needs\\". =Global partnerships for development= The eighth MDG is to develop a global partnership for development. There are five targets 1) to develop predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system rules; 2) to address the needs of least developed countries, landlocked countries and small island developing states; 3) to deal comprehensively with developing countries' debt; 4) to provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies and 5) to make available benefits of new technologies. All targets are comparable to the Right to development. Of note a total of 83% of least developed country exports enter developed countries duty-free. In the developing world, 31% of the population use the Internet, compared with 77% of the developed world. In 2012 ODA of $126 billion was 4% less than in 2011, which was 2% less than in 2010. This is the first time since 1996-1997 that ODA fell in two consecutive years, while essential medicines are available in only 57% of public sector facilities and 65% of private facilities in selected developing countries. There are over six billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and for every person who uses the Internet from a computer, two do so from a mobile device. In South Africa, over 25,000 students have improved their math skills through interactive exercises and quizzes on mobile phones through cooperation between government, Nokia and individual schools and teachers. The MDG Gap Task Force was created by the UN Secretary-General in 2007 to improve monitoring of the global commitments contained in MDG 8 tracking existing commitments and identifying gaps and obstacles to fulfilment in development assistance, trade, debt sustainability, access to essential medicines and new technologies. The Task Force integrates more than 30 UN and other international agencies while The Integrated Implementation Framework records and monitors financial and policy commitments made by UN Member States and other international stakeholders. Human rights and the international order =Post 2015 Agenda= Criticism of the Millennium goals are that they should be transformative not technocratic. A key element in empowering people is that the response should be framed within a broader view of poverty that addresses root causes like power inequalities. Creating an inventory of public goods and services for distribution and seeking to fill deficits through foreign aid follows the history of development. A rights-based approach seeks to identify systemic obstacles that keep people from accessing opportunity. Genuine participation and access to information are the cornerstone of empowerment and instrumental gains occur when local knowledge and local preferences are used. Civil and political rights like the rights to vote, to freedom of expression and to freedom of association are crucial if excluded groups are to ensure that Governments focus on the MDGs with a human rights basis. Human rights in relations to develop goals possess a number of different characteristics. Rights are universal, the birthright of all humans, and are focused on the inherent dignity and equal worth of all. Human rights cannot be waived or taken away and they impose obligations of action and omission. Rights are internationally guaranteed and legally protect individuals and groups. Rights have corresponding obligations on the duty-bearer traditionally the state, who must 1) respect human rights by refraining from interfering with them; 2) protect human rights by ensuring that private actors do not interfere with people's ability to exercise them (e.g. ensure that private schools enrol children from ethnic minorities); 3) fulfil human rights by adopting all necessary measures (e.g. create health programmes to provide medicines or pass laws to recognize indigenous ancestral lands and 4) guarantee human rights without discrimination of any kind including disability, health status, age, sexual orientation, civil, political and social status. International human rights law predate the MDGs, and States have existing legal obligations to realize human rights such that development goals targets and indicators need to be aligned with a human rights approach. The process of alignment should involve 1) adapting each target to the relevant economic, social or cultural right; 2) mainstreaming gender; 3) ensuring the excluded are included; and 4) ensuring indicators are rights sensitive. There must be minimum standards for the process agreed on by all participants that includes the design, implementation and monitoring of development strategies; which are inclusive of women and marginalized groups. Elite capture and reinforcement of existing social hierarchies and power relations must be prevented and information must be transparent and accessible, finally there must be accountability mechanisms to ensure the participatory process is kept to these standards such that overall there is a prioritization of human rights in policy and resource allocation. The Development CoOperation Forum is an initiative of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSCO) and now held biannually. The objectives of the upcoming forum include 1) Assess how a global partnership for development beyond 2015 could work in practice. 2) examine implications of a post-2015 development agenda for development cooperation; 3) identify ways to enhance national and global accountability and effective monitoring of development cooperation and 4) advance policy dialogue and concrete actions by Southern development cooperation partners on commons issues and challenges. =Labour organisations = The International Labour Organization (ILO) since its formation in 1919 has lent strong support to workers rights and its work complements human rights as stipulated under Article 23 of the UDHR., Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 11 of the European Convention. The organization has developed its own conventions and committees for advise on labour laws and mediates between trade unions and employers guarding labour principles outlined in the UN Global Compact. The ILO Conventions include Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948 and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949. In 1998 the organization issued a declaration of four core labour rights 1) freedom of association and the effective right of collective bargaining 2) the prohibition of forced compulsory labour 3) the effective abolition of child labour 4) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment or occupation. Collective bargaining may be viewed as an individual right to combine with other individual workers in a position to achieve wage justice, safe working conditions, fair disciplinary treatment and comradery. It is also a practice that counterbalances and overcomes inequalities in market forces. The Fair Labor Association (FLA) developed a Workplace Code of Conduct based on ILO standards and addresses 1) forced labour; 2) child labour; 3) harassment or abuse; 4) nondiscrimination; 5) health and safety; 6) freedom of association and collective bargaining; 7) wages and benefits 8) hours of work and 9 overtime compensation. =Transnational corporations= Around half of the wealthiest 100 entities in the world today are corporations not countries. with many organisations committing gross human rights violations from which they earn vast profits. Wars are inflamed through arms sales and corporations deal in conflict commodities like diamonds. Importantly the legal personality of corporations was established in the Barcelona Traction case. (1970) In 2004 the UN Commission on Human Rights asked the OHCHR to compile a report on the responsibilities of transnational corporations (TNCs) and following up on the report a Special Representative was appointed to look at the issues and to comment on the relationship of TNC's and other business enterprises. The Ruggie Reports from between 2005 -2011 present a conceptual and policy framework to help guide relevant actors comprising three core principles protect, respect and remedy. It is the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business; whilst there is a corporate responsibility to respect human rights; and furthermore there is need for effective access to remedies. In 2011 The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights were annexed to the last report. States have the primary role in preventing and addressing corporate related human rights abuses under resolution 8/7 governments can support and strengthen market pressures on companies to respect rights whilst adequate reporting enables stakeholders to examine rights related performance. To fulfil the duty to protect states must regulate and adjudicate the acts of business enterprises. International Human rights treaties do not themselves create direct obligations for corporations but treaty bodies refer more directly to the role of states in specifically guarding against human rights violations by corporations. The more recent Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities clearly provides that state parties have an obligation to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person organization or private enterprise. An unresolved legal issue in this regard is as to the extent of a State's jurisdiction, does a states obligation extend extra-territorially or internationally? Business enterprises should respect human rights, avoiding infringing on the human rights of others and they should address adverse human rights impacts when they are involved. The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights refers to those rights as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. As part of their duty to protect against business related human rights abuse States must take appropriate steps to ensure that those affected have access to effective remedy through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means. Since the 1990s soft law instruments have been relied upon to guide corporate behaviour such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Global Compact and the UN draft norms on transnational corporation and other business enterprises. The OECD Guidelines cover a wide range of issues including labour and environmental standards, human rights, corruption, consumer protection, technology amongst others. The guidelines are completely voluntary and were revised in 2000 and updated in 2011. In 2000 a complaint procedure was introduced allowing NGO's and others to submit complaints to alleged breaches where previously only trade unions could submit complaints. The 2011 update introduced a specific chapter on human rights and aligns the guidelines with the UN Special Rapporteur framework of \\"protect respect and remedy\\". In 2000 the UN established the Global Compact which call on business leaders \\"embrace and enact' a set of 10 principles relating to human rights, labour rights, environmental protections and corruption. The compact did not include a mechanism for dispute resolution. In response to this criticism integrity measures were introduced in 2005 which created a complaints procedure for systematic abuse of the compacts overall aims and principles. In 2003 a UN subcommission on the promotion and protection of Human Rights adopted a set of international norms applying to TNC's and other business they are based on international instruments, non binding declarations and guidelines adopted by multilateral organizations. The norms include 1) general obligations; 2) rights to equal opportunity and non-discriminatory treatment; 3) rights to security of persons; 4) rights of workers 5) respect for national sovereignty and human rights; 6) obligations with regard to consumer protection; 7) obligations with regard to environmental protection 8) general provisions of implementation and 9) definitions. The norms however do not have legal status and are unlikely to be developed further and the subcommission is now replaced by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee. There has also emerged over the past decades a proliferation of company specific and multi-stakeholder codes of conduct such as the Sullivan principles and as such hundreds of companies have now publicly committed to upholding basic human rights. Codes of conduct are regarded as part of the soft law regime and are not legally binding but the general normative effect may lead to legal effect as standards may be incorporated into employment and agency contracts. =Human rights enforcement= The Human Rights Commission tasked with drawing up the UDHR was divided on whether the bill should be legally enforceable either as an annex to the UN Charter or as a multilateral convention. As a Declaration of principles it has no powers of implementation but results in new developments of customary international law. As a non legal document the declaration yet defines the nature and meaning of a pledge to respect human rights provided under Article 55 of the UN Charter. Since its initial singing with 48 members and 8 abstention it has grown to include 192 member states. As such Human rights have an inherent dignity and are inalienable, they \\"should be protected by the rule of law\\" to prevent the need of individuals being compelled to revolt against tyranny During the 1970s, General Pinochet's crimes in Argentina contributed greatly to the general assembly passing the United Nations Convention against Torture1975 while the Helsinki Accords 1975 also gave strength to the Human Rights movement. Today the binding UN covenants of the ICCPR and the ICESCR are now in force. In 1977 the Security Council imposed mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa after having previously declared apartheid as \\"a grave threat to the peace\\" justifying the interference into the States internal affairs. The ban on trade was not policed and circumnavigated by multinational corporations. During this period Andrei Sakharov drew attention to the plight of political prisoners whilst critiquing the UN system for its partisan politics. Václav Havel appealed to the Helsinki promise of political cooperation to be taken at face value. These developments coincided with a shift in US foreign policy to include human rights in its agenda while the twin covenants making human rights abuse a legitimate subject of international concern. The Commission and Human Rights Council have not substantially acted on human rights violations and states represented on the commission have not wished to create enforcement procedures which might be used on themselves or their allies, such that tragedies like Pol Pot's Genocide and the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa persist. The Human Rights Committee a body of independent experts monitor the implementation of the ICCPR. All parties must submit an initial report and are subject to four yearly reporting. Concerns and recommendations are addressed in \\"concluding observations\\" addressed to the State Party. Article 41 provides for interstate complaints while the Optional Protocol 1 gives the committee competence to examine individual complaints of alleged violation by State Parties to the Protocol Enforcement in relation to TNC's has often been through tort litigation where human rights standards have been incorporated into domestic legislation. though International law itself is yet unable to impose human rights obligations on corporations. The Alien Tort Statute or Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) of 1789 draws directly on international norms to hold corporations liable for conduct that violates human rights. The ATCA allows a plaintiff not resident in the USA to sue a defendant over which a US court has jurisdiction for a violation of the law of nations even where the event is outside US territory. In Filartiga v Pane-Irala a Paraguayan policeman was sued for torture and murder of the plaintiffs relative though in Sosa v Alvarez Machain it was held That the ATCA did not extend to arbitrary arrest or detention in violation of the UDHR and the ICCPR. In Doe v Unocal a civil claim was brought under the ATCA alleging abuses on the part of an oil consortium and its security representatives which resulted in forced labour, murder, rape and torture of villages. The Court held that a reasonable person could conclude on the evidence that Uncol had aided and abetted the abuses committed by the Myanmar Military and court drew on the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for its decision. The International Criminal Court (ICC) may hold individuals accountable for human rights abuses under the provision of its founding statute. it does not however have jurisdiction of corporations though individuals within corporations can be held to account. The Court has jurisdiction to try cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes where states with the domestic criminal jurisdiction are unwilling to carry out investigations. Where multinational corporations commit crimes on a scale that reach the level of the courts jurisdiction individuals responsible can then be held liable.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Bert Youn, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 1, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), after being grounded by Finn and Jake, hires a hitman named Scorcher to go after them, thinking that Scorcher will merely punch them. But when he sees the hitman attempting to kill Finn and Jake the Ice King plans to save them. \\"Hitman\\" was the first and only episode of the series to have been boarded by Moynihan and Youn. Because the latter was serving in the South Korean military, the two had to work on the episode via the Internet. The episode was watched by 2.273 million people and received largely positive critical reviews, with many calling the episode a highlight of the season. Plot The Ice King is grounded for four weeks after Finn and Jake upset one of his schemes to kidnap Breakfast Princess. Angered, the Ice King seeks a \\"hitman\\" to punch Finn and Jake; however the hitman that he hires, Scorcher, is an assassin, who tries to murder the duo, first by setting their tree house on fire, and then by trying to asphyxiate them. Both schemes are thwarted by the Ice King, who does not intend for Finn and Jake to die. Scorcher turns his ire towards the Ice King after realizing that he has been interfering with his work. Subsequently, the Ice King flees to Finn and Jake's house, where he explains the situation. Soon, Scorcher arrives, casting fire at the three. Ice King, realizing that the only way Scorcher will leave them alone is if Finn and Jake die, freezes the two and feigns that he himself killed them. This satisfies the assassin, who then leaves. The Ice King in turn begins defrosting Finn and Jake by sitting on them. Production \\"Hitman\\" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Bert Youn, from a story by Pendleton Ward, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and Mark Banker. This was the only episode of the series to have been boarded by Youn and Moynihan. Youn had previously storyboarded for the series during its first season, and Moynihan had previously storyboarded with Cole Sanchez during the second season. During the production of \\"Hitman\\", Youn was in Korea doing mandatory army training with the South Korean military, whereas Moynihan was in Los Angeles. To compensate for this, the two communicated with each other via the Internet. The episode's previous title had been \\"Hitcapades\\", before it was changed to \\"Hitman\\". The opening for the episode features the Breakfast Princesses. Ward drew the young, toast-based version, whereas Sanchez drew the older, eggs and bacon-based iteration. The two could not decided on which one to use, so they eventually put them both in the episode. Moynihan later opined that many of his drawing for this episode were off-model, because he had yet to see any work prints from the previous episodes that he had worked on. While Ward enjoyed the off-model designs that Moynihan drew, Moynihan himself was critical of them and tried to curb his penchant for them in subsequent episodes. This episode is one of the first to feature the characters browsing the Internet. At the time of its writing, storyboard artist Kent Osborne initially thought that the references to the Internet were jarring and anachronistic, since the series was supposed to take place in a fantasy world. Voice actress Grey DeLisle appears in this episode as Breakfast Princess. She would later reprise her role in the sixth season episode \\"Princess Day\\". Ward himself voices Scorcher, although his only audible line occurs near the end of the episode, when he angrily concedes to Ice King's insistence that Finn and Jake are dead. Reception \\"Hitman\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on August 1, 2011. The episode was viewed by 2.273 million viewers and scored a 0.3 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.3 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2012 It Came from the Nightosphere DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re- released as part of the complete third season DVD on February 25, 2014. Mike Lechevallier of Slant magazine applauded the episode, citing it as one of the highlights of the third season, and wrote that it was, \\"a great misunderstanding-style storyline\\". However, he did offer a more critical note regarding the Ice King's motivations, writing, \\"it becomes problematic to process Ice King's substantial bit of character maturation in deciding to aid his perpetual thwarters in their time of need\\". In the end, however, he noted that, \\"this is truly a minor complaint\\". A review from Geekadelphia named the installment as among the season's \\"amazing benchmark episodes\\", writing that it was one of the entries that illustrated that \\"the folks behind the show really got their foothold and finally figured out the direction and tone that seemed a bit uneven up until this point.\\" Likewise, C. S. Strowbrige of The Numbers named the episode as one of the highlights of the season.

International human rights instruments Kiribati is a member of the United Nations and has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child(CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Reservations were made with respect to articles 24 (b) – (f), 26 and 28 (b)-(d) of the CRC concerning a child's rights to health including safe drinking water, social security and education as well as a declaration that the definition of child's rights in certain articles would be exercised in accordance with traditional custom regarding the child's place in a family.http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/Library/RATIF.nsf/f8bbb7ac2d00a38141256bfb00342a3f/f1ed8c73c1368844c12568b7004480df?OpenDocument Recommendations to withdraw these reservations and declaration are yet to be enacted. There has been international concern that Kiribati has only ratified three of the seven core international human rights treaties, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). It has also been noted in various submissions to the Human Rights Council that Kiribati is behind on reporting obligations to CEDAW and the CRC. Constitutional protection of rights The Constitution of Kiribati came into force in 1979 and was revised in 1980. It provides for the protection of fundamental human rights, including: * Protection of right to life (section 3) * Protection of right to personal liberty (section 4) * Protection from slavery and forced labour (section 5) * Protection from inhuman treatment (section 6) * Protection from deprivation of property (section 7) * Protection for privacy of home and other property (section 8) * Provisions to secure protection of the law (section 9) * Protection of freedom of conscience (section 10) * Protection of freedom of expression (section 11) * Protection of freedom of assembly and association (section 12) * Protection of freedom of movement (section 13) * Protection from discrimination on the grounds of race, etc. (section 13). Notably, while there is a provision providing protection from discrimination on the grounds of race and political opinion, there is no protection from discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation or disability. The government has tried to amend the constitution to provide for non-discrimination on the grounds of sex or gender, however it did not achieve the required 2/3 majority. While the constitution provides for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, like most countries, they are subject to certain qualifications and limitations. In particular, Kiribati's customary laws are given recognition in the Courts.Laws of Kiribati Act 1989 Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review 2010 The Human Rights Council in its Eighth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review issued a report on Kiribati, following a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Kiribati which took place in 2010. It was acknowledged in this report that Kiribati faces a number of challenges and constraints with regards to human rights, these including the effects of climate change, the rights of women and children, developmental challenges and access to justice. Notwithstanding these challenges it was also noted that Kiribati has a clear constitutional and legal framework and that there have been achievements in certain areas such as in education and addressing the impact of climate change, for example through the Environment Amendment Act (2007). Right to water and sanitation The rights to water and sanitation derive from the right to an adequate standard of living, recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, CRC and CEDAW – all of which Kiribati is party to. The government of Kiribati introduced the National Water Resources Policyhttp://www.climate.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kiribati-National- Water-Resources-Policy-2008.pdf in 2008 which was supplemented by the introduction of the National Sanitation Policy (NSP) http://www.climate.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kiribati-National- Sanitation-Policy-2010.pdf in 2010. The NSP acknowledges that water supply and resource issues in Kiribati are some of the most complex in the world due to a combination of factors including the density of population and the impact of climate change.http://www.climate.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kiribati- National-Sanitation-Policy-2010.pdf at page 2 Both policies contain forty priority issues that required short term attention and an additional twenty- seven requiring attention within the next decade. These policies were criticised by the UN Special Rapporteur in the 2012 Special Report on the human right to drinking water and sanitation in Kiribati. She considered them to be over ambitious and unfocused, with the need for a clear legal framework to be implemented in the country to give national ownership to the issues. In its submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review, Amnesty International identified overcrowding as the key cause of poor sanitation and drinking water shortages in Kiribati. As Kiribati is one of the most densely populated areas in the world there is increased stress on both infrastructure and resources, making management of water and sanitation a challenge in the country. Data shows that sixty-five percent of people in Kiribati have access to an improved water source and thirty-three percent to improved sanitation. This low level of sanitation is part of the reason for high disease rates and illness, for example the chance of a person having diarrhoea is four hundred percent more likely in Kiribati than in Australia or New Zealand, water borne diseases are increasingly common, outbreaks of typhoid occur annually and the country has the highest infant mortality rate in the Pacific region. It has also been acknowledged that as one of the world's least developed countries, Kiribati has limited capacity to fully address the situation and issues of international obligations of other states to respect the rights to water and sanitation in other countries may be a contributing factor to the broader issues faced by Kiribati, particularly in relation to climate change. The effects of climate change are a reality for people's everyday life in the country and it is the effects of climate change coupled with inaction by the State and international community that have led to the denial of rights. Rights of women and children =Women’s rights= The protection of women remains a sensitive issue within the nation and this is largely due to the cultural and social structures that exist within Kiribati. The discrimination provision of the Bill of Rights does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender or sex, effectively meaning that discrimination against women is lawful in Kiribati [24]. Customary law is given constitutional status which often allows for discrimination against women, this is particularly due to traditions which hold women as inferior to men in Kiribati society. Land inheritance and custody laws were considered particularly discriminatory by Amnesty International in its submission to the Human Rights Council. Citizenship laws in Kiribati were also criticised as discriminatory against women. For example, the Citizenship Act 1979 provides that a Kiribati woman who marries a foreigner and moves to that country can only regain citizenship if that marriage breaks down, whereas a Kiribati man who does the same can regain citizenship at any time. Awareness of women's rights has increased over recent years within the country; particularly in relation to domestic violence with the formation of the Kiribati Women Activists Network (K-Wan).http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/KI/K_WAN_UPR_KIR_S08_2010_KiribatiWomenActivistsNetwork.pdf =Domestic violence= While there are laws in place which make rape and all forms of assault illegal, there are no laws against domestic violence specifically and prosecutions are treated as offences warranting prosecution under the Penal Code of Kiribati.United States Department of State As gender roles are strictly defined and used as a justification for the negative treatment of women which has meant that women generally refuse to report or share any violence issues with formal authorities. In addition to this progress has been made with the ratification of CEDAW and in 2011 the government introduced an action plan for the elimination of gender based violence. It has been acknowledged by the government that there are some domestic laws in the country which do not comply with CEDAW. Measures have been taken by the government in an attempt to address these issues surrounding violence. In 2010 the Kiribati Health and Support Study: A Study on Violence Against Women http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/pacific/drive/KiribatiFamilyHealthandSafetyStudy.pdf was published showing there were high levels of violence against women in Kiribati, with 68% of women surveyed having experienced some form of domestic violence in 2008. =Sexual exploitation of children= The law of Kiribati prohibits the exploitation of children in the sex industry with the procurement of any girl under 18 for prostitution being prohibited. Despite this underage girls have been known to be involved in commercial sex with crew members of large foreign fishing boats, often facilitated by family members.

In 1920 he published Peccavi...???, a then- scandalous novel with a gay protagonist, co-written with fellow actor Ernst Winar. A performer of considerable talent, he was to be honored for his achievements on the stage in the 1930s by an honorary committee that included Simon Carmiggelt, who related that, when the committee members understood that Engers himself was gay, withdrew from the committee one after the other. Other works were a screenplay about the closing of the Zuiderzee, which created the artificial lake IJsselmeer, in which he was to act as well (only promotional footage for the project seems to remain), and a play about Oscar Wilde, published in 1917, whose main themes are norms and deviancy; \\"deviancy\\" in Engers' play includes art and beauty, which are crushed by the normality of everyday society.

He was raised in Mid-City. He graduated with a fine arts degree from LSU in 1952, after which he began architectural studies at Tulane University. He briefly served in the U.S. Army. Before being able to survive as an artist, he worked for Maison Blanche, a New Orleans department store, as a display designer/window dresser. For the vast majority of his life, he lived in the French Quarter, where he was well known for his eccentricity and hospitality. His friend and student, Robert Mapplethorpe restaged many of his earlier black and white photographs. Dureau died of Alzheimer's disease.

Texaco, 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1995), was a U.S. copyright case holding that a private, for-profit corporate library could not rely on fair use in systematically making copies of articles for its employees. Case background  Texaco is a for-profit corporation that maintained an internal library and employed a number of scientists. Texaco subscribed to journals published by the American Geophysical Union, a scholarly society that publishes a number of journals. Texaco also purchased a photocopy license from the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC), an entity that licenses academic content to research organizations.Cásarez at 644. Texaco, like many entities with institutional libraries, engaged in the practice of photocopying articles from journals to send to employees. The AGU and five other publishers, eventually joined by several dozen other publishers, sued Texaco. Texaco defended its actions by citing the fair use doctrine, which holds that uses found to be \\"fair,\\" \\"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research,\\" are not infringements of copyright.17 U.S.C. Section 107, Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use. The court ultimately deemed Texaco's use not to be fair use; Texaco was fined and agreed to retroactively purchase a license from the Copyright Clearance Center. The Second Circuit's fair-use analysis weighed heavily on the \\"fourth factor\\",Cásarez at 644. which considers \\"the effect of the use upon the potential market for ... the copyrighted work.\\" Because CCC made licenses available for the photocopying, the court held that Texaco's failure to use those licenses for all its photocopying deprived the rightsholders of lost licensing revenue. This portion of the opinion has been criticized for its circularity of reasoning: Since any use could in theory be licensed, any unlicensed use would weigh against fair use on the market harm factor. Judge Dennis Jacobs dissented. He characterized the publishers' argument as circular. Since any license fee they would collect would result only if the use was not deemed fair, deeming the use unfair because of the lost licensing fee was bootstrapping. He also would have treated the scientists' use of photocopies in the laboratory as socially productive and therefore weighing in favor of fair use. References  Further reading  * Nicole B.

It is located on the west side of Profile Road, in a rural area between the village center of Franconia and Cannon Mountain. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It continues to function as a small hotel with restaurant. Description and history The structure is estimated to have been built around 1820 by Nicholas Powers, one of the first settlers of the area. It consists of a pair of story Cape style buildings that have been joined, offset by about . The main entrance is in the southern section, framed by sidelight and transom windows; there are secondary entrances on the north section's facade. It was originally a farmhouse, whose farm was by the late 19th century supplying fresh goods to the area's large resort hotels. It was itself converted for use as an inn in 1928, after fires devastated a number of the area hotels. Around that time, shed dormers were added to both sides of each roof line. Further additions in the 1950s-60s added more kitchen and dining space to the rear. The grounds include a number of guest cabins, as well as an old barn that has also been adapted for guest use.

As the story goes, around March or April 1898, Aguinaldo requested Marcela Agoncillo to make the Philippine flag according to a design, inspired by the Cuban flag, given by the revolutionary committee. Lorenza, then seven years old, helped her mother in sewing the flag together with Rizal’s niece, Delfina Herbosa Natividad. The task was finished in five days. Aguinaldo took the flag with him when he sailed back to the Philippines on the U.S. transport McCulloch after the defeat of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. It was waved from the window of Aguinaldo’s house in Kawit, Cavite after he declared the independence of the Philippines on June 12, 1898. =As a Catholic= Lorenza was a devout Catholic. She entered the congregation of St. Paul de Chartres, intending to become a nun. However, a strange disease affecting her kidneys forced her to abandon the vocation. After recovering her health, she studied at the Philippine Normal School. She became a teacher at the Malate Catholic School, serving there for 50 years. Like her sisters, she was a cultured woman. She sang beautifully and recited with ease poems like Rizal’s “Mi Ultimo Adios” at family gatherings. The old Agoncillo house in Malate, which she shared with her sisters, revealed her fine artistic tastes. She was also known for being softhearted. She could not refuse anyone who appealed for financial help, whether deserving or not. Agoncillo lived through the hardships of the Japanese occupation and the horrors of the liberation of Manila, during which the family house was destroyed. Among the buildings that were heavily damaged in the area was the Malate Catholic School, which she sought to reopen. She became the driving force not only in restoring the school but also in managing it so it could resume its role as an educational institution. To this twin effort, she gave complete dedication. Later life In 1967, she received a Plaque of Merit for her invaluable contributions to the school. Like her parents, Agoncillo was patriotic and well – bred. Her dignity was an inspiration to both her colleagues and the thousands of students who passed under her care. =Death= She died on September 2, 1972, three days short of her 82nd birthday.

It is located in the village of Fedje on the northern coast of the island of Fedje. It is the church for the Fedje parish which is part of the Nordhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1941 using designs by the architect Ole Halvorsen. The church seats about 400 people. The church is built of stone/brick, which is better suited than wood for the harsh marine climate on Fedje. The roof consists of slate from Alta and the tower is covered with copper. History The earliest existing historical records of a chapel at Fedje date back to the year 1636, but the chapel was likely built before the 1600s because in the mid-1600s, it was described as being very old. The chapel was an annex chapel within the large Lindaas prestegjeld. Shortly after the last worship service on 24 April 1659, the old chapel was torn down and on 21 August of the same year, the new church was consecrated as the first official church on Fedje. The church was not much larger than the chapel on the site--the nave was only long. The church may not have been located on the present site, but rather on a small island north of the village of Fedje. By the mid-1800s, the church was in poor condition, so it was decided to replace the church. After a fundraising campaign, the old church was demolished in 1888 and a small wooden church was built. The new church was consecrated by Bishop Waldemar Hvoslef on 17 October of the same year. The church from 1888 quickly became too small for the congregation and in 1918 the parishioners began a plan to finance a new and larger church. In 1939, the church from 1888 was torn down, but unfortunately the start of World War II and the Invasion of Norway delayed the construction of the church. It was not until 1941 that the church was finished and on 7 September 1941 it was consecrated by the Bishop Andreas Fleischer.

In Denmark, a parish (Danish: sogn, plural sogne) is a local ecclesiastical unit in the Church of Denmark. Each parish is assigned to a physical church, and the church's administration (sognekontor) handles the area's civic registration of births, marriages and deaths. Each Danish municipality is composed of one or more parishes. From the middle of the 19th century until the 1970 administrative reform, parishes not located in a Danish market town (købstad) also operated as the lowest level of civil administration, either individually or in groups of two or three parishes known as parish municipalities (sognekommuner). In the civil context, the parish was headed by a parish council (sogneråd), the chairman of which was called a parish chairman (sognerådsformand, literally meaning a parish council chairman). History hundred of Aarhus County. Danish parishes originated in the Middle Ages. Beginning in 1645, Danish pastors have been required to maintain a parish register (kirkebog), which in modern times has become a valuable tool for genealogical research. Since 1812, each parish has been instructed to keep two separate copies of this record, one written by the priest and one by a dean (degn), stored in separate buildings to prevent the destruction of both in case of fire. In 2001, civil registrations were merged into a national computerized system (elektronisk kirkebog), now handled by around 500 parish priests.Kirkens besparelser på elektronisk kirkebog kom aldrig, Kristelig Dagblad, 22 April 2013 Until the municipal reform of 1970, parish municipalities functioned as the lowest unit of civil government with responsibility mostly concerning schools, roads, unemployment and care for the invalids and the elderly without family. In 1870, there were 1097 parish municipalities. Figures before and after 1920 cannot be compared directly due to the 1920 reunification of South Jutland with Denmark. In the 1970 municipal reform, Denmark's 88 market towns and more than 1300 parish municipalities merged to become 277 municipalities. Since 1970, municipalities normally comprise several parishes. The number of municipalities was further reduced by the 2007 municipal reform to 98. The parish boundaries continue to play a significant role in terms of community cohesion - notably in rural areas - and are often a basis for school districts.  Civil and church administrations  Between 1662 and the Danish municipal reform of 1970, each parish was assigned to a hundred (herred) which in turn was part of a county (amt). In 1970, the hundreds lost their administrative functions and the counties were dissolved at the end of 2006. Since 2007, each municipality comprises one or more parishes, and in turn belongs to a region. Each parish is assigned to a deanery (provsti), in turn forming part of a diocese (stift). Some parishes are administered collectively as a pastorat, with usually one or two priests providing religions services in the area. The civic registration of births, marriages and deaths is conducted by the Church of Denmark. Historically, a number of religious minorities have been awarded the same right concerning their own members, notable the Jewish and Calvinist communities in Denmark. An exception to the historical system of parish-level registers is South Jutland where registers are kept by the local municipalities (Haderslev, Sønderborg, Tønder, and Aabenraa Municipalities). This administrative divergence dates from the 1864-1920 period when the South Jutland region was part of Prussia.

He was presented with the Polish American Historical Society's Haiman Award in 1989, and the Cavalier's Cross of the Order of Merit by the President of Poland in 2001. He turned 100 in August 2016 and died in January 2020 at the age of 103 and 5 months.Edward G Pinkowski Books ;Pills, Pen & Politics (1974) Pinkowski's book on Confederate soldier and Baton Rouge mayor Leon Jastremski is the only biography written on the subject. Reviewer Donald Everett found Pinkowski's book took effort to identify Polish immigrants and Polish American families in Louisiana at the time, but at no time could Pinkowski definitively prove that Jastremski had any friends or personal connection to them other than his Polish name. James S. Pula criticized Pills, Pen & Politics because it did not offer enough analysis of the inner motivations behind Jastremski's political career. ;Lattimer Massacre (1950) Lattimer Massacre historian Michael Novak credited Pinkowski as \\"the true hero\\" in preserving the story of the Lattimer Massacre from historical oblivion. According to Novak's historiography, the Massacre was completely unknown to historians until the Slavic Community on Strike (1968) was published by Victor R. Greene, who mentioned several paragraphs on Lattimer. Novak contacted Greene, who stated that his information on Lattimer was from a largely unnoticed pamphlet printed by Edward Pinkowski in 1950. Research Pinkowski will always be remembered as the man who found the bones of Polish-American war hero, general Casimir Pulaski. His research on Polish trading pioneer Anthony Sadowski led to the discovery of his grave in Douglassville, Pennsylvania in 1966. Pinkowski's study of Pulaski led him to believe that his body was buried under the Pulaski monument in Savannah, Georgia, contradicting past historians' reports of him being buried at sea. In 1996, the marble statue was removed for repair, and an unmarked coffin was extracted from underneath. The city of Savannah did not earmark any money to finance a DNA test, so Pinkowski personally paid $30,000 to test the body against DNA of Pulaski's living descendants. The results were inconclusive. Pinkowski researched the Lattimer Massacre extensively, and interviewed two surviving marchers, Andrew Meyer and John Miklos, in the 1940s.Margaret M.

He presided over a period of unprecedented corruption in which he assisted several major criminals, notably the Barker- Karpis gang and John Dillinger. He was eventually dismissed as chief, but retained a senior role in the Kidnap Squad, during which he continued to assist criminals. Later, he was demoted to detective, in which role he was involved in the killing of Homer Van Meter. He was finally dismissed from the force, but he was never successfully prosecuted for his crimes. Early career Brown was born in West Virginia into a family of coal miners. He stood 6 foot 5 inches and was too tall to work in the mines, so he went to St. Paul and worked at various jobs before joining the police in 1914. He married Mary Raffety, and the couple had four daughters and one son.Mahoney, p. 9. St. Paul's police already had a reputation for tolerating the presence of criminals in the city. John O'Connor developed the so-called \\"O'Connor system\\" in which criminals were protected from extradition so long as they committed no crimes while they were in the city. The system attracted big-spending gangsters who supported other lucrative businesses, particularly illegal speak-easies.Mahoney, pp. 5–6. Brown achieved local fame after killing escaped murderer Edwin Rust in a gunfight. He was appointed to the \\"Purity Squad\\", which was supposed to identify and close down gambling dens, speak-easies, and brothels. He quickly learned to build contacts with the gangs who ran them and to take bribes. In 1926, he was arrested for stealing a large quantity of alcohol that had been confiscated in a raid.Mahoney, p.10-12. He was later released through lack of evidence and reinstated. The Purity Squad became notorious for its repeated failure to find any illegal activity, and a board of inquiry was moving toward dismissing Brown. The dismissal was suddenly withdrawn, however, probably due to pressure from corrupt politicians with links to local crime bosses, particularly Leon Gleckman, \\"the Al Capone of St. Paul\\".Mahoney, p. 14. Chief of Police In 1930, Gleckman engineered Brown's appointment to chief of police.Folsom, Robert, The Money Trail: How Elmer Irey and His T-men Brought Down America's Criminal Elite, Potomac, 2010, pp. 247–8. In return, Brown protected Gleckman's business interests. Gleckman was kidnapped by rival racketeer Jack Peifer, and Brown worked hard for his release. The ransom was paid, but one of the kidnappers was later found shot dead by an unknown assailant. Brown took the ransom from the man's safe;Robert O’Connor, \\"St. Paul’s Gangster Era\\", 3AM Magazine he later claimed that he stored it at police headquarters, but it was never located. Brown's tenure as chief came to an end when he became involved with the Barker-Karpis gang, who had come to St. Paul at the invitation of Gleckman's rival Jack Peifer. The gang committed a series of robberies until a neighbor recognized them from pictures in True Detective magazine. Brown delayed responding to the information, and he or one of his associates tipped them off. They cleared out believing that Ma Barker's lover Arthur Dunlop had informed on them, and they shot him and dumped his naked body. The Dunlop murder sealed Brown's fate as chief, as the publicity led to questions about how the gang had gotten away. He was dismissed as chief by the new mayor, who was elected on an anti- corruption ticket. However, he remained a member of the force. Later police career After his dismissal, Brown attempted to get elected as sheriff of Ramsey County, Minnesota. According to FBI informants, members of Dillinger's gang, particularly Homer Van Meter, paid $1500 into Brown's election campaign, but he was unsuccessful.George Russell Girardin et al, Dillinger, The Untold Story, Indiana University Press, 2004, p. 340 Despite suspicions against him Brown was appointed to the newly formed Kidnap Squad. With prohibition over, local criminals turned to new sources of income. Racketeers Jack Piefer and Harry Sawyer suggested that the Barker-Karpis gang should move into kidnapping. They kidnapped wealthy businessman William Hamm. Brown informed them of plans by police to trap them. The ransom money was successfully collected, and a cut given to Brown. Another kidnapping followed. Edward Bremer, a local businessman, was snatched on his way to work after dropping his daughter at school on January 15, 1934. The FBI became actively involved. When it became evident that leaks were coming from the local Kidnap Squad, Brown was isolated from the investigation. Homer Van Meter was repeatedly shot by Brown as he lay on the ground On August 23, 1934 Brown was involved in the killing of former ally Homer Van Meter at the corner of Marion Street and University Avenue in St. Paul. Van Meter was lured to a supposed meeting, but was confronted by four police officers who were waiting for him, led by Chief of Police Frank Cullen. All were heavily armed with rifles and Brown carried a Thompson submachine gun.Morton, James, The Mammoth Book of Gangs, Constable & Robinson Ltd., (2012), p. 1931 The officers later claimed Van Meter ignored their command to stop and fled into a nearby alley, where he fired twice on the officers with a .45 caliber pistol. Chief Cullen, armed with a rifle, held his fire as a bystander walked past, but the remaining officers opened fire on Van Meter, who fell dead.\\"Homer Van Meter Walks Into Police Trap and Dies Shooting\\", Lawrence Journal-World, 24 August 1934 He was 27 years old. Brown continued to fire at Van Meter as he lay prone; the impact of the bullets ripped off one finger and nearly severed a thumb and finger of the right hand.Dillinger Mob Man Shot Down, Prescott Evening Courier, 24 August 1934 The body was found to be armed with a .45-caliber Colt automatic pistol. The number and severity of Van Meter's wounds were attributed to the use of the Thompson submachine gun. Van Meter's family later said that their kin had been used for \\"target practice\\". By this time Brown was under investigation by the FBI. Many of the kidnappers had been arrested and detained by the beginning of 1935. A great deal of information about Brown's involvement given by minor gang members Edna Murray and Byron Bolton. As a result, Brown was dismissed from the force. However, as most of the evidence was hearsay, Brown was not arrested or charged. He challenged his dismissal, but the evidence of his corruption was considered sufficient to justify it. Later life Brown moved away to open a liquor store. He continued in the profession for some years, but was later arrested for non-payment of tax and for operating without a license. He was sentenced to a year in jail, but the sentence was suspended. He died of a heart attack in 1959.

He works for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) as a tecnico (lucha libre term for those that portray the \\"good guys\\") and has previously worked for the International Wrestling League (IWL). Prior to October 2016 he worked as the masked Gotita de Plata (Spanish for \\"Silver Droplet\\") character, first in the Mini-Estrella and then in the regular sized division. Máscara de Bronce's birth name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.In Mexico newspapers and magazines do not report masked wrestlers real names even if they could find out through research, nor do they show clear pictures where you can see most or all of the face of a masked wrestler, normally blurring it out. Personal life While masked wrestlers in Mexico often do not reveal a lot about their personal life Máscara de Bronce has confirmed that he is the son of Hidalgo wrestler El Vengador and the brother of wrestlers Halcón NegroNot related to the Halcón Negro Jr. who wrestled in the 1990s and Halcón Suicida as well as the cousin of Pequeño Ángel and female wrestler Chica Dinamita. Professional wrestling career Using the name Gotita de Plata he made his in-ring debut on November 5, 2009, against Rayito del Sol (Little Ray of Sunshine), making him only 11 years old at the time. To obscure the fact that he was only 11 when he began wrestling he was booked as a Mini-Estrella, working with other wrestlers who were not necessarily little people but generally short of stature. His early matches were closely monitored by his father and older brothers, only working the occasional match while still in school. Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), one of Mexico's largest wrestling promotions, held the 2012 version of their Quien Pinta Para La Corona (\\"Who Desires the Crown\\") competition, a contest used to evaluate young wrestlers and invite the top prospects to work a match or two for AAA show before the judges chose the best male, female and Mini- Estrella to get an AAA contract. For the 2012 version AAA visited Monterrey, Campeche, Puebla and Guadalajara to evaluate wrestlers, it is not clear which location Gotita de Plata auditioned in or if he was invited to wrestle a tryout match in some other way. The actual try out matches took place on September 12, 2012, in Mexico City in front of a panel of AAA judges and officials. In the first match Gotita de Plata teamed up with fellow Mini- Estrellas Lucky Boy and Rey Celestial, losing to Heylex, Mini Excorcista and Los Gemelos Muertes (who did not compete in the Mini-Estrella division).Records are not clear on who the fourth person on Gotita's team was. Later in the night Gotita de Plata, Pequeño Bonsai and Rey Celestial defeated the team of Heylex, Mini Diamond and Mini Exorcista. In the end Rey Celestial won the Minis division contest, but Gotita de Plata impressed the AAA officials enough that they brought him back in May 2013 as part of the regular sized division, teaming with Flamita and Saturno to defeat the team of Carta Brava Jr., Danny Casas and Eterno in the opening match of the show. Following his experiences with AAA Gotita de Plata began working in the regular sized division full-time, working for the International Wrestling League (IWL) in 2013. On the IWL 3rd Anniversary Show he lost to Flyer in the third match of the night. In late 2014 he returned to AAA and began working opening show matches for AAA television tapings, often with opening match wrestlers such as Argenis, Ludxor, Venum and Niño Hamburguesa as he continues his in-ring training, supervised by AAA high flyer Aero Star. =Máscara de Bronce (2016-2020)= On October 28, 2016 AAA presented Gotita de Plata under a new ring character, \\"Máscara de Bronce\\" (\\"Bronze Mask\\") complete with a new mask and full body suit. He teamed up with Aerostar and Venum, losing to Super Fly, Parka Negra and Dave the Clown. In 2017, he joined Venum's \\"La Nueva Real Fuerza Aerea\\" group with Lancelot. During subsequent event in Iraputo, Bronce failed to capture the GFW World Heavyweight Championship from Eli Drake On July 10, 2020, Bronze announced his departure from the promotion through social networks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was written by Lizzie Mickery and directed by Marcos Siega. Summary Ryan and Claire discuss what happened on the day Ryan was told Claire died. Ryan expresses his disbelief that Claire is actually there and Claire expresses her desire to have Joe dead. Joe and Emma watch Kingston Tanner, a pastor, in an interview with Carrie where he calls Joe out for being the anti-Christ. Emma asks Joe if he believes in God and Joe says he doesn't. Joe also says he wants to teach Kingston a lesson. Carrie's car gets stuck in traffic behind a big truck. Four of Joe's followers, Angela, Robert, Lucas, and Tilda, attack Carrie's driver and body guard. Tilda hands Carrie a phone with Joe on the line, who informs her she must again broadcast a message of his, or he'll come after her and everyone she loves. Ryan asks Carrie to not broadcast the clip until he watches it, in case it's a message for Joe's followers. Mandy is approached by two men at a random building. She pulls out a knife in fear but sees Mark, who tells her the men are there to ensure their safety. Mark asks Mandy where Joe is, but she refuses to tell him, saying Joe doesn't want anyone to know. Mark brings her home to Lily, who bakes Mandy chocolate cake as Mandy admires the house. Lily asks Mandy where Joe is and violently slaps her when she refuses to tell. Claire and Ryan watch Joe's video, which turns out to be a threat to Kingston through bible quotes. They conclude that Joe is going to go after Kingston's son, Preston, who goes to college in Connecticut. Claire insists she go with Ryan and Ryan hesitantly agrees, but once at his car, sends Claire a text message saying \\"Sorry\\" and leaves with Mike, asking Max to introduce herself to Claire and keep her safe. Max lets Claire into the room where Ryan does his researching. Max tells Claire that Ryan fell apart after he thought Claire died. Claire says that she had to do what was best for her son, and Max says she only wants what's best for her uncle. Angela, Robert, Lucas, and Tilda arrive at Preston's frat house. They're stopped by a security guard, but stab him in the back of their van. Along the drive to the college, Mike tries to explain what happened with Claire, but Ryan repeatedly tells him that it's okay. Tilda and Lucas enter the frat house and go up to Preston's room, where his roommate is making out with a girl while Preston isn't there. They kill the roommate and girl after the roommate repeatedly calls Tilda \\"fatty.\\" Robert and Lucas superglue masks to everyone's faces inside, and trap them in a room. Preston gets home with a girl and Tilda slits the girl's throat in front of Preston after he begs God to keep her alive. Ryan and Mike enter the frat house and find the room with the masked hostages. Lucas comes charging out of the room and Mike shoots him dead. Tilda, Robert, and Angela drive off with Preston as a hostage. Ryan gets into his car and follows them. Mike calls Ryan, who says he needs to end this by killing Joe and asks Mike to take care of Claire and Max, hanging up the phone before Mike can get another word in and eventually throwing his phone out of the window once he arrives at Korban. Emma shows Joe surveillance footage of Mandy climbing over a gate and leaving. At Lily's, Mark and Luke burn Mandy's wrist over a candle's flame when she again refuses to tell where Joe is. Emma realizes that Mandy got one of Lily's number and must have gone to her. Joe calls Lily demanding Mandy be kept unharmed. Lily gives the phone to Mandy, who says she didn't tell them anything. Lily tells Joe he can come get Mandy in person or she will die. Joe tells Mandy he loves her, which she says back, and Joe hangs up the phone. Joe angrily tells Emma she should have tried harder to get close to Mandy, but Emma disagrees, saying he shouldn't have ever brought her, which visibly upsets Joe, who clearly is very angry at and blames Emma for Mandy's death. Lily, Mark, and Luke have dinner with Mandy's dead body sitting in a chair at the table. Joe watches as Carrie broadcasts his video. Carrie then goes to Ryan's apartment and asks Mike and Max to talk to Ryan, apologizing for showing the video but saying she did so out of fear because Ryan never followed up about it. She says she only wants to help Ryan but Mike tells her that he's not there. Claire overhears the conversation and confronts Carrie, saying if she wants to help Ryan, she should help her. Robert, Tilda, and Angela arrive back at Korban with Preston and Joe meets with them, none of them realizing that Ryan has followed them back and is now on Korban grounds.

He is currently the head coach of the Mercyhurst Lakers men's ice hockey team, a position he has held since 1988. Career Gotkin began attending SUNY-Brockport in 1978, managing to work his way onto the varsity ice hockey team in his final two years there before graduating in 1982. He spent one additional year with the program as an assistant the following season. By 1986 he was back in the college ranks as an assistant coach for Rensselaer. After two campaigns with the Engineers he received his first head coaching opportunity at Mercyhurst. When Gotkin arrived in Erie the college's ice hockey program was only a year old. He took over after Fred Lane led the team to a very good 16-7 mark the year before and while Gotkin's first season was disappointing at 11-16-1 he soon brought the Lakers to Division III prominence with at least 18 wins in four consecutive seasons. Mercyhurst made their first postseason appearance in his third year and their first National Championship appearance by year five (the Lakers by that time having moved up to Division II). Gotkin would lead the Lakers to their first 20-win season two years later (as well as their second championship game) wasn't able to push them any further for the rest of their time in D-II. A year after the MAAC ice hockey conference was formed Mercyhurst was invited to join alongside Bentley and they became a Division I program for the 1999–00 season. The Lakers started off strong, finishing with a second place finish in their inaugural year, before winning the conference tournament the following season and making their first NCAA tournament appearance. Gotkin would get the Lakers to three consecutive regular season crown from 2001 thru 2003 and a second NCAA berth in '03 but after the season the MAAC conference dissolved when founding members Iona and Fairfield dropped their programs. Fortunately for Gotkin and the rest of the programs, the remaining universities continued to support their teams and formed a new conference, Atlantic Hockey which began play in 2003–04. Gotkin and the Lakers weren't quite as successful in the second version as they were in the MAAC but he still helped the team to several 20-win seasons, a tournament title in 2005, a regular season title in 2013–14 and notched his 500th win during the 2015–16 season. Gotkin signed a 5-year extension that will keep him with the team through the 2020 season.

In conventional microinverter designs that work with one-phase power, the energy from the panel must be stored during the period where the voltage is passing through zero, which it does twice per cycle (at 50 or 60 Hz). In a three phase system, throughout the cycle, one of the three wires has a positive (or negative) voltage, so the need for storage can be greatly reduced by transferring the output of the panel to different wires during each cycle. The reduction in energy storage significantly lowers the price and complexity of the converter hardware, as well as potentially increasing its expected lifetime. Concept =Background= Conventional alternating current power is a sinusoidal voltage pattern that repeats over a defined period. That means that during a single cycle, the voltage passes through zero two times. In European systems the voltage at the plug has a maximum of 230 V and cycles 50 times a second, meaning that there are 100 times a second where the voltage is zero, while North American derived systems are 120 V 60 Hz, or 120 zero voltages a second. Inexpensive inverters can convert DC power to AC by simply turning the DC side of the power on and off 120 times a second, inverting the voltage every other cycle. The result is a square-wave that is close enough to AC power for many devices. However, this sort of solution is not useful in the solar power case, where the goal is to convert as much of the power from the solar power into AC as possible. If one uses these inexpensive types of inverters, all of the power generated during the time that the DC side is turned off is simply lost, and this represents a significant amount of each cycle. To address this, solar inverters use some form of energy storage to buffer the panel's power during those zero-crossing periods. When the voltage of the AC goes above the voltage in the storage, it is dumped into the output along with any energy being developed by the panel at that instant. In this way, the energy produced by the panel through the entire cycle is eventually sent into the output. The problem with this approach is that the amount of energy storage needed when connected to a typical modern solar panel can only economically be provided through the use of electrolytic capacitors. These are relatively inexpensive but have well-known degradation modes that mean they have lifetime expectancy on the order of a decade. This has led to a great debate in the industry over whether or not microinverters are a good idea, because when these capacitors start to fail at the end of their expected life, replacing them will require the panels to be removed, often on the roof. =Three-phase= Alternating current (green) repeatedly passes through zero voltage, during which time the energy from the panel must be stored or lost. Three-phase power (blue) remains positive throughout its cycle and thus requires little or no storage. In comparison to normal household current on two wires, current on the delivery side of the power grid uses three wires and phases. At any given instant, the sum of those three is always positive (or negative). So while any given wire in a three-phase system undergoes zero- crossing events in exactly the same fashion as household current, the system as a whole does not, it simply fluctuates between the maximum and a slightly lower value. A microinverter designed specifically for three-phase supply can eliminate much of the required storage by simply selecting which wire is closest to its own operating voltage at any given instant. A simple system could simply select the wire that is closest to the maximum voltage, switching to the next line when that begins to approach the maximum. In this case, the system only has to store the amount of energy from the peak to the minimum of the cycle as a whole, which is much smaller both in voltage difference and time. This can be further improved further by selecting the wire that is closest to its own DC voltage at any given instant, instead of switching from one to the other purely on a timer. At any given instant two of the three wires will have a positive (or negative) voltage and using the one closer to the DC side will take advantage of slight efficiency improvements in the conversion hardware. The reduction, or outright elimination, of energy storage requirements, simplifies the device and eliminates the one component that is expected to define its lifetime. Instead of a decade, a three-phase microinverter could be built to last for the lifetime of the panel. Such a device would also be less expensive and less complex, although at the cost of requiring each inverter to connect to all three lines, which possibly leads to more wiring. =Disadvantages= The primary disadvantage of the three-phase inverter concept is that the only sites with three-phase power than can take advantage of these systems. Three-phase is easily available at utility-scale and commercial sites, and it was to these markets that the systems were aimed. However, the main advantages of the microinverter concept involve issues of shading and panel orientation, and in the case of large systems, these are easily addressed by simply moving the panels around, the benefits of the three-phase micro are very limited compared to the residential case with limited space to work in. As of 2014, observers believed that three-phase micros had not yet managed to reach the price point where their advantages appeared worthwhile. =Combining phases= It is important to contrast a native three-phase inverter with three single-phase micro-inverters wired to output in three-phase. The latter is a relatively common feature of most inverter designs, allowing you to connect three identical inverters together, each across a pair of wires in a three-phase circuit. The result is three- phase power, but each inverter in the system is outputting a single phase. These sorts of solutions do not take advantage of the reduced energy storage needs outlined above.

It is named for the mountainous Arcady region of Greece. Gilbert White's seminal piece \\"Natural History of Selbourne\\" promotes a benign attitude towards nature and advocates for a peaceful coexistence between organisms. It was an individual realization of ancient arcadian ideas of harmonious interactions between humans and nature. The evolution of Arcadian ecological thought continuously reverts to the detailed letters and poems in this work.Worster, Donald. Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.White, Gilbert. The natural history and antiquities of Selborne. Methuen: The Aberdeen University Press Limited, 1901. The harmonious relationship described by Arcadian ecology establishes a responsibility to resist the domination of nature. Donald Worster in his book, Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas, uses Imperial ecology as a counterpoint to Arcadian ecology. Imperial ecology takes a different approach, and suggests that humans should attempt to manage nature, because nature exists for man's benefit (utilitarianism). This contradiction is representative of the ecologists' struggle to explain humanity's relationship with nature while considering popular theological views of the time period. The discussion of Arcadian versus Imperial ecology would continue with prominent figures of the field such as Henry David Thoreau and Charles Darwin. The long term implications of this debate have the potential to shape nature in the future as humans struggle with ethical debates and laws for preservation.Oelschlaeger, Max. \\"Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective.\\" Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print. History The Arcadian standpoint has its roots in several historical and cultural traditions which have shaped the study of ecology. One of these such cultural traditions was the Renaissance, which cultivated the appreciation of landscape, wilderness, and nature. Environmental sociologist Kris van Koppendr.ir. C.S.A. (Kris) van Koppen, CV underscores this point by arguing, \\"The social theories that belong to the arcadian approach are particularly orientated to the recognition, elaboration and extension of the intrinsic values of nature, as well as to the social organization of their preservation\\".van Koppen, C.S.A.(Kris). \\"Resource, Arcadia, Lifeworld. Nature Concepts in Environmental Sociology.\\" Sociologia Ruralis 3 (2000): 300-318. Print. Arcadian ecology can be understood by its contrasts with another prominent view, Imperial Ecology. Sociologists and historians define Imperial Ecology as the standpoint that nature is a force to be dominated in the quest for human convenience. It is in this difference that it can be clearly seen that the arcadian approach criticizes 'resourcism' and 'reductionism'. Therefore, sociologists and ecologists who subscribe to the notion of arcadian ecology view natural disasters like the Dust Bowl as stemming directly from conceptions of nature like imperial ecology. Within arcadian ecological thought, there has been a recent focus on the relationship between humans and animals. This comes primarily from Keith Tomas and his work Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500–1800 published in 1983. This contribution began to highlight animal rights and the inhumane treatment of animals between 1500 and 1800. In a similar vein, Lynn White reflected on the shift from the biblical idea that animals were put on earth to serve man, to the realization that man must live in harmony with beast.White, L. The historical roots of our ecological crisis Science 155 (3767). 1967. Print Ethical implications Ethical and political implications of the Arcadian Ecology viewpoint are ever popular in scholarly and media debates during the twenty-first century. The debate however, did not begin during the current time but rather has progressed over many centuries as humans attempt to grapple with their short-term and long-term environmental impact. Max Oelschlaeger remarks, \\"Nearly 50 years ago Aldo Leopold identified the basic problem of conservation: learn how to live on the land without spoiling it\\".Oelschlaeger, Max. \\"Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective.\\" Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print. It would also not even be fifteen years later when Rachel Carson wrote about Neanderthal science and its unreflective practitioners.Oelschlaeger, Max. \\"Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective.\\" Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print. =United States conservation debate= A more reflective look at the United States' environmental practices can show in depth the struggle of a relatively new country, with substantial economic means, to come to an agreement on appropriate actions regarding nature. Historically the United States has had significant expansion and over-resourcing. The many national parks and government-protected environmental lands were in part created because there was over-farming and development. Teddy Roosevelt used his position as the United States President to set aside more than 194 million acres of park land. Karl Jacoby, an expert in environmental history, has written how the Adirondack Park in New York was created to ensure a continued water source to the New York City population and a natural environment to “recharge” from city life.Jacoby, Karl. Crimes against nature: Squatters, poachers, thieves, and the hidden history of American conservation. University of California Press, 2001. Not all United States National Parks were created for reasons other than nature preservation, such as Yosemite National Park. Originally it was set aside as land to be undeveloped by those who predicted that land conservation may become important in the future. For classification purposes, those ecologists that saw a need to refuse a developmental and destructive path for Yellowstone ascribe to the arcadian ecology view. However, this originally Arcadian movement was opposed, when San Francisco need a viable water supply after a devastating earthquake. This conservation issue sparked a major debate over the Hetch Hetchy. The debate pitted major thinkers against each other including John Muir who thought there was \\"no holier temple than Yosemite\\" and Gifford Pinchot who was in favor of damming to provide water resources to San Francisco.Stradling, David. Conservation in the Progressive Era: Classic Texts. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004. Print. The Hetch Hetchy examines the dichotomy of arcadian and imperial ecology. In addition to National Parks, the United States has put many laws into motion regarding environmental protection including the National Environmental Policy Act (1969), the Wilderness Act (1964), and the Endangered Species Act (1973). These laws all celebrate the Arcadian harmony between nature and humans and ensure its preservation. Unfortunately, Americans, according to Max Oelschlaeger, are also, \\"the world’s leading consumers: our ecological footprints tread heavily on other parts of the planet\\".Oelschlaeger, Max. \\"Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective.\\" Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print. One of the major problems in determining if there has been success in terms of the environment in the United States is the subjectivity that comes with this environmental issue. A look at the work by Eliot Brownlee, a professor of economic history, will suggest that the United States is an economic success story that utilized the natural resources to the best of their abilities. The view looks at nature not as a pawn, but a means to an end in production which has advanced the human race further than ever thought possible.Brownlee, Eliot. 1974, The Dynamics of Ascent: A History of the American Economy. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Print. In opposition, a prominent environmental philosopher, Joseph Petulla, wrote a different story of the landscape of Brownlee. He saw the economic success coming at a costly price of the destruction of the American land. Western civilization had encroached too far into nature and it was more reminiscent of Imperial Ecology rather than Arcadian Ecology.Petulla, Joseph M. American environmental history.

Interviews * ChicagoArts Interview with Artist Adelheid Mers ChicagoArts Interview with Artist Adelheid Mers * art21 Inside the Artists Studio Inside the Artists Studio Part 1 * Inside the Artists Studio 2 Inside the Artists Studio Part 2 Artist statement I make diagrams that map paths through existing formations—books or essays by particular authors, but also institutions and organizations. As a compulsive learner, something I do well is to make out relations, and to hold in mind multiple points of view. Mostly, my diagrams are specific to a site or to an occasion. Most are closely related to the arts, dealing with the artist as citizen and with beliefs and habits that permeate art worlds. This may sound solipsistic, but as the arts have since the sixties been increasingly framed in relation to economy, sciences and politics, this is an entry into a wide range of issues. What fascinates me in any context is how people make sense, myself included. The emphasis is on the activity, not on the result. Beliefs—cultural, political, religious—may initially be products of indoctrination and of habit, but once scrutinized, they tend to squirm, to shift, to make away, in short, they reveal themselves as being in flux. That of course is one reason why to examine how one makes sense can be upsetting, and why techniques to affect and arrest critical thinking are employed by those seeking power over others. I am making work that is intended to provoke audiences to give it a shot, or to at least watch how I not only struggle through the underbrush, but also have fun with it. I don't think that the gumption to try to discern \\"the rules\\" as much as one's own tenets, and then to take responsibility for one's understanding, is necessarily tied to class, or even to education. The levels of sophistication may vary, but the impulse seems to arise in many contexts. Thus, I feel that I can work with many audiences, if I can only get exposed to them.I have no shortage of subject matter, since each arising opportunity carries that in it. How to offer more effective entries into my work now occupies my attention. The documentation that best captures my work includes the people who participate in it. If I want to continue to present diagrams, which I do, I need to increasingly present instances of their uses as well. I am scheduling more opportunities for formal and informal conversations. My experience is that most viewers are interested in inserting themselves. Diagrams are testing grounds for scenarios that may or may not turn out to be convincing. I am seeking ways to emphasize this open-endedness, to document it with video, make it available not just for the duration of a presentation, but also as representation that can exist in conjunction with a diagram later, as a mode of its use. By opening up my ways of making sense for public scrutiny, by mingling my points of view with those of others, I am framing myself as an artist who explores contemporary techniques of learning and of teaching through the arts. These techniques emphasize not to teach \\"down\\", but to respect and in turn learn from those one encounters. I am not an activist who supports a particular subject, but an artist who supports a particular mode of being in the world—respect, responsibility and, as much as possible, fearlessness. - Adelheid Mers Mer's Statement, Mapping Project Peck School of Art, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI Projects *Moral Politics and World of Art' Moral Politics and World of Art *Fractal 3Line Matrix - Granting for Arts Organizations and Individual Artists, seen from Artists' Perspectives.

Stollings played college basketball at Ohio State University and Ohio University. After serving as an assistant coach at various colleges from 2000 to 2011 and briefly as interim head coach at New Mexico State in 2003, Stollings was head coach at Winthrop from 2011 to 2012, VCU from 2012 to 2014, Minnesota from 2014 to 2018, and Texas Tech from 2018 to 2020. Stollings led Winthrop to a winning record in her single season at the school and VCU to the 2014 WNIT. Additionally, Stollings twice took Minnesota to the NCAA Tournament, in 2015 and 2018. In two seasons at Texas Tech, Stollings inherited a losing program and achieved a winning record in her second season of 2019–20. However, months after that season, Stollings was fired following a USA Today story that revealed allegations of abusive treatment of players. Early life and playing career Stollings grew up in Beaver, Ohio, where she attended Eastern High School. As of 2017, her career point total of 3,514 is the high school basketball career scoring record in Ohio, ahead of LeBron James's 2,657. As a senior in 1992–93, Stollings was a Kodak All-American. From 1993 to 1995, Stollings played college basketball at Ohio State University under head coach Nancy Darsch. At guard, Stollings averaged 6.0 points and 1.1 rebounds in her first season in 1993–94.http://stats.ncaa.org/team/518/stats/12769 The following season in 1994–95, Stollings averaged 5.4 points and 1.2 rebounds.http://stats.ncaa.org/team/518/stats/13221 In 1995, Stollings transferred to Ohio University, where she played for the Ohio Bobcats from 1996 to 1998 under head coach Marsha Reall. In her debut season with Ohio in 1996–97, Stollings averaged 10.1 points and 3.1 rebounds.http://stats.ncaa.org/team/519/stats/13222 As a senior on the 1997–98 team, which went 17–11 (13–5 Mid-American Conference), Stollings was Ohio's leading scorer with 22.9 points per game, in addition to 4.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists.http://stats.ncaa.org/team/519/stats/10161 Stollings was a Kodak honorable mention All-American in 1998 and graduated from Ohio University that year as a double major with a B.B.A. in marketing and B.S. in sport industry. After graduating from college, Stollings played professional basketball for two years, first for Club ABB Baden in Switzerland in 1998–99. Then in 1999, Stollings was invited to the training camp of the WNBA team Utah Starzz. In 2001, Stollings played for the Mobile Majesty of the National Women's Basketball League. Coaching career =Assistant coach (2000–2011)= Stollings began her college coaching career as an assistant coach at Jacksonville University in the 2000–01 season. In 2001, Stollings began the first of two seasons as an assistant coach at New Mexico State under Nikita Lowry Dawkins, who was then named Nikita Lowry. Early in 2003, New Mexico State fired Lowry following an internal investigation that found that Lowry was physically and verbally abusive towards players. From December 20, 2002 until resigning on February 5, 2003, Stollings was interim head coach, during which she went 9–3. Eventually, New Mexico State won the Sun Belt Conference West Division title. On July 9, 2003, Wright State University hired Stollings as an assistant coach for the Wright State Raiders women's basketball program on the staff of head coach Bridgett Williams. Stollings coached for one season at Wright State. From 2005 to 2007, Stollings was an assistant coach at Saint Louis University under Shimmy Gray-Miller. Stollings was then an assistant coach under Renee Ladner at Ole Miss from 2007 to 2011 and was associate head coach in the 2010–11 season. Stollings helped sign a highly ranked 2009 recruiting class that included Mississippi Gatorade Player of the Year Valencia McFarland. =Winthrop (2011–2012)= In the 2011–12 season, Stollings had her first head coaching job at Winthrop, where Winthrop went 18–13, only the program's second winning season in 26 years and the most total wins by any first-year Winthrop head coach.

Following an 11–0 start, Texas Tech went 18–11 (7–11 Big 12) record in 2019–20, a season that had the Big 12 Tournament and postseason play canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://texastech.com/sports/womens-basketball/schedule/2019-20 USA Today revealed in a story published on August 5, 2020 that 12 players left Texas Tech since Stollings became head coach in 2018 over accusations that Stollings and her staff were verbally abusive and subject players to dangerous forms of conditioning, for instance a requirement for players to have a 90 percent heart rate in practice and games. The day after that story was published, Texas Tech fired Stollings for cause. Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt verbally heard findings on June 29 from an internal investigation into Stollings but took over a month to take disciplinary action, for which Hocutt said on August 7: \\"Have we let these girls down? We have,\\" and \\"While we were aware of the concerns the young women brought forward after the first season, we were not aware of the magnitude to which they had occurred or to the magnitude to which it’d affected the young women in our locker room.\\" Head coaching record References External links *Texas Tech biography *Minnesota biography *VCU biography Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American women's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Ohio Category:Basketball players from Ohio Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball coaches Category:New Mexico State Aggies women's basketball coaches Category:Ohio Bobcats athletes Category:Ohio State Buckeyes women's basketball players Category:Ole Miss Rebels women's basketball coaches Category:Saint Louis Billikens women's basketball coaches Category:Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball coaches Category:VCU Rams women's basketball coaches Category:Winthrop Eagles women's basketball coaches Category:Wright State Raiders women's basketball coaches Category:People from Beaver, Ohio Category:Guards (basketball) ","title":"Marlene Stollings"},{"id":"42433100","text":"Catalan artist Lluïsa Vidal.

Trials were discontinued in 2015, with new trials scheduled to begin March, 2018. It was initially established as a potential drug option for patients suffering pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia. It may also be useful for treating various types of chronic neuropathic pain EMA401 has shown efficacy in preclinical models of shingles, diabetes, osteoarthritis, HIV and chemotherapy. EMA401 is a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (ATR) being developed by the Australian biotechnology company Spinifex Pharmaceuticals. EMA401 target angiotensin II type 2 receptors, which may have importance for painful sensitisation.  History of drug development  Angiotensin II is an octapeptide hormone central to the renin-angiotensin system. It regulates blood pressure control, water fluid homeostasis, and neuronal excitability. Receptor agonists and antagonist of angiotensin II receptors that target various parts of the complicated renin-angiotensin system were developed to increase knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system and aid the development of antihypertensive drug candidates. These investigations led to the discovery of two subtypes of membrane bound G protein-coupled angiotensin receptors within the renin-angiotensin system with vastly different functions: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). ATR is the receptor subtype that was found to be mainly responsible for blood pressure, water fluid regulation, and other classical known physiological actions of angiotensin II on the renin- angiotensin system. Phase I clinical trial have indicated that doses of EMA401 up to 400 mg are safe in humans. Spinifex Pharmaceuticals reported the results of a phase 2 randomised placebo controlled - clinical trial results in which 183 patients with postherpetic neuralgia received either oral EMA401 or placebo for 28 days. Those assigned to EMA401 reported significantly less pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia although the improvement was modest (6.9% better than placebo on a ten point pain scale). There was no evidence of any serious side effects caused by EMA401. Spinifex Pharmaceuticals plans to proceed with larger phase II clinical trial to test higher doses for longer periods of time. A nonrandomized Phase 2 study of EMA401 for the treatment of pain in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy was approved and is currently underway.  Mechanism of action  Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide that regulates blood pressure, controls water fluid balance, and pain perception. It activates two G protein-coupled receptors: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). AngII co- localized in neurons that express substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide suggesting its presence in nociceptors (noxious-stimuli sensing neurons). EMA401 may alleviate pain and provides relief by blocking the AngII induced potentiation which is thought to be coupled to protein kinase A.  Pharmacokinetics  EMA401 is the sodium-salt form of (S)-2-(diphenylacetyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-5-(phenylmethoxy)- 3-isoquinoline carboxylic acid. EMA401 dose of up to 400 mg was tested in healthy male adults without any major adverse effects. EMA401 has been administered orally at a standardized dose of 100 mg twice daily. EMA401 reaches a maximum plasma concentration of 1000 ug/L one-hour after administration of 100 mg of EMA401 in both men and women, as observed in a phase II trial. EMA401 has an elimination half-life of 6 hours on day 1 of drug intake increasing to 12 hours by day seven of drug intake. Total plasma concentration of EMA401 is consistent over 28 days. A steady state of minimum drug plasma concentration is reached by the 8th day of being on the drug. EMA401 does not accumulate in the blood at presently administered doses. EMA401 does not cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore has little effect on the central nervous system.  Adverse effects  No serious adverse effects have been observed with EMA401 in early clinical trials but there is limited evidence Slightly higher frequency of complaints such as pharyngitis, headaches and allergic dermatitis are reported by individuals taking EMA401. Headache frequency was higher in patients receiving EMA401 over placebo in both phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for EMA401.

His work has been performed in New York City, across the United States, in Europe, Canada, Australia and Latin America.

The 1985 premier performance of THEM at PS122 was part of New York's first AIDS benefit.  Biography  = Early years = Charles Houston Jones, born 1951 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was the only child of North Jones and Pauline Jones, née Houston. He attended public primary and secondary school there and he attended his first dance class when he was 16 years old and a junior at William Penn High School. The Harrisburg Community Theater offered free dance classes to teenagers, and as he was involved in theater in school he went. This jazz-based show was his first experience performing dance. He enrolled as an English/Drama major at Gannon College, (now Gannon University) in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1969. There was no dance program and he only studied there for two years before he “accidentally” dropped out. He was traveling the summer after his sophomore year of college with the intention of returning to school in the fall, but he found himself in Israel, and decided to stay there for a year. He worked as a pig farmer for nine months at Kibbutz Lahav in the Negev Desert. Then he worked for three months on a banana plantation at Kibbutz Adamit in the Galilee on the border with Lebanon. Houston-Jones found 1971 to be a propitious time to be in Israel; it was the years between The Six-Day War and The Yom Kippur War and there was a calm atmosphere among the Israelis. He had always been fascinated by collective socialist living situations, so the idea of being on a kibbutz intrigued him. He had never done any kind of heavy farm work and while there he had to get up at 4 AM: feeding pigs, mating them and working in the slaughterhouse. When he moved north to Adamit he worked harvesting bananas, and at the end of most days, he and his comrades would go skinny-dipping in the Mediterranean. He would sometimes dance on the beach in the nude. Houston-Jones was able to take just one dance class that entire year; the African-American choreographer and dancer Gene Hill Sagan was teaching on a nearby kibbutz. It was around this time that he began to use Ishmael as his first name and hyphenated his parents’ surnames, though he never legally changed either. = Philadelphia = After returning to the US in 1972 Houston-Jones moved to Philadelphia. He audited dance classes at Temple University with Helmut Gottschild and Eva Gholson. He then got into the Wigman-based company Group Motion Media Theater About  Group Motion Dance with whom he danced for two years. After leaving Group Motion he began studying improvisation and later performing with Terry Fox and the musician Jeff Cain under the name A Way of Improvising. He also studied with Joan Kerr, Les Ditson, Contact Improvisation with John Gamble and “African” at Ile Ife, the Arthur Hall Afro American Dance Ensemble .The Arthur Hall Collection and Ile Ife Films, Inc It was during this time that he formed a strong comradeship with the visual artist Fred Holland who he met through their mutual involvement with the Painted Bride Art Center. Houston-Jones and Fox were Holland’s first dance teachers. Holland went on to make his own award-winning dance/theater works, some in collaboration with Houston-Jones. Houston-Jones began making his own work in 1976. That year, in collaboration with fellow ex- Group Motion dancer Michael Biello and musician Dan Martin, he formed the gay- men's performance collective Two Men Dancing. This group made four evening- length works, most notably What We’re Made Of in 1980. This piece was begun during his last year in Philadelphia; after living there for seven years, he moved to New York on Thanksgiving Day, 1979. = New York = Houston-Jones arrived in New York in the East Village, Manhattan in early 1980. He did some Contact Improvisation performances at Danspace Project with Danny Lepkoff, with whom he had studied. The East Village community at that time was infused with punk, new wave, drag, drugs and the mixing of a hipper, younger gay population with the modern dance and experimental theater milieux. Houston- Jones, like many dancers at the time, was influenced by the gay/punk/club scene and also by break dancing, graffiti and rap music. The first time Houston-Jones heard future collaborator Chris Cochrane play was at the club 8 BC. Dancers and choreographers would go to 8 BC, Limbo Lounge, the Pyramid Club, or King Tut’s Wah-Wah Hut to see shows and also to perform. There was a palpable excitement and eagerness to see what was happening at venues such as PS 122, The Kitchen, Dance Theater Workshop and Danspace Project at Saint Mark’s Church. There were smaller, grittier spaces as well like Dixon Place mission/history and Chandelier where something new was happening almost every night. With the exception of the Wah-Wah Hut and Chandelier, Houston Jones performed at all of these venues. It was during this time that Houston-Jones first heard Dennis Cooper read from his book The Tenderness of the Wolves, and knew that he wanted to work with him. At around this time, the pall of AIDS began to hover over the dance world. People in the dance and performance art communities were becoming sick and dying. Dance contemporaries of Houston- Jones (John Bernd, Arnie Zane, Harry Sheppard, et al.) died at this time. Houston-Jones volunteered with the organization God's Love We Deliver,God's Love We Deliver: About Us: Mission In Action and brought meals to people who were left homebound by the disease. Also during the early 1980s Houston-Jones traveled twice to Nicaragua. He was there while the Sandinista government was at war with the US-funded Contras. For two weeks in 1983 he was part of a North American delegation at a theater festival and as a guest of the state. He was chauffeured in buses, housed in a hotel, fed in restaurants and generally pampered. The following year, 1984, he returned on his own, staying in a family’s rented room and getting around on his own, which he found extremely difficult. He had met some people on his first trip who had arranged for him to teach at the University of Central America, Managua. He taught contact improvisation to Sandinista soldiers. Students would show up in their fatigues, wearing leotards underneath. They would change and prop their rifles against the wall. He was in Nicaragua only over a month but after this second visit he became much more engaged with progressive politics and social issues. It was from these experiences, plus losses due to AIDS, and Reaganomics that his work began to shift and pieces like f/i/s/s/i/o/n/i/n/g, Radio Managua and THEM were created. He also made several collaborative pieces, some with Fred Holland and later with the writer Dennis Cooper. He collaborated with several musician/composers who came from the punk and club scenes, most notably, Chris Cochrane from the bands No Safety and Suck Pretty. During this time he was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts and other agencies and he traveled several times to Europe and Venezuela to perform and to teach. Professional work Other significant choreography by Ishmael Houston-Jones includes: 13 Love Songs: dot dot dot, Houston-Jones' collaboration with Emily Wexler which premiered at American Realness in 2014.Ishmael Houston-Jones and Emily Wexler talk about heartbreak No Where /Now Here was commissioned for Mordine and Company in Chicago in spring 2001 and Specimens was commissioned for Headlong Dance Theater in Philadelphia in 1998. In 1997 Houston-Jones was the choreographer for Nayland Blake's Hare Follies at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. From 1995-2000 Houston-Jones was part of the improvisational trio Unsafe / Unsuited with Keith Hennessy and Patrick Scully .Unsafe Unsuited - YouTube In 1990 he and Dennis Cooper presented The Undead at the Los Angeles Festival of the Arts. In 1989 Houston- Jones collaborated with filmmaker Julie Dash on the video Relatives, which featured a performance by his mother, Pauline H. Jones and was aired nationally on the PBS series Alive From Off-Center (Alive TV). Houston-Jones has collaborated with composers King Britt, Chris Cochrane, Fast Forward, Dave Pavkovik, Chris Peck, Tom Recchion, Leslie Ross and Guy Yarden. He was also a longtime collaborator of Blondell Cummings. In addition to his own choreography, Houston-Jones has performed in the work of John Bernd, Ping Chong, Dancenoise, Terry Fox, Beth Gill, Miguel Gutierrez (choreographer), Lionel Popkin, Mike Taylor, and Yvonne Meier. He has a small role, (Dancer) in the John Sayles 1984 film The Brother from Another Planet. and he appears in Caspar Strache's 1998 film Circle's Short Circuit Circle's Short Circuit (1998) - IMDb and The Situation Room, 2004,Ticket Sales - Art Basal Weekend: THE SITUATION ROOM #2 at Miami Beach Cinematheque on 12/4/2005 8:30 PM directed by Steve Staso. = Recent = In the early 2000s Houston-Jones made a deliberate decision to stop making dance pieces. He felt that he didn't know what he wanted to say and that he didn't want to just make work just for the sake of making work. He was committed to performing in other people's pieces ( Yvonne Meier, Lionel Popkin, and others), but he didn't feel he had anything new to offer of his own. He did, during this time, make pieces with students at Alfred University, the New School, and at the American Dance Festival. He concentrated on teaching, writing, and serving on the boards of several not- for-profit dance organizations: ( Headlong Dance Theater,ABOUT  headlong dance theater Danspace Project, Movement Research, and Ashley Anderson Dances .about ) Then in 2009, after not making professional dance pieces for eight years, Houston-Jones made The Myth and Trials of Calamity Jane and the Son of the Queen of the Amazons in collaboration with Ashley Anderson and This Ring of Fire in collaboration with Daniel Safer both at Dance New Amsterdam, (DNA). Also in 2009 he was asked to revive three of his works from the 1980s: What We’re Made Of (1980), DEAD (1981), and THEM (1986). All three revivals were completed and performed in 2010. The re-imagined THEM has since toured to four cities in Europe and to Los Angeles. His most recent piece, 13 Love Songs: dot dot dot, a collaboration with Emily Wexler premiered in January 2014 at the American Realness Festival in New York and toured to the American Dance Festival in North Carolina.
