The population in 2011 was 6,406Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 20.13 km². History From the discovery of various archeological vestiges within the territory, including the Cerros Altos region, there is a consensus that human settlement in the area occurred in the 2nd century A.D. (including the remains of forge/foundry and inscription). Other evidence of human occupation in the territory occurred in Ataboeira, where coins and fragments of pots, dated to the Roman occupation were discovered. Complementary evidence includes the visible Moorish influence on local architecture, such as the \\"typical\\" chimneys, the white-painted homes and Açoteias terraces. Ferreiras was part of the parish of Albufeira until 1997, and created on 12 July of that year, with the promulgation of decree 40/97. Geography Alongside the Albufeira-Ferreira railline, showing the topography of the region Ferreiras is one of the five civil parishes Albufeira, located within the referred coastal Algarve, occupying 2,227 hectares of the municipality's 14,066 hectare territory. The parish is centred from the coast, and includes the settlements of Alfarrobeiras, Fontainhas, Lagoas, Mosqueira, Vale Serves, Pinhal, Assumadas, Poço das Canas, Alpouvar, Malhada Velha, Cotovio and Vale Paraíso. In the east is the roadway terminus of the parish, the Ribeira de Quarteira; the waterway, which springs in the north of the parish, results from the confluence of Ribeira de Algibre and Ribeira de Alte, and extends south to Paderne, around its castle. The limits of the new parish extend to the north, to the parish of Paderne and the Escarpão roadway until Ribeira de Quarteira; the south is confined by the Caminho de Ferro, Caminho da Mosqueira and Caminho Municipal 1285 (municipal roadway) and the Estrada Nacional 395; the eastern frontier is limited by the municipality of Loulé; and the western border by the Caminho da Ataboeira and Caminho de Poço das Canas, until the limit of the municipality of Albufeira with Silves. Economy A view of the Ferreiras segment of the Algarve line Agriculture and handicrafts constitute the two principal components of the regions economy, with handicrafts, primarily, complementing the traditional rural lifestyle. In reality, though, agriculture is becoming of secondary importance, with the demise of the older generation and lack of support for traditional agriculture. Yet, the region is still potential source of agricultural development, with optimal growing conditions and climate for the cultivation of almond, fig, olive and carob trees; many of the regions soils are classified within the national agricultural reserve () designation, under the auspices of the Serviço de Reconhecimento e Ordenamento Agrário (Agricultural Land Recognition and Planning Service). In parallel, Ferreiras secondary and tertiary sectors, primarily concentrated on industry, have contributed, along with the rapid increase in the tourism and hotelier sectors since the 1960s.

[...] Repeated malaria infections strengthen adaptive immunity and broaden its effects against parasites expressing different to the good old immunity against malaria.\\" Black nurses aided the sick and the group's leaders hired additional men to take away corpses, which most people would not touch. Blacks in the city died at the same rate as whites, about 240 altogether. Some neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, for fear they were carrying the fever. Major port cities such as Baltimore and New York had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia although New York sent financial aid to the city. Beginnings In the spring of 1793, French colonial refugees, some with slaves, arrived from Cap Français, Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). The 2,000 immigrants were fleeing the slave revolution in the north of the island. They crowded the port of Philadelphia, where the first yellow fever epidemic in the city in 30 years began in August. It is likely that the refugees and ships carried the yellow fever virus and mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted by mosquito bites. Mosquitoes easily breed in small amounts of standing water. The medical community and others in 1793 did not understand the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of yellow fever and other diseases. In the ports and coastal areas of the United States, even in the northeast, the months of August and September were considered the \\"sickly season,\\" when fevers were prevalent. In the South, planters and other people wealthy enough usually left the Low Country during this season. Natives thought that newcomers especially had to undergo a \\"seasoning\\" and were more likely to die of what were thought to be seasonal fevers in their early years in the region.Currie, William, An Historical Account of the Climate and Diseases of the United States, Philadelphia: T. Dobson, 1792 Philadelphia then was the temporary capital of the United States, and the government was due to return in the fall. President George Washington had left the city. The first two people to die of yellow fever in early August in Philadelphia were both recent immigrants, one from Ireland and the other from Saint-Domingue. Letters describing their cases were published in a pamphlet about a month after they died. The young doctor sent by the Overseers of the Poor to treat the Irish woman was perplexed, and his treatment did not save her. A 2013 book by Billy G. Smith, professor of history at Montana State University, makes a case that the principal vector of the 1793 plague in Philadelphia (and other Atlantic ports) was the British merchant ship Hankey, which had fled the West African colony of Bolama (an island off West Africa, present day Guinea-Bissau) the previous November, trailing yellow fever at every port of call in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic seaboard. Epidemic declared After two weeks and an increasing number of fever cases, Dr. Benjamin Rush, a doctor's apprentice during the city's 1762 yellow fever epidemic, saw the pattern; he recognized that yellow fever had returned. Rush alerted his colleagues and the government that the city faced an epidemic of \\"highly contagious, as well as mortal... bilious remitting yellow fever.\\" Adding to the alarm was that, unlike with most fevers, the principal victims were not the very young or very old. Many of the early deaths were teenagers and heads of families in the dockside areas.Butterfield, L. H., editor, Letters of Benjamin Rush, vol. 2, p 641. Believing that the refugees from Saint-Domingue were carrying the disease, the city imposed a quarantine of two to three weeks on immigrants and their goods, but was unable to enforce it as the epidemic increased its reach. Then the largest city in the US, with around 50,000 residents, Philadelphia was relatively compact and most houses were within seven blocks of its major port on the Delaware River. Docking facilities extended from Southwark south of the city to Kensington to the north. Cases of fever clustered at first around the Arch Street wharf. Rush blamed \\"some damaged coffee which putrefied on the wharf near Arch Street\\" for causing the fevers. Soon cases appeared in Kensington. As the port was critical to the state's economy, the Pennsylvania governor, Thomas Mifflin, had responsibility for its health. He asked the port physician, Dr. James Hutchinson, to assess conditions. The doctor found that 67 of about 400 residents near the Arch Street wharf were sick, but only 12 had \\"malignant fevers.\\"American Daily Advertiser, August 28, 1793. Alarmed by what Rush and others told him, Mayor Matthew Clarkson asked the city's medical society, the College of Physicians, to meet and advise the city's government and citizens how to proceed. Rush later described some early cases: On August 7, he treated a young man for headaches, fever and vomiting, and on the 15th treated his brother. On the same day a woman he was treating turned yellow. On the 18th a man in the third day of a fever had no pulse, was cold, clammy, and yellow, but he could sit up in his bed. He died a few hours later. On the 19th a woman Rush visited died within hours. Another physician said five persons within sight of her door died. None of those victims was a recent immigrant. The College published a letter in the city's newspapers, written by a committee headed by Rush, suggesting 11 measures to prevent the \\"progress\\" of the fever. They warned citizens to avoid fatigue, the hot sun, night air, too much liquor, and anything else that might lower their resistance. Vinegar and camphor in infected rooms \\"cannot be used too frequently upon handkerchiefs, or in smelling bottles, by persons whose duty calls to visit or attend the sick.\\" They outlined measures for city officials: stopping the tolling of church bells and making burials private; cleaning streets and wharves; exploding gunpowder in the street to increase the amount of oxygen. Everyone should avoid unnecessary contact with the sick. Crews were sent to clean the wharves, streets and the market, which cheered those remaining in the city.Federal Gazette, August 31, 1793. Many of those who could left the city. Elizabeth Drinker, a married Quaker woman, kept a journal for years; her account from August 23 through August 30 tells the quickening story of the spread of the disease in the city and the rising toll of deaths. She also describes the many people leaving the city. =Temporary hospitals= Like all hospitals of that time, the Pennsylvania Hospital did not admit patients with infectious diseases. Bush Hill. The Seat of Wm. Hamilton Esqr. near Philadelphia, by James Peller Malcolm. Bush Hill was the country seat of James Hamilton by this time. The Guardians of the Poor took over Bush Hill, a 150-acre estate farther outside the city, whose owner William Hamilton was in England for an extended stay. Vice President John Adams had recently rented the main house, so yellow fever patients were placed in the outbuildings. Nurses were hired to treat patients, under orders by young physicians from the city, who were to visit on a daily basis. The end of August was not traditionally a busy time in the city. Many families who could afford to or who had relatives in the countryside lived elsewhere during that hot month. Beginning in September, shipments generally increased with the arrival of fall goods from Britain. In 1793, the Federal Congress was not scheduled to resume session until November, but the Pennsylvania Assembly met in the first week of September. Founded by the Quaker William Penn, the city was the center of Quaker life in the United States. The Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends was scheduled to be held in the third week of September. =Panic and refugees= Between the College's advisory on August 25 and the death of Dr. Hutchinson from yellow fever on September 7, panic spread throughout the city; more people fled. Between August 1 and September 7, 456 people died in the city; 42 deaths were reported on September 8. An estimated 20,000 people left the city through September, including national leaders. The daily death toll remained above 30 until October 26. The worst seven-day period was between October 7 and 13, when 711 deaths were reported. Some neighboring towns had patrols on the roads to prevent entry by refugees. The major ports of Baltimore and New York prevented refugees from entering and quarantined them and goods from Philadelphia for weeks. The publisher Mathew Carey published a short pamphlet later in the fall in which he described the changes that had occurred in the life of the city: > \\"Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with > vinegar of camphor at their noses, or smelling-bottles full of the thieves’ > vinegar. Others carried pieces of tarred rope in their hands or pockets, or > camphor bags tied round their necks.... People hastily shifted their course > at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the > footpath, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected > in passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and friends > avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold > nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many > shrunk back with affright at even the offer of a hand. A person with crape > [mourning crepe], or any appearance of mourning, was shunned like a viper.\\" Black nurses The College of Physicians' advisory implied the fever was contagious and people should avoid contact with its victims although \\"duty\\" required that they be cared for. Yet in families, when the person with the fever was a mother or father, they could forbid their children from coming near them. Rush knew of Dr. John Lining's observation during the 1742 yellow fever epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, that African slaves appeared to be affected at rates lower than whites; he thought they had a natural immunity. Writing a short letter to the newspapers under the pseudonym \\"Anthony Benezet,\\" a Quaker who had provided schooling for blacks, Rush suggested that the city's people of color had immunity and solicited them \\"to offer your services to attend the sick to help those known in distress.\\"American Daily Advertiser, September 2, 1793. Richard Allen and Absalom Jones recalled their reaction to the letter in a memoir they published shortly after the epidemic: > Early in September, a solicitation appeared in the public papers, to the > people of colour to come forward and assist the distressed, perishing, and > neglected sick; with a kind of assurance, that people of our colour were not > liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and > consulted how to act on so truly alarming and melancholy occasion. After > some conversation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in Him who can > preserve in the midst of a burning fiery furnace, sensible that it was our > duty to do all the good we could to our suffering fellow mortals. We set out > to see where we could be useful. The first we visited was a man in Emsley's > alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the house, there > were none to assist but two poor helpless children. We administered what > relief we could, and applied to the overseers of the poor to have the woman > buried. We visited upwards of twenty families that day—they were scenes of > woe indeed! The Lord was plentiful to strengthen us, and removed all fear > from us... > In order the better to regulate our conduct, we called on the mayor the next > day, to consult with him on how to proceed, so as to be the most useful. The > first object he recommended was a strict attention to the sick, and the > procuring of nurses. This was attended to by Absalom Jones and William Gray; > and, in order that the distressed might know where to apply, the mayor > advised that upon application to them they would be supplied. Soon after, > the mortality increased, the difficulty of getting a corpse taken away, was > such, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black > people were looked to. We then offered our services in the public papers, by > advertising that we would remove the dead and procure nurses. Our services > were the production of real sensibility—we sought not fee nor reward, until > the increase of the disorder rendered our labour so arduous that we were not > adequate to the service we had assumed. Allen noted in his account that because of the increase in mortality, he and Jones had to hire five men to assist them in removing corpses, as most people avoided the sick and the dead. In a September 6 letter to his wife, Rush said that the \\"African brethren ... furnish nurses to most of my patients.\\"Butterfield, p. 654 Despite Rush's theory, most of the city's people of color were not immune to the fever. Many of the slaves in Charleston in 1742 could have gained immunity before having been transported from Africa, by having been exposed to yellow fever in a mild case. People who survived one attack gained immunity. A total of 240 blacks died, in proportion to their population at the same rate as whites. Controversy over treatment Given the limited resources and knowledge of the times, the city's response was credible. The medical community did not know the natural history of yellow fever, a viral infection spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Efforts to clean the city did not defeat the spread of the fever as the mosquitoes bred in the clean water. Philadelphia's newspapers continued to publish during the epidemic, and through the doctors and others tried to understand and combat the epidemic. On September 7, Dr. Adam Kuhn advised patients to treat symptoms as they arose; he had studied medicine at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. Rush claimed that he tried Kuhn's and Steven's stimulating remedies, and his patients still died. He recommended other treatments, including purging and bloodletting, and published his theories. The hope offered by any of these treatments was soon dashed when it became clear that they did not cure the disease, and the doctors' competing claims demoralized patients.Butterfield, pp 1213–18. In his 1794 account of the epidemic, Mathew Carey noted that other doctors claimed to have used calomel (a mercury compound) before Rush and that \\"its efficacy was great and rescued many from death.\\" Carey added that the \\"efficacy of bleeding, in all cases not attended with putridity, was great.\\" Rush taught the African-American nurses how to bleed and purge patients. Allen and Jones wrote that they were thankful that \\"we have been the instruments, in the hand of God, for saving the lives of hundreds of our suffering fellow mortals.\\" Rush's brand of medicine became the standard American treatment for fevers in the 1790s and was widely used for the next 50 years.Duffy, William, From Humors to Medical Science, 1993, pp 68–71 Rush's claim that his remedies cured 99 out of 100 patients have led historians and modern doctors to ridicule his remedies and approach to medical science. Some contemporaries also attacked him. The newspaper editor William Cobbett attacked Rush's therapies and called him a Sangrado, after a character in Gil Blas, who bled patients to death. In 1799 Rush won a $5,000 libel judgment against Cobbett. Government responses to crisis The responses of the various levels of government in the city varied. The Federal government had no authority to act and Congress had not been in session since June. President Washington and his cabinet continued to meet until he left the city on September 10 for his scheduled vacation, a period that included laying the cornerstone on September 18 of the new US Capitol to be built in the City of Washington, the designated capital. Employees of the Treasury Department, who collected customs and worked on the country's financial system, worked throughout the epidemic; the post office also stayed open. The state legislature cut short its September session after a dead body was found on the steps of State House. Governor Mifflin became ill and was advised by his doctor to leave. The city's banks remained open. But, banking operations were so slowed by the inability of people to pay off notes because of disruptions from the epidemic that banks automatically renewed notes until the epidemic ended. The mayor Matthew Clarkson organized the city's response to the epidemic. Most of the Common Council members fled, along with 20,000 other residents. People who did not leave Philadelphia before the second week in September could leave the city only with great difficulty, and they faced road blocks, patrols, inspections and quarantines. On September 12, Clarkson summoned fellow citizens interested in helping the Guardians of the Poor. They formed a committee to take over from the Guardians and address the crisis.Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee to Attend to and Alleviate the Sufferings of the Afflicted with the Malignant Fever, 1794. On the 14th, Clarkson was joined by 26 men, who formed committees to reorganize the fever hospital, arrange visits to the sick, feed those unable to care for themselves, and arrange for wagons to carry the sick to the hospital and the dead to Potter's Field. The Committee acted quickly: after a report of 15-month-old twins being orphaned, two days later the Committee had identified a house for sheltering the growing number of orphans. As noted above, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones offered the services of members of the Free African Society to the Committee.Allen and Jones, A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People..., 1993, p. to come. When the Mayor's Committee inspected the Bush Hill fever hospital, they found the nurses unqualified and arrangements chaotic. \\"The sick, the dying, and the dead were indiscriminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the sick, were allowed to remain in the most offensive state imaginable... It was, in fact, a great human slaughter-house.\\" On September 15, Peter Helm, a barrel maker, and Stephen Girard, a merchant and shipowner born in France, volunteered to personally manage the hospital and represent the Mayor's Committee.Minutes, p. 18. They made rapid improvements in hospital operations: bedsteads were repaired and more brought from the prison so patients would not have to lie on the floor. A barn was adapted as a place for convalescing patients. On September 17, the managers hired 9 female nurses and 10 male attendants, as well as a female matron. They assigned the 14 rooms to separate male and female patients. With the discovery of a spring on the estate, workers were organized to have clean water pumped into the hospital. Helm and Girard informed the Committee that they could accommodate more than the 60 patients then under their care, and soon the hospital had 140 patients.Minutes, pp. 17ff. Girard found that the intermittent visits by four young physicians from the city added to the confusion about patient treatment. He hired Jean Deveze, a French doctor with experience treating yellow fever in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Deveze cared only for the patients at the hospital, and he was assisted by French apothecaries. Deveze admired Girard's fearlessness in his devotion to the patients. In a memoir published in 1794, Deveze wrote of Girard: > I even saw one of the diseased ... [discharge] the contents of his stomach > upon [him]. What did Girard do? ... He wiped the patient's cloaths, > comforted [him] ... arranged the bed, [and] inspired with courage, by > renewing in him the hope that he should recover. —From him he went to > another, that vomited offensive matter that would have disheartened any > other than this wonderful man. News that patients treated at the hospital were recovering encouraged many people to believe that medicine was gaining control of the fever. But, it soon became clear that mortality at the hospital remained high; about 50% of those admitted died. Reactions by other cities As the death toll in the city rose, officials in neighboring communities and major port cities such as New York and Baltimore established quarantines for refugees and goods from Philadelphia. New York established a \\"Committee appointed to prevent the spreading and introduction of infectious diseases in this city\\", which set up citizen patrols to monitor entry to the city. Stage coaches from Philadelphia were not allowed in many cities. Havre de Grace, Maryland, for example, tried to prevent people from Philadelphia from crossing the Susquehanna River to Maryland. Neighboring cities did send food supplies and money; for example, New York City sent $5000 to the Mayor's Committee.Minutes, pp 36ff. Woodbury and Springfield, New Jersey; Chester, Pennsylvania and Elkton, Maryland, were among towns that accepted refugees. President Washington corresponded with members of his cabinet on where to assemble if the epidemic prevented Congress from meeting as scheduled in December. Washington decided to hold the cabinet in early November in Germantown, at that time an independent town ten miles from the heart of Philadelphia. Carey's accusations In his 1793 account of the epidemic, Mathew Carey contrasted the sacrifices of men like Joseph Inskeep, a Quaker who served on the Mayor's Committee and also visited the sick, with the selfishness of others. When Inskeep contracted the fever, he asked for the assistance of a family whom he had attended when several of its members were sick. They refused; he died, which might have happened even with their aid. Carey reported their refusal. He published rumors of greed, especially by landlords who threw convalescing tenants into the street to gain control of their flats. While he praised Richard Allen and Absalom Jones for their work, he suggested that blacks had caused the epidemic, and that some black nurses had charged high fees and even stolen from those for whom they cared. Allen and Jones quickly wrote a pamphlet to defend the people of color in the crisis. The historian Julie Winch believes they wanted to defend their community, knowing how powerful Carey was, and wanting to maintain the reputation of their people in the aftermath of the epidemic. The men noted that the first nurses from the Free African Society had worked without any pay. As the mortality rate increased, they had to hire men to get anyone to deal with the sick and dying. They recounted that > the great prices paid did not escape the observation of that worthy and > vigilant magistrate, Matthew Clarkson, mayor of the city, and president of > the committee. He sent for us, and requested we would use our influence to > lessen the wages of the nurses. But on informing him of the cause, i.e. that > of the people over-bidding one another, it was concluded unnecessary to > attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people > concerned. Allen and Jones noted that white nurses also profited and stole from their patients. \\"We know that six pounds was demanded by and paid to a white woman, for putting a corpse into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded and paid to four white men, for bringing it down the stairs.\\" Many black nurses served without compensation: > \\"A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house to house where > distress was, and no assistance, without fee or reward. He was smitten with > the disorder, and died. After his death his family were neglected by those > he had served. Sarah Bass, a poor black widow, gave all the assistance she > could, in several families, for which she did not receive any thing; and > when any thing was offered her, she left it to the option of those she > served.\\" Response of churches Church clergy continued to hold services, which helped keep up residents' morale. Rev. J. Henry C. Helmuth, who led the city's German Lutheran congregation, wrote A Short Account of the Yellow Fever in Philadelphia for the Reflecting Christian. He also left a diary. On September 16 he reported that his church was \\"very full\\" the day before. In one week in October, 130 members of his congregation were buried. On October 13, he wrote in his diary: > Preached to a large gathering about Jes.26,1. I showed that Philadelphia a > very blessed city—the Lord is among us and especially in our congregation. I > proved this with examples of dead and still living people. Baptized a child. > Announced that I could not be with the corpses, that the sick should be > reported to me in the morning so that I could visit them in the > afternoon.Helmuth, Justus Henry Christian, A short account of the yellow > fever in Philadelphia for the reflecting Christian , translated from the > German by Charles Erdmann, Philadelphia: 1794, Open Collections Program: > Contagion, Harvard University Library, accessed 28 March 2012 The Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends at the Arch Street Meeting House drew 100 attendees, most from outside the city. The meetinghouse is not far from the waterfront where the epidemic had started. In their Yearly Epistle following the meeting, the Friends wrote that to have changed the time or place of the meeting would have been a \\"haughty attempt\\" to escape \\"the rod\\" of God, from which there was no escape.\\"Yearly Meeting Epistle 1793,\\" Swarthmore College Library Quaker Collection; see also letter by Margaret Morris to her daughter August 31, 1793, Haverford College Library Manuscript Collection. The Quaker John Todd, who attended the meeting, contracted the fever and died of it. His young widow, Dolley Payne Todd, later married James Madison, a Virginia congressman whom she met in Philadelphia and a future US president. End of the epidemic President's House, Philadelphia. Washington left the plague-ridden city for Mount Vernon on September 10. He and his cabinet reassembled in Germantown in early November. On November 11, Washington visited the city before the official all clear on November 14, but did not reoccupy the President's House until December. Doctors, preachers, and laymen all looked to the coming of autumn to end the epidemic. At first they hoped a seasonal \\"equinoctial gale,\\" or hurricane, common at that time of year, would blow away the fever. Heavy rains in late September seemed to correlate with a higher rate of cases. Residents next anticipated freezing temperatures at night, which they knew were associated with ending fall fevers. By the first two weeks of October and peak of the crisis, gloom pervaded the city. Most churches had stopped holding services, and the post office moved out of the area of the highest number of cases. The market days continued, and bakers continued to make and distribute bread.Federal Gazette, October 5, 1793. Several members of the Mayor's Committee died. African- American nurses had also begun dying of the fever. Carts took ill victims to Bush Hill and the dead to burial grounds. Doctors also suffered illness and death, and fewer were available to care for patients. Three of Rush's apprentices and his sister died; he was too sick to leave his house. Such news cast doubts on Rush's methods, but none of those victims had submitted to his harsh treatment. Those refugees from Saint-Domingue who thought they had immunity used the streets freely, but few other residents did. Those who had not escaped the city tried to wait out the epidemic in their homes. When the Mayor's Committee took a quick census of the dead, they found that the majority of victims were poor people, who died in homes located in the alleys, behind the main streets where most of the business of city was conducted.Minutes, pp. 51, 241ff. On October 16, after temperatures cooled, a newspaper reported that \\"the malignant fever has very considerably abated.\\"Federal Gazette, October 16, 1793 Stores began to reopen October 25, many families returned, and the wharves were \\"once more enlivened\\" as a London-based ship arrived with goods.Federal Gazette, October 25, 1793. The Mayor's Committee advised people outside the city to wait another week or 10 days before returning. It published directions for cleaning houses which had been closed up, recommending that they be aired for several days with all windows and doors open. \\"Burning of nitre will correct the corrupt air which they may contain. Quick lime should be thrown into the privies and the chambers whitewashed.\\" On the 31st, a white flag was hoisted over Bush Hill with the legend, \\"No More Sick Persons Here.\\"Federal Gazette, November 1, 1793. But, after some warm days, fever cases recurred. The white flag had to be struck. Finally on November 13, stagecoaches resumed service to the north and south. A merchant reported that the streets were \\"in an uproar and rendered the wharves impossible by reason of the vast quantities of wine, sugar, rum, coffee, cotton & c. The porters are quite savvy and demand extravagantly for anything they do.\\"Welsh papers, November 13, 1793, Historical Society of Pennsylvania. On November 14, the Mayor's Committee recommended purifying houses, clothing and bedding, but said that anyone could come to the city \\"without danger from the late prevailing disorder.\\"Minutes, p. 120. Lists of the dead An official register of deaths listed 4044 people as dying between August 1 and November 9, 1793 based on grave counts, so the total was probably higher. City officials, medical and religious leaders, and newspaper publishers reported the number and names of victims, based on the minutes of the Mayor's Committee. The Appendix of on-line edition of Minutes lists the names of all the patients admitted to Bush Hill hospital, as well as the disposition of their cases.Minutes, pp. 205–232. The publisher Mathew Carey released his history of the epidemic just weeks after its end. He listed the names of the dead at the back of the book, which is one reason it was a bestseller. While Deveze did not reveal his patients' names in describing his treatments, Rush named his patients in his memoir. Controversies over the epidemic The end of the epidemic did not end the controversies among the city's doctors, who disagreed about causes and treatment. Hearing rumors that colleagues were going to try to get him expelled from the College of Physicians, Rush resigned and formed a new medical society, which many of the city's younger doctors joined. Rush's promotion of his remedies and attacks on others were strongly criticized by the medical community. =Cause= Merchants worried more about Rush's theory that the fever arose from the filth of Philadelphia and was not imported from the West Indies. They did not want the port's reputation to suffer permanently. Doctors used his treatments while rejecting his etiology of the disease. Others deprecated his therapies, such as Dr. Deveze, but agreed that the fever had local origins. Deveze had arrived on the refugee ship from Saint-Domingue which many accused of having carried the disease, but he thought it healthy. The doctors did not understand the origin or transmittal of the disease. Historians believe it was brought by refugees from Saint- Domingue, where it was endemic, and transmitted by mosquitoes between the infected and healthy persons. =Differing courses of treatment= Dr. Kuhn advised drinking wine, \\"at first weaker wines, such as claret and Rhenish; if these cannot be had, Lisbon or Madeira diluted with rich lemonade. The quantity is to be determined by the effects it produces and by the state of debility which prevails, guarding against its occasioning or encreasing the heat, restlessness or delirium.\\" He placed \\"the greatest dependence for the cure to the disease, on throwing cool water twice a day over the naked body. The patient is to be placed in a large empty tub, and two buckets full of water, of the temperature 75 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit's thermometer, according to the state of the atmosphere, are to be thrown on him.\\" The water treatment was also advocated by Dr. Edward Stevens, who in mid-September claimed it had cured Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, of the fever.General Advertiser, September 11, 1793, also in Rush, pp. 207ff Rush searched the medical literature for other approaches. Benjamin Franklin had given him letters sent by Dr. John Mitchell, related to treating patients during a 1741 yellow fever outbreak in Virginia. (Franklin never published the letters.) Mitchell noted that the stomach and intestines filled with blood and that these organs had to be emptied at all costs. \\"On this account,\\" Mitchell argued, \\"an ill-timed scrupulousness about the weakness of the body is of bad consequences in these urging circumstances.... I can affirm that I have given a purge in this case, when the pulse has been so low that it can hardly be felt, and the debility extreme, yet both one and the other have been restored by it.\\"In a manuscript of 1744, Dr. John Mitchell of Virginia detailed his observations and treatments of victims of a \\"yellow fever\\" epidemic in 1741–2; copies of the manuscript were sent to Mr. Cadwallader Colden, a physician in New York, and to Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia; the manuscript was eventually printed (in large part) in 1805 and reprinted (in full) in 1814. See: * (John Mitchell) (1805) (Mitchell's account of the Yellow Fever in Virginia in 1741–2), The Philadelphia Medical Museum, 1 (1) : 1–20. * (John Mitchell) (1814) \\"Account of the Yellow fever which prevailed in Virginia in the years 1737, 1741, and 1742, in a letter to the late Cadwallader Colden, Esq. of New York, from the late John Mitchell, M.D.F.R.S. of Virginia,\\" American Medical and Philosophical Register, 4 : 181–215. Dr. Mitchell misdiagnosed the disease that he observed and treated, and that the disease was probably Weil's disease or hepatitis. See: Saul Jarcho (1957) \\"John Mitchell, Benjamin Rush, and Yellow fever,\\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 31 (2) : 132–136. After experimenting, Rush decided that a powder of ten grains of calomel (mercury) and ten grains of the cathartic drug jalap (the poisonous root of a Mexican plant, Ipomoea purga, related to the morning glory, which was dried and powdered before ingesting) would create the desired elimination he was seeking. Since the demand for his services was so great, he had his assistants make as many of his powders in pill form as they could. On September 10, he published a guide to treating the fever: \\"Dr. Rush's Directions for Curing and Treating the Yellow Fever\\", outlining a regimen of self-medication. At the first sign of symptoms, \\"more especially if those symptoms be accompanied by a redness, or faint yellowness in the eyes, and dull or shooting pains about the region of the liver, take one of the powders in a little sugar and water, every six hours, until they produce four or five large evacuations from the bowels...\\" He urged that the patient stay in bed and \\"drink plentifully\\" of barley or chicken water. Then after the \\"bowels are thoroughly cleaned,\\" it was proper to take 8 to 10 ounces of blood from the arm if, after purging, the pulse was full or tense. To keep the body open he recommended more calomel or small doses of cream of tartar or other salts. If the pulse was weak and low, he recommended camomile or snakeroot as a stimulant, and blisters or blankets soaked in hot vinegar wrapped around the lower limbs. To restore the patient he recommended \\"gruel, sago, panada, tapioca, tea, coffee, weak chocolate, wine whey, chicken broth, and white meats, according to the weak or active state of the system; the fruits of the season may be eaten with advantage at all times.\\" The sick room should be kept cool and vinegar should be sprinkled around the floor. Rush's therapy was generalized as \\"purge and bleed,\\" and as long as the patient remained debilitated, Rush urged further purging and bleeding. Not a few of his patients became comatose. The calomel in his pills soon brought on a state of constant salivation, which Rush urged patients to attain to assure a cure. A characteristic sign of death was black vomit, which salivation seemed to ward off.Rush, p to come. Since he urged purging at the first sign of fever, other doctors began seeing patients who suffered severe abdominal distress. Autopsies after their death revealed stomachs destroyed by such purges. Unlike other doctors, Deveze did not offer advice in the newspapers during the epidemic. He later discussed treatment in his memoir, which included 18 case studies and descriptions of several autopsies. While he deprecated Rush's harsh purgatives and \\"heroic\\" bleeding, he moderately bled patients and also used medicines to evacuate the bowels. Like Rush, he thought poisons had to be \\"abstracted\\" in severely debilitated patients. Instead of purges, he used blisters to raise welts on the skin. Unlike Kuhn, he did not favor baths. He preferred to apply heat, using hot bricks on hands or feet. He strongly discounted the traditional treatment for severe fevers, which was to wrap patients in blankets, give them camomile tea or Madeira, and try to bring on sweats., Harvard University Library He preferred \\"acidulated\\" water to the use of Peruvian bark as many patients found the bark distasteful. He thought the use of opium very helpful.Deveze, pp. to come. Aftermath The Governor created a middle path: he ordered the city to be kept clean and the port policed to prevent infected ships, or those from the Caribbean, from docking until they had gone through a period of quarantine. The city suffered yellow fever epidemics in 1797, 1798, and 1799, which kept the origin and treatment controversies alive., Harvard University Library Some of the city's clergy suggested the epidemic was a judgment from God.\\"An Earnest Call Occasioned by the Alarming Pestilential Contagion,\\" November 8, 1793, Evans catalog #25427. Led by the Quakers, the religious community petitioned the state legislature to prohibit theatrical presentations in the state. Such entertainment had been banned during the Revolution and had only recently been authorized. After an extensive debate in the newspapers, the State Assembly denied the petition.Federal Gazette, November 19, 1793 and Philadelphia Gazette, March 25, 1794. The recurrences of yellow fever kept discussions about causes, treatment and prevention going until the end of decade. Other major ports also had epidemics, beginning with Baltimore in 1794, New York in 1795 and 1798, and Wilmington in 1798, making yellow fever a national crisis. New York doctors finally admitted that they had had an outbreak of yellow fever in 1791 that killed more than 100 people. All the cities that suffered epidemics continued to grow rapidly. The widespread recognition that the epidemics were based along the waterfront meant that cities grew more rapidly in outlying areas, but that was also where land was available at lower cost. Families who could afford it planned to vacate the port cities during the sick season. During the epidemic of 1798, Benjamin Rush commuted daily from a house just outside the city, near what is now 15th and Columbia Streets, to the new city fever hospital, where as chief doctor he treated fever victims.Butterfield, p. 803. The civic responses to the 1798 epidemics in Philadelphia and New York were more complex than the efforts of the 1793 Mayor's Committee. For instance, Philadelphia forced evacuation of certain neighborhoods and placed refugees in supervised camps. After the epidemic, the city inspected all houses and destroyed those it deemed unhealthy. American doctors did not identify the vector of yellow fever until the late nineteenth century. In 1881 Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor, argued that mosquito bites caused yellow fever; he credited Rush's published account of the 1793 epidemic for giving him the idea. He said that Rush had written: \\"Mosquitoes (the usual attendants of a sickly autumn) were uncommonly numerous...\\" In the late 1880s, Finlay's theories were confirmed in Cuba by experiments of the US Medical Army Corps under direction of Dr. Walter Reed in the late 1880s, in which subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by infected mosquitoes. In the first week of September 1793, Dr. William Currie published a description of the epidemic and an account of its progress during August. The publisher Mathew Carey had an account of the epidemic for sale in the third week of October, before the epidemic had ended. He accused blacks of causing the epidemic and black nurses of overcharging patients and taking advantage of them. The reverends Richard Allen and Absalom Jones of the Free African Society published their own account rebutting Carey's attacks; by that time Carey had already published the fourth edition of his popular pamphlet. Allen and Jones noted that some blacks had worked for free, that they had died at the same rate as whites from the epidemic, and that some whites had also overcharged for their services. Currie's work was the first of several medical accounts published within a year of the epidemic. Dr. Benjamin Rush published an account more than 300 pages long. Two French doctors, Jean Deveze and Nassy, published shorter accounts. Clergymen also published accounts; the most notable was by the Lutheran minister J. Henry C. Helmuth. In March 1794, the Mayor's Committee published its minutes. (Letters written during the epidemic, which in some cases expressed the last sentiments of victims, were preserved by many families and have been a source for scholars in various archives.) The rapid succession of other yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the northeastern United States engendered many accounts of the efforts to contain, control and cope with the disease. Rush wrote accounts of the 1797, 1798, and 1799 epidemics in Philadelphia. He revised his account of the 1793 epidemic to eliminate reference to the disease being contagious. He varied his cures. In 1798 he was appointed as the chief doctor at the fever hospital. The mortality rate that year was roughly the same as it had been at Bush Hill in 1793, despite radical difference between the therapies used. Noah Webster, then a notable New York newspaper publisher, joined two doctors in publishing the Medical Repository, a magazine that collected accounts of fever epidemics throughout the nation. Webster used this data in his 1798 book, suggesting that the nation was being subjected to a widespread \\"epidemic constitution\\" in the atmosphere that might last 50 years and make deadly epidemics almost certain.Webster, Noah, A Brief History of Epidemic Disease, 1798. Yellow fever epidemics became seen as a national crisis. When in 1855 a French doctor published an 813-page history of yellow fever in Philadelphia, covering outbreaks from 1699 to 1854, he devoted only a few pages to the 1793 epidemic.LaRoche, Yellow Fever, considered in its historical, pathological, etiological, and therapeutic relations, 1855 General 20th-century US histories, such as the 10-volume Great Epochs in American History, published in 1912, used short excerpts from Carey's account.Halsey, Francis W., Great Epochs in American History, volume 4, 1912, pp 83–89 The first history of the epidemic to draw on more primary sources was J. H. Powell's Bring Out Your Dead (1949), but he did not use the personal letters, which are largely held by Quaker colleges in the area. While Powell did not write a scholarly history of the epidemic, his work reviewed its historical importance. Since the mid- twentieth century, scholars have studied aspects of the epidemic, first in papers. For example, Martin Pernick's \\"Politics, Parties, and Pestilence: Epidemic Yellow Fever in Philadelphia and the Rise of the First Party System,\\" developed statistical evidence to show that Republican doctors generally used Rush's therapies and Federalist doctors used Kuhn's.Pernick, Martin S. \\"Politics, Parties, and Pestilence: Epidemic Yellow Fever in Philadelphia and the Rise of the First Party System,\\" William and Mary Quarterly, 1972, pp 559–586. Scholars celebrated the 200th anniversary of the epidemic with the publication of papers on various aspects of the epidemic.Estes, J. Worth, and Smith, Billy G. A Melancholy Scene of Devastation: The Public Response to the 1793 Yellow Fever Epidemic, Philadelphia: Science History Publications, 1997. A 2004 paper in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine reexamined Rush's use of bleeding.Kopperman, Paul E. “‘Venerate the Lancet’: Benjamin Rush’s Yellow Fever Therapy in Context,” Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 2004, 78: 539–574.

He was killed in action by the Colombian Army after a military operation on October 25, 2007. Colombian authorities wanted him on charges of rebellion, extortion, terrorism, first degree murder, armed assault, assault and battery and kidnapping among others. Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos described his death as the \\"most important\\" blow against FARC in 2007. Early years In 1979 Gustavo Rueda Díaz studied in the northern Colombian port city of Barrancabermeja, during this year he became a militant in the Communist Youth (Juventud Comunista JUCO). Two years later in 1981 Rueda joined the 4th Front of the FARC-EP in the Middle Magdalena Region and assumed the alias of \\"Martín Caballero\\". He was later sent to the area of the Serranía del Perijá mountain range near the border with Venezuela. In 1991 he was appointed commander of the 37th Front of the FARC-EP which he led until his death in 2007. Kidnapping of Fernando Araújo Caballero was suspected of being the mastermind behind the kidnapping of the former Colombian minister of Foreign Affairs Fernando Araújo who was kidnapped in the city of Cartagena in December 2000 and escaped in 2006. Attempted attack on President Bill Clinton In 2000, President Bill Clinton visited Cartagena de las Indias in part to stand by Colombia in solidarity for its long war. Caballero was accused of planning to attack him in 2000 by placing explosives along the route of Clinton's presidential limousine. Kidnapping of three US American citizens Martín Caballero was accused by Colombian authorities of being the man responsible behind the majority of kidnappings in the northern Caribbean region of Colombia, including the three United States citizens Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes and Marc Gonsalves. Stansell, Thomas and Gonsalves were kidnapped when their Cessna Grand Caravan crashed while working for California Microwave Systems, which the U.S. Defense Department had contracted with to gather information about illicit coca and opium crops in Colombia . They were rescued in July 2008. For this case the Attorney General of Colombia formally accused Caballero on October 5, 2006 and ten other guerrilla leaders of being responsible for their kidnapping. According to Colombian military intelligence Caballero ordered the incursion of the 37th Front of the FARC-EP in the corregimiento of Matuya in the municipality of Maria La Baja, Bolívar Department, in which the insurgents assaulted a farm, threatened the workers, demanded a ransom and stole some 140 cattle. Under his orders insurgents also attacked numerous farms with the same strategy also extorting agricultural producers throughout the region.

Surgical career Brooke, son of the well- known mineralogist, Henry James Brooke, was born 30 June 1804. His early education was carried on at Chiswick, under Dr. Turner. After this he was entered at Rugby School in 1819 and St John's College, Cambridge, where he remained five years. He was twenty-third wrangler and B.A. 1827, B.M. 1828, and M.A. in 1853. During a part of this period he studied medicine, and his professional education was completed at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He passed the Royal College of Surgeons examination on 3 September 1834, and became a fellow of that institution 26 August 1844. He lectured for one or two sessions on surgery at Dermott's School, and afterwards held positions on the surgical staff of the Metropolitan Free Hospital and the Westminster Hospital, which latter appointment he resigned in 1869. He is known as the inventor of the bead suture, which was a great step in advance in the scientific treatment of deep wounds. On 4 March 1847 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He belonged to the Royal Meteorological Society (president 1865–1866) and the Royal Microscopical Society. He also at various times served on the management of the Royal Institution and on the council of the Royal Botanical Society. In addition to these he was connected with many philanthropic and religious societies, and was a very active member of the Victoria Institute and Christian Medical Association. Inventions His public papers and lectures generally pertained to the department of physics, mathematical and experimental, and his more special work was the inventing or improving of apparatus and especially of self-recording instruments for scientific use. Brooke also studied the theory of the microscope, and was the author of some inventions which facilitated the shifting of lenses, and improved the illumination of the bodies observed. He applied his improved methods to the investigation of some of the best known test-objects of the microscope. His name is, however, most popularly known by means of the Elements of Natural Philosophy, originally compiled by Dr. Golding Bird in 1839, who alone brought out the second and third editions. After his death in 1854, Brooke edited a fourth edition, revised and greatly enlarged, followed by a fifth in 1860. In 1867 he entirely rewrote the work for the sixth edition. Death He died at Weymouth, 17 May 1879, and his widow died at 3 Gordon Square, London, 12 Feb. 1885, aged 86. Automatic registration of instruments by photography Between 1846 and 1852 Charles Brooke invented a series of self-recording instruments for the automatic registration of measurements using a light- source, mirrors and optics to amplify readings and a clockwork drum covered in photographic paper to record the results. These instruments included barometers, thermometers, psychrometers, and magnetometers, which registered their variations by means of photography. Charles Brooke's inventions obtained an award from the British Admiralty as well as a medal from the jurors of the Great Exhibition. The account of the perfecting of these apparatus is detailed in the British Association Reports from 1846 to 1849, and in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 1847, 1850, and 1852. These self- recording instruments were adopted at the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. In 1859 a self-recording magnetometer of United States manufacture, based on the designed of Charles Brooke, was built by the Coast Survey and the Smithsonian Institution at a magnetic observatory on the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. The Smithsonian report also noted that the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory had a self- registering magnetograph in 1850, which was described by General John Henry Lefroy, in Silliman's Journal, May, 1850. A somewhat similar self-registering system invented a little earlier by Francis Ronalds, inaugural Honorary Director at the Kew Observatory, was also deployed to Toronto as well as numerous other observatories around the world. Ronalds’ cameras were adopted by the new UK Meteorological Office from the 1860s to assist in weather forecasting and continued in use for many years.

Born in the diocese of Sens, he studied Arts at the Collège de Montaigu of the University of Paris. He served as Rector of the University from December 1507 to March 1508. Life Beginning in 1508, Jacques Almain studied theology with John Mair at the College of Navarre in Paris. He received his license in Theology in January 1512 and his doctorate in the same subject in March of that year. When King Louis XII of France decided to support the 1511 Council of Pisa (or conciliabulum, as it was called dismissively) against Pope Julius II, the University was told to support this assembly. The University chose Almain to reply to a polemical tract by Cardinal Thomas Cajetan, the Pope's most eminent apologist. Almain wrote a trenchant critique of that tract by Cajetan, but did not live to answer the Apologia the Pope's defender wrote in response. Nor did Almain comment directly on the Fifth Lateran Council called by Pope Julius to counter the assembly in Pisa. Works Almain wrote in several academic genres. His earliest works were concerned with logic and the Physics of Aristotle. His Moralia became a standard textbook of moral theology, presenting ethical issues in a dry Scholastic style. He also wrote texts discussing portions of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. One text was concerned with the opinions of the medieval Dominican theologian Robert Holcot. Apart from the reply to Cajetan, Almain wrote on political topics. These works included a discussion of the opinions of William of Ockham about papal power and a disputation on the power of pope and council, his earliest statement of Conciliarism. Almain embraced the distinction between the absolute and ordained powers of God. His moral philosophy was Aristotelean, arguing for conduct in the middle ground between extremes. His political thought embraced the need for order but allowed a community to restrain any ruler whose conduct had become dangerous to its very survival. Almain's critique of Cajetan's treatise on the papacy argued that Church and State were parallel in nature, both able to act against an errant leader, whether pope or king. All of these teachings are found in the posthumous Opuscula (Paris, 1518).  References  *Conciliarism and Papalism, ed. J. H. Burns and Thomas M. Izbicki, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.

Le Guin, originally published in the September 1969 issue of Orbit, a fiction anthology. The story is part of the Hainish Cycle and explores topics such as the human effect of space travel at nearly the speed of light, as well as religious and political topics such as feudalism.Spivack, Charlotte, Ursula K. Le Guin, (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 50. \\"Winter's King\\" was one of four nominees for the 1970 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. Le Guin revised the story, focusing on pronoun gender, for its inclusion in her 1975 short story collection The Wind's Twelve Quarters. Conception The story takes place on Gethen, the same planet shown in more detail in The Left Hand of Darkness. It was in fact Le Guin's first vision of that place: The original story centred on the idea that someone could age 12 years while the rest of their world had aged sixty. (Itself one of many to address the point made by Einstein: that if he could travel far enough and fast enough he could return and be younger than his own son.) A similar idea was used by Le Guin's in the earlier short story Semley's Necklace, later expanded as Rocannon's World. But that was a Rip Van Winkle-type fairy tale, where a person goes underground in the company of dwarves or elves, spending an apparently brief time but on emerging finding whole generations had elapsed. Here, the Gethenians understand the science of what has happened. The focus is psychological, someone confronting their own child who is now much older than they are. It also includes the idea of mind manipulation, used earlier and rather differently in City of Illusions. Plot \\"Winter's King\\" tells the story of Argaven, ruler of a large kingdom on Gethen, a planet whose inhabitants do not have a fixed sex. She has been kidnapped and her mind apparently altered. Fearing this, she abdicates in favour of her infant child, with a reliable regent to rule until the child Emran is old enough. With the help of aliens from distant worlds (who include Earth-humans) she travels to another planet 24 light-years away, using a Nearly-As-Fast-As-Light ship. This means 24 years pass but she is no older. News passes by means of an instantaneous communicator (ansible) and all seems well. On this planet (Ollul) she is cured of the mind alterations, which would have made her a paranoid tyrant had she tried to carry on. There she lives and studies for 12 years, learning about the wider society of many planets and about people with two fixed sexes, very alien to her. She then learns that things are going badly back home and is persuaded to go home, which takes another 24 years. Sixty years have now passed: her child is now old and has become a tyrant. Public opinion is with her and she is restored, with Emran committing suicide. The story ends there. But the 1995 short story \\"Coming of Age in Karhide\\" (which appears in a collection called The Birthday of the World) mentions in passing the first and second reigns of Argaven, saying little but indicating that the second reign was a success. Literary significance and criticism Charlotte Spivack points out that the story's winter theme precedes and produces the story's androgyny theme.Spivack, Charlotte, Ursula K. Le Guin, (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 48. Susan Wood deems the story notable because of its scientific extrapolation of topics such as sub-lightspeed travel and alien biology, topics which \\"provide a framework for powerful psychological studies.\\"Wood, Susan, Ursula K.

Life Onslow was the eldest son of Sir Richard Onslow and was baptised on 23 April 1622. His father was an important Parliamentarian from Surrey during the Civil War. Onslow was educated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1639 and at Lincoln's Inn in 1640. In 1641, Onslow was elected Member of Parliament for Bramber in the Long Parliament.

The station has been a Bott outlet since 1996, though the license history stretches back to the establishment of KSLH, an educational station that was owned by St. Louis Public Schools, in 1950. History =KSLH: the educational station= As KSLH, the station operated from the district's audiovisual building, the former Harris Teacher's College, now converted into loft apartments. The St. Louis city board of education applied to the FCC to operate a new noncommercial FM radio station on September 25, 1944, which was granted by the Federal Communications Commission on June 11, 1947. The station took nearly three years to be built; in May 1949, the board approved $60,874 in bids for the construction of the facility at the district's audiovisual building at 1517 S. Theresa Ave. By year's end, construction was nearly complete on the facility, including a tower, as well as a total of five studios and two control rooms. KSLH finally began broadcasts on April 13, 1950, with receivers set up in 191 city elementary schools. Despite coming on late in the school year, KSLH quickly settled into a schedule. All but three of the station's initial 15-minute programs were for grade school students; the exceptions were high school fare on poetry, choral music, and business. KSLH devoted itself almost entirely to instruction for most of its life. By 1953, it broadcast from 9:10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., matching the school day; it produced about 300 educational programs in a given year, alongside content obtained in the National Association of Educational Broadcasters program exchange. Eight different planning committees worked with teachers on the development of radio courses, while many programs aired at different times to suit the needs of the city schools. In its first decade of broadcasting, the station produced 2,878 fifteen-minute programs. In addition to NAEB-supplied programs, KSLH educational broadcasts were also supplied by the state of Missouri, the United Nations, and even the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and BBC. Among its staff was at least one alumnus who went on to a lengthy career in St. Louis broadcasting: future KMOV-TV anchor Julius Hunter, who at one time taught in the school system, worked at the station as a writer- producer in the late 1960s. The station, however, still broadcast during the day, and it was silent entirely on weekends and when school was not in session; aside from an afternoon hour of adult shows, it did not expand into evenings, saying the cost of doing so was prohibitive. Even when St. Louis community station KDNA sought to enter into a time-share agreement in 1973 to use the KSLH facility when KSLH was off the air, the board refused, and the FCC rejected the group's petition to force the board into such a situation without its consent. =Airtime and equipment problems= KSLH operated with its original equipment for almost all of its ownership by the St. Louis city school board. In 1978, the board applied for $75,000 in federal funds, which, combined with the school board's own money, would have enabled a power increase from 12,100 to 100,000 watts and the replacement of the 1950s equipment. The school system tried again in 1986, seeking $285,000 for similar modifications. Another problem that developed for KSLH in the 1980s was its limited hours of operation. As the Federal Communications Commission pushed stations to begin broadcasting at least 12 hours per day, school board officials looked for solutions. In one 1981 proposal approved by the school board, KWMU-FM, the public radio station at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, was to supply National Public Radio programs to the station for a fee one-third that of other proposals, particularly news and current affairs programming. At the time, KWMU eschewed most NPR talk shows to air classical music, and WSIE in Edwardsville, Illinois, lacked full-market coverage of St. Louis, meaning that listeners could not pick up such NPR programs as All Things Considered; at the time, St. Louis was the largest market in the country where the show was not aired. Even though the KWMU plan never came to fruition, the station did begin carrying programming outside of the school day, including the school board's meetings every other Tuesday night and coverage of the high schools' Public High League football and basketball. It also contracted Michael C. Ermatinger to provide programming in the evenings; in 1987, Ermatinger was convicted on sexual assault charges. =Reorganization, Webster University operation, and LCMS sale attempt= Trouble in the St. Louis school system, however, would make an impact on KSLH. In October 1988, a federal judge ordered the school board to draft a plan to reorganize its administration and improve efficiencies, while the Missouri attorney general's office made its own proposal six months later. By May 1989, the school board had announced 25-percent cuts to its administrative staff, with KSLH and its five staff slated for total elimination. Proposals to fill the KSLH void were quick to come in. One was from Urban Communications, Inc., which would have reinvented KSLH as a minority-oriented radio station and carried out the power increase to 100 kW. However, the school board voted unanimously a month after announcing cuts to restore funding for KSLH. Ultimately, in 1991, the school board cut back its spending on KSLH from $250,000 to $100,000 annually and entered into an agreement with Webster University, under which Webster supplied some programming for air on KSLH. Webster maintained studios on the campus and fed jazz programming back to the KSLH transmitter by telephone line. Under Webster interim operation, KSLH operated during the day on weekdays and continuously on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. In 1993, the school board unanimously voted to accept bids for KSLH, with a minimum asking price of $250,000. Of the 13 bids received by the school board, the highest bid, of $1 million, was made by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, which planned to use the KSLH frequency to simulcast and expand the Christian talk and teaching on its KFUO AM 850, a daytime-only station. Filed in February 1994, the Lutheran Church application languished for over 18 months and eventually was terminated, as the synod was facing a license challenge over hiring practices at the KFUO stations. =KSIV-FM= The school board, however, wound up making money on the delay. In October 1995, a second Christian buyer emerged to acquire KSLH: Community Broadcasting, Inc., the non-profit stations arm of the Bott Radio Network, owners of KSIV AM 1320 in Clayton since 1982, which paid $1.625 million for the license and began operating 91.5 in 1996. Under Bott, the newly recalled KSIV-FM relocated to the Crestwood master FM tower south of St. Louis in Shrewsbury, Missouri and began stereo broadcasts for the first time in its history.

History The Chester Canal was conceived in 1771, to provide a link between the Trent and Mersey Canal, then being built, and the River Dee, to prevent the likely demise of the Dee and of Chester as a port once the Trent and Mersey was completed. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1772 for a narrow canal from Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich. As a result of objections by the Duke of Bridgewater and the Trent and Mersey Canal, it had to finish away from the Trent and Mersey, with no connection between the two. The proprietors built a wide canal, suitable for boats , which ran from Chester to Nantwich. There were difficulties, and by the time Nantwich was reached in 1779, there was no money left to build a branch to Middlewich. The canal was a failure, and the company resolved to abandon the canal in 1781. However, they managed to keep going somehow, until construction of the Ellesmere Canal began. The Chester Canal became part of a larger network, which generated more traffic, and the two companies amalgamated in 1813, to become the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. Sign indicating the Middlewich Branch at Barbridge Junction Further hope was generated by the prospects of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal opening their line between Nantwich the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction, from where there was a connection into the Birmingham Canal Navigations. The need for the branch to Middlewich was now more important, as it would enable traffic on the new canal to reach Manchester. After the Earl of Bridgewater died in 1824, the company again approached the Trent and Mersey and the Bridgewater Canal about a possible link between Nantwich and Middlewich. The Bridgewater Trustees approved of the scheme, but the Trent and Mersey would not sanction it until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was officially authorised by an Act of Parliament. This occurred in 1826, and the Ellesmere and Chester obtained their own Act to authorise their canal in 1827. The Trent and Mersey built the short Wardle Canal with one lock, to maintain control of the junction, and imposed high tolls for traffic using it, but the work went ahead, and the Middlewich Branch was opened on 1 September 1833, having cost £129,000. The work included the building of transhipment warehouses and wharves at Barbridge Junction, although the branch saw little traffic until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal finally opened in 1835. Just ten years later, the two companies amalgamated, and the joint system became the Shropshire Union Canal network in 1846. Location From Barbridge Junction, the original Chester Canal heads north-west, and is level for , before the first of the two Bunbury Locks is reached on the descent to Chester. In the opposite direction, the canal is level for before it reaches the two Hack Green Locks. Along the Middlewich Branch, which heads north-east, the first lock is Cholmondeston Lock, from the junction. Just to the south of the junction on the main line is Hurleston Junction, where another branch of the Shropshire Union network, now rebranded the Llangollen Canal, turns off to head towards Llangollen and the Montgomery Canal.

Like other dry downland valleys, Findon Valley was created during the last ice age when chalk that was being frozen prevented water from seeping downwards through the chalk. In summer, streams of melting ice would flow down off the Weald across the Downs, creating the dry valleys such as Findon Valley.Brandon, Peter (1998), The South Downs Phillimore The settlement of Findon Valley is bordered to the west and east by land in the South Downs National Park.

He is well known for his evangelical zeal for the application of the fly-by-wire system in the Airbuses. He is the son of the former Airbus CEO, Henri Ziegler. Bernard Ziegler was born in Boulogne sur Seine, France. He was educated in the École Polytechnique (1954), as an engineer and École de l'Air (1955), for his pilot training and military commission. Ziegler began his career as a fighter pilot in the French air force. He saw action in the Algerian War and was decorated twice. Principal medals and decorations received include the Officier de l’Ordre National du Mérite, Médaille de l'Aéronautique, Croix de la Valeur Militaire and Officier de la Légion d'honneur. In August 1961 the Vallee Blanche Aerial Tramway was badly damaged when an aeroplane of the French Air Force piloted by Bernard Ziegler tore its hauling cable. Three cars crashed and six people were killed.Time He continued his studies in École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace (Supaéro) (1961) and was later posted to École du personnel navigant d'essais et de réception (EPNER), the French Air Force test pilot establishment in 1964. He was the chief test pilot for the Dassault Mirage G in 1968. At Airbus, his career spans from chief test pilot (1972), to senior vice president for flight and support and then, to senior vice president for engineering. As a test pilot, he flew the first flights of the Airbus A300, A310, A320 and the A340. Bernard Ziegler was the most influential figure in developing the cockpit design and fly-by-wire control system for the Airbus airliners. He proposed that numerous technological innovations be applied to Airbus aircraft; for example, using composites, twin-engine configuration for the A300, fly-by-wire and many others. He was the guiding force in the creation of the flight envelope protection, incorporated in the Airbus flight-control software. This innovation allows the pilot to apply the maximum control forces considered necessary, while preventing inadvertent inputs that could place the aircraft outside the safety margin. This feature is considered by many to be highly beneficial in avoiding unusual attitudes in flight and in safely maximizing the effectiveness of evasive maneuvers in response to GPWS warnings. For his efforts in advancing the fly-by-wire cause, he was honoured by the Flight Safety Foundation in 1998. He retired from Airbus after 25 years of service in 1997.

Retrieved 22 September 2013. Being based on Java, it is portable and can both be run locally and as an applet. It grew out of the need for an advanced open source software that can cope with complex spatio-temporal image data, mainly obtained from microscopes in biological research. It lends much of the philosophy from ImageJ but aims to supersede it by having a more modern design. Endrov grew out of the needs of a software to map the embryogenesis of C.elegans. The lead developer, Johan Henriksson, is a Ph.D. student at Karolinska Institute. Specifications Endrov is both a library and an imaging program. The design has made strong emphasis on separating GUI code from data types, filters and other data processing plugins. The idea is that the program can be used for most daily use or prototyping, and for bigger batch processing or integration, the code is invoked as a library. As a program, Endrov can do what you expect from normal image processing software. It is meant to be hackable; integrating new editing tools, windows and data types is meant to be simple. The main features that set it apart from other imaging software is that it can handle additional dimensions (XYZ, time, channel) which is needed for more serious microscopy. Filters can also be used without being directly applied, and can be composed into filter sequences. Data (for example derived from analysis) is stored together with the images. The native image format is OST but most common formats are supported. Comparison with ImageJ ImageJ is older and hence it is more mature and has more plugins. This limits how much of ImageJ can be changed without breaking backwards-compatibility, which has caused design flaws to accumulate over time. Endrov sacrifices all backwards- compatibility for a clean design. While ImageJ consists of a core and rather independent plugins, Endrov has few core functions and plenty of plugin-plugin dependencies. The goal is to tighten the integration and increase encapsulation, thus reduce code redundancy and ease maintenance. As an example, the GUI is separate from most algorithm plugins; algorithms merely provide descriptions of input and output.

He was known in Colombia for his thunderous voice and for the way he intoned the traditional Spanish-style \\"Goooooooool!\\" sound when a goal had been scored. Perea commentated on eight football World Cups, fifteen World Series for CBS Spanish Radio, seven Olympics, many boxing matches and thousands of soccer matches in Colombia and abroad. He became so successful as a sportscaster that he transcended himself into a national politician. Perea was Afro-Colombian and broke down many barriers that kept black Colombians from gaining admiration and respect in Colombian pop culture and in entering the ritzy social scenes of Colombian society. After gaining popularity for his picturesque way of narrating football matches, Perea joined the Colombian Liberal Party with the support of then presidential candidate Horacio Serpa and ran for the senate. In 2009 he was appointed Ambassador to Colombia in South Africa. Commentating career Perea was born on 2 June 1934 in Condoto in the department of Chocó on Colombia's Pacific coast, an area largely inhabited by descendants of African slaves who arrived in Colombia in the 18th Century. Before the age of ten, his family moved to Cartagena where Perea grew up playing soccer and listening to the radio. Perea began doing play-by-play in the early 1960s and quickly rose to become the voice of Junior, the professional soccer team from the port city of Barranquilla. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Perea's emotional and passionate manner of broadcasting soccer, baseball and boxing captured the attention of millions of listeners around the country and media executives in Colombia's capital, Bogota. He became regarded as Colombia's best play-by-play announcer. In the early 1990s, he accepted an offer to leave Barranquilla to become the voice of Millonarios, a professional soccer team in Bogota. Perea also accepted the job as sports anchor on a highly rated nightly television news station on national Colombian television, and he also aired a daily radio show that was tops in the market. Exposure to the larger market helped Perea's ratings increase and he became more popular and was listened to by more Colombians. Political career =Senate (1998–2000)= Because of Perea's ratings and popularity, politicians and celebrities sometimes appeared with him in the radio booth to play to the emotions of Perea's listeners. In 1997, while President Ernesto Samper was struggling with a scandal concerning allegations he had accepted drug money into his campaign, Samper visited Perea during a soccer match. Perea interviewed the President in the broadcast booth and declared his support for the President's Liberal Party government and for Samper's Chief of Staff, Horacio Serpa who was the alleged successor to the presidency in the upcoming presidential election. Perea continued to use his influence on the public airwaves to endorse the Liberal government and Serpa, and to urge his listeners to do the same. Shortly thereafter, Perea decided to enter politics himself. Perea ran for senate in 1998 and won by 71,510 votes taking office on 20 July 1998. Perea supported Serpa for president, but Andres Pastrana won the election. Perea had hoped to legislate from the Senate during a Serpa-led presidency but found himself fending off criticism and pressure from President Pastrana's Conservative Party supporters in the Senate. Perea was suspended and subsequently expelled from the Senate on 18 July 2000 for appearing on television and radio broadcasting soccer matches. Perea believed that since he was a sports announcer by trade, he should be allowed to do play-by-play and that he was not doing anything illegal. The rules however made it clear that a senator was not permitted to appear on television or radio and engage in broadcasts. Perea fought the charges against him and eventually was cleared of any corruption and was permitted to return to politics. =Campaigns for Mayor of Barranquilla (2003–2007)= In 2003 Perea ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Barranquilla. In 2007 Perea decided to run once again for mayor of Barranquilla against Alejandro Char Chaljub. Perea facing a possible low turnout in poll results decided to ally with one of Char's supporters and political barons of the region José Name Tehran, a move that was highly criticized by the media.. Perea once again lost the election. =Ambassador to South Africa (2009–2016)= President Álvaro Uribe Vélez appointed Perea Ambassador of Colombia to South Africa in replacement of Carlos Moreno de Caro. Perea presented his diplomatic credentials to President Thabo Mbeki on 26 February 2009. Perea's experience as a soccer commentator and knowledge of the game ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and knowledge influenced President Uribe to appoint Perea to the diplomatic post. Death Perea died in a hospital in the north of Bogotá on April 11, 2016.

He was a member of the Tejano Tex-Mex group Conjunto Bernal.http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/bernal.htm In 1972, Paulino converted from the apostolic Christian denomination of Catholicism to Evangelical Protestantism and founded Bernal Christian Records in order to evangelize his Protestant Christian beliefs. Through his La Nuevo Cristiana ministry, Bernal currently owns and operates more than a dozen Spanish Language religious radio stations located in Texas carrying a satellite-fed programming schedule. In 2008 Paulino Bernal released a new CD of polkas produced by Grammy-winning producer Armando Lichtenberger Jr., \\"El Maestro Del Acordeon Y Sus Polkas\\" on Urbana Records and received his first Grammy Nomination for Best Polka Album for the 51st Annual Grammys.http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/music/directory/radio/radio.south.htm The best of the conjuntos is, beyond a doubt, El Conjunto Bernal. Described by connoisseurs of conjunto music as \\"the only one of its kind\\" and \\"twenty years ahead of its time\\" El Conjunto Bernal is well known for its tremendous range of innovations. Its musical experiments spanned the gamut of conjunto, from the traditional polka to Latin music such as the bolero, cha cha cha, and even American rock and roll. El Conjunto Bernal owed much of its originality and meteoric rise to fame to the genius of its founder, Paulino Bernal. Early life Paulino Bernal was born June 22, 1939, in Raymondville, Texas. Reared in the grinding poverty that was experienced by most Chicanos of his generation, Paulino was forced to give up schooling when he was in the seventh grade. An accomplished accordionist by that time, he left school \\"to try and earn money and get us out of the poverty in which we found ourselves.\\" Bernal’s mother was a divorcee, and early on she moved to Kingsville, Texas, where Paulino, his older brother Eloy, the younger Luis, and three sisters were all forced to pick cotton, cucumbers, and other crops to help support the family. One day a man came by the house selling a guitar, and Mrs. Bernal \\"with great sacrifice,\\" bought it for the boys. Paulino soon learned enough to play the cantinas with an elderly accordionist, where he picked up tips to help buy food for the Bernal family. But Paulino's future lay with the accordion. He remembers hearing the best accordionists of the late 1940s and early 1950s on the radio – Narciso Martinez, Valerio Longoria, Tony De La Rosa – all of whom were recording for the largest Mexican-American company at the time, Ideal Records. Paulino dreamed of joining their ranks, and when a friend of his was given an accordion as a gift, it was Paulino who spent the most time practising on it. Shortly afterwards, during a trip to visit his father in Rio Grande Valley, Eloy was given a bajo sexto by him and the Bernal’s were soon on track toward their future. Los Hermanitos Bernal launched their musical career in 1952. They were hired to play a dance in nearby Premont – Paulino on accordion, Eloy on bajo sexto, and a friend, Adan Lomas, on drums. According to Bernal, \\"a lot of people attended, and they liked the Bernal Brothers so much, they kept calling us back.\\" They began playing in Falfurrias and in Alice nearby, the home of Ideal Records. Soon the Bernal Brothers came to the attention of Armando Marroquín, the man who recorded all the artists for Ideal Records. The Bernal Brothers were first recorded as the backup conjunto for some of the duets then popular among Texas-Mexicans, such as Carmen y Laura. In March 1955, Marroquin gave the Bernals their chance as headliners, and a 78 rpm record was released with the cancion ranchera Mujer Paseada on one side and the romantic bolero Desprecio on the other. With the release of their first record, the Bernal Brothers quickly put their cotton picking days behind them forever and soon joined Valerio Longoria and Tony De La Rosa as the top conjuntos in Texas. El Conjunto Bernal recorded prolifically for Ideal between 1955 and 1960 and some of the best sides including the monster hits: Mi Unico Camino and Sentimiento Y Renco, both from late 1958, are on this CD and cassette. Marroquin began taking them on tours throughout the southwest and beyond where they always played for packed houses. They were especially popular in Arizona where local bandleader Pedro Bugarin was fond of featuring them with his orchestra. In fact, according to Paulino, he and Eloy used to sit in with Bugarin’s band, and some of the band musicians would in turn sit in with El Conjunto Bernal. This exposure to band music inspired Paulino to branch out of the normally simple ranchera music of the conjunto into the more sophisticated style of the orquesta. When Armando Marroquin ended his relationship with Ideal Records around 1960, El Conjunto Bernal stayed with him and recorded for his new label, Nopal Records. Shortly thereafter, Conjunto Bernal relocated to McAllen, Texas, across the border from Mexico in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Bernal began working with Victor Gonzales and the two men founded Bego Records (the company name a combination of their two last names). The Bego years represent some of Conjunto Bernal’s most innovative work. It was at his time that Paulino attracted the most talented musicians in the conjunto traditions to his group. In the late 1960s, Gonzales bought out Paulino’s interest in Bego Records and Paulino went on to found Bernal Records, which also produced many outstanding hits by El Conjunto Bernal. By this time however, Paulino had given up performing in favor of the administrative aspects of show business. He ran the recording company, hosted a regional TV music show, and generally concentrated on the promotional aspects of the business. Meanwhile, Oscar Hernandez and other very able accordionists picked up the slack and carried on the tradition of excellence begun by Paulino. During this same time, success in the music field took its toll on Paulino and he succumbed to the allure of alcohol and drugs. In 1972, however, a cook Paulino had hired to work in a restaurant he owned changed his life by converting him to the teachings of born-again Christianity. From that day on Paulino gave up the life of alcohol and drugs to devote himself to preaching. He also resumed his career as accordionist, only this time he did so in the service of Christianity. He started a new recording company, Bernal Christian Records, under whose banner he has continued to develop his inimitable style. As he once commented in an interview, \\"People who knew me before lament that I’m not playing anymore. They don’t seem to realize that I play more now than I ever did before!\\" References  External links  *Official Biography *Conjunto Bernal history *Handbook of Texas Online Category:1939 births Category:American evangelicals Category:Living people Category:American accordionists Category:People from Willacy County, Texas Category:Tejano accordionists Category:Musicians from Texas Category:People from Kingsville, Texas Category:21st-century accordionists ","title":"Paulino Bernal"},{"id":"13909811","text":"Joseph \\"Jo Jo\\" Corozzo, Sr. (born 1942 in Brownsville, Brooklyn) is a New York mobster who was the reputed consigliere of the Gambino crime family.

Joseph Corozzo is the father of New York criminal attorney Joseph Corozzo, Jr. =From capo to consigliere= Joseph Corozzo, Sr. started with the Gambino family as a transport truck hijacker. Corozzo earned the nickname \\"Miserable\\" because he allegedly suffers from bipolar disorder. In 1971, Corozzo was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to answer grand jury questions about organized crime. In 1991, during the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act trial of Gambino boss John Gotti, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Corozzo as a Gambino caporegime. In 1992, Corozzo became the Gambino consigliere. He replaced Frank Locascio, who had been sentenced to life in prison that year. On November 24, 1992, Corozzo was indicted in New York on charges of running a hijacking crew, a horse race betting establishment, and a loansharking operation. On May 30, 1994, Corozzo was indicted in New Orleans on racketeering charges involving mob infiltration of the video poker game industry in Louisiana. On May 20, 1995, Corozo was acquitted of all charges in the New York trial. On September 8, 1995, Corozzo pleaded guilty to conspiracy counts in New Orleans as part of a plea bargain deal. Corozzo was sentenced in New Orleans to three years in federal prison at the Federal Prison Camp Montgomery, Maxwell AFB, AL. In 2003, \\"Ruling Panel\\" member Michael \\"Mikey Scars\\" DiLeonardo testified that Arnold \\"Zeke\\" Squitieri was Gambino underboss and that John \\"Jackie Nose\\" D'Amico and Nicholas Corozzo ran the day-to-day family operations.

The charges included numerous drug charges and charges of extorting payments from a Staten Island trucking company owned by businessman Joseph Vollaro. On June 5, 2008, in a plea bargain deal, the government dropped all drug charges against Corozzo and he pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy. Joseph received 46 months in federal prison, the low end of the sentencing guidelines. On January 1, 2011, five months before his scheduled release date, Joseph was indicted again as part of an FBI operation against over 100 alleged Mafia members and associates. His specific charges included distributing cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy. On September 19, 2012, Corozzo was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Corozzo was imprisoned at the low security Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix in New Jersey. In October 2015, Corozzo was transferred to a reentry center in Brooklyn.

Declaration, Chapter 4: Miscellaneous Provisions Background The protection of religious and minority rights had been a matter of international concern and the subject of protections ever since the days of the Peace of Westphalia.Essays on International Law and Organization, Leo Grossman, BRILL, 1984, , page 5 The 1878 Treaty of Berlin had a new type of provision that protected minorities in the Balkans and newly independent states Great Power recognition was nominally conditional on the promise of guarantees of religious and civic freedoms for local religious minorities. Historian Carol Fink argues: :the imposed clauses on minority rights became requirements not only for recognition but were also, as in the cases of Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania, conditions for receiving specific grants of territory.Carole Fink, Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection (2004). p 37. Fink reports that these provisions were generally not enforced—no suitable mechanism existed and the Great Powers had little interest in doing so. Protections were part of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and became increasingly important after World War II.Jennifer Jackson Preece, \\"Minority rights in Europe: from Westphalia to Helsinki.\\" Review of international studies 23#1 (1997): 75-92. At the Paris Peace Conference the Supreme Council established 'The Committee on New States and for The Protection of Minorities'. All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition. It was agreed that although the new States had been recognized, they had not been 'created' before the signatures of the final Peace Treaties.Oscar I. Janowsky, The Jews And Minority Rights, (1898-1919) (Columbia University Press, 1933), p. 342 Clemenceau noted in an aide-memoire attached to the Polish treaty that the minority protections were consistent with diplomatic precedent: The new treaties gave minorities the right to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In the case of the Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction.Summary of the work of the League of Nations, January 1920-March 1922, League of Nations Union, 1922, page 4 and United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, Part I. - Future Constitution and Government of Palestine, C. Declaration The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded. As with most of the principles adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties. Many international law norms and customary practices developed in the inter-war years by the League of Nations are still in use today. The procedures for managing intrastate and inter- ethnic issues include international supervision, regional economic unions, minority protection, plebiscites, and territorial partition. The Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and European Union practice are modern examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.see the discussion on pages 97-98 and footnote 353 in Managing Babel: The International Legal Protection of Minorities in the Twentieth Century, Li-ann Thio, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2005 Bilateral treaties There were several bilateral Minority Treaties, each signed between one of the countries in question and the League. The treaties were signed between the League and some of the newly established nations: Poland, Yugoslavia (also known then as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), Czechoslovakia. Similar treaties were also imposed on Greece and Entente- allied Romania in exchange for their territorial enlargement, and on some of the nations defeated in the First World War (Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey). At the same time, Albania, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and, outside of Europe, Iraq were persuaded to accept minority obligations as part of the terms of their admission to the League of Nations.Jennifer Jackson Preece, Minority Rights in Europe: From Westphalia to Helsinki Review of International Studies, 1997, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 1-18.

Registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 21 July 1921.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 5, pp. 336-353 System The Minority Treaties were the basis of the League's system of minorities. Their aim was to protect the minorities without alienating the majority of the countries' population. The procedure was centered on the Council of the League (rather than the more encompassing Assembly) which had the right and obligation to raise complaints of treaty violations. Individual Council members had the unique privilege of placing complaints on the agenda, even through the petitions for that could be sent from any source. The majority of cases, however, were never handled by the council. Before reaching the Council, the petition passed through: the minority section of the Secretariat which selected the petitions according to some criteria (prohibition of violent language, integrity of the state, complaints about specific violations...), tried a first mediation and asked for supplementary information; the special committee of three that was appointed by the council and had the faculty of: # dismissing the petition; # trying a second stage of mediation # submitting the question to the Council, which had the opportunity to seek a final agreement between the parties.Giuseppe Motta, Less of Nations. Central-Eastern European minorities after WW1, vol.1; http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/59407 If the accused government and the League could not reach a satisfactory compromise, the final decision was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice (most cases were solved by negotiations between affected governments before the International Court intervention).Carole Fink, \\"The minorities question at the Paris Peace Conference\\" in The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years, Manfred Franz Boemeke, Gerald D. Feldman, Elisabeth Gläser (eds.), Cambridge University Press, 1998, , Google Print - p. 249 onward Importance The Minority Treaties, recognized as history's first minority treaties, were an important step in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis. Nonetheless, the treaties were also subject to past and present criticism. The countries subject to the treaties saw it as limiting their sovereignty and infringing their right for self-determination, as the League was allowed to influence national, religious and educational policy in those countries, and suggesting that they were not competent enough to deal with their internal matters. Further criticism centered on the treaties not being obligatory for the established countries (like France, Germany, United Kingdom or Russia). The Western countries, who dictated the treaties in the aftermath of the First World War, saw minority safeguards as unnecessary for themselves, and trusted that they could fulfill the \\"standard of civilization\\". It was the new Central and Eastern European countries that were not trusted to respect those rights, and, of course, Bolshevik Russia, still in the throes of the Russian Revolution, was a separate case. This inequality further offended the smaller countries. Finally, this inequality also meant that the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.Boris Tsilevich, EU Enlargement and the Protection of National Minorities: Opportunities, Myths, and Prospects, 2001. With the decline of League of Nations in the 1930s, the treaties were increasingly considered unenforceable and useless. The League Council, charged with enforcing the various minority treaties, often failed to act upon complaints from minorities. There was an unwritten rule that state policies aimed at the cultural assimilation of minorities should be ignored as the \\"minor evil\\" with regard to the rights enshrined in the Minority Treaties when those policies were seen as guaranteeing the internal stability of the state concerned. When the Council did review cases, the reviews were commonly dominated by the countries whose ethnic groups were affected and that tried not only to resolve the problem of mistreatment of their minorities but also score other political goals on the international scene, sometimes even sacrificing the very minority in question (German and Hungarian governments are recognized as having abused the system the most). Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations. Even before Adolf Hitler seized control of Germany in 1933, the problems with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934. =Renewed interest= Judge Sir Hersch Lauterpacht explained the legal effectiveness of the operation of this system of minority protection treaties. He pointed out the Court's determination to discourage the evasion of these international obligations, and its repeated affirmation of The United Nations established a formal minority rights protection system as an integral part of the Plan for the Future Government of Palestine.A complete list of the various legal instruments still in force was compiled by the UN Secretariat in 1950. E/CN.4/367 Symbol: E/CN.4/367, Date: 7 April 1950 (see CHAPTER III THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND THE TREATIES CONCLUDED AFTER THE WAR, resolution 181(II) of 29 November 1947, \\"The Future Government of Palestine\\", pages 22-23)Self-determination and National Minorities, Thomas D. Musgrave, Oxford Monographs in International Law, Oxford University Press, 1997, , Table of Treaties, Page xxxviii The status of the treaties was questioned by the United Nations Secretariat in 1950, but a modern-day Chairman-Rapporteur of the UN Working Group on Minorities subsequently advised that no competent UN organ had made any decision which that extinguish the obligations under those instruments. He added that it was doubtful whether that could even be done by the United Nations. The provision that 'No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants on the ground of race, religion, language or sex.' is enshrined in a multitude of international human rights conventions and the UN Charter itself.see the discussion in Justifications of Minority Protection in International Law, Athanasia Spiliopoulou Akermark, pages 119-122. Li-ann Thio, a professor of international and human rights law at the National University of Singapore noted that many international law norms and customary practices developed in the inter-war years by the League of Nations are still in use today. She specifically addressed the procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues through (1) international supervision, (2)supranational integration, (3)minority protection, (4)plebiscites, and (5)partitions. She cited the Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and 1990s European practice as examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees. The International Court of Justice performed a legal analysis of the status of the territory of Palestine in order to determine the applicable law, before seeking to establish whether that law had been breached. The Court said that in addition to the general guarantees of freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, account had to be taken of specific guarantees of access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places. It noted that minority and religious rights had been placed under international guarantee by Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July 1878, and observed that those \\"existing rights\\" had been preserved in accordance with the safeguarding provisions of Article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate and a chapter of General Assembly resolution 181 (II) on the future government of Palestine.See paragraphs 69, 70, and 129 of the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognized the urgent need to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It also noted that the rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.

Grant, The Recognition of States: Law and Practice in Debate and Evolution, Praeger/Greenwood, 1999, Google Print, p.114 Background Poland regained independence (as the Second Polish Republic), after 123 years of partitions, in the aftermath of the First World War. The victorious powers decided that due to significant non-Polish minorities in areas claimed by Poland (which historically controlled many Lithuanian and Ruthenian territories under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and would likely inherit a substantial German minority within its new borders) and the ongoing civilian strife caused by the local wars (in particular the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918-1919 and Polish- Soviet War of 1919-1920), Poland had to sign the treaty in exchange for Polish independence and for Poland to sign the peace treaty with Germany (the Article 93 of the Treaty of Versailles stated that: \\"Poland accepts... provisions... to protect the interests of inhabitants of Poland who differ from the majority of the population in race, language, or religion\\").See the text of the Treaty of Versailles . Note that identical requirement was given to Czechoslovakia in Article 86. In addition, the treaty declared that Poland had to take over a part of debts of Russian state and grant a most favored nation clause in transit trade to \\"Allied and Associated States\\" (Articles 14-18). The treaty The Polish government declared its support for \\"total and complete protection of life and freedom of all people regardless of their birth, nationality, language, race or religion\\" (Article 2) and religious tolerance (Article 7 which stated that \\"difference of religion, creed, or confession shall not prejudice any Polish national in matters relating to the enjoyment of civil or political rights, as for instance the admission to Public employment, functions and honors, or the exercise of professions and industries\\"). Provisions of the treaty \\"were obligations of international importance and were guaranteed by the League of Nations\\". They could not be changed \\"without consent of majority of the League of Nations Council\\" (Article 12). National minorities could direct their complaints to the League of Nations Council. Difference of opinions \\"in legal or actual matters\\" between Poland and any of the western powers or any of the members of the League of Nations Council, which would result from provisions of the treaty was to have an international character (Article 12). The treaty was signed by Polish representatives at Versailles (Roman Dmowski, Ignacy Paderewski) on 28 June 1919, the same day as the main Treaty of Versailles (hence it is known as Little or Small Treaty of Versailles. The parliament of Poland, the Sejm, ratified the treaty on 31 July 1919; the treaty was implemented on 10 January 1920. Poland renounced it at the League of Nations forum in Geneva on 13 September 1934.

Several Cumins were clerks in the chanceries of King Henry I of England and King Henry II of England, as well as in the dioceses of Rouen and Bayeux. A John Cumin, who became Archbishop of Dublin in 1182 may also have been a relative.Young \\"Cumin, William\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography William Cumin was Archdeacon of Worcester by March 1125 and the chancellor of King David I of ScotlandGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Durham: Bishops before 1136. David was the uncle of the Empress Matilda.Barlow English Church pp. 96–97 Cumin was educated by Geoffrey Rufus, who had been chancellor to King Henry I of England and Bishop of Durham.Barlow English Church p. 88 Cumin was captured at the Battle of the Standard in August 1138, but was set free at the instigation of the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia. At the time of the death of Geoffrey Rufus, most of the diocese of Durham was under the control of King David. With the death of Geoffrey, David tried to gain control of the English diocese by installing his own candidate into Durham, this being his chancellor, Cumin.Huscroft Ruling England p. 134 When David came south to meet with the Empress, he stopped in Durham, where he refused to allow the burial of the previous bishop until Cumin was allowed into the see.Crouch Reign of King Stephen pp. 310–311 Cumin was intruded into the see of Durham about 11 May 1141, but was never consecrated. However, when the Empress was driven from London in June 1141, this deprived Cumin of some support. Cumin still had the support of one of Geoffrey's nephews and support in the cathedral chapter and castle. But he was opposed by Ranulf, the nephew of Bishop Ranulf Flambard, who was an archdeacon at Durham, and by the papal legate to England. Another supporter was William of Aumale, Earl of York, who attempted to marry one of his nieces to Cumin's nephew who held Northallerton in the North Riding of Yorkshire.Dalton \\"William Earl of York\\" Haskins Society Journal p. 162 By 1142, David had withdrawn his support, and Cumin resorted to using a forged letter of support from the papacy in an attempt to get consecrated. Eventually Cumin was deprived of his benefices by Pope Innocent II about 14 March 1143 as well as being excommunicated. Around this time his soldiers were described as by Simeon of Durham as \\"incessantly making forages; whatever they could lay their hands on they plundered....wherever these men passed it became a wilderness. Their torments were of many and various kinds, difficult to describe and difficult to believe. Men were hung from the walls of their own howses....others...plunged into the bed of the river....everywhere throughout the town there were groanss and various kinds of deaths\\". At the same time, the pope ordered a new election held at York Minster which selected the Dean of York, William of St. Barbara. Cumin, however, still had the support of two of the local magnates, Henry the Earl of Northumbria and Alan the Earl of Richmond, and Cumin garrisoned the priory. In 1144, Cumin negotiated a settlement of the dispute, in which he relinquished his claims to Durham in exchange for lands to endow his nephew Richard. Cumin was imprisoned for a time, but eventually returned to the south of England where he had the support of Gilbert Foliot, then Abbot of Gloucester. Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury then took up Cumin's cause in about 1146, and Theobald lobbied the papacy for Cumin's absolution. Cumin was restored to some of his benefices by 1152, and was once more Archdeacon of Worcester by 1157. He died probably about 1158 or 1159.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Worcester: Archdeacons of Worcester Two of Cumin's nephews served as knights in Scotland. William is noted as a knight by the Durham chronicle, and Osbert served Henry, earl of Northumberland. Both died in the before 1144 during the conflicts in Durham. Another nephew, Richard Comyn, received the honour of Richmond as part of his uncle's settlement at Durham. Richard was the ancestor of the Comyn family of Scotland.

The \\"I Love...\\"-series spawned a US version, aired by VH-1. Part of the series was repeated in the spring of 2012 on BBC Two as part of a special season dedicated to the 1970s.

History Regarding the origins of the band name, Ritchie Young stated \\"I wanted to call the band The Mountains but there are tons of \\"mountains\\" bands. We ordered some reel- to-reel tape on eBay and it had a sticker on the box that said Loch Lomond. On the tape itself were old French nuns singing. We sampled that in our first record.\\" With help of engineer/producer Rob Oberdorfer, Young crafted the first Loch Lomond album, When We Were Mountains with Ryan Cross and Kate O'Brien in 2004. Over the next few years, Loch Lomond performed around Portland, Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest in various incarnations. Live performances would range from Young by himself to a full band. During this time, many different recording sessions took place in various studios and homes. These recordings were compiled on the early 2006 EP Lament For Children. In the later half of 2006, Loch Lomond solidified into a nine-person band. In this format, they produced their 2007 album \\"Paper the Walls\\", which was more reminiscent of traditional chamber folk music while featuring many non-traditional instruments. They toured with The Decemberists in late 2008. In 2010, Loch Lomond's song, Wax and Wire, was featured in the short film Danny MacAskill's Way Back Home produced by Red Bull Media House. 2011 saw the release of Little Me Will Start A Storm, Tender Loving Empire. 2012 Chemikal Underground released the EP White Dresses.

The small community is located on the shores of Southwest Arm, New Bay and was first settled by loggers in the late 1800s who came for the local timber resource. Several sawmills were constructed, and over the years the town developed around the logging industry. Over the past several decades logging has drastically declined, and is no longer a way of life for the majority of people; however, a few still do find employment in a small sawmill located near the town. In the 1980s, Superior Glove Works opened a factory that remains in operation today, employing many townspeople. Meanwhile, many others commute to nearby Botwood and Grand Falls for work.  Attractions  There is a hiking trail at Rowsell's Hill, which leads to a scenic outlook of the town. There are also a few swimming holes in town, including Mill River and Otter Pond. The Point Leamington Heritage Interpretive Centre is a museum that explores the interesting history of the town. It has a gift store and kitchen called Aunt Ethel's for snacks and refreshments. It is scenically located by the rapids of the Mill River, overlooking the bay.  Education  Education in the town is provided through Point Leamington Academy, which is operated by the Nova Central School District. The school houses nearly 100 students, grades K-12 from Point Leamington, Leading Tickles, Glovers Harbour, and Pleasantview.

At age 16 she came up with the stage name Dolores Duran and became a crooner, working at nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952, Dolores recorded her debut album, which featured songs like \\"Canção da Volta\\" (Antonio Maria-Ismael Neto) and \\"Bom É Querer Bem\\" (Fernando Lobo). Her first composition, \\"Se É por Falta de Adeus\\", was written with Antonio Carlos Jobim and recorded by Dóris Monteiro. She wrote two other pop music classics with Jobim, \\"Por Causa de Você\\" and \\"Estrada de Sol\\". Dolores wrote also: \\"Fim de Caso\\", \\"Solidão\\", \\"Castigo\\", as well as \\"Pela Rua\\", \\"Ternura Antiga\\" and \\"Idéias Erradas\\", written with Ribamar. Dolores toured the former Soviet Union in 1958 with other Brazilian performers, and later spent some time in Paris on her way back to South America. She recorded her greatest hit, \\"A Noite do Meu Bem\\" a few days before she died. Duran died of a heart attack at age 29. She always had a weak heart and had already had a milder heart attack a few years before. After her premature death, Dolores' fame increased, and singers like Lúcio Alves and Nana Caymmi dedicated full albums to her music.

Upon entering the university, Cook was one of the first African-Americans to play for the football program. After playing well on the freshman team, Cook was promoted to the varsity football team. He was a starter as a sophomore, ending the season with 68 tackles and 18 quarterback sacks, both school records. Graduation took apart the front line, as Cook was the lone returning starter for the 1972 season. The team only managed three wins, but Cook was still a dominant force, recording 19 sacks and 122 tackles. In 1974, his senior season, his tackles diminished, but he still lead the team in quarterback sacks.https://southernmiss.com/news/2009/8/25/Fred_Cook_to_Become_Sixth_Southern_Miss_Football_Player_to_Join_Legends_Club.aspx Cook was third team All-American and played in both the senior bowl and Blue- Gray games.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/smis/genrel/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/fred- cook.pdf Pro career Cook was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the second round of the 1972 National Football League draft. The Colts had fallen on hard times. In 1974, under head coach Howard Schnellenberger the team was terrible, going 2-12, only getting wins versus the New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons. In 1975, the Colts had a new head coach in Ted Marchibroda and improved to 10–4. Cook started all 14 games, just as he did as a rookie the previous season. Cook picked off a Steve Grogan pass for his first career interception in the Colts 34–21 over the New England Patriots.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197512210clt.htm Cook also scored the only touchdown of his career when he returned a fumble recovery for a score in another game that season. The Colts qualified for the playoffs three times during Cook's career, but they lost in each appearance. One of those was the \\"Ghost To The Post\\" game in which Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler hit tight end Dave Casper for the winning touchdown in the final minutes of the game. Oakland won 37–31. Cook was a full-time starter in each of his seasons with the Colts, playing in 104 games for the franchise. On July 19 1981, the Colts traded Cook, who was pending to be a free agent, to the Washington Redskins for a few draft picks. However, Cook was dealing injuries and never played for Washington.https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/sports/colts-trade-fred-cook-to- redskins.html Personal life In 2009, Southern Mississippi inducted Cook into their legends club. The club consist of former players, many of whom went on to careers in the NFL. Brett Favre, Ray Guy, Reggie Collier, and Sammy Winder are among the players in the club. When Hurricane Katrina struck Mississippi, Cook's elementary school was completely destroyed, and he himself lost two cars. He also lost the son of a friend to suicide not long after the storm. Though the losses left him battling depression, Cook vowed to not let it get him down. Not long after the storm, he returned to Baltimore for an alumni reunion.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-2006-11-06-0611060094-story.html References Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pascagoula, Mississippi Category:Players of American football from Mississippi Category:American football defensive linemen Category:Southern Miss Golden Eagles football players Category:Baltimore Colts players ","title":"Fred Cook (American football)"},{"id":"13910129","text":"Sir Frederick Wright-Bruce Sir Frederick William Adolphus Wright-Bruce, GCB (14 April 1814 – 19 September 1867) was a British diplomat. Early life Frederick Bruce was the youngest of the three sons of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin and his second wife Elizabeth, youngest daughter of James Townshend Oswald of Dunnikier, Fife. He was born at Broomhall, Fife, on 14 April 1814. It was during his brief practice as a barrister that he changed his surname after receiving a large inheritance from a client. Diplomatic service On 9 February 1842 he was attached to Lord Ashburton's mission to Washington, returning to England with his lordship in September of that year. =Hong Kong, Bolivia, Uruguay, Egypt and China= On 9 February 1844 he was appointed colonial secretary at Hong Kong, and accompanied its second governor John Francis Davis on arriving there on 8 May of that year. He left Hong Kong to begin 16 months' leave, on the 23 June 1846, and just four days later was appointed lieutenant-governor of Newfoundland. His next change was to Sucre, with the appointment of consul-general in the republic of Bolivia on 23 July 1847, and on 14 April 1848 he was accredited as chargé d'affaires. He was named chargé d'affaires to the Oriental republic of Uruguay on 29 August 1851, and on 3 August 1853 became agent and consul-general in Egypt in the place of the Hon. C. A. Murray. On his brother, Lord Elgin, being appointed ambassador extraordinary to China, he accompanied him as principal secretary in April 1857. He brought home (18 September 1857) the treaty with China signed at Tientsin on 26 June 1858 and was made a C.B. on 28 September. His diplomatic tact was thoroughly appreciated by the home government, for he was appointed on 2 December 1858 envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the Xianfeng Emperor of China, and on 1 March following chief superintendent of British trade in that country. His mission was prevented from proceeding to Peking by the opposition made by the Chinese. The mission therefore returned to Shanghai, where it remained until the ratification of the treaty of 26 June 1858 at Peking on 24 October 1860. He proceeded to Peking on 7 November 1860 but withdrew to Tientsin for the winter, while arrangements were made for putting a residence in order for his reception. The mission was established at Peking on 26 March 1861, but it was not until 2 April that Bruce paid a visit to Prince Gong. During his time in Shanghai, his support for the Qing contributed heavily to Britain's later intervention in the Taiping Rebellion. =United States= On the removal of Lord Lyons from Washington to Constantinople, Bruce was selected to fill the important office of British representative at Washington on 1 March 1865. He was made a K.C.B. of the civil division on 12 December 1862 and received the grand cross of the order on 17 March 1865. He was appointed umpire by the commission named under the convention of 1864, concluded between the United States of America and the United States of Colombia, for the adjustment of claims of American citizens against the Colombian government. He died, unmarried, at Boston in the United States on 19 September 1867, when his remains were embalmed and, being conveyed to Scotland, were interred at Dunfermline Abbey on 8 October.

It began in 1943 when founder Stanley Davis purchased the St. Peter Creamery of St. Peter, Minnesota. The company has since expanded to include plants in Minnesota, Idaho, and South Dakota, as well as sales offices in Minneapolis, Geneva, Shanghai and strategic partners in the Middle East, Japan, and Africa. Davisco Foods International was managed until 2012 by Stanley's son, Mark Davis. Mark's son, Jon Davis, was appointed CEO from January 1, 2012. History 1943-1953 On August 1, 1943, Stanley Davis decided to buy the St. Peter Creamery, a dairy company located in his hometown of St. Peter, Minnesota. Harvey Parson, Davis's former teacher, was a partner in the creamery for six months, as was Eiler Grand after that. When Parsons and Grand left to start their own companies elsewhere, Davis became the sole owner of the company. In 1944, World War II brought a sudden change to the dairy markets; the government wanted skim milk to ship overseas and began rationing butter. Demand and prices for dairy products were high during this time, permanently changing both the market and the business model of St. Peter Creamery. 1953-1963 When prices began to drop during the 1950s, the St. Peter Creamery faced many challenges. In order to continue running the company, Stan Davis decided to purchase a dryer. In 1959, Stan Davis's son Mark began working for the company as a driver for the new bulk milk pickup route. 1963-1973 The dryer installed in 1956 made it possible for the St. Peter Creamery to service increasingly large milk routes by the early 1960s. Eventually, St. Peter was servicing the Bernadotte, Blue Earth, Cleveland, Mankato, Nicollet, Pemberton, and St. Clair routes. The largest consolidation came in 1969 when Stan Davis and Allen Cords, former classmates in dairy school at the University of Minnesota, decided to combine the milk supplies of the St. Peter Creamery and the Le Sueur Cheese Company. Stan Davis, Mark Davis, and Allen Cords each owned one-third of the new business, and Mark Davis became the manager of Le Sueur Cheese. In 1970, the cheese plant in Le Sueur was expanded and another partnership was established with Glen Anderson, a former employee. This led to the company taking ownership of another dryer, this time at a plant in Nicollet, Minnesota . 1973-1983 In 1973, a unique partnership was formed with Fromagerie Bongrain (USA) Inc., a subsidiary of Bongrain-Gerard, S.A., based in Guyancourt, France. The company researched several United States locations and chose Le Sueur as the site for production of its Camembert and Brie cheeses. For eight years the American and French cheese plants operated side by side in the Le Sueur Cheese building, until finally the value of international currency made the venture unprofitable. During the 1970s, the St. Peter Creamery ended butter production and stopped taking milk from farmers. Its capacity as a specialty drying plant tripled when a used spray dryer was rebuilt and installed in 1978, making necessary new warehouse and powder storage facilities in 1981. Another dryer was also added at the Nicollet plant. 1983-1993 In December 1983, Stan Davis purchased a creamery in Lake Norden, South Dakota. It was a move that turned the business away from traditional ideas of profit in the dairy industry; the Lake Norden plant would collect no milk, gaining its profits solely from whey collected from the surrounding cheese plants. The Lake Norden site was immediately expanded to include an additional spray dryer and space for liquid and dry storage. In 1986, the three Davis companies - St. Peter Creamery, Inc.; Le Sueur Cheese Company, Inc.; and Nicollet Food Products, Inc. - merged to form Davisco Foods International, Inc. This move unified the company, which now had plants in four locations. Shortly after, all four of Stan Davis's sons entered the family business. In 1991, Davisco Foods International acquired the Welsh company that it was tied to in the production of BiPro, its whey protein isolate. During the same year, Mark Davis decided to build a cheese plant in Jerome, Idaho, because there was a good milk supply in need of a processing plant. In 1993, the company decided to move the old St. Peter Creamery, now a part of Davisco's Food Ingredient Division, to Le Sueur, Minnesota. The new plant was designed to handle the increased volume and diversity demanded by a quickly changing food industry. 1993-2003 The 1990s brought rapid change to Davisco Foods International. BiPro, the whey protein isolate responsible for increased company profits in the 1980s, found new applications in the consumer market. In 1994, the fully automated cheese plant in Jerome received honors as Food Engineering Magazine's New Plant of the Year. In 1995, Pauline Olson joined Davisco Food International's management team as the Director of Sales and Marketing. Also during this time, the company hired new sales personnel and full-time applications scientists. In 1998, Jerome Cheese Company was selected as the prime site for the construction of a new whey processing facility. The operation became the only commercial whey fractionating plant in the United States to use chromatography methods. The addition of an automated cheddaring system later in 1998 increased plant capacity. As the company grew and the need for sales and marketing resources increased, Davisco Foods International moved its original Le Sueur sales headquarters to Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The company later added sales offices in Mexico City, Mexico, and Geneva, Switzerland. 2003-Present During the 2000s, Davisco Foods International launched a consumer line of whey protein products, beginning with the sales of BiPro whey protein isolate in March 2004. At the end of 2006, the company began sales of two additional consumer products, BioZate (a hydrolyzed whey protein isolate supplement) and BioZzz (alpha-lactalbumin).

Arrest Higazy was arrested following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He alleges that the FBI threatened to torture his family unless he confessed to being involved in the attacks. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, issued a decision holding that Higazy had stated a 5th Amendment claim, and then removed the decision from the court's website and shortly thereafter replaced it with a redacted version. The redacted version omitted approximately one page of details relating to the FBI's alleged interrogation of Higazy during a polygraph examination. On September 24, 2009, Abdallah was paid approximately $250,000 by the FBI for his treatment and wrongful detention. Facts as stated by the court According to the original opinion, Higazy was an Egyptian student staying at the Millenium Hilton Hotel near the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Hotel security claimed they found an aviation radio in Higazy's safe. The FBI questioned Higazy, guessing he might somehow have been communicating with or aiding the 9/11 pilots. Higazy denied he owned the radio. The FBI wanted Higazy to be detained as a material witness, but the federal judge allowed only a 10-day detention, because the evidence suggesting Higazy's involvement in 9/11 was not very strong. On the ninth day, an FBI agent conducted a polygraph test during which, according to Higazy, the agent told Higazy that unless Higazy confessed to owning the radio, they would \\"make sure that Egyptian security (gave) his family Hell,\\" which both parties understood to include torture. Higazy confessed to owning the radio. A criminal complaint was then filed against Higazy, and he was detained without bail. Approximately three weeks later, the airline pilot who actually owned the radio returned to the Hilton Hotel to reclaim his property, which he had left at the hotel. Two days later, Higazy was released after spending a total of 34 days in custody. Subsequent media coverage The CBS television show 60 Minutes interviewed Higazy in 2004, and the CBS website includes most of Higazy's allegations. A newspaper account of the redaction quotes the clerk for the appellate court stating that the decision to reissue the opinion in redacted format was not done at the request of the Justice Department or the FBI, and that the redacted information was originally sealed for the safety of Higazy and his family.

Early life He was the eldest son of Robert Brunton, a watchmaker (14 Aug 1748–1834) of Dalkeith,Williamson's Street Directory 1784 where he was born. He studied mechanics in his father's watch and clock making shop, and engineering under his grandfather William Brunton (16 July 1706 – 22 March 1787), who was a colliery viewer in the neighborhood. (His grandfathers death certificate states that William Brunton was actually a portioner in Dalkeith, not a colliery viewer) Career In 1790 he commenced work in the fitting shops of the cotton mills at New Lanark built by David Dale and Sir Richard Arkwright. In 1796, he migrated south to Birmingham, being attracted by the fame of the Soho Foundry, obtaining employment with Boulton and Watt. He remained at Soho until he was made foreman and superintendent of the engine manufactory. Still only twenty-one, he would be sent alone to rectify problems on customers premises. Leaving Soho in 1808 he joined the Butterley Works of Benjamin Outram and William Jessop, and being deputed to represent his master in many important missions he made the acquaintance of John Rennie, Thomas Telford, and other eminent engineers. In 1815 he returned to Birmingham, having become a partner in and the mechanical manager of the Eagle Foundry, where he remained ten years, during which time he designed and executed a great variety of important works. From 1825 to 1835 he appears to have been practising in London as a civil engineer, but quitting the metropolis at the latter date he took a share in the Cwmafan Tin Works, Glamorganshire, where he erected copper smelting furnaces and rolling mills. He became connected with the Maesteg Works in the same county, and with a brewery at Neath in 1838; here a total failure ensued, and the savings of his life were lost. Inventions Drawing of a Brunton calciner. As a mechanical engineer his works were various and important; many of them were in the adaptation of original and ingenious modes of reducing and manufacturing metals, and the improvement of the machinery connected therewith. In the introduction of steam navigation he had a large share; he made some of the original engines used on the Humber and the Trent, and some of the earliest on the Mersey, including those for the vessel which first plied on the Liverpool ferries in 1814. He fitted out the Sir Francis Drake at Plymouth in 1824, the first steamer that ever took a man-of-war in tow. Brunton took out nine patents in all, three of them while he was in Birmingham. His first was for a steam boiler furnace with a revolving bed and a vibrating hopper which distributed the fuel evenly.Prosser, R.B. (1881) Birmingham Inventors and Inventions Private publication, reprinted 1970 Wakefield: S.R.Publishers. His calciner was used on the works of most of the tin mines in Cornwall, as well as at the silver ore works in Mexico, and his fan regulator was also found to be a most useful invention. At the Butterley works he applied the principle of a rapid rotation of the mould in casting iron pipes, and incurred great expense in securing a patent, only to find that a foreigner, who used the same process in casting terra cotta, had recited in his specifications that the same mode might be applied to metals. The most novel and ingenious of his inventions was the walking machine called the Steam Horse, which he made at Butterley in 1813 for use on the company's tramway at Crich. A second one was built for the Newbottle colliery, which worked with a load up a gradient of 1 in 36 during all the winter of 1814. Early in 1815, through some carelessness, this machine exploded and killed thirteen persons.Nicholas Wood, Treatise on Rail Roads, 1825, pp. 131–5, with a plate. In the course of his career he obtained many patents, but derived little remuneration from them, although several of them came into general use. Latterly he turned his attention to the subject of improved ventilation for collieries, and sent models of his inventions to the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park. He was intimate with all the engineers of the older school, and was almost the last of that celebrated set of men. Later life After his experience at Neath, he occasionally reappeared in his profession, but was never again fully embarked in business. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, but the date of his admission has not been found. Brunton died at the residence of his son, William Brunton, at Camborne, Cornwall, 5 October 1851, having married, 30 October 1810, Anne Elizabeth Button, adopted daughter of John and Rebecca Dickinson of Summer Hill, Birmingham. She died at Eaglesbush, Neath, Glamorganshire, 1845, leaving sons who became well known engineers in their own right - John born 1812, William born 1817, J. Dickinson born 1821 and George born 1823.

He attended Pictou Academy. He founded Frontier College in 1899, the oldest adult education institution in Canada. Career In 1899, Reverend Fitzpatrick began teaching labourers from lumber, mining, and railway camps out of a log cabin in Nairn, Ontario although he had no staff, some parish assistance, and little money. He founded the Frontier College in 1899 with his colleagues at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Fitzpatrick developed the idea of the Labourer-Teacher who work alongside the labourers during the day and teaches them in the evenings. In 1920, Reverend Alfred Fitzpatrick said, \\"Whenever and wherever people shall have occasion to congregate, then and there shall be the time, place and means of their education.\\" The College's purpose was to teach frontiersmen how to read. He promoted education as a right for all. He challenged Canadian universities to recognize the balance of intellectual, spiritual and physical qualities every individual embodies, no matter their station in life. Alfred Fitzpatrick wrote books which argued for literacy and explained why new immigrants should receive language and cultural training. He objected to the conditions imposed on a transient, peripheral working class. He challenged Canadians, its universities and its government and businesses to take education and literacy to labourers, remote communities, ex-convicts, people with learning disabilities, and street people. After World War II, the Frontier College began working with teens, children, and families in urban centers. It established literacy programs to promote reading among the young, in remote communities, ex-convicts, people with learning disabilities, and street people. Frontier College continues to this day helping to combat illiteracy in Canada with program of basic literacy, secondary and university education. The organization, which celebrated its 100th Anniversary in 1999, was founded on the principle of \\"literacy for all\\".

It was formerly placed in the family Myrsinaceae before this was merged into the Primulaceae. It is found nearly worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical areas. It contains about 200 species, including several notable radiations, such as the matipo of New Zealand and the kōlea of Hawaii (the New Zealand \\"black matipo\\", Pittosporum tenuifolium, is not related to Myrsine). In the United States, members of this genus are known as colicwood. Some species, especially M. africana, are grown as ornamental shrubs. The leathery, evergreen leaves are simple and alternate, with smooth or toothed margins and without stipules. The one-seeded, indehiscent fruit is a thin-fleshed globose drupe. The flowers and fruits often do not develop until after leaf fall and thus appear naked on the branches. The fruits often do not mature until the year after flowering. The calyx is persistent. The Pacific basin and New World species formerly separated in the genera Rapanea and Suttonia (distinguished from the African and Southeast Asian Myrsine sensu stricto by having the style absent and staminal tube and filaments completely adnate to the corolla) are now generally included in Myrsine.

It has two churches, only one of which is still in use. Its nearest town is Basingstoke, approximately away. It has an acreage of , which lies on comparatively low ground, south of the high country round the surrounding villages of Farleigh Wallop and Nutley, and north-west of that which rises to Wield and beyond to Bentworth. The village itself lies on the lowest ground towards the west of the parish on the road which comes northeast from Northington and the two other Candovers, and runs across the parish to enter Nutley at Axford and continues uphill to Farleigh Wallop and thence to Basingstoke. The village is home to Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his wife Anya Linden, of the supermarket Sainsbury family. History The village of Preston Candover is probably of Saxon origin. It was originally called Prestecandavere, the Candover belonging to the Priests. The name derives in part from the Candover Brook which rises from springs just to the south of the village, and from a religious community which flourished here before the Norman Conquest. By the eleventh century Preston parish had been carved up into six manors. The land from which they drew their revenues became organised into the common field system. This was based initially on three large fields worked in common by the villagers, although new fields were added as the population grew. The fields were divided into furlongs, each furlongs being divided in turn into strips of about in size. A family's holding consisted of a number of strips dotted about each of the common fields. Much of the higher ground in the valley was devoted to rough grazing and also held in common, this land comprising Preston and Nutley Down, Southwood Green, and Oakhills Common. At one time Preston Down was joined to those of Brown and Chilton Candover, and this made it an ideal route for the drovers and their herds. The trackway across the down today is known as the B3046 route. =Victorian times= By Victorian times Preston Candover and Nutley had a population of over 500 people. The land was divided between six main farms, ranging in size from 200 to . The village at Preston formed a long straggling settlement. The cottages were a mixture of styles, some timber framed, others built of brick or of flint with brick dressings. The roofs were either thatched or tiled. The villages of Preston Candover and Nutley each had a church dedicated to St Mary. Preston's church lay at the southern end of the village. It had been built in the seventeenth century, the original church, dating from 1190, having been destroyed by fire. The village also had a Methodist Chapel, built in 1865. =1901 to the present= A major change in the appearance of the village occurred in the 1920s at the point where the Basingstoke–Alresford road met the road to Wield. Previously there had been just a pond lying at the fork in the road. In 1870 a parish pump was installed next to the pond. In dry summers it was much used by farmers from Wield and Ellisfield, while the brick steps became a favourite spot for visiting Methodist preachers to conduct meetings and for pedlars to display their wares. A memorial was erected in 1919 in honour of the 16 men of the parish killed in action during the Great War. The Candovers are now today a main crossing point to New Alresford and Basingstoke, but still the three villages still remain in peaceful countryside. To this present day there is a primary school opposite the playing fields and tennis courts in the village, which has a nursery and a primary school up to year 6. Mrs Simrit Otway is the headteacher. Governance The village of Preston Candover is part of the civil parish of Preston Candover, which is part of the parish council of Preston Candover and Nutley. It is also part of the Upton Grey and the Candovers ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non- metropolitan district in Hampshire County Council.

Life Statue of John Cordy Burrows at Old Steine, Brighton Burrows was born at Ipswich on 5 August 1813. He was the second child of Robert Burrows, silversmith, of Ipswich, by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Cordy of London. John was educated at the Ipswich grammar school, but, left at an early age to become an apprentice to the surgeon Mr. William Jeffreson in Framlingham, with whom he diligently applied himself to his profession. Moving to Brighton in 1837, he became an assistant to the surgeon Mr. Dix to whom he was distantly related. After two years he started a practice of his own. His medical studies had been conducted at Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals. He qualified at the Society of Apothecaries in 1835, became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1836, and was admitted a fellow in 1852. Once in practice for himself it was not long before he came into public notice, and, while not neglecting his professional work, found both time and energy to do many other things. In 1841 along with Dr. Turrell he projected the Royal Literary and Scientific Institution. He also took part in the establishment at Brighton of the Brighton Mechanics' Institution. He was secretary from 1841 to 1857, and afterwards treasurer. He projected the fountain on the Steine in 1846, raised the money for its erection, and then laid out and planted the enclosures near it entirely at his own expense. His attention was next directed to the sanitary condition of the town, and under his advice the Health of Towns Act was adopted. He came still more prominently forward in 1849 as one of the town committee who purchased the Royal Pavilion from the Commissioners of Woods and Forests for the sum of £53,000. On the charter for Brighton being obtained in 1854 he was returned at the head of the poll for the Pavilion ward. In 1857 he was elected mayor, and he continued in that office during the following year. The high esteem in which he was held by the inhabitants of Brighton was evinced on 13 October 1871 by the presentation of a costly testimonial consisting of a handsome carriage and a pair of horses, and other gifts. In consequence of a petition to the crown, asking that his great services to Brighton might receive public recognition, he was knighted by the queen at Osborne on 5 February 1873. He was a fellow of the Linnean, Zoological, Geographical, and other learned societies, brigade surgeon of the Brighton artillery corps, and chairman of the lifeboat committee. He was one of the two promoters of the Extramural Cemetery, and at great expense to himself obtained the order for discontinuing sepultures in the churches, chapels, and graveyards of the town. His aversions were street organ-players and itinerant hawkers, none of whom were allowed to exercise their callings in the borough in the period during which his will was law. He died at 62 Old Steine, Brighton, on 25 March 1876. His interment took place at the Extramural Cemetery on 1 April. His statue, erected in the grounds of the Royal Pavilion, was unveiled on 14 February 1878; it was moved to the south end of Old Steine in 1984, and was listed at Grade II on 26 August 1999. He married, 19 October 1842, Jane, daughter of Arthur Dendy of Dorking; she died in 1877, leaving one son, William Seymour Burrows, who succeeded to his father's practice. Sir John's elder brother was Robert Burrows, born 1810, known as an Ipswich artist and photographer.

It was created when the Newport Branch Canal joined the Shrewsbury Canal in 1835, and was closed along with the canal in 1944. History The Shrewsbury Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1793, and was to run from the town of Shrewsbury to the Wombridge Canal, most of which was bought by the new canal company, to secure a link to the Donnington Wood Canal and the supplies of coal which were available there. The canal was level from Shrewsbury to Eyton, a little to the west of Wappenshall, where there were two locks. To the south-east of Wappenshall, it ascended through nine locks and then up an inclined plane at Trench, to reach the Wombridge Canal which was above the level of the canal at that point. It was opened in February 1797, as was suitable for tub-boats, which were wide, and nearly all the traffic through Wappenshall was coal towards Shrewsbury, with empty boats passing in the reverse direction. The canal, which was part of the East Shropshire network, remained isolated from the rest of the British canal system. In 1825, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was authorised, to run from the Ellesmere and Chester Canal at Nantwich to Autherley Junction near Wolverhampton on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Two years later, that canal company approached the Shrewsbury Canal about a possible link between Norbury and Wappenshall. However, they experienced severe engineering difficulties in building their main line, and no further action was taken until 1831, when Henry Williams, who was superintendent and engineer for the Shrewsbury Canal and also worked for the on the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction company, costed a project to make the Shrewsbury Canal suitable for standard narrow boats. In the event, only the two locks to the west of Wappenshall were widened, and specially-built boats were used on the Trench branch, which could negotiate the narrower locks. The new canal to Wappenshall Junction opened in 1835. The Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal became part of the Shropshire Union Canal in 1846, having amalgamated with the Ellesmere and Chester Canal the previous year. The Shropshire Union company bought up most of the East Shropshire network soon afterwards, and ran it profitably until the early twentieth century. However, decline set in after the First World War, and the Trench incline was closed in 1921, followed by Shrewsbury Basin in 1922. The canal, along with Wappenshall junction, was closed in 1944 under an Act of Parliament obtained by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, who owned it by then. Restoration Remains of the guillotine gate at Wappenshall Lock in 1964. The bottom gates were of the guillotine type and the remains of one set of the gear for these gates can be seen. Today the junction still has a warehouse over part of the canal, a roving bridge, and has been the subject of work by the Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust. In 2007, the canalside buildings at Wappenshall, including a trans-shipment warehouse which has been little altered since it ceased to be used in the 1930s, and retains many original features, were put up for sale. They were eventually purchased, along with a length of the canal and the Wappenshall basin, by Telford and Wrekin Council,Shropshire Star, (17 June 2008), \\"Victory in sight for canal scheme\\", accessed 24 December 2008 who are working with the Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust to allow repairs to the buildings to be undertaken, with the aim of providing a museum and heritage centre for the canal, a cafe, and offices for the Canals Trust.Shrewsbury and Newport Canals Trust: News: Latest News on Wappenshall, accessed 25 December 2008 The link from Newport to Wappenshalll was crossed by a towpath bridge immediately before the junction. This is still in situ, and is a grade II listed structure. Nearby is a three-storey dock warehouse, which straddles a section of the canal. The first floor includes trap doors, which allowed goods to be hoisted up from the canal boats into the warehouse. It is also listed, and was built by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Earl of Sutherland, rather than the canal company, as was the basin. The Sutherland Estate also built a fine office for the canal toll clerk. It is a two-storey building, constructed of red bricks, with a central half-octagonal bay containing three sets of windows. A small community developed around the junction, as several cottages and the Sutherland Arms public house were built close by. The building is now called Bridge House, and it was rented to John Tranier when it was first opened. On the route to Shrewsbury, the canal was crossed by a lift bridge, to the west of the junction. The Trench Branch, which heads south- east, passes under a minor road at Wappenshall Bridge, and Wappenshall Lock, the first of the nine to Trench, was just after it.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1902 Although much of the basin has been filled in, there is still some water in the canal through the basin, as the Hurley Brook, which formerly ran to the south of the canal, has been diverted into it just below Britton Lock, the second on the Trench Branch, and leaves it again below Eyton Lock, the first on the route to Shrewsbury.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 2011 See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system Bibliography  * =References= Category:Canal junctions in England Category:Canals in Shropshire Category:Canals opened in 1835 Category:Shropshire Union Canal ","title":"Wappenshall Junction"},{"id":"13910710","text":"Aco Petrović is the name of: * Aco Petrović (basketball) (1959–2014), Serbian basketball coach * Aleksandar Petrović (basketball) (born 1959), Croatian basketball coach and former basketball player ","title":"Aco Petrović"},{"id":"13910730","text":"Ann Moura (born August 20 1947) is an author of books about magic, religion and Neo-Paganism. She calls her witchcraft tradition Green Witchcraft, and has written several books about it. Her public Craft name is Aoumiel. Ann Moura has been a solitary practitioner of Green Witchcraft for over forty-five years. According to Moura, her mother and grandmother practiced witchcraft, which makes her a hereditary witch. Her mother and grandmother were Brazilians of Spanish descent, and Ann Moura considers their tradition Celtic-Iberian. Unlike them, Moura doesn't include names of Christian saints to her witchcraft practice. Instead, she uses names of Pagan deities because she believes that the family's witchcraft tradition was originally Pagan. The death of Moura's mother prompted her to write about Green Witchcraft. She wanted to pass along the things she had learned from her mother and grandmother. Her mother and grandmother passed down information as matters came up rather than as a complete, formal education. Moura was worried that the knowledge moving from one generation to the next was getting slimmer. Green Witchcraft as presented by Moura also contains information discovered by Moura herself. Moura holds both Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in history. She is a certified Archivist, and has been a Navy Lieutenant and a high school history teacher.

Bree seizes the invitation to a bris to ask the mohel to perform the circumcision. She has to pretend to be Jewish so that the mohel will perform the circumcision. The mohel tells her that they are entering a covenant and she vows to raise the baby as a Jew. Orson is angry when he finds out she went behind his back and she admits that since Benjamin is related to her by blood, she felt her wishes were more important. He wants to know if she considers him to be the baby’s father since he does not just want to be a glorified babysitter. Dylan uses a school assignment on genealogy to probe for more information on her father. Katherine refuses to help at first. She finally brings her a piece of paper and says it contains all the information she needs to find her father, as long as Dylan swears to never reveal where Katherine is, since the night he left, he had vowed to kill her for taking his daughter away. She tearfully tells how her husband beat her and she was certain she was going to die. Dylan hands back the piece of paper and says she will ask her teacher for a different assignment. Katherine smiles in triumph as she unfolds the paper and the viewer sees that it is completely blank. Victor tells Gabrielle that he has cleared his schedule for a month so that they can take a real honeymoon. First, they are going to start with a boat trip. He makes her promise not to tell any of her friends about it. She is surprised that he has even dismissed the crew and that it will be just the two of them at sea. Carlos goes to collect a painting he left at Edie’s and she gleefully informs him that she showed Victor an incriminating photo of him and Gabrielle. Carlos immediately calls Gabrielle who now sees the romantic boat trip in a sinister new light. Victor tells Gaby he knows about the affair and tells her he “has something for her”. As he is reaching into a duffel bag. Gabrielle assumes he has got a gun and knocks him overboard with an oar. She motors the boat back to the marina, where Carlos is waiting for her. He suggests they call the police to look for Victor, since it was self-defense, but when they look in the bag there is no gun, only a sweater Victor was going to give Gabrielle because she was cold. They decide they are going to have to retrieve Victor themselves and, luckily, find him and bring him back on board. He and Carlos start to fight and Gaby, fearing for Carlos’s safety, knocks Victor overboard again. Only this time, they cannot find him. They look for six hours, but finally assumed Victor must be dead. They return to the marina and realize that since no one knew that Gabrielle was with him, if they send the boat back out on its own, it will just look like an accident or suicide, since Gabrielle will say that Victor was despondent over her leaving him. When Susan and Mike are over at Bree’s for dinner, Bree finds Mike taking some pills in her kitchen. He tells her it is just aspirin for residual pain from his car accident but she examines a pill he has left behind and determines that it is a highly addictive narcotic. She tells Susan, who is reluctant to believe that Mike is lying to her and is reassured when he says it was the last few pills from an old prescription. But Bree convinces her that addicts are cunning and resourceful liars, so Susan looks through Mike’s things and finds a bag full of pills hidden in a flashlight. When she confronts him, he says he has been taking them since hurting himself on the job. He did not think he could take time off, not with all the talk of expenses for the baby. He wants his son to have all the advantages he never had, and not to have to be a plumber. Susan says all he needs is a father who is not addicted to drugs. To reassure her of his sincerity to quit, he empties the bag of pills into the kitchen sink. But later that night, he opens up the drain to get the pills back.

Particular attention has been given to endemic problems that led to the demise of steam power in small- to medium-scale commercial applications: excessive pollution, maintenance costs, labour-intensive operation, low power/weight ratio, and low overall thermal efficiency; where steam power has generally now been superseded by the internal combustion engine or by electrical power drawn from an electrical grid. The only steam installations that are in widespread use are the highly efficient thermal power plants used for generating electricity on a large scale. In contrast, the proposed steam engines may be for stationary, road, rail or marine use.  Improving steam traction  Although most references to \\"Modern Steam\\" apply to developments since the 1970s, certain aspects of advanced steam technology can be discerned throughout the 20th century, notably automatic boiler control along with rapid startup. =Abner Doble= In 1922 Abner Doble developed an electro-mechanical system that reacted simultaneously to steam temperature and pressure, starting and stopping the feed pumps whilst igniting and cutting out the burner according to boiler pressure. The contraflow monotube boiler had a working pressure of to but contained so little water in circulation as to present no risk of explosion. This type of boiler was continuously developed in the US, Britain and Germany throughout the 1930s and into the 1950s for use in cars, buses, trucks, railcars, shunting locomotives (US; switchers), a speedboat and in 1933, a converted Travel Air 2000 biplane. detailed article with drawings =Sentinel= In the UK, Sentinel Waggon Works developed a vertical water- tube boiler running at which was used in road vehicles, shunting locomotives and railcars. Steam could be raised much more quickly than with a conventional locomotive boiler. =Holcroft and Anderson= Trials of the Anderson condensing system on the Southern Railway (Great Britain) took place between 1930 and 1935. Condensing apparatus has not been widely used on steam locomotives, because of the additional complexity and weight, but it offers four potential advantages: * Improved thermal efficiency * Reduced water consumption * Reduced boiler maintenance for limescale removal * Reduced noise The Anderson condensing system uses a process known as mechanical vapor recompression. It was devised by a Glasgow marine engineer, Harry Percival Harvey Anderson. The theory was that, by removing around 600 of the 970 British thermal units present in each pound of steam (1400 of the 2260 kilojoules in each kilogram), it would be possible to return the exhaust steam to the boiler by a pump which would consume only 1-2% of the engine's power output. Between 1925 and 1927 Anderson, and another Glasgow engineer John McCullum (some sources give McCallum), conducted experiments on a stationary steam plant with encouraging results. A company, Steam Heat Conservation (SHC), was formed and a demonstration of Anderson's system was arranged at Surbiton Electricity Generating Station. SHC was interested in applying the system to a railway locomotive and contacted Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway. Maunsell requested that a controlled test be carried out at Surbiton and this was done about 1929. Maunsell's technical assistant, Harold Holcroft, was present and a fuel saving of 29% was recorded, compared to conventional atmospheric working. The Southern Railway converted SECR N class locomotive number A816 (later 1816 and 31816) to the Anderson system in 1930. The locomotive underwent trials and initial results were encouraging. After an uphill trial from Eastleigh to Litchfield Summit, Holcroft is reported as saying: > \\"In the ordinary way this would have created much noise and clouds of steam, > but with the condensing set in action it was all absorbed with the ease with > which snow would melt in a furnace! The engine was as silent as an electric > locomotive and the only faint noises were due to slight pounding of the rods > and a small blow at a piston gland. This had to be experienced to be > believed; but for the regulator being wide open and the reverser well over, > one would have imagined that the second engine (an LSWR T14 class that had > been provided as a back-up) was propelling the first\\". The trials continued until 1934 but various problems arose and the project went no further. The locomotive was converted back to standard form in 1935. =André Chapelon= The work of French mechanical engineer André Chapelon in applying scientific analysis and a strive for thermal efficiency was an early example of advanced steam technology. Chapelon's protégé Livio Dante Porta continued Chapelon's work. =Livio Dante Porta= Postwar in the late 1940s and 1950s some designers worked on modernising steam locomotives. The Argentinian engineer Livio Dante Porta in the development of Stephensonian railway locomotives incorporating advanced steam technology was a precursor of the 'Modern Steam' movement from 1948. Where possible, Porta much preferred to design new locomotives, but more often in practice he was forced to radically update old ones to incorporate the new technology. =Bulleid and Riddles= In Britain the SR Leader class of c. 1949 by Oliver Bulleid and the British Rail ‘Standard’ class steam locomotives of the 1950s by Robert Riddles, particularly the BR Standard Class 9F, were used to trial new steam locomotive design features, including the Franco-Crosti boiler. On moving to Ireland, Bulleid also designed CIÉ No. CC1 which had many novel features. Achieving the ends The Sir Biscoe Tritton Lecture, given by Roger Waller, of the DLM company to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 2003 gives an idea of how problems in steam power are being addressed. Waller refers mainly to some rack and pinion mountain railway locomotives that were newly built from 1992 to 1998. They were developed for three companies in Switzerland and Austria and continued to work on two of these lines . The new steam locomotives burn the same grade of light oil as their diesel counterparts, and all demonstrate the same advantages of ready availability and reduced labour cost; at the same time, they have been shown to greatly reduce air and ground pollution. Their economic superiority has meant that they have largely replaced the diesel locomotives and railcars previously operating the line; additionally, steam locomotives are a tourist attraction. A parallel line of development was the return to steam power of the old Lake Geneva paddle steamer Montreux that had been refitted with a diesel-electric engine in the 1960s. Economic aims similar to those achieved with the rack locomotives were pursued through automatic control of the light-oil-fired boiler and remote control of the engine from the bridge, enabling the steamship to be operated by a crew of the same size as a motor ship. =Carbon neutrality= A power unit based on advanced steam technology burning fossil fuel will inevitably emit carbon dioxide, a long-lasting greenhouse gas. However, significant reductions, compared to other combustion technologies, of other pollutants such as CO and NOx are achievable by steam technology, which does not involve explosive combustion, without the need for add-ons such as filters etc. or special preparation of fuel. If renewable fuel such as wood or other biofuel is used then the system could be carbon neutral. The use of biofuel remains controversial; however, liquid biofuels are easier to manufacture for steam plant than for diesels as they do not demand the stringent fuel standards required to protect diesel injectors. It has been proposed that, given sufficient solar energy, silicon compounds — or even regular biomass processed into solid fuel through torrefaction — might be refined for use as a coal replacement for this type of engine. =Advantages of advanced steam technology= In principle, combustion and power delivery of steam plant can be considered as separate stages. While high overall thermal efficiency may be difficult to achieve, largely due to the extra stage of generating a working fluid between combustion and power delivery attributable mainly to leakages and heat losses, the separation of the processes allows specific problems to be addressed at each stage without revising the whole system every time. For instance, the boiler or steam generator can be adapted to use any heat source, whether obtained from solid, liquid or gaseous fuel, and can use waste heat. Whatever the choice, it will have no direct effect on the design of the engine unit, as that only ever has to deal with steam. Early twenty-first century =Small-scale stationary plant= This project mainly includes combined electrical generation and heating systems for private homes and small villages burning wood or bamboo chips. This is intended to replace 2-stroke donkey engines and small diesel power plants. Drastic reduction in noise level is one immediate benefit of a steam-powered small plant. Ted Pritchard, of Melbourne, Australia, was intensively developing this type of unit from 2002 until his death in 2007. The company Pritchard Power (now Uniflow Power) stated in 2010 that they continue to develop the stationary S5000, and that a prototype had been built and was being tested, and designs were being refined for market ready products. Until 2006 a German company called Enginion was actively developing a Steamcell, a micro CHP unit about the size of a PC tower for domestic use. It seems that by 2008 it had merged with Berlin company AMOVIS. Since 2012, a French company, EXOES, is selling to industrial firms a Rankine Cycle, patented, engine, which is designed to work with many fuels such as concentrated solar power, biomass, or fossil. The system, called \\"SHAPE\\" for Sustainable Heat And Power Engine, converts the heat into electricity. The SHAPE engine is suitable for embedded, and stationary, applications. A SHAPE engine has been integrated into a biomass boiler, and into a Concentrated solar power system. The company is planning to work with automobile manufactures, long-haul truck manufactures, and railway corporations. A similar unit is marketed by Powertherm, a subsidiary of Spilling (see below). A company in India manufactures steam-powered generators in a range of sizes from 4 hp to 50 hp. They also offer a number of different mills that can be powered by their engines. In matter of technology, notice that the Quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas, while exhausting in cold areas. =Small ship auxiliaries and large portable generators= Once again quiet operation is the immediate benefit sought in this field, a potential recognised by Ted Pritchard, but nothing of note has yet appeared. =Small fixed stationary plant= The Spilling company produces a variety of small fixed stationary plant adapted to biomass combustion or power derived from waste heat or pressure recovery. The Finnish company Steammotor Finland has developed a small rotary steam engine that runs with 800 kW steam generator. The engines are planned to produce electricity in wood chip fired power plants. According to the company, the steam engine named Quadrum generates 27% efficiency and runs with 180 °C steam at 8 bar pressure, while a corresponding steam turbine produces just 15% efficiency, requires steam temperature of 240 °C and pressure of 40 bar. The high efficiency comes from a patented crank mechanism, that gives a smooth, pulseless torque. The company believes that by further developing the construction there is potential to reach as high efficiency as 30–35 %. =Automotive uses= During the first 1970s oil crisis, a number of investigations into steam technology were initiated by large automobile corporations although as the crisis died down, impetus was soon lost. Australian engineer Ted Pritchard's main field of research from the late 1950s until the 1970s was the building of several efficient steam power units working on the uniflow system adapted to a small truck and two cars. One of the cars was achieving the lowest emissions figures of that time. IAV, a Berlin-based R&D; company that later developed the Steamcell, during the 1990s was working on the single-cylinder ZEE (Zero Emissions Engine), followed by the compact 3-cylinder EZEE (Equal-to-Zero- Emissions-Engine) designed to fit in the engine compartment of a Škoda Fabia small family saloon. All these engines made heavy use of flameless ceramic heat cells both for the steam generator and at strategic boost points where steam was injected into the cylinder(s). Cyclone Power Technologies of Pompano Beach, Florida, patented the Cyclone Mark V Engine, a compact, six cylinder radial steam engine with integrated steam generator and condenser. The engine is predicted to produce 100 hp at 3600 rpm, although as of January 2, 2015, Cyclone Power Technologies has yet to deliver a working engine to a customer or provide a public demonstration of their engine working. The engine has been promoted for use in racing cars to set a land speed record for steam-powered vehicles and an all-fuel engine for powering forklift trucks. =Rail use= * No. 52 8055, a rebuild of an existing locomotive (East Germany, 1960). * The 5AT project, a proposal for an entirely new locomotive (Britain, 2000s). * The ACE 3000 project, proposed by locomotive enthusiast Ross Rowland during the 1970s oil crisis. The locomotive would look like a diesel, and was designed to compete with current diesel locomotives by using coal, much cheaper than oil at the time. The ACE 3000 would feature many new technologies, such as automatic firing and water-level control. The locomotive would be able to be connected to a diesel unit and run in unison with it, so that it would not be necessary to hook up two identical locomotives. The ACE 3000 was one of the most publicised attempts at modern steam, but the project ultimately failed due to lack of funds. * The CSR Project 130, intends to develop a modern steam locomotive (based on an existing ATSF 3460 class locomotive) capable of higher-speed passenger transport at more than 100 mph, and tested up to 130 mph (hence the name Project 130). It is proposed to be carbon-neutral, as it will run on torrefied biomass as solid fuel (unlike all other contemporary designs, which mandate liquid fuel). The development is a joint effort between University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment (IonE) and Sustainable Rail International, a non-profit employing railway experts and steam engineers established for the purpose. Novel versus conventional layout Both 52 8055 and the proposed 5AT are of conventional layout, with the cab at the back, while the ACE 3000 had the cab located at the front. Other approaches are possible, especially with liquid fuel firing. For example: * Cab forward type. This is a well-tried design with the potential for a large power output and would provide the driver good visibility. Being single-ended it would have to be turned on a turntable, or a triangular junction. Example: Southern Pacific 4294. * Garratt type. Another well-tried design with large power potential. Example: South Australian Railways 400 class. A future design could include shorter water tanks, and a cab at each end, to give the driver a good view in either direction. Sentinel-Cammell locomotive * A design mounted on power bogies with compact water-tube boiler similar to Sentinel designs of the 1930s. Example: Sentinel-Cammell locomotive (right). Fireless locomotives Another proposal for advanced steam technology is to revive the fireless locomotive, which runs on stored steam independently pre- generated. An example is the Solar Steam Train project in Sacramento, California.

History The Shrewsbury Canal connected Shrewsbury to the Wombridge Canal, and provided a way to supply the people of Shrewsbury with coal at reasonable prices. The route between Shrewsbury and Wappenshall was relatively flat, although beyond Wappenshall, nine locks and a large inclined plane were needed to reach the Wombridge Canal. There were two more locks before Wappenshall. The valleys of the River Tern and the River Roden were crossed by aqueducts, Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct being, in Thomas Telford's opinion, the first aqueduct made of cast iron, although Benjamin Outram's iron aqueduct on the Derby Canal actually opened a month earlier. The other major obstacle to a level canal was a bluff of land near a large bend in the River Severn just to the east of Shrewsbury. A route closer to the river might have been possible and would have avoided a tunnelOrdnance Survey, 1:50,000 map if a large landscaped park had not been created there in 1786, to the design of Humphry Repton. Josiah Clowes was the engineer for the canal from the start of its construction until his death in 1795, and the tunnel was his design. However, William Reynolds, the iron founder responsible for the manufacture of the iron aqueduct, suggested that a towpath should be provided throughout its length. The tunnel was around wide, and the wooden towpath was fixed to bearers built into the wall. It was wide, but because the entire width of the tunnel was filled with water, including the bit below the towpath, the resistance to boats passing through the tunnel was reduced. The structure was long, and was the first tunnel to be constructed with a towpath. Tunnels without a towpath were arduous for the crews, as the boats had to be legged through them. The tunnel runs in a south-easterly direction away from Shrewsbury, and passes under fields and a wood. The ground above it is fairly shallow, and there is a ventilation shaft near the middle. Most of the tunnel is lined with bricks, but both portals are faced with stone, and the south- east portal carries the date 1797 on the keystone. The towpath lasted until 1819, when it was removed. Because the tunnel was not straight, it was not possible to see if someone had entered the tunnel from the other end. To overcome this, a byelaw was introduced which stated that whoever reached the centre first should continue, whilst the other boat would have to turn back. Today the canal is disused, and the tunnel remains, though the ends have been bricked up.

The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. History The nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership grew out of the U.S. government's Vital Voices Democracy Initiative. The Vital Voices Democracy Initiative was established in 1997 by First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, following the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing to promote the advancement of women as a U.S. foreign policy goal. The first Vital Voices Democracy Initiative conference was held in 1997 in Vienna, and hosted by U.S. Ambassador to Austria Swanee Hunt. The Vital Voices Democracy Initiative led to the creation of Vital Voices Global Partnership as a nonprofit non- governmental organization (NGO) in March 1999. Former Hillary Clinton aide and chief of staff Melanne Verveer is co-founder of the global partnership and its board chair emeritus. Other co-founders were Alyse Nelson (current President of Vital Voices Global Partnership), Donna McLarty, Mary Yerrick, and Theresa Loar. Loar was the founding President of the Vital Voices Global Partnership and also served as Director of the Vital Voices Democracy Initiative at the U.S. Department of State, the Senior Coordinator for International Women's' Issues at the U.S. Department of State and Director of the President's Interagency Council on Women.

Somerset Maugham's 1915 novel, this Warner Bros. sanitized version was written by Catherine Turney. The central characters are Philip Carey, a clubfooted medical student, and Mildred Rogers, a low-class waitress with whom he becomes obsessed. This is the second film version of Somerset Maugham's classic novel. The first was the 1934 film adaptation, starring Leslie Howard, and the third was the 1964 film adaptation, starring Laurence Harvey. Plot Philip (Paul Henreid), an impoverished, clubfooted, failed artist, is attending medical school in London, using a trust set up for him by a wealthy uncle for tuition. When he initially meets Mildred (Eleanor Parker), she pays scant attention to him and he finds her common and crass, but his wounded pride spurs him to return to the restaurant where she works, hoping to spark her interest. He invites her to accompany him to the theatre and, because she has nothing else to do, Mildred accepts. Philip spends what little money he has on her before she breaks a date with him and an ugly argument ensues. When he discovers she apparently has run off to marry one of her regular customers, Miller (Richard Aherne), he initially is happy to be free from his emotional bondage to her. Philip resumes a relationship with Norah Nesbitt (Alexis Smith), an author he had met in France, but it soon becomes obvious to her that her love for him is returned only as friendship. A pregnant Mildred, abandoned by the married Miller, returns seeking Philip's help, and he takes her away to Brighton, willing to marry her and adopt the child. He introduces her to his handsome and personable friend Harry Griffiths (Patric Knowles), who entrances Mildred and steals her away from him. Philip strikes up a friendship with Athelny (Edmund Gwenn), one of his patients, and quickly becomes a regular at the man's family Sunday dinners. He attracts the attention of Athelny's oldest daughter Sally (Janis Paige), but when he sees the homeless Mildred in the street, he offers her and her baby a place to stay. The relationship is platonic, and Mildred becomes increasingly enraged by Philip's apparent lack of interest in her. When he spurns her physical advances, she chases him out of his home and then burns his money and trashes his apartment. Philip catches pneumonia and is nursed back to health by Griffiths, who eventually takes him to the hospital charity ward where Mildred is dying. With the burden of his obsession lifted by her death, Philip returns to Sally.

Warner to release her to RKO to make the movie. In 1944, hoping he could do for another of his contract players what the first film had done for Davis, Warner decided to give the part of Mildred to Eleanor Parker, at the time better known for sweet young lady roles. Director Goulding, unconvinced she could handle it, tested Parker twice before he decided she could pull it off. To prepare, Parker studied the Cockney dialect with character actress Doris Lloyd, who had a small supporting role in the film. She perfected it so well British extras thought she was one of them. To explain the non-English accent of Philip Carey, portrayed by Paul Henreid, reference was made to his Austrian mother. Henreid was actually too old for the role and was fitted with a blond wig to disguise his age. Henreid wrote in his memoirs that he felt the original script \\"was very well written\\" but that Goulding rewrote it throughout the shoot. He did not get along with Goulding, disagreeing as to how scenes should be played and taking too many long takes. The film was completed in 1944 but, following a disastrous preview screening, was shelved for two years. After edits that lost Parker some of her best moments (a death scene showing her ravaged by illness was considered too grim for audiences and cut) and severely reduced Alexis Smith's performance from a lead to a supporting character, it was released to mostly poor reviews and largely ignored by the moviegoing public.Of Human Bondage at Turner Classic Movies Henreid said after the preview that he suggested via his agent Lew Wasserman that producer Blanke re do the print and use pick ups to help re cut the film. He says that as a result \\"we ended up with a good film.\\" Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther described the remake as \\"a pale and pedestrian repeat ... so manufactured and dramatically inert that even those who did not see the original will likely find it disappointingly dull ... the role of Philip Carey is performed by Paul Henreid in a highly self-conscious and completely unconvincing style ... a girl named Eleanor Parker wiggles and whines so elaborately in the role of the licentious waitress that her manner seems almost in jest ... Edmund Goulding, the director, must share a part of the blame for the stuffed and mechanical performance of these two characters ... although the screen-writer, Catherine Turney, didn't help matters any here ... Of Human Bondage, in this version, is pretty much of a thorough-going bore.\\"New York Times review Variety said the film \\"has been given excellent period mounting to fit early London background, is well-played and directed in individual sequences, but lacks overall smoothness ... Edmund Goulding's direction gets good work out of the cast generally, and helps interest, although most of major characters carry little sympathy.\\"Variety review TV Guide says, \\"Henreid and Parker do admirable jobs, though they certainly don't match Leslie Howard or Bette Davis ... Though by no means a great picture ...

The term \\"ladder\\" is used because as your taxable income increases, you \\"climb\\" the ladder and your tax rate increases. The formula begins with the taxpayer's gross income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code § 61(a). From gross income, the taxpayer may subtract the amount of any deductions listed in § 62(a) (\\"above the line deductions\\") to arrive at an adjusted gross income. The taxpayer then subtracts the appropriate amount for personal exemptions under § 151(d)(1) (as adjusted annually for inflation under § 151(d)(4)). Finally, the taxpayer subtracts either the appropriate standard deduction under § 63(c) or the total of itemized deductions under § 63(d) to arrive at the taxpayer's taxable income for that tax year. Taxable income serves as the base against which the taxpayer's tax rate is applied. After multiplying taxable income by the tax rate, the taxpayer may subtract the amount of any credits, then must add any additions to tax (such as the Alternative Minimum Tax). This calculation results in the taxpayer's tax liability, which is the actual amount the taxpayer owes for that tax year.

This idea has no foundation in modern history, linguistics, or genetics. British Israelism The idea can be traced to Edward Hine, an early proponent of British Israelism, deriving the Anglo-Saxons from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. The link between British Israelism, Assyrian, and Germanic ties is in a hypothetical sense by British Novelist Edward Hine comparing ancient Assyria and neighboring Israel to 20th century Britain and Germany. John Wilson, the intellectual founder of British Israelism, had considered that not only the people of Great Britain, but all the Germanic peoples were descended from the Ten Lost Tribes. Hine took a more particularist view, deciding that only the British nation fulfilled the prophecy for Israel — he acknowledged an ethnic affiliation between Britons and Germans, but thought this reflected what he considered was a close relationship between the ancient Israelites and their neighbors the Assyrians (who had taken the Ten Lost Tribes into captivity in Assyria). Likewise, Britain and Germany's status as two great powers of the modern age he considered reflective of the ancient glories of the Kingdom of Israel and of Assyria. So there were two original competing views as to the relationship between the Germans and British-Israel; either the British people, alone, were identified with the Tribes of Israel (Edward Hine) or they included the Germans (John Wilson) and other European peoples (including the Dutch and Scandinavians).The Standard of Israel, 1876, Vol II, p. 100. Hine maintained that only the Ten Tribes of Israel were included within the British race and excluded the Continental Teutonic or German peoples, who he instead believed descended from Assyrians not Israelites.Life From The Dead, 1874, Vol. I, pp. 327–328 Hine believed all the tribes of Israel settled in Britain only, with Manasseh who became the Americans (who mostly descended from British stock). Hine had identified the Ten Tribes as being together in Britain in that Ephraim were the drunkards and ritualists, Reuben the farmers, Dan the mariners, Zebulan the lawyers and writers, Asher the soldiers etc., or that these tribes were regional or local people in Britain.Edward Hine, The English Nation Identified with the Lost House of Israel by Twenty-Seven Identifications, (Manchester: Heywood, 1870), p. v. Hine's particularist view was received with some hostility by other British Israelites, who maintained that other Europeans descended from the lost tribes of Israel, not solely Britain.The Standard of Israel, 1876, Vol.II, p. 101. Hine believed that all of the ancient peoples mentioned in the Bible must also be present in the modern world, in order for the prophecies concerning them to be fulfilled. If a people was \\"lost\\" to the ages, it meant simply that the people must have migrated to a new region, changed their ethnonym, and forgotten their history. Hine considered the Assyrians as such a \\"lost\\" people (unlike for example, the Egyptians), and he made no mention in his writings of the modern Assyrian community in the Middle East — a community that was largely unknown to Europe in his time. Although Assyria is portrayed as one of the great enemies of Israel in the Bible, Hine took pains to explain that he did not consider Germany to be an enemy of Britain, and his writings do not betray any anti- German feelings. In his Forty Seven Identifications, he did admit ‘The Germans are not our enemies, and there is evidence to show that they could not become our enemies’.Banner of Israel, 1917, p. 296 Later writers in his tradition, however, have often set Germany in the biblical role of Assyria as an enemy to Britain. British Israelism often compares the militarism of the German Empire with that of the Neo-Assyrian Empire as narrated in the Bible, by analogy establishing Britain, as the threatened party, with the Kingdom of Israel. After World War II, the comparison was also extended to the supposed brutality towards the Jewish population.Julia M. O'Brien, Nahum and Atrocity, Continuum International Publishing Group (2002), , p. 115, quoting Craigie (1958)... Revision of Assyrian extent of territory Adherents of the Assyria-Germany connection often revise the extent of land the Assyrians controlled (see Neo- Assyrian Empire). British Israelites, for example, who equate Assyria to Germany claim that the Neo-Assyrian Empire extended to the Black Sea region and further north. Mainstream historians, by contrast, believe land controlled by the Assyrians during the Neo-Assyrian Empire did not stretch that far, but only reached into southern, south western and north eastern Anatolia, bordering Armenia. There is no historical evidence that the Assyrians crossed the Caucasus into Europe in Assyrian records of the time, and the furthest extent of their conquests would have been the southern borders of the Caucasus and the south eastern edge of the Black sea.World History, Volume 1, William J. Duiker, Cengage Learning, 2009, p. 31 However, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, which took control over the Assyrians and Babylonians in the 6th century BC. did extend its territory to the Black Sea and north-west into Thrace. British Israelites, however, maintain that this extended territory already existed before the Persians, often quoting as evidence the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, which lists Assyria as having already extended to the Black Sea region. British Israelites also cite Pliny the Elder, who mentioned a tribe dwelling around the north-western regions of the Black Sea (Romania or Ukraine) in the 1st century AD called the Assyriani, who they believe were Assyrians. The Gesta Treverorum record a legend of one Prince Trebeta who allegedly colonized what is today Trier. Taking the legends of Trebeta as having founded Trier in Germany in 2053 BC (1300 years before the establishment of Rome in 753 BC) as literal fact, and revising the extent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire into south-western parts of Europe, British Israelites believe that the ancient Assyrians had a vast territory. To further corroborate this belief, British Israelites often quote from the Austrian Chronicle of 95 Seigneurs (see below). Jews deported by Assyrians to Germany British Israelites who adhere to the Assyria-German identification believe that a small portion of Jews were deported to Germany by the Assyrians. They cite II Kings 18: 13 which notes that the Assyrian king Sennacherib sacked several cities of Judah and captured several Jewish inhabitants. This deportation has been verified by archaeology, since an ancient Assyrian prism records Sennacherib deported a population of Judah (see Taylor and Sennacherib Prisms). This population of Judah was deported (with the House of Israel) to the Medes but British Israelites believe that the Jews and Israelites who were deported by the Assyrians to the Medes, did not stay there, but migrated over time into parts of Europe. The 14th-century Austrian Chronicle of 95 Seigneurs is usually cited by British Israelites, as it purports to trace an early Jewish settlement in Germany or Austria. The Chronicle connects the Dukes of Austria with the Jews rather than the Assyrians but states that Central Europe became to accept the Jewish faith or Jewish customs from 708–704 BC. British Israelites provide an answer for this: they believe since the Assyrians had long controlled parts of Europe (especially Germany) that the Germans or Austrians became to accept Jewish customs and faith in the 8th century BC because Sennacherib (who captured several cities in Judah) had deported its Jewish inhabitants into Eastern Europe along the Danube River, eventually reaching Austria and Germany. The Chronicle lists 'Jewish Kings' who began from 708–704 BC during which a duke called Gennan converted to Judaism. Consequently, this Jewish population intermarried with the local rulers in the regions of Austria and Hungary, the pagans were subdued and the whole country was Jewish until c. 227 CE. Often cited to support these theories, is the legend of Judaesaptan. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, this was a legendary Jewish kingdom, which several thousands of years ago sat in Austria or central Europe; it first appeared in writing in Gottfried Hagen's chronicle Reimchronik (1270). Wolfgang Lazius in the 16th century attempted to find the remains of the kingdom but was unsuccessful.H. Gold, Geschichte der Juden in Wien (1966). Anglo-Saxons not Germanic British Israelites who are proponents of Hine's German-Assyria connection do not believe that the Anglo-Saxons were Germanic, but instead of Scythian heritage, who ultimately descended from the ancient Israelites.Hine, Forty-seven Identifications, (1878), pp. 16–29. Hine pointed out that the Anglo-Saxons only spoke a Germanic language, and that the term 'German' was an exonym and that the Saxons were distinct to the other continental Germanic tribes.Hine, pp. 20–22.The term German, is an exonym of Deutsch and Deutschland (Germany). Hine believed that the Anglo-Saxons were only in Germany for a short time as part of their migration to the appointed 'Islands' (which he identified as Britain) as their final resting place, as told where the Israelites would be resettled in Isaiah 24: 15; 42: 4; 49: 1; 51: 5 and Jeremiah 31: 10.Hine, pp. 20The first-mentioned \\"Germans\\" were actually a Celtic tribe, which had formerly lived east of the Rhine River. The Encyclopædia Britannica says: \\"Of the Gaulish [Celtic] tribes west of the Rhine... the Treveri claimed to be of German origin, and the same claim was made by a number of tribes in Belgium.... The meaning of this claim is not quite clear, as there is some obscurity concerning the origin of the name Germani. It appears to be a Gaulish term, and there is no evidence that it was ever used by the Germans themselves. According to Tacitus it was first applied to the Tungri, whereas Caesar records that four Belgic tribes... were collectively known as Germani. Worldwide Church of God Herbert W. Armstrong in Chapter 5 of his Mystery of Ages (1985), \\"The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendents of the ancient Assyrians.\\" (p. 183). In this, Armstrong draws upon the opinions of Herman L. Hoeh, published in his 1963 Compendium of World History. Such suggestions are informed by Jerome's simile with Psalms 83:8.Hoeh, \\"Germany in Prophecy!\\" (1962). Also in Hoeh (1963) vol.2 ch.1.: \\"Jerome, who lived at the time when the Indo-Germanic tribes were invading Europe, provides this startling answer ... Yes! Jerome said so! But how did he know? He saw them! He was an eyewitness to their migrations from Mesopotamia and the shores of the Black and Caspian seas!\\" Hoeh (1963) draws on Verstegan (1605) and Johannes Turmair (1526) to conclude that Deutsch really derives from Tuisto whom he in turn identifies with Shem: :Tuitsch or Tuisto: Chief of thirty-two dukes. Noah gave him all the land between the Don River and the Rhine or what was called Grossgermania. This is the beginning of the 'neolithic' settlement of Europe. Tuitsch is, according to all ancient German commentaries and chronicles, a son of Noah. But which son? Noah adopted Tuitsch's children as his own. The ancient Germans understood the name Tuitsch to be the title 'Teacher.' He was therefore the great patriarch of his family who taught the divine will to his children. Tuitsch is the father of Mannus (who is the Assyrian Ninus). The son of Mannus, Trebeta, is the same man who is called the son of Ninus in classical writers. The son of Mannus or Ninus — Trebeta — built Trier, the first town of Germany. Since the Bible calls this Ninus (who built Nineveh), Asshur, Tuitsch is therefore Shem! (Hoeh 1963 vol. 2 ch. 2) Controversy As with Anglo-Israelism itself, proposed German-Assyrian connections enjoy no empirical support and are not current among mainstream historians, anthropologists, archaeologists or historical linguists.

Career Talman graduated with BA and MA degrees in Music Composition from the City College of New York. He later studied at Columbia University, where he began using computers for sound composition in 1984. He also taught and conducted orchestras at both schools. He has lived in New York City since 1976. Though trained as a composer of chamber and orchestral music, Talman switched modes of presentation after an extended stay in Europe. His repeated visits to the Cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague in 1996-97 provided important insight regarding architectural sound. Talman determined that the ambient sound of a space, the Room Tone, is sufficient to activate the resonance of the space, which provides unique sonic perceptual data of the site. After two years of experimentation with recordings of spatial sound, Talman’s installation “Vanishing Point 1.1” (1999) was presented at St. Paul’s Chapel at Columbia University. This work featured the site’s resonance, extracted from a recording of its ambient room tone, amplified, treated as a compositional element and returned to the space in multi-channel sound. Since then Talman has produced numerous works that feature this unique resonance-composition and feedback technique. The installations, at times, also incorporate resonant sculpture, video projection and other visual objects. Installation sites have included Cathedral Square (Domplatte) in Cologne, Germany, St. James Cathedral in Chicago, the Bavarian Forest, a wind turbine site in Åland, Finland, the MIT Media Lab, The Kitchen, Eyebeam, bitforms gallery in New York City and others.

Angus bulls are also used on Hereford heifers in an attempt to produce smaller calves and reduce dystocia. The term is particularly used in Australia and New Zealand. In North America, the term \\"Black Whiteface\\" is also used in some regions. It is characterized by a white face similar to the Hereford, but the red body color of the Hereford is replaced by black from the Angus. This is because both the alleles for white faces and black coat color are both genetically dominant in cattle. Black Baldy cows are noted for their good mothering abilities. In addition to general hybrid vigor expected with a crossbred, the cross also produces black skin, which in sunny climates reduces the prevalence of sunburn on bare skin, such as the udder of the cow. The prevalence of Black Baldies significantly increases wherever cattle breeders switch from the traditional Hereford herds to the Aberdeen Angus breed.

The Black Hereford is a crossbreed of beef cattle produced in the British Isles with Hereford beef bulls with Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. Black Herefords are not usually maintained from generation to generation, but are constantly produced as a byproduct of dairy farming as a terminal cross. They are one of the most common types of beef cattle in the British Isles, outnumbering many pure beef breeds. Appearance The Black Hereford has a white face like the Hereford, but the red body colour of the Hereford is replaced by black from the Holstein-Friesian - white face and black coat colour are both genetically dominant in cattle. The pied pattern of the Holstein-Friesian does not appear in the offspring. Origin Cattle only produce milk after calving, and so every dairy cow must produce a calf every year. In dairy herds (which in the British Isles are almost all Holstein-Friesians), the best milking cows will normally be bred to a dairy bull, usually by artificial insemination (AI). The female purebred dairy calves from these matings will go on to become replacement dairy cows. Half of the purebred calves will, of course, be male - these are mostly not needed for breeding, and are generally unsuitable for beef; they may be reared for veal or are killed and disposed of at a few days old, depending on economics. Purebred dairy calves are not needed from the rest of the herd, and a beef bull is run with the remaining females to produce crossbred calves suitable for beef - these females will be the poorer-quality cows, the heifers (first-time calvers), and any of the other cows which have not settled (become pregnant) successfully by a bull. The beef bull in this system may be of almost any beef breed, but the Hereford is one of the most widely used - one reason for its popularity is that the white face from the Hereford makes it very easy to avoid confusion between the crossbred and purebred calves at birth. Uses Black Herefords are intermediate in type between their beef sires and dairy dams, making them hardy and healthy, and suitable for rearing on grass. When well-grown, all the males and most of the females will normally be killed for beef. Females not needed for beef may be kept for breeding further beef animals - they are put to another beef bull and allowed to rear their own calves on grass as \\"single sucklers\\".

In 1958, the high school was refounded and moved into a new building, but then was added on to in 1970 to encompass the growing number of students being enrolled. In 2017, a Medical Lake High school student was investigated for a google drive filled with sexually explicit pictures of other students with the youngest victim being 14. In February of 2018, a threat was made against the school by a student and was investigated by the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office. A few months later in April of 2018, a Medical Lake student was killed while 3 other students were injured in a car crash when headed to a track meet. This started the #MedicalLakeStrong movement in Spokane, with schools such as Freeman High School (Washington) and Shadle Park High School offering their support and solidarity. That June, the district announced that they had received a one million dollar STEM grant and that the high school students would be receiving their own personal Chromebooks that September. Enrollment has declined within the Medical Lake School District and is expected to continue. A contributing factor has been the privatization of base housing at Fairchild Air Force Base; an increasing number of military families have chosen to live off-base and outside the M.L. school district. A building moratorium by the city of Medical Lake and a sluggish economy have also contributed. MLHS grew in the 1970s from 487 in 1970 to 650 in 1978, but declined in the early 1980s to below 500 in 1983 and athletics dropped from the 'AA' Frontier League and returned to the 'A' NEA in 1984. Enrollment was 675 in October 2007, but fell to 512 in four grades in May 2012. In 2019, the enrollment was 542.

It accomplishes this estimation by backing off through progressively shorter history models under certain conditions. By doing so, the model with the most reliable information about a given history is used to provide the better results. The model was introduced in 1987 by Slava M. Katz. Prior to that, n-gram language models were constructed by training individual models for different n-gram orders using maximum likelihood estimation and then interpolating them together.

Otherwise, the conditional probability is equal to the back-off conditional probability of the (n − 1)-gram. The more difficult part is determining the values for k, d and α. k is the least important of the parameters. It is usually chosen to be 0. However, empirical testing may find better values for k. d is typically the amount of discounting found by Good–Turing estimation. In other words, if Good–Turing estimates C as C^*, then d = \\\\frac{C^*}{C} To compute \\\\alpha, it is useful to first define a quantity β, which is the left-over probability mass for the (n − 1)-gram: :\\\\beta_{w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i -1}} = 1 - \\\\sum_{ \\\\\\\\{w_i : C(w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i}) > k \\\\\\\\} } d_{w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i}} \\\\frac{C(w_{i-n+1}\\\\cdots w_{i-1} w_{i})}{C(w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i-1})} Then the back-off weight, α, is computed as follows: :\\\\alpha_{w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i -1}} = \\\\frac{\\\\beta_{w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i -1}}} {\\\\sum_{ \\\\\\\\{ w_i : C(w_{i-n+1} \\\\cdots w_{i}) \\\\leq k \\\\\\\\} } P_{bo}(w_i \\\\mid w_{i-n+2} \\\\cdots w_{i-1})} The above formula only applies if there is data for the \\"(n − 1)-gram\\". If not, the algorithm skips n-1 entirely and uses the Katz estimate for n-2. (and so on until an n-gram with data is found) Discussion This model generally works well in practice, but fails in some circumstances. For example, suppose that the bigram \\"a b\\" and the unigram \\"c\\" are very common, but the trigram \\"a b c\\" is never seen. Since \\"a b\\" and \\"c\\" are very common, it may be significant (that is, not due to chance) that \\"a b c\\" is never seen. Perhaps it's not allowed by the rules of the grammar. Instead of assigning a more appropriate value of 0, the method will back off to the bigram and estimate P(c  b), which may be too high.Manning and Schütze, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, MIT Press (1999), .

Note that the drive wheels are connected via a low gear ratio to a flywheel (bottom). A friction motor is a simple mechanism to propel toy cars, trucks, trains, action figures and similar toys. The motor consists of a large flywheel which is connected to the drive wheels of the toy via a very low gear ratio, so that the flywheel revolves faster. The flywheel's axis is perpendicular to the direction in which the toy faces and moves. When the toy is pushed forward, the drive wheels engage the flywheel. Pushing the vehicle forward repeatedly spins this flywheel up to speed. When let go, the flywheel drives the vehicle forward. The flywheel stores the kinetic energy of the initial acceleration and propels the toy after it is released. As the flywheel, unlike the spring of a pullback motor, is continuously rotating and not held, the motor may be \\"pumped up\\" by pushing the car repeatedly forward. The cars also typically work in forward and reverse. Some used a zip cord pulled from the vehicle body to accelerate the flywheel directly. Another system was the Turbo Tower of Power (TTP) in which air expelled from a hand-operated pump pushed turbine blades on the flywheel's rim. These toys were especially popular in the 1960s to 1980s though they continue to be available today.

The vast majority of dishes that make up the Hmong cuisine are not actually unique to Hmong communities but rather blends of culinary dishes found in hosting states of Hmong migration. While remaining stateless after their expulsion by the Han clan of Ancient China, the Hmong have adopted staple dishes from various cuisines during their migration as their own, such as dishes of the Lao, Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese cuisines. Overview Hmong cuisine varies somewhat by region. A variety of large cucumber grown by the Hmong For example, in Hmong communities in the United States, a Hmong dish may be largely based on a dish of a larger Asian ethnicity that also resides in the local community, such as the Chinese, Vietnamese, or Thai. As many ethnic Hmong have passed through Thailand en route to their final destinations around the world and many still reside there, Thai cuisine is a particularly important part of Hmong cuisine. While the modification of ingredients in adopted dishes is generally minimal, preparation might be shortened as it would in a mountainous setting where many individuals in a given village need to be fed. In urban settings around the world where public eating establishments are common, most Hmong dishes resemble other available Asian dishes. One major difference is that the addition of extra condiments is encouraged. An example of this is the addition of large amounts of white sugar and soy sauce to pho, a hearty soup considered to be the national dish of Vietnam. As the Hmong language was not widely written until the 1950s, Hmong cuisine has been, until recently, passed on by elders of the community. Any actual Hmong dishes are purely of oral tradition and can vary from clan to clan or family to family. These differences are largely based on the country of residence and available resources. While Hmong restaurants are extremely rare in Asia, they have become more popular in the countries of Hmong diaspora. While such establishments are generally owned by members of the Hmong community, menu items are generally not identifiable as a part of a cuisine specific to the Hmong. However, it is common to find popular East and Southeast Asian dishes labeled as \\"Hmong\\" in such establishments. For example, \\"Hmong Chicken Wings\\" are commonly found on appetizer menus in Hmong restaurants. In this dish, the chicken is general marinaded in most of the spices used in other dishes preferred by the Hmong. In recent years, Hmong cuisine has enjoyed a rise in popularity in areas where truly authentic Asian restaurants are limited. This is largely a result of increased acceptance of the Hmong in their new communities. .  Ingredients  Hmong goat head soup or thắng cố served at the Bac Ha Sunday market in Vietnam The Hmong staple food is white rice, which is usually eaten with a variety of vegetables, hot pepper (often in the form of a Southeast Asian-inspired sauce) and boiled or fried meat if it is available. Sticky (glutinous) rice—either white or purple—is commonly served at gatherings and on other special occasions. Hmong cuisine is characterized by the use of a wide variety of spices and herbs found in the Vietnamese, Thai, and Laotian cuisines, including hot pepper (usually Thai), lemongrass, cilantro, garlic, green onions, mint, galangal, and ginger. Fish sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and hoisin sauce are also used prevalently. Egg rolls Traditional \\"Hmong\\" egg rolls can be culturally tied back to Vietnamese egg rolls during their migration across Asia. These fried and flour wrapped rolls can be found at family events and annual events such as the Hmong New Year. The Hmong community of Rhode Island holds an annual fundraiser by selling traditional Hmong egg rolls. Each family has their own recipe, but typically the rolls consist of eggs mixed with shredded carrots and cabbage, ground pork, onions, scallions, and cilantro. These are seasoned with oyster sauce, rolled in a paper-thin wheat shell, and deep fried.  Meals  Hmong people typically eat three meals a day and do not usually snack in between meals. Each meal includes white rice and usually vegetables and a smaller portion of meat. The meat and vegetables are usually stir fried, steamed or boiled. Hot pepper (kua txob) is usually served as a side at most meals, as it is in many other Asian cuisines. The types of food prepared for different mealtimes do not vary widely, although more preparation is typically put into breakfast and dinner. This is due to the common shortage of ingredients throughout the migrant past of the Hmong. This is something that has been accepted and embraced by the Hmong. Meals are eaten in a communal manner with food being placed in the center. For large cultural gatherings the men eat first, followed by the women and children. This is only true to those who still hold on to traditional Hmong customs.

Example If the issue is the defendant's mental state at the time of the offense, the ultimate issue would be the defendant's sanity or insanity during the commission of the crime. In the past, expert witnesses were allowed to give testimony on ultimate issues, such as the applicability of the insanity defense to a particular defendant. However, after the 1982 trial of John Hinckley, Jr., the federal rules of evidence were changed. Now in the United States, federal courts and some states have rules of evidence that specifically rule out legal conclusions drawn by expert witnesses in their testimony. However, a large amount of judicial discretion is allowed in how this rule is applied, resulting in an uneven application of rules across jurisdictions. Definition The Federal Rules do not say what falls within the definition of an \\"ultimate issue.\\" However, a long history of case law on the subject suggests that an expert witness runs afoul if he uses the same words (words with legal meaning) that will ultimately be presented to the jury. One court excluded a psychologist's evidence on the credibility of prosecution's witness on the grounds that it amounted to an \\"ultimate opinion\\", meaning this was an opinion that could only be properly reached by a jury. The expert witness testimony is confined to giving an opinion on whether the defendant had a serious mental disorder at the time of the offense, and explaining the symptoms and characteristics of any diagnosis given, including other testimony regarding the defendant's mental status (mens Rea) and motivation. The expert witness cannot make a statement addressing the issue of whether the legal test for insanity has been met. That is left to the judge and jury. The restriction of expert opinion on ultimate issues includes any testimony on the criminal elements, including testimony that would bear on the mental state of the defendant relevant to ultimate legal decisions to be decided by the triers of fact. History The Federal Rules of Evidence adopted in 1975 (and their state counterparts) expressly allowed expert testimony to include statements on ultimate issues if such statements will be helpful to the judge or jury. In 1984, Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) was added following the trial of John Hinckley, Jr. for the attempted assassination of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The changes were in part a result of the public backlash due to Hinckley's successful use of the insanity defense. These changes, in particular Rule 704(b), put limits on expert witness testimony. The new rules of evidence restrict the testimony allowed on the ultimate issue. Rule 704(b) states that the mental health expert may testify to the defendant's mental disorder or defect and its symptoms, but may not offer a conclusion on an ultimate issue such as the sanity or insanity of the defendant. The expert witness must refrain from merely giving the jury a conclusion that pertains to the legal issues at hand and cannot testify to legal conclusions (ultimate issues), the rationale being that mental health professional are not attorneys. Judicial discretion remains in determining the limits of testimony as well, such that any testimony that \\"wastes time' or is irrelevant can be barred. The rationale for this restriction was stated in the legislative history of the rule as the following: The result is that large gray areas remain regarding exactly what testimony is allowed. For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Rutland ruled that testimony from \\"an extraordinarily qualified handwriting expert\\" was admissible on the \\"ultimate issue of authorship of key documents\\". Jeffrey R. MacDonald trial An example of how this change in the rules of evidence can affect trial testimony is demonstrated in an analysis of the 1979 trial of Jeffrey R. MacDonald, a physician, for the murder of his wife and children, if his trial occurred today. In that trial, an expert testified in support of the defense hypothesis that someone else committed the murders. Expert testimony that the defendant had a \\"personality configuration inconsistent with the outrageous and senseless murders of [his] family\\" was not allowed under the rules of evidence in effect at the time because it was considered confusing and misleading. However, under Rule 704(b) this character testimony would not be barred since testimony regarding \\"personality configuration\\" is general psychological evidence unrelated to any ultimate issues such as intent or malice aforethought. Also, an expert witness would not be in violation of 704(b) in use today if he gave testimony regarding the defendant's positive behaviors, such as acting like a loving father and husband, which might create the impression that he was not capable of committing such a crime, but is an opinion unrelated to guilt. Conclusions Rules of evidence are meant to screen what evidence the jury may consider to prevent testimony that is mere opinion from infringing upon the territory of jury decision-making. Rule 704(b) reversed the trend toward permitting the testimony of experts on the ultimate issue. Since so much faith is placed in the jury system, limiting what a jury can consider narrows the jury's options. As in the past, lay witnesses may testify to facts only. The result of rule 704(b) is to prevent expert witnesses such as psychologists and psychiatrists from testimony regarding how the defendant's mental state affected an element of the crime or an element of the defense. It has been ruled that 704(b) bans expert opinions on mental states affecting other elements, not only on questions of insanity, but also on questions on all mental states forming an element of a crime or defense such as premeditation in a murder case or specific intent and mens rea. English law The position under English law is different from that in the United States as there is no rule preventing an expert from giving an opinion on the 'ultimate issue' in England and Wales. This has been confirmed by the English Courts in both criminalR v Atkins 2009 EWCA Crim 1876 and civilBarings PLC v Coopers & Lybrand 2001 EWHC Ch 17 cases.

Position The island is at the southernmost point of the River Thames. The garden-lined southern horseshoe curve of the island is mapped as Hamhaugh Point, and being its only tapered side becomes the narrowest width. Otherwise Hamhaugh is almost rectangular: long and wide. It is from the parish churches of Shepperton and Weybridge respectively, however Shepperton High Street is a further north of this whereas Weybridge High Street runs next to its parish church, which means the whole area is closer to Weybridge's urban resources. The town is accessible by boat or a journey using Walton Bridge of more than . The Shepperton Lock area of Old Shepperton has a family gastropub, two marine shops/chandler's shops and the lock's indoor and outdoor tea room. =Crossing the river= A ferry operates from Shepperton Lock's downstream side to the northern point of Weybridge and links the Thames Path National Trail. A fee of below £1 is payable. Land use The island, apart from landings (boats' hardstanding) and a patch of woodland with a path running through it along the north side, is residential, consisting of 46 houses and a communal green. Access is on foot or carried bicycle from Shepperton lock, across Lock Island and then across a weir. A second weir, without foot access, connects the island to the right bank: Hamm Point of the Hamm Court residential estate, Addlestone. History The island was created and soon thereafter slightly reduced to create a smaller island, Lock Island, to the north, which was also part of the mainland  this creation occurred after the fixing of most non- urban parish boundaries, pre-1700, and explains why given the wide channel dug to its north (almost equal width of the widest river course to all other sides), it stayed part of the parish of Shepperton. Before the later Thames locks including all those of the mid- to lower Thames (such as from Windsor down to Teddington) were built from 1805 onward, the river here saw flooding across what was a combined island, at various points such as the far north in times of very high tide, when combined with post-rainfall water volumes, this being similar to Penton Hook Island and Desborough Island which were also originally peninsulas. With the additional capacity and cuts along this stretch this acts to bypass the old river when necessary and makes navigation much shorter for river journeys.

Playing career Whitehouse was born in Smethwick, Staffordshire. He signed for Birmingham from Redditch in 1916, and scored 48 goals in 87 games for the club in three seasons of wartime competition. He was one of many local players given a first team opportunity during the First World War at a younger age than would have been the case if regular players had not been away on military service. He was a combative forward who scored goals for Birmingham at a rate of about one every three games, which helped them win the championship of the Second Division in 1920–21.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 134. He moved to Derby County in 1923, and formed a prolific partnership with Harry Storer and Randolph Galloway. He missed the last two games of the 1923–24 season with injury, otherwise he would have been ever-present, and Derby missed promotion to the First Division on goal average by one goal. When two years later Derby were promoted, Whitehouse was equally at home in the top flight, scoring 47 goals in less than three seasons. In a six-year career at Derby he made exactly 200 appearances, scoring 86 goals at a rate of nearly a goal every two games. In February 1929 he moved to Sheffield Wednesday. The club won two successive league championships in 1928–29 and 1929–30, but Whitehouse's contribution was small. He failed to settle, and played only ten games in all. He then spent three seasons with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, playing more than 100 times for the club in the Third Division South, went on to Folkestone Town and spent a further year as player-manager of Worcester City. He later scouted for Derby County. Whitehouse died in Halesowen, Worcestershire at the age of 50.

Once known as the \\"California Riviera\\", the Salton Sea is now called one of America's worst ecological disasters: a fetid, stagnant, salty lake, that coughs up dead fish and birds by the thousands in frequent die-offs that occur. However, among the ruins of this man-made mistake, a few remaining eccentrics (a roadside nudist, a religious folk artist, a Hungarian revolutionary, and real estate speculators) struggle to keep a remodeled version of the original Salton Sea dream alive. The film shares these people's stories and their difficulties in keeping their unique community alive, as the nearby cities of Los Angeles and San Diego attempt to take the agricultural water run-off that barely sustains the Salton Sea. The film ultimately explores the historical, economic, political, and environmental issues that face the Salton Sea, while taking a closer look at the people who have chosen to live in what they see as a surreal paradise. Release The film premiered at the 2004 Slamdance Film Festival. With the addition of John Waters as the film's narrator, the new version of the film premiered at the Provincetown International Film Festival, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, hosted by Mr. Waters himself. The film opened in select theaters on February 24, 2006 and continued to screen theatrically throughout the United States and Canada until late 2007. A shorter, more environmentally themed version of the film aired on the Sundance Channel's GREEN programming block, along with occasional broadcasts on the PBS TV station KQED documentary series Truly, CA. The DVD of Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea was released by the home video distributor, Docurama/New Video, on September 25, 2007. Critical reception The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes certified the film as \\"Fresh\\", reporting that 96% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 53 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 8 reviews. In screening at more than 200 festivals in twenty countries, Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea won 35 awards for Best Documentary.

The offspring gain beefiness from their sire and hardiness from their upland dams, and their colour is a blue roan which is regarded as attractive by many farmers. Due to the genetic origin of roan colouration in cattle, this colour does not breed true. This is because roan is the result of incomplete dominance between white and solid colour. Roan is produced consistently only in the first-generation cross between these. On average only half of the offspring of two blue roan cattle will be blue roan themselves, with the other half being either solid white or solid black. The Blue Grey cross became so popular that a special type of Shorthorn was developed to produce white Shorthorn bulls - the Whitebred Shorthorn. They are well-suited for rough grazing land and will utilize coarse grasses other breeds would shun. They are able to maintain good condition on less than ideal pasture and do not graze so intensively as sheep. Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, Limestone Country Project.

It is the second screen adaptation of the classic 1911 novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. (The first was a silent version released in 1919.) The screenplay by Robert Ardrey was directed by Fred M. Wilcox. It centers on a young orphan who is thrust into the dark and mysterious lives of her widowed uncle and his crippled son when she comes to live with them in their isolated country house in Yorkshire, England. A 1987 Hallmark Hall of Fame TV film titled The Secret Garden stars Gennie James and Jadrien Steele. A 1993 adaptation, The Secret Garden, starred Kate Maberly and Heydon Prowse. A 2020 version, set in 1947, was released in the United States in August 2020 on premium streaming video because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MGM film was filmed primarily in black- and-white, with the sequences set in the restored garden of the title filmed in Technicolor. The movie was Margaret O'Brien's final film for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. The film was released on DVD on May 7, 2013 as part of the Warner Archive Collection.https://www.wbshop.com/products/the-secret-garden-mod Plot When tempestuous Mary Lennox (Margaret O'Brien), born in India to wealthy parents, is orphaned by a cholera epidemic, she is sent to live with her reclusive and embittered Uncle Archibald Craven (Herbert Marshall) and her ill-behaved, bedridden cousin Colin (Dean Stockwell), about her own age, at their desolate and decaying estate known as Misselthwaite Manor. Dickon (Brian Roper), the brother of one of the house maids, tells her of a garden secreted behind a hidden door in a vine-covered wall. When a raven unearths the key, the two enter and discover the garden is overgrown from neglect since Craven's wife died there in an accident. They decide to keep their discovery a secret, and begin to restore it to its original grandeur. Under the influence of the Secret Garden, Mary becomes less self-absorbed, Colin's health steadily improves, and Archibald's curmudgeonly personality fades away.

Reception According to MGM records the film earned $610,000 in the US and Canada and $383,000 overseas, resulting in a loss of $848,000. On TCM, Margarita Landazuri writes that at the time of release, many critics “felt, as did the Variety critic, that 'the allegorical and psychological implications that have been carried over from Frances Hodgson Burnett's book are clearly for the grown-up trade. Not only that, but a good bit of the production is designed to create eerie terror that may discourage parents from letting moppets see the pic.' In this era when even the youngest 'moppets' take Harry Potter in stride, however, such criticism seems quaint, and The Secret Garden seems ahead of its time.“ Leonard Maltin gives the “Vividly atmospheric“ film three out of four stars.

It is derived from Shorthorn cattle, but is always white, rather than being the range of colours found in other Shorthorns. It has not undergone the specialisation seen in other Shorthorns (Beef Shorthorn and Dairy Shorthorn), and so it remains as a more traditional hardy and thrifty cattle type. This favours its use for conservation grazing of hill pastures, grazing rank grass species to maintain a diverse flora.Rare Breeds Survival Trust Uses The Whitebred Shorthorn was developed to provide white Shorthorn bulls for crossing with black Galloway cows.Whitebred Shorthorn Society history page The offspring of this cross form a popular type, the Blue Grey, which has useful characteristics of both parents, and an intermediate blue roan colour. As this colour does not consistently breed true, Blue Greys are normally produced each generation from the parent breeds. Breed history While the exact origin is unknown the breed came to be noticed in the late nineteenth century when it was known as the Cumberland White. At that time Mr David Hall of Larriston, Newcastleton, Roxburghshire, and Mr Andrew Park of Stelshaw, Bailey, Cumberland sold Blue-grey suckled calves at Newcastleton suckler sales. Numbers of Whitebred cattle, mainly bulls for cross breeding, increased after about 1900, until a separate day was needed at the Newcastleton auctions. The Whitebred Shorthorn Association was formed on 12 March 1962 by a meeting of almost 200 breeders. In the autumn of 1964 official breed society sales were held at Newcastleton and Bellingham and there was another successful Newcastleton sale in 1965. In that year the first sale of Whitebreds in Carlisle was held at Botchersgate Mart. Breed association sales continue to be held in Carlisle, in spring and autumn, although numbers sold are now in single figures.

The series is named after its most frequent protagonists, citizens of the Maurai Federation. The Maurai (originally descended from Māori peoples of N'Zealann and other Polynesians, but including a diverse array of ethnic and racial groups) dominate the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Fearful of the social and ecological implications of a return to large-scale industrial society, they use their considerable might and covert resources to prevent other nations from developing nuclear power. In Orion Shall Rise, the novel that culminated the series, Anderson allowed for the possibility that a more equitable distribution of power, and an advanced, space-faring civilization might evolve. Other societies in the Maurai series include: * The Northwest Union - a technological clan based society in the Pacific Northwest of North America * The Five Nations of the Mong - a feudal society in the center of North America, where an elite descended from post-war Russian, Chinese and Mongol invaders rules over a serf class descended from US citizens * The Domain of Skyholm, a class-based European society located in France, the Alps, and the Low Countries dominated by an ancient pre-war dirigible sky-city. * Other European nations include Angleylann, divided into small statelets including Devon; Italya, the confederation of the Alemanns in central Europe; and the Zheneralship of Espanya in the Iberian peninsula. * In North America, various \\"Free Merican\\" states exist, including Corodo and the piratical \\"Sky People\\", who raid Meyco to the south with primitive airships. * The story \\"Progress\\" takes place in Benghal, part of the Brahmard confederacy. * An extremely patriarchal society is located in Khorasan. * The island of Okkaido is a nation-state allied with the Maurai. * There is a reference to an empire known as the \\"'Perio\\" having ruled much of America but disintegrated before the time depicted in the stories.

Saipov often wrote articles critical of Uzbek President Islam Karimov and his government. He wrote extensively about torture in Uzbek prisons, the clampdown on dissent, and the rise of Islamic radicalism. He also worked as a correspondent for RFE/RL and Voice of America. He was shot dead at close range outside his downtown office in Osh in October 2007.  Journalism  Saipov reported \\"aggressively\\" on Uzbekistan's politics. According to the NGO Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Saipov was the subject of attacks in state-controlled Uzbek media in the month before his death, and had stated that Uzbek security agents were following him. Natalia Antelava from BBC News reported: \\"At twenty-six, Alisher Saipov was one of the most outspoken journalists in Central Asia ... He wrote extensively about torture in Uzbek President Islam Karimov's prisons, about the clampdown on dissent and the plight of the Uzbek refugees living in Kyrgyzstan.\\"  Murder and investigation  On 24 October 2007, Saipov was shot dead by someone at close range outside of his office in Osh. He was survived by his wife and three-month-old daughter. Amnesty International called on Kyrgyz authorities to better protect journalists, and for an investigation into Saipov's murder that was \\"thorough, impartial and in line with international practices\\". In 2007 and 2008, Kyrgyz investigators said they were probing allegations that Uzbek security agents might have been involved in the murder. The International Crisis Group, an NGO, stated that there were \\"strong indications\\" that Uzbek agents were responsible. In April 2009, officials announced that they had arrested former police officer Abdufarit Rasulov for the murder and found the murder weapon. However, the trial judge in the Osh City Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence for a trial. Prosecutors appealed, and the judge was replaced. On December 9, 2009 Kyrgyzstan’s Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution of the suspect Abdufarit Rasulov, a former policeman, could proceed, following an appeal by Alisher Saipov's father Avaz Saipov, who called the case \\"bogus\\". According to Uznews, Rasulov denied involvement in the murder and said that he was beaten by police. A CPJ spokesperson stated that \\"the refusal to launch a new investigation into the murder of Alisher Saipov only adds to the impression that the Kyrgyz authorities are concerned less with justice than in closing a diplomatically embarrassing case.\\" Radio Free Europe was critical of the decision, stating, \\"The confusion and contradictions around the investigation have granted de facto impunity to Saipov's killers and raise questions about the Kyrgyz government's commitment to solving the case\\". In 2010, Rasulov was found guilty and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. On 25 October 2012, Kyrgyz Deputy Interior Minister Melis Turganbaev stated that a new investigation into the murder had begun.

Biography =China= Ziya was born in Yarkant County, Xinjiang Province, China. After having gone to Soviet elementary and middle schools, he moved back to China, settling down in Yining City in 1930. There he founded many primary schools to promote Uyghur education, and wrote his novel The Bloody Mountain, which attacked the Nationalist government's ethnic policy. He also rewrote Gherip Senem, a Uyghur epic poem into a play that has since been played on stage. Samedi was arrested in 1937 by Xinjiang's governor, Sheng Shicai. A court sentenced him to seven years in jail. In 1944 he was released, and joined the army of the secessionist Second East Turkestan Republic. He was promoted to a Colonel, and was made in charge of military reconnaissance until that Soviet satellite regime collapsed in 1949. From 1950-1958 Samedi held a number of important positions in the new Chinese government ruled by the Communist Party, among them regional director of education, director of culture as well as the chairman of writer's association. In 1958, however, the Chinese government convicted him of crimes relating to sedition and ethnic separatism, sentencing him to two years of re-education through labor. =Soviet Union= After his re-education sentence was complete, Samedi fled to the Soviet Union. From 1961, he and his family published Uyghur separatist propaganda from the Kazakh SSR, including historical novels, among them Yillar Siri (Secret of the Years), Ehmet Ependi (Mr. Ehmet), Mayimhan, and Gheni the Brave. In the 1980s, Samedi was honored with the Kazakhstan People's Writer Award for his contribution to Uyghur literature. His books are still available in Kazakhstan.

CLFS first marshals logs records to in-memory buffers and then writes them to log-files on secondary storage (stable media in CLFS terminology) for permanent persistence. When the data will be flushed to stable media is controlled by built-in policies, but a CLFS client application can override that and force a flush. CLFS allows for customizable log formats, expansion and truncation of logs according to defined policies, as well as simultaneous use by multiple client applications. CLFS is able to store log files anywhere on the file system. CLFS defines a device driver interface (DDI), via which physical storage system specific drivers plug into the CLFS API. The CLFS driver implements the ARIES recovery algorithm; other algorithms can be supported by using custom drivers. CLFS supports both dedicated logs, as well as multiplexed logs. A dedicated log contains a single stream of log records whereas multiplexed log contain multiple streams, each stream for a different application. Even though a multiplexed log has multiple streams, logs are flushed to the streams sequentially, in a single batch. CLFS can allocate space for a set of log records ahead-of-time (before the logs are actually generated) to make sure the operation does not fail due to lack of storage space. A log record in a CLFS stream is first placed to Log I/O Block in a buffer in system memory. Periodically blocks are flushed to stable storage devices. On the storage device, a log contains a set of Containers, which are allocated contiguously, each containing multiple Log I/O Blocks. New log records are appended to the present set. Each record is identified by a Log Sequence Number (LSN), an increasing 32-bit sequence number. The LSN and other metadata are stored in the record header. The LSN encodes the identifier of the container, the offset to the record and the identifier of the record - this information is used to access the log record subsequently. However, the container identifiers are logical identifiers, they must be mapped to physical containers. The mapping is done by CLFS itself.

He made 331 appearances in the Football League. Jones was born in 1891 in Rotherham, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. A former coal miner, he was transferred from Sunderland to Birmingham in 1920 for a fee of £2,000. For six seasons he formed a formidable full-back pairing with Frank Womack, helping the club win the Football League Second Division title in the 1920–21 season. He went on to play 237 matches in all competitions for the club, including 191 in the First Division. He later played for Nelson, Crewe Alexandra and Scarborough.

Later managed by Jake Riviera, who first worked for the band as a roadie, they reached their peak as part of the \\"Naughty Rhythms Tour\\" of 1975, along with other stalwarts of the same scene, Dr. Feelgood and Kokomo, each band alternately headlining on different dates. History The band has its origins in a folk-rock duo formed by ex-Junior's Blues Band members Martin Stone and Philip C. Lithman. Lithman moved to San Francisco in the late 1960s, leaving Stone to play with Savoy Brown and Mighty Baby. The duo reunited in the early 1970s, recording Kings of the Robot Rhythm with vocalist Jo Ann Kelly and various members of Brinsley Schwarz. The album was released in 1972; the same year, the duo expanded, adding Paul \\"Dice Man\\" Bailey, Paul \\"Bassman\\" Riley, and Pete Thomas to the line-up. During the next two years, Chilli Willi & The Red Hot Peppers became a popular live act in Britain, and recorded two John Peel Sessions for BBC Radio 1, on 9 April 1973 and 25 July 1974. In 1974, they released their final album, Bongos Over Balham, which sold poorly; the band split in 1975. After the band's breakup, Thomas became the drummer for Elvis Costello's backing band, The Attractions; Riley played with Graham Parker; Bailey formed Bontemps Roulez; and Stone played with the Pink Fairies, before concentrating on his book business but has since played with Wreckless Eric, Almost Presley and Deep Fix. Lithman moved back to San Francisco where he began to work with his former associates, The Residents, under the name Snakefinger.

The company provided services for IT operations, business solutions, outsourcing, infrastructure and consulting. ErgoGroup had a total of 90 offices and regional branches throughout Norway, Sweden and Finland, and was a subsidiary of Posten Norge, the Norwegian Postal Service. It was the second largest ICT operations company in Norway. The company also held partial ownership in SYSteam, TransWare, Gecko, Eiendomsverdi, Buypass, Eye-Share and Bekk Consulting. ErgoGroup merged with EDB Business Partner in 2010, creating EVRY. Organisation and services ErgoGroup organised its services in Norway into five business areas: IT Operations, Solutions, Regional Services, the Nordic countriesNordic Region and Bekk Consulting. IT Operations work primarily with outsourcing contracts aimed at the key account market. This business area also had responsibility for ErgoGroup's communications services, and developed basic operating solutions that were used by all of ErgoGroup's business areas. Other areas covered by IT Operations were cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS), network solutions, virtualisation, security and IT surveillance. The second business area, Solutions, delivered software solutions, services and business sector solutions that streamlined selected work processes within the public and private sectors. Examples of areas of specialisation were: finance and corporate performance management, portal, case and document handling, business consultancy and process optimisation, development, architecture and integration, electronic transactions, and information databases. Regional Services covered ErgoGroup's smaller businesses and businesses outside the main cities and regional centres. This area covered IT infrastructure, electronic collaboration, unified communications, portals, enterprise content management, enterprise resource planning, Customer Relationship Management, mobile solutions, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and IT infrastructure library. In 2007 ErgoGroup bought Bekk Consulting, a Norwegian consultancy company in which ErgoGroup then had 75 per cent ownership shares and options to purchase the remaining 25 per cent within three years. Bekk Consulting supplied consultancy, development and management services in the following areas: process and organisational development, modernisation of professional systems, portal and self-service solutions and customised business applications. History The company was founded as the government agency Statens Driftssentral for administrativ databehandling in 1972 to perform operational services related to IT operation. In 1985 it was made a limited company and renamed Statens Datasentral AS, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Government Administration. It bought TF Data in 1989, Oslo Data in 1991 and Statdata in 1993. The postal service bought the company in 1995, changing its name to Posten SDS. It was renamed to Ergogroup in 2001. In 2005 the company bought the outsourcing division of Ementor and in 2006 Nor-Cargo Data, AddIQ, Fujitsu Services Norway, SYSteam (at NOK 1.1 billion) and Allianse (at NOK 900 million). In 2007 it bought 75 per cent of Bekk Consulting. Due to an increased customer base and enhanced value creation, ErgoGroup has experienced a steady and organic growth in recent years. The ICT industry as a whole is in a process of consolidation, due partly to market demands for increased professionalism on the part of suppliers. ErgoGroup has been an active participant in this development and has consolidated its core activities through strategic acquisitions. In May 2010, Telenor owned EDB Business Partner, who announced that it was in strategic discussions with ErgoGroup, which later lead to a merger between Norway's two biggest IT companies.

Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, the television program In 1955, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon premiered as a television series. Richard \\"Dick\\" Simmons starred as Sgt. Preston, and was supported by Yukon King, his dog, and Rex, his horse. Though no plotlines seem to have been re- used from the show's radio serial precursor, Challenge of the Yukon, they were generally built upon the same themes. The visual component of the snowy Yukon, however, did give the television version a different feel but like all such films when filmed on a stage set, the frosty breath of people in Arctic conditions could not be simulated. Genuine outdoor scenes were added to give the show some reality but they were monotonously filmed in the same area and reused again and again. Mainly filmed at Ashcroft, Colorado, the series was telecast on CBS from September 29, 1955 to February 27, 1958. Sergeant Preston of the Yukon was one of many TV programs from the 1950s that generated toys, games, comic books, and other juvenile merchandise.

Recording at the edge is a distributed or de-centralized approach to storage—the video is spread across a number of edge-storage devices as opposed to centralized on one.Bosch: Recording at the Edge Solution Brief Network bandwidth-friendly Recording at the edge is a network bandwidth-friendly approach because it does not use any network bandwidth in order to record video—instead the network is only used to play back audio or video from the edge at some review station. When the network includes a WAN or, worse still, the Internet, by definition Recording at the Edge becomes the only way to ensure high quality recordings. Reliability Recording at the edge is more reliable because recording is independent of the network's health and degree of congestion. Even if the network grinds to a halt recording continues unaffected. However, you have to be very cautious while only recording at the edge. SD cards in these cameras are continuously filled with data, written over, and over-worked -They burn out very quickly, compared to a normal Hard Drive. Simple Deployment Recording at the Edge can be achieved by deploying PC-based DVRs at the edge, however with vulnerable operating systems these are more challenging to maintain than a simple purpose built embedded appliance. Embedded DVRs are better suited to this role, although conventional DVRs traditionally focus on recording, searching and playback than scalable live streaming over the network, which is a primary function of an IP-based CCTV architecture. Surveillance System Fault Tolerance One of the concerns about IP-based CCTV is the dependence on the network. In a network outage in a centralized storage model both live video and the ability to record is lost. With Recording at the edge this is less of an issue because network outage only impacts live video. In a centralized approach, if the central recording station fails, all cameras cease to be recorded. With recording at the edge, if one edge recorder fails then only those cameras connected to that unit stop recording. Pre-alarm recording For added security centralized storage is frequently used to record alarm video for easy alarm verification and long- term secure storage. Pre-alarm recording is offered by introducing a buffer in the encoder so that the seconds or minutes of video before and after an alarm can be automatically transmitted to the centralized storage. Because of the huge edge storage capacities of some encoders, ranging from 256 MB to 800 GB, you can continuously record video at high frame rates and high resolutions, and still take advantage of pre-alarm recording. For instance, if you continuously transmit a 1 Mbit/s stream (30 IPS at 4 CIF) to a central recorder in the anticipation that an alarm event will occur, you will consume 1 Mbit/s of network bandwidth, or send about 11 Gigabytes of video data. If, however, you use recording at the edge, and use pre-alarm recording configured to 5 seconds pre- and 10 seconds post-alarm, then assuming 20 alarms per day you will transmit a much lower total of around 40 Megabytes of video. The same 11 GB will still be recorded locally but only 40 MB, or 0.4% of it, will touch the network. In those instances where the pre-alarm video is not long enough, it is comforting to know that the original complete video is always available, recorded at the edge. Dual Streaming In situations where the network bandwidth is severely limited, recording at the edge is a savior for high quality recorded video but it does not solve the challenge of needing to view live video over a restricted network. Some encoders support dual streaming. This is a concept that enables the encoder to deliver two totally independent streams of video, separately configured for different frame rates and video resolutions. Typically for limited bandwidth networks one high quality stream is used for local recording, and a lower quality, which translates to a lower bit rate, is used for viewing live. Conversely for high bandwidth networks, the same stream will be used to record locally and centrally, and Automatic Network Replenishment is used to fill any gaps in the centralized recording dues to network interruptions. Bosch: Recording at the Edge Solution Brief Economies of Scale A major justification for centralized storage is that we can use enormous RAID disk arrays, reducing the cost per terabyte. These cost savings must be balanced against the advantages above. The ideal solution is to seamlessly combine both approaches—when the network bandwidth is available and reliable then use it, but when it is severely limited or intermittent, then use recording at the edge. System Management Another significant benefit of centralized systems is the relative simplicity of system management, because everything is co-located in one room or data center rather than dispersed across hundreds or thousands of miles. For recording at the edge to be a pragmatic solution it is critical to include centralized health monitoring and associated system management utilities. These include SNMP compatibility to network management systems such as Tivoli and HP Open View, and the ability to reconfigure and upgrade multiple units simultaneously. Digital video recorders in recording at the edge Analog- to-DVR systems do not offer edge recording. This is because the analog cameras must first record to a central DVR; the video is then compressed into a digital format, and then stored typically on a hard drive inside the unit. All of this must be done before it can record to SD or attached hard drive. IP Camera systems on the other hand do not require analog to digital conversion so can record digital video directly to SD cards inside the camera, or to attached hard drive.

It houses exhibits to inform and educate on the role of Navy Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) and Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams. The museum also preserves the history of the SEALs (the original Navy frogmen first trained outside of Fort Pierce). The idea of the museum originated in the home of Albert Stankie, where he and other former UDT Frogmen gathered personal artifacts and experiences from their service in World War II. They worked to procure the defunct Ft. Pierce Treasure Museum building and site. This evolved into a dedicated facility, which opened in 1985, and was recognized as a National Museum by an act of Congress signed into law February 7, 2008. UDT-SEAL Memorial UDT-SEAL Memorial The focal point of the Museum is the UDT-SEAL Memorial, the only memorial in the world dedicated exclusively to the United States Navy SEALs and their predecessors. The Memorial consists of a 500-pound, 9-foot-tall, bronze sculpture of a modern Navy SEAL. The names of all Underwater Demolition Team members—the \\"Frogmen\\" of World War II and modern Navy SEALs—who have died in the service of the country are carved into black, granite panels on the walls surrounding the sculpture and its reflecting pool. Other notable exhibits The museum collection includes a number of rare artifacts dating from the founding of the SEALs, from the days of Scouts & Raiders, through the Underwater Demolition Teams, to recent present-day activities of US Navy SEALs: * Original World War II–era obstacles used for demolition training prior to the Normandy landings (\\"D-Day\\"). * LCPL \\"the Shark Tooth Boat\\" used by the UDT in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II and during the Korean War. * Patrol Boat River (PBR), used during the Vietnam era. These boats had a shallow draft and jet drive making them ideal for insertion and extraction in the rivers and canals of the region. * Apollo space craft—the actual training devices used by the UDT \\"frogmen\\" recovery Teams during the Apollo, Gemini, and Mercury space missions. *The museum features several boats including the Mark V Special Operations Craft (SOC) which is an 82-foot and 52-plus ton boat operated by Special Boat Teams and was used as a medium range insertion and extraction platform for Navy SEALs.

(Sinibald, Sebald) is venerated as the patron saint of Nuremberg, traditional administrative centre of Franconia, and the guarantor of its independence.Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon: \\"Sebaldus von Nürnberg\\" According to legend Sebaldus was a hermit and a missionary.  Legends  Almost all details of the life of Sebaldus are uncertain, beyond his presence in the woodland of Poppenreuth, west of Nuremberg(Klasus-Stefan Krieger), Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon, s.v. \\"Sebaldus\\" which was explained by his being a hermit. However various legends about his life have been recorded. One of the earliest legends (ca 1280) claims Sebaldus was a contemporary of Henry III (died 1056) and was of Franconian origin. After a pilgrimage in Italy, he became a preacher at Nuremberg.San Sebaldo (Sinibaldo) Another text claims that he was a Frankish nobleman who met Willibald and Winibald in Italy (thus dating his life to the 8th century) and later became a missionary in the Sebalder Reichswald that is associated with his name. Other legends claim he was either the son of the king of Denmark or a student in Paris who married a French princess, but then abandoned her on their wedding night to go on a pilgrimage to Rome. In these versions of the legend the Pope gave Sebaldus the mission of evangelising in the forests of Nuremberg, which gives his ancient presence there a papal authority.  Veneration  caption= Shrine of St. Sebaldus (containing his relics) in the Sebalduskirche at Nuremberg, the masterpiece of Peter Vischer the Elder and his sons, 1508-19 Despite the obscure origins and insecure historicity of the saint himself, the cult of Sebaldus has been long associated with Nuremberg, fostered by the city itself, which became a place of pilgrimage. The earliest existence of his cult can be dated to the late eleventh century, with a passing reference under the year 1072 in the chronicle of Lambert of Hersfeld.Noted in Carl Mirbt, Die Publizistik im Zeitalter Gregors VII. 1894:115 and note 5. in 1255, he became the co-patron, with Saint Peter, of the newly rebuilt parochial church, where his tomb was venerated. The feast day of St Sebaldus as August 19 appeared in a calendar of Olmütz of 1131-1137, and many children born in that city bore the saint’s name. The relics of the saint were translated in 1397 to the new choir of the church of Saint Sebaldus, and every year his relics were carried in procession. The kings and emperors of Germany, when in Nuremberg, customarily prayed before his reliquary. On March 26, 1425 he was formally canonized by Pope Martin V, following a request by the Council of Nuremberg. In 1429, florins from Nuremberg began to bear his image. A Latin Vita Sancti Sebaldi (\\"Life of St. Sebaldus\\") was written about 1480 by Sigmund Meisterlin, a peripatetic Benedictine monk who spent some time at Augsburg. In 1508-19, Peter Vischer the Elder and his sons fabricated the celebrated Late Gothic bronze tomb in the Church of St. Sebaldus, considered a masterpiece of the German Renaissance. The cult survived the Reformation. In Italy, where he is venerated as San Sinibaldo, an altar was dedicated to him in the Venetian church of San Bartolomeo sul Rialto.For the veneration of Sebaldus in Italy, see Hans Martin von Erffa, \\"Der Nürnberger Stadtpatron auf italienischen Gemälden\\", Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz, 20.1 (1976), pp. 1-12.

She is a member of the Alberta Liberal Party, and was first elected in the 1997 election. Early life She graduated with a bachelor's degree in fine arts in acting and a certificate in public administration from the University of Alberta. Before entering politics, she worked for the Alberta Advisory Council on Women's Issues, the Phoenix Theatre and Theatre Network, the Medical Council of Canada, and the Alberta Snowmobile Association. Political career =Electoral record= Blakeman first sought political office in the 1997 provincial election, when she ran as a Liberal candidate in Edmonton-Centre to replace retiring Liberal MLA Michael Henry. She was elected, finishing more than a thousand votes ahead of the second-place finisher, Progressive Conservative Don Weideman. This gap narrowed when Weideman challenged her re-election bid in the 2001 election, but grew to more than three thousand votes in 2004. The 2008 election would bring a new Progressive Conservative Opponent, in Bill Donahue, but a similar result, as Blakeman handily retained her seat. For the 2015 election, Blakeman ran for three political parties, Liberal, Alberta Party and Greens. All to no avail as she lost her seat in the legislature in the 2015 election which saw the NDP sweep to power for the first time. =Legislative initiatives= In 1997, Blakeman sponsored the Domestic Abuse Act, a private member's bill that never reached second reading. In 1998, she brought forward the Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Amendment Act, another private member's bill, which would have expanded the province's anti-discrimination legislation to include sexual orientation as a basis on which discrimination was prohibited (later the same year, the Supreme Court of Canada, in Vriend v. Alberta, ruled Alberta's failure to include this to be in contravention of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms); it too failed to advance to second reading. In 1999, Blakeman sponsored the Consumers Insurance Company Act, a private bill designed to create a new insurance company, in compliance with the law that new insurance companies could only be created by acts of the legislature. However, the bill faced some opposition from Blakeman's Liberal colleagues, including Linda Sloan, Hugh MacDonald, and Gary Dickson, who expressed concern that the bill might be a step towards privatized medicine. The bill passed. In 2007, Blakeman sponsored the Healthy Futures Act, which would have required major policy and funding decisions to undergo \\"health impact assessments\\", which would look at their impacts on Albertans' health through social and environmental impacts. Blakeman's Liberal colleagues supported the bill, as did the New Democrats (although NDP MLA Ray Martin expressed concern that the bill only required assessment, rather than action, on potential adverse health impacts) and several Progressive Conservatives. Even so, it was defeated through majority opposition of the Progressive Conservatives, many of whom expressed the view that the bill would add nothing meaningful that did not already exist under the existing regulatory framework, while, in the words of PC MLA Dave Rodney, \\"effectively bring[ing] the decision- making apparatus of the government and this Assembly to a grinding halt.\\" =Leadership aspirations= After Kevin Taft announced his intention to resign the leadership of the Alberta Liberal Party following its defeat in the 2008 election, Blakeman was one of four MLAs to express interest in running in the ensuing election to replace him. However, in August she announced that she would not do so, citing the cost of a candidacy. She was a candidate in the 2011 leadership election, placing third. =Critic portfolios= * Liberal Opposition House Leader * Critic for Environment and Sustainable Resource Development * Critic for Culture * Critic for Justice and Solicitor General * Critic for Municipal Affairs Personal life Blakeman is married to Edmonton city councillor Ben Henderson.

It replaced the Neutrality Acts of 1937, by which belligerents could purchase only nonmilitary goods from the United States as long as the recipients paid immediately in cash and assumed all risk in transportation using their own ships. The \\"Cash and Carry\\" revision allowed the sale of military arms to belligerents on the same cash- and-carry basis. Originally presented to Congress by Senator Key Pittman (D-NV) earlier in 1939, the bill was designed to replace the Neutrality Act of 1937, which had lapsed in May 1939. The bill had been defeated repeatedly by the Senate and the House on more than one occasion as Isolationists feared that passing the bill would draw the US into the conflict in Europe. However, President Roosevelt felt that further help was needed in Europe after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. The bill passed in late October, gaining approval from the House on November 5, 1939. The President gave his signature the same day. The purpose of this policy was to allow the Allied nations at war with Germany to purchase war materials while maintaining a semblance of neutrality for the United States. Various policies, such as the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937, forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms. Cash and carry ended this prohibition, while still attempting to keep U.S. interests out of the conflict. U.S. ships were forbidden from entering into conflict zones, and US passengers traveling on foreign ships were notified that they did so at their own risk. Coming out of the Great Depression, the U.S. economy was rebounding. Further growth in manufacturing would propel the economy forward. The cash and carry program stimulated U.S. manufacturing while allowing the Allied nations, particularly the United Kingdom, to purchase much needed military equipment. The program prevented U.S. business interests from backing the success or failure of any warring nation. Because of the conclusion of the Nye Committee, which asserted that United States involvement in World War I was driven by private interests from arms manufacturers, many Americans believed that investment in a belligerent would eventually lead to American participation in war. The \\"cash and carry\\" legislation enacted in 1939 effectively ended the arms embargo that had been in place since the Neutrality Act of 1936, and paved the way for Roosevelt's Lend-Lease program.

Overview The main features of cash and carry are summarized best by the following definitions: *Cash and carry is a form of trade in which goods are sold from a wholesale warehouse operated either on a self-service basis or on the basis of samples (with the customer selecting from specimen articles using a manual or computerized ordering system but not serving themselves) or a combination of the two. *Customers (retailers, professional users, caterers, institutional buyers, etc.) settle the invoice on the spot in cash and carry the goods away themselves. *There are significant differences between \\"classical\\" sales at the wholesale stage and the cash and carry wholesaler: namely cash and carry customers arrange the transport of the goods themselves and pay for the goods on the spot, rather than on credit. *Access to purchase at a cash and carry is typically limited to operators of bona fide businesses, and the general public are not admitted. Though wholesalers buy primarily from manufacturers and sell mostly to retailers, industrial users and other wholesalers, they also perform many value added functions. The wholesaler, an intermediary, is used based on principles of specialization and division of labor as well as contractual efficiency.(OECD -Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) In a retail context, the term has a similar meaning: customers pay cash for the goods they purchase (the retailer does not offer credit accounts) and carry them away themselves (the retailer does not offer delivery service). The first textbook on wholesaling - Wholesaling Principles and Practice (1937) by Beckman and Engle notes that the \\"During the era of rapid change in the field of wholesaling which began in the middle of the twenties, the cash and carry wholesale house was ushered in.\\"Wholesaling - Wholesaling Principles and Practice (1937) by Beckman and Engle. page 222 Lawrence Batley is widely accredited as the originator of the concept in the UK. However, research on the evolution of grocery wholesaling in the UK by Dr Jim Quinn at Trinity College Dublin notes that the first report of a UK cash and carry was in June 1957 when The Grocer announced that a cash and carry warehouse had been opened in Ramsgate by Vye & Son a subsidiary of the Home & Colonial Group. The new service was called Wiseway and a range of own brands was being developed. In April 1958 L. Batley & Co. of Huddersfield opened a large 30,000 sq. ft. modern Cash & Carry warehouse by far the biggest of its kind to date.

The Rose Garden bankruptcy occurred in 2004 when the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon was the subject and primary asset in a bankruptcy filing, shifting ownership of the arena from billionaire Paul Allen to a consortium of creditors. Allen, who owns the arena's primary tenant, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA, financed the arena's construction in 1993 with a US $155 million loan on what Allen's representatives later characterized as unfavorable terms. As a result of the bankruptcy, the Rose Garden was operated by its creditors for over two years, during which Allen and the creditors briefly offered the arena for sale. By April 2007 the Rose Garden was once again owned by Allen. Background Ground broke on the Rose Garden in 1993, and the building opened two years later in 1995. The Rose Garden cost $262 million to build, $155 million of which was financed through a loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. As Allen was unwilling to personally guarantee the loan, the lenders demanded an interest rate of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment. Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance. A shell corporation, the Oregon Arena Corporation (OAC), was chartered to oversee the construction and operation of the Rose Garden, as well as operation of the Rose Quarter as a whole. The sole shareholder in OAC was Allen. During the 1990s and the early 2000s (decade), the team was successful both on the court and in the box officetwice making it to the Western Conference finalsbut a series of questionable and expensive player acquisitions caused many fans to sour on the team, by then derisively called the \\"Jail Blazers.\\" In addition, the team payroll skyrocketed to over $100 million. In 2002, a collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the players' union imposed a luxury tax on excessive payrolls; this tax impacted the team's finances greatly. In the summer of 2003, Bob Whitsitt resigned and was replaced as team president by Steve Patterson; Patterson was chartered with restoring the team's image and bringing costs under control. Bankruptcy filing Claiming the local economy was responsible for reduced revenues which made it unable to make payments on the loans used to finance Rose Garden Construction, the Oregon Arena Corporation filed for bankruptcy on February 27, 2004. After negotiations concurrent with the bankruptcy failed to produce a settlementAllen offered US $90 million, and creditors demanded US $198 millionthe United States Bankruptcy Court ordered on November 8 of that year that the OAC transfer the Rose Garden to the creditors. Several factors contributed to the bankruptcy. Debt service on the loan was expensive due to the undesirable loan terms, the Trail Blazers were not drawing as well due to negative press and a decline in quality of play. In addition, the local economy affected ticket sales, and a lawyer for the creditors noted that OAC was ineffective in luring non- basketball events to the arena. Many of the corporations leasing skyboxes in the arena (a primary source of revenue) declined to renew leases. =Portland Arena Management= As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Oregon Arena Corporation was dissolved and their assets (primarily the Rose Garden and the underlying land) became the property of the lenders on January 1, 2005. The lenders formed a new corporation, Portland Arena Management LLC (\\"PAM\\") to manage the property acquired in the bankruptcy proceedings, and hired Global Spectrum to operate the arena. For a while, the Trail Blazers (still owned by Allen) and the Portland Arena Management had a highly hostile relationship, with the two entities competing for ticket sales. Almost immediately after PAM took over the arena, the Trail Blazers demanded that new owners perform US $40 million in renovations to maintain the Rose Garden as a \\"first class facility.\\" Effects One year after the Rose Garden was transferred to creditors, Larry Conn, an executive at Vulcan Inc. gave an interview in which he claimed that \\"all options were on the table\\" concerning the Trail Blazers as the \\"economic model\\" was broken, and noted that without a \\"public-private partnership\\", \\"no businessperson can sustain losses of that kind\\". Conn noted that the lease agreement with Portland Arena Management gave PAM all revenue from the arena's premium seating (the black courtside seats, as well as luxury box revenue), concessions, and parking, as well as all arena-related revenue for events other than Trail Blazer games. The Trail Blazers retained the revenue for non-premium seating (the arena's red seats) for Blazer games. Paul Allen repeated the claim in an interview in March. Team officials were vague about specifics, leading to much media speculation that Allen might sell the team, attempt to move it, or was lobbying for increased public financing of Trail Blazer operations. In addition to the lease concerns, that season the Blazers posted the league's worst record (21-61), and attendance was below average. While the financial model may have been broken for the Trail Blazers, it was anything but for Portland Arena Management. Rose Quarter GM Mike Scanlon of Global Spectrum stated that the company was \\"very happy with how things are going at the Rose Garden\\", and referred to Global's stewardship of the Garden as a \\"very positive experience\\". He noted that the arena did 45 concerts in 2005, and that same year landed another sports tenant, the Portland LumberJax of the National Lacrosse League. =Trail Blazers and arena go up for sale= Throughout the spring of 2006, NBA commissioner David Stern met with both Blazer management and PAM in an attempt to repair the relationship. In the spring of 2006, Allen and PAM agreed to jointly market the team and the arena for sale. Fourteen investor groups (including one fronted by Terry Porter) expressed interest, and paid a US$100,000 application fee. The highest initial bids were in the US$300–$325 million range. However, Allen unexpectedly pulled the team off the market. It was speculated that Allen agreed to sell the team to learn what price Portland Arena Management would accept from a third party. Others suspected that he had advance knowledge of the upcoming purchase of the Seattle SuperSonics by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett, and that Allen saw an opportunity to move the Blazers to his hometown of Seattle should the Sonics move to the Sooner State. In an interview, Allen indicated that the Blazers' strong 2006 draft, including 2006 NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy, caused him to change his mind about selling the team. Public reaction The bankruptcy filing was widely criticized in the local media and elsewhere. Helen Jung, a reporter for The Oregonian described the affair as a game of \\"chicken\\" and as \\"bankruptcy as a business strategy\\", and noted Allen may have worsened his position by taking the arena into bankruptcy rather than offering a higher settlement. Lewis & Clark College law professor and noted local blogger Jack Bogdanski was even more unkind, attacking the morality and \\"character\\" of a billionaire \\"weaseling\\" his way out of a debt that he could easily repay personally, especially at a time when the team was putting an emphasis on the off-court behavior of his players. Claims concerning the \\"broken financial model\\" were similarly mocked. After Blazer management complained about having the \\"worst lease in pro sports\\", Dwight Jaynes of the Portland Tribune noted that the situation was largely the team's own fault. Helen Jung noted that teams regularly complain about losing money, and suspected that such claims were often a ruse to obtain public financing. During the bankruptcy period, the team and the state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, had an especially troubled relationship. Oregonian columnist John Canzano and then-Trail Blazers president Steve Patterson were deeply distrustful of each other. The paper hired an outside editor to investigate the relationship between the paper's sports department and the team. The Trail Blazers, for their part, maintained throughout putting Oregon Arena Corp. into bankruptcy was the best option for the team. Paul Allen stated that the debt service on the loan was greater than the revenues earned by the stadium, especially in the face of declining attendance. Allen also noted that the creditors, on a loan of $155 million, had recouped $195 million in cash over the years, plus the arena, which the bankruptcy court valued at US$60 million. Paul Allen re-acquires the arena On February 2, 2007, Allen (through his subsidiary Vulcan) and PAM announced that the parties had signed a letter-of- intent for Allen to repurchase the arena.Rose Garden deal done - Playbooks and Profits from OregonLive.com On April 2 of that year, the deal was completed. At that point, a new Allen-owned corporation, Vulcan Sports and Entertainment, was chartered to operate Allen's sports-related properties, including the arena, the Trail Blazers, and the Seattle Seahawks. Terms of the purchase agreement were not disclosed.

Ras Kass sent waves through the hip-hop world with his debut independent single release \\"Remain Anonymous,\\" earning him a Hip-Hop Quotable in The Source Magazine. Before his signing with Priority/EMI Records, Ras Kass began making guest appearances on several records and freestyles on numerous radio shows, further solidified the emerging lyricist's notoriety. Recorded guest appearances include Sway & King Tech's \\"Come Widdit\\" (feat. Ras Kass, Ahamad and Saafir) (Priority Records) and their \\"Wake Up Show Anthem '94\\" (feat. Ras Kass, Nas, Lauryn Hill, Chino XL, Organized Konfusion and Saafir), as well as Chino XL's \\"Riiiot\\" (American Recordings), and KeyKool and Rhettmatic's \\"E=MC5\\" (feat. Ras Kass, LMNO, and Meen Green) Up Above Records. =Soul on Ice and Rasassination= From a young age, Austin was influenced by hip hop music and inspired by a variety of emcees including Ice Cube, Rakim, Scarface, and KRS-One. His first album, Soul on Ice, was released in 1996. Taking its name from a book by Eldridge Cleaver, Ras addressed racial relations in the same manner, most notably with \\"Ordo Abchao\\" and \\"Nature of the Threat.\\" The album was released on Priority Records, as was the follow-up, Rasassination, which featured beats from Easy Mo Bee and guest appearances by RZA, Twista, Xzibit, Mack 10 and Dr. Dre. Lead single \\"Ghetto Fabulous\\" featured Dre and Mack 10 and was pushed by a lavish video shoot. The album received generally positive reviews, and shortly afterward the MC announced his third album, Van Gogh. =Priority issues, Van Gogh and Goldyn Chyld= During the recording of Ras's intended third album, Van Gogh, Priority Records merged with Capitol Records, which acquired the emcee's contract and his material. Initially near completion, the album was heavily bootlegged before any single or promotion could be prepared. In fact, the would-be single \\"Van Gogh\\" was even played on an episode of The Sopranos. Ras went back to work overhauling the project, procuring tracks from DJ Premier, Hi-Tek, and Dr. Dre and retaining songs from Rockwilder and Battlecat. Tensions arose during the re-recording, from budget restrictions to lack of promotion: Despite the fact that \\"Van Gogh\\" remained shelved the album's singles \\"Back It Up\\" and \\"Goldyn Chyd\\" received decent amount of spins on Los Angeles urban contemporary radio stations KKBT (The Beat) and KPWR (Power 106) during the course of 2001–02. Ras Kass was also involved in The HRSMN, sometimes called the 4 Hrsmn, consisting of himself, Kurupt (of Tha Dogg Pound), Killah Priest, and Canibus. The Horsemen Project, a white-label of rough tracks by the four, was released in 2003, but no other releases have been subsequently forthcoming. Finally, nearing the completion of his album, the MC and Priority disagreed over the lead single. Originally pushing \\"Goldyn Chyld,\\" produced by DJ Premier, Priority executives decided to try to release the Dr. Dre-produced \\"The Whoop\\" instead, against the wishes of both Ras Kass and Dr. Dre. As he was finishing up Goldyn Chyld, Kass was pulled over in California and arrested for a D.U.I., marking his third; though sentenced to jail time, he was given an extension. Two weeks before the start of his sentence, Priority informed him of their decision not to put out Goldyn Chyld after all. Becoming a fugitive, Ras attained the masters to his project, recorded some music, and finally turned himself in to police. During this time, he also had minor problems with producer the Alchemist, who sold Ras a beat that he later re-sold to rapper Jadakiss, which ultimately formed the basis for the track \\"We Gon' Make It.\\" =Incarceration, Institutionalized I and II, Priority release= After serving only 19 months for his D.U.I. charge, Ras Kass recorded the album Institutionalized and began seeking release from his contract with Priority/Capitol Records. Though intended to be an album, it was released as a mixtape, generating a moderate buzz despite Capitol's alleged reluctance. He would go on to release two more mixtapes in 2006, Revenge of the Spit and Eat or Die, and got into a fight with former G-Unit rapper The Game over an alleged reference to the rapper's son in a freestyle. In October 2007, Kass finally succeeded in being released from his record contract. However, after rumors of a deal with Def Jam or G-Unit Records, he was again incarcerated, this time for violating his parole by flying to the 2007 BET Awards. During this time, he put out the album Institutionalized Volume 2 on Babygrande Records. After nearly two years of incarceration, Ras Kass was released from jail at the end of May 2009. Ras Kass talks about his arrest and incarceration in the 2011 film Rhyme and Punishment, which documents rap artists who have spent time behind bars. =The Quarterly= Featured in HipHopDX's Underground Report, Ras Kass revealed that his next release would be a project called The Quarterly. Originally intended to be completed within the fourth quarter of 2009, it comprises a song a week released in the fashion of fellow west coast emcee Crooked I's Hip-Hop Weekly and Freeway's Month of Madness. \\"The Quarterly\\" was released on November 23, 2009, via www.raskass-central.com and includes nineteen tracks featuring collaborations by Killah Priest, Mistah F.A.B. and Krondon of Strong Arm Steady, with production from Pete Rock, Veterano, and others. =A.D.I.D.A.S.

(All Day I Dream About Spittin) project and a viral marketing campaign called \\"Save The Ras Kass\\", which included a series of satirical web episodes about the plight of the endangered emcee.RAS KASS: A.D.I.D.A.S. – Limited Edition CD & Vinyl Kickstarter.com In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating \\"we started trying different angles at solving old problems.

Provan quickly established himself in McNeill's revamped Celtic side, scoring his first goal against Hibernian at Easter Road on 18 November 1978. In May 1979 Provan won his first major winner's medal as Celtic clinched the Premier Division by defeating Rangers 4-2 in the last game of the league season.The Celtic Wiki (Celtic 4 Rangers 2) The following year Provan was voted SPFA Player of the Year by his fellow professionals.1979–80 in Scottish football#Individual honours Provan was proving to be a huge success at Celtic and his distinctive long curly hair, jersey hanging over his shorts and socks down at his ankles made him - visually alone - a standout figure on the field of play in Scotland.The Bhoy in the Picture: Davie Provan Provan went on to win a further three League championships with Celtic (1980–81, 1981–82 and 1985–86), along with one Scottish League Cup (1982) and two Scottish Cups (1980 and 1985). The latter Scottish Cup saw Provan write himself into football history, becoming only the third player at that time to score direct from a free kick in a Scottish Cup final. Celtic had been a goal down to Dundee United at the time, and following Provan's equaliser went on to win 2–1. The start of season 1985–86 saw Provan in exceptional form for Celtic, resulting in intense media speculation that a recall to the Scotland international side was on the cards. However, Provan had to be substituted during a 3–0 Old Firm defeat at Ibrox in November due to illness. This turned out to be M.E. - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - a long-term condition that leaves the sufferer extremely lethargic and unable to perform much in the way of physical activity. Provan made several attempts at rehabilitation but eventually made the decision in the summer of 1987 to retire from playing football. His last game was coming on as a substitute against Motherwell in January 1986. A testimonial was arranged for Provan, and in November 1987 Celtic played Nottingham Forest in front of 42,000 fans, losing 3–1. Kenny Dalglish made a guest appearance for Celtic, with Provan playing for the first eight minutes. =Scotland= Provan's success at Celtic saw him capped for Scotland 10 times. He made his debut against Belgium in November 1979, scored against Israel in a 3–1 win at Hampden in a 1982 World Cup qualifier, and was part of Jock Stein's 22-man squad for the 1982 World Cup finals in SpainPlanet World Cup - Scotland's World Cup squad 1982 although he did not actually play. John Robertson (Nottingham Forest), Davie Cooper (Rangers) and Peter Weir (Aberdeen) competed with Provan for an international place.Scottish FA - John RobertsonSporting Heroes - Davie Cooper Media work Since his retirement as a player, Provan has worked in the media as a pundit and co-commentator for Sky Sports. Since the 2012–13 season, he has been one of the main co- commentators on Sky's coverage of the Premier League, Champions League and Scottish Professional Football League. Provan was also a columnist for several years for the Scottish edition of the now defunct News of the World and now writes for its sister paper, The Sun. Personal life Provan is married to Fiona and the couple have two daughters, Kelly and Anna.

It was released by 20th Century Fox and filmed in Cinemascope on location in London. The screenplay by Nigel Balchin was based on the novel Warrant for X, original UK title The Nursemaid Who Disappeared by Philip MacDonald. The film focuses on Philip Hannon (Van Johnson), a blind playwright who overhears a partial conversation he believes is related to the planning of a kidnapping. When the authorities fail to take action because they believe his story is the product of a writer's fertile imagination, Hannon searches for the child with the help of his butler and ex-fiancée, using his acute sense of hearing to gather evidence and serve as guidance. The plot of the film bears some resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window of 1954, which also features a disabled protagonist witnessing a crime, which the police refuse to take seriously, therefore placing him in danger and culminating in a final standoff with the killer in the protagonist's darkened apartment. Plot synopsis Philip Hannon (Van Johnson) is a blind man who lives in a London flat with a spectacular view over the Thames river between Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Station, with his trusted butler Bob Matthews (Cecil Parker); he works as a playwright. One day, he overhears part of a conversation in his local pub that possibly involves a plot to commit a crime. He tries to contact Inspector Grovening (Maurice Denham) who offers no help, so he teams up with his butler and his ex-fiancée, Jean (Vera Miles), who is over from America, to bring the kidnappers to justice. Their sleuthing soon leads them to a nanny agency with dire repercussions. Cast * Van Johnson as Phillip Hannon * Vera Miles as Jean Lennox * Cecil Parker as Bob Matthews * Patricia Laffan as Miss Alice MacDonald * Maurice Denham as Inspector Grovening * Isobel Elsom as Lady Syrett * Estelle Winwood as Barmaid * Liam Redmond as Mr. Murch * Martin Benson as Pillings * Natalie Norwick as Janet Murch * Terence De Marney as Sergeant Luce Reception In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther observed, \\"a large part of this picture is curiously casual and slow, as Van Johnson, as the blind man, bores the mischief out of everybody with his hazy suspicions...for that matter, he bores the audience, too. Lots of unimpressed fellows were ho-humming in the balcony at Loew's State yesterday...matters do start popping about half or two-thirds of the way along, when it is finally discovered, through various coincidences, that something has been cooking all the time. But you have to depend on Mr. Johnson — and Nigel Balchin, the screenwriter — to give you the details after they've been discovered. This is not a good way to get people interested in a mystery show...it would be a more exciting picture if it got going with a little more snap, established a more compelling mystery and built up some genuine suspense.\\"The New York Times review See also * List of American films of 1956 References External links   Category:1956 films Category:1950s crime thriller films Category:1950s mystery thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about blind people Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on thriller novels Category:Films set in London Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films directed by Henry Hathaway ","title":"23 Paces to Baker Street"},{"id":"13912561","text":"Eli Baruch Shulman (born October 1959) is a Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University's affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) and a lecturer at its Yeshiva Program/Mazer School of Talmudic Studies (MYP), where he holds the Rabbi Henry H.

He grew up in the town of Everett, Washington. Eckhardt was first exposed to the homebrewing of beer by his father, who produced his own low quality beverage during the years of Prohibition in the United States. Eckhardt never developed a taste for his father's brew, however, recalling many decades later that it and the other home-made beers of the Great Depression years \\"earned an honest reputation as abysmal.\\" Nevertheless, this aspect of his early life would later prove to be formative when he himself became interested in the brewing art in the late 1960s. =Brewer and writer= Eckhardt experimented with beer brewing starting in 1968, when he began modifying the recipe of a Vancouver, British Columbia brew shop owner and refining his technique. Eckhardt's positive interaction with a Portland, Oregon brew shop owner on the topic of homebrewing lead Eckhardt to the publication of his first beer book in 1969, A Treatise on Lager Beers.

The increase in American production for domestic consumption and export has been, in part, affected by the lower cost of rice compared with Japan; but other more difficult-to-analyze factors are important. At present, sake homebrewing is not allowed under Japanese law. Eckhardt foresees that his book, which spells out how homebrewing might reinvigorate sake consumption in Japan.

The name \\"Chester\\" is derived from the original name of the street, which was renamed Massachusetts Avenue on March 1, 1894.The City Record and Boston News-Letter: Mass Ave History Chester Park is also located in the historic South End of Boston. History The square was first constructed in the mid-19th century to attract affluent residents. The park was once the largest garden square in the South End. It originally included a very large white, three tiered fountain with a seating area and numerous trees, flowers, and other gardens. It fell into decline shortly after the start of the 20th century for a number of reasons. As a result, wealthy residents moved to neighborhoods like Back Bay which were highly regarded, and many of the South End's rowhouses were subdivided into rentals which attracted less affluent residents. The grand Victorian townhouses were gradually divided up and converted into smaller units, public buildings, and rooming houses. The park suffered its most devastating change in the 1950s when City and State officials decided to run Massachusetts Avenue directly through the park, dividing the square in half. =Present day= Chester Square has since seen a significant turnaround since the late 1990s, as part of the overall economic and real estate boom that has been impacting the South End of Boston. While there are no current plans to rejoin the two garden squares to make them whole again, upcoming plans include a complete makeover of the park complete with two new fountains, as part of the State's plans to redesign Massachusetts Avenue from Symphony Hall to Albany Street and the I-93 Connector.

Today it consists of two broad earth banks separated by a ditch, originally almost six metres deep surrounding an enclosure of almost half a hectare. Its defences are so well preserved that until the mid-1970s archaeologists believed the site to be either a Roman fort or mediaeval farmstead. However excavations in the early 1980s provided evidence that it was inhabited between the 100 BC and 200 AD by local Celtic farmers. Radiocarbon dating has provided evidence that the site was definitely occupied around 60 BC.Gifford, John (1996) The Buildings of Scotland: Dumfries and Galloway, Penguin The name Rispain may derive from a local equivalent of the Old Welsh word rhwospen meaning 'the chief of the cultivated country', a name certainly appropriate to as prestigious a farm as this. Excavation revealed traces of a timber gateway to the north east, which would probably have been connected to a timber stockade running along the top of the inner rampart. There was also evidence of large timber roundhouses inside the enclosure, one of which is thirteen and a half metres in diameter. In the ditch's south eastern corner excavation uncovered a square pit, possibly a cistern.

Sacabambaspis lived in shallow waters on the continental margins of Gondwana. It is the best known arandaspid with many specimens. It is related to Arandaspis.  Description  Reconstruction of Sacabambaspis Sacabambaspis was approximately in length. The body shape of Sacabambaspis vaguely resembled that of a tadpole with an oversized head, flat body, wriggling tail, and lack of fins. It had characteristic, frontally positioned eyes, like car head lamps.Janvier, Philippe (1997) Arandaspida The Tree of Life Web Project. = Armor = Sacabambaspis had a head shield made from a large upper (dorsal) plate that rose to a slight ridge in the midline, and a deep curved lower (ventral) plate, this headshield is ornamented with characteristic oak-leaf shaped or tear-drop shaped tubercles. Also it had narrow branchial plates which link these two along the sides, and cover the gill area. The eyes were far forward and between them are possibly two small nostrils and they, which are surrounded by what is thought to be endoskeletal bone, and putative nostrils, are found at the extreme anterior of the head, one of the diagnostic features of the arandaspids. The rest of the body was covered by long, strap- like scales behind the head shield. = Tail = The tail consists of relatively large dorsal and ventral webs and an elongated notochordal lobe, the posterior end of which is bordered by a small fin web. This tail structure clearly differs from that of heterostracans, which are currently grouped with arandaspids and astraspids in the clade Pteraspidomorphi (Gagnier 1993, 1995; Donoghue & Smith 2001; Sansom et al. 2005), in which the caudal fin looks diphycercal (i.e. symmetrical) and strengthened by a few large radials (Janvier 1996).  Discovery and species  Specimens of Sacabambaspis at Musee d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. Genus named after the village of Sacabamba, Cochabamba Department, Bolivia, where the first examples were found. * S. janvieri (Gagnier, Blieck & Rodrico, 1986), the type species, is known from Anzaldo Formation, Bolivia. There are 30 known specimens of this Bolivian species, all crammed into a very confined area, believed to be the result of a fish kill, probably due a sudden inflow of freshwater from a large storm. They were found associated with a large number of lingulid brachiopods, also killed at the same time. * S. sp. (Young, 1997), is known from the Stokes Siltstone and Carmichael Sandstone, Central Australia. Isolated scales found in the Horn Creek Siltstone from Central Australia have a very similar ornamentation to the Bolivian scales. * S. sp. (Albanesi & Astini, 2002), is known from Argentina. * S. sp.( Sansom et al., 2009), is known from Amdeh Formation, Oman, Arabian Peninsula. The Oman discoveries showed that the fish were present all around the margins of the ancient continent of Gondwana and not just in the southern regions as had previously been shown by the findings from South America and Australia.  Paleobiology  Life restoration of Sacabambaspis = Feeding = Although it had no jaws, the mouth of Sacabambaspis janvieri was lined with nearly 60 rows of small bony oral plates which were probably movable in order to provide more efficient suction-action through expansion and contraction of the oral cavity and pharynx. = Sensory system = The fossils of Sacabambaspis show clear evidence of a sensory structure (lateral line system). This is a line of pores within each of which are open nerve endings that can detect slight movements in the water, produced for example by predators. The arrangement of these organs in regular lines allows the fish to detect the direction and distance from which a disturbance in the water is coming.

The concept of \\"just the right amount\\" is easily understood and applied to a wide range of disciplines, including developmental psychology, biology, astronomy, economics and engineering. Applications An animation used to study the Goldilocks effect in visual attention of infantsThe goldilocks principle frequently appears in machine learning. The goldilocks learning rate is the learning rate that takes the fewest possible steps to achieve minimal loss. *In cognitive science and developmental psychology, the Goldilocks effect or principle refers to an infant's preference to attend to events that are neither too simple nor too complex according to their current representation of the world. This effect was observed in infants, who are less likely to look away from a visual sequence when the current event is moderately probable, as measured by an idealized learning model. *In astrobiology, the Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star. As Stephen Hawking put it, \\"like Goldilocks, the development of intelligent life requires that planetary temperatures be 'just right.S Hawking, The Grand Design (London 2011) p. 194 The Rare Earth Hypothesis uses the Goldilocks principle in the argument that a planet must be neither too far away from nor too close to a star and galactic center to support life, while either extreme would result in a planet incapable of supporting life. Such a planet is colloquially called a \\"Goldilocks Planet\\". Paul Davies has argued for the extension of the principle to cover the selection of our universe from a (postulated) multiverse: \\"observers arise only in those universes where, like Goldilocks's porridge, things are by accident 'just right. *In medicine, it can refer to a drug that can hold both antagonist (inhibitory) and agonist (excitatory) properties. For example, the antipsychotic Aripiprazole causes not only antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors in areas such as the mesolimbic area of the brain (which show increased dopamine activity in psychosis) but also agonism of dopamine receptors in areas of dopamine hypoactivity, such as the mesocortical area. *In economics, a Goldilocks economy sustains moderate economic growth and low inflation, which allows a market-friendly monetary policy. A Goldilocks market occurs when the price of commodities sits between a bear market and a bull market. Goldilocks pricing is a marketing strategy that, although not directly related to the Goldilocks principle, uses product differentiation to offer three versions of a product to corner different parts of the market: a high-end version, a middle version, and a low-end version. *In business, the Goldilocks Principle describes for what quantities one should create or sell products. It states that one should always create/sell a product in at least large, medium, and small sizes. This will cover the widest range of people who want the product. *In marketing, the Goldilocks Effect/Principle/Theory is to offer versions of a product at high, mid and low prices with the aim of encouraging the buyer to purchase the mid-priced product rather than a cheaper product. *In software development, the Goldilocks Principle describes how many features one should include into the software product. It states that one should always create a product with a slimmed down set of features, a medium set of features, and one with a maximum set of features. This will cover the widest range of people who want and use the product. *In communication, the Goldilocks principle describes the amount, type, and detail of communication necessary in a system to maximize effectiveness while minimizing redundancy and excessive scope on the \\"too much\\" side and avoiding incomplete or inaccurate communication on the \\"too little\\" side. *In mathematics, the \\"Goldilocks Zone\\" is often used to refer to the near horizontal \\"shelf area\\" of many third-degree – and higher – polynomials such as ƒ(x)=x³. It is sometimes strictly defined as the area between which the slope of the first- order derivative does not exceed ±15° from the horizontal although less popular definitions based on rates of change are sometimes used. *In statistics, the \\"Goldilocks Fit\\" references a linear regression model that represents the perfect flexibility to reduce the error caused by the bias and variance. *In design sprint, the \\"Goldilocks Quality\\" means to create a prototype with just enough quality to evoke honest reactions from customers.

Its Founding CEO is Sasha Havlicek.  Approach  ISD's CEO Sasha Havlicek speaking at the Global Summit on Homegrown Violent Extremism ISD's approach is to counter extremism and the ideologies that underpin it in ways that are practical, affordable, effective, and scalable. ISD operates through five interconnected pillars of work: * Research & Insight: ISD research combines in-depth analysis of audience, networks and content to accurately interpret the threat of violent extremism online and offline. ISD research has been consistently ahead of the curve, predicting developments in extremism and informing responses to emerging challenges. It has helped to reveal previously unseen challenges, enabling us and others to design effective and forward thinking programmes. * Communication & technology: ISD works on the application of data, technology and marketing tactics to mount proportional responses to extremist messaging. ISD leads major programmes with Facebook, Google and Microsoft. * Education: ISD’s innovative global education programmes and resources build the resilience of young people to extremism through the development of vital skills, from critical thinking to social and emotional learning. ISD research has shown that education plays a critical role in undermining extremist ideologies and support for extremist groups, disrupting their activities at the roots. * Grassroots networks: Extremism is a global phenomenon that is ill served by top-down approaches. Isd works to empower and facilitate independent, grassroots networks to take the lead at the front lines, applying their local expertise and credibility in a way that delivers impact at scale. * Policy & advisory: ISD provides strategic advice to over 15 governments and 100 cities worldwide, allowing us to facilitate the exchange of best practice between policy-makers and practitioners to coordinate counter-extremism programmes. ISD also provides high-level strategic advice to the tech sector to harmonise efforts with governments and civil society. Programme of work ISD runs a wide ranging programme of work on extremism which ranges from traditional research papers through to the facilitation of practitioners networks and the development of counter narrative tools. Their work ranges from work on Islamist extremism through to work on the Far Right and even integration Major programmes include: * Against Violent Extremism (AVE) network: a global network of former extremists, survivors of violence and interested individuals from the public and private sectors - working together to counter all forms of violent extremism. * Youth Civil Activism Network (YouthCAN): the leading global youth network of counter-extremism activists, YouthCAN provides marketing and digital tools to spur the creation of counter-narrative content for the Millennial generation. * Online Civil Courage Initiative (OCCI): builds on ISD’s existing partnership with Facebook to develop new understanding and responses to the challenge of hate speech and violent extremism on social media. * Extreme Dialogue: a multi-media education resource for teachers and social workers centred on compelling films of ‘formers and survivors’ of extremism. * One to One: an innovative engagement initiative that facilitates interventions between former extremists and young people who show serious extremist tendencies. * Strong Cities Network (SCN): the first ever global network of municipal-level policy makers and practitioners united in building social cohesion and community resilience to counter violent extremism in all its forms. * Policy Planners’ Network: ISD manages the PPN, a European inter-governmental network of policy chiefs from integration and interior ministries created to systematise cross-border exchange and develop upgraded, coordinated responses to the dual challenges of integration and extremism. In delivering their projects ISD partners with governments and leaders of the technology sector such as Google. ISD also chairs the EU’s Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) working group on the internet and social media. = Strong Cities Network = Launch of the Strong Cities Network in 2015 Launched at the United Nations in September 2015, the Strong Cities Network (SCN) is the first ever global network of mayors, municipal-level policy makers and practitioners united in building social cohesion and community resilience to counter violent extremism in all its forms. Led by ISD and comprising more than 100 cities, the SCN builds collaboration between mayors, political actors and frontline teams to tackle polarisation, hate and violence in local communities in every major global region. The network catalyses, inspires and multiplies community-centered approaches and action to counter violent extremism through peer learning and expert training.

Biography =During the war= Forwood attended Crozier Academy in Chester, Pennsylvania, earned his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and was appointed as an Assistant Surgeon on August 5, 1861. He was assigned to Seminary Hospital in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., where he served initially as the hospital’s executive officer, then as regimental surgeon of the 14th U.S. Infantry, and then acting medical director of General Sykes’ division, V Corps, Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula campaign. He took part in the battles of Yorktown, Williamsburg, Gaines Mill and Malvern Hill before he was reassigned to the office of the Medical Director, Washington, D.C. in October 1862. In February 1863, Forwood was assigned to the 6th U.S. Cavalry as an assistant surgeon. On May 13, 1863, Forwood was accompanying acting regimental commander George Henry Cram and two enlisted orderlies from General Buford’s headquarters back to their camp when they were captured by a band of Mosby’s guerillas. The group’s leader, Lieutenant Fairchild, after securing their horses and equipment, offered to release them if they would give their parole. Cram and the two soldiers did so and were released. Since medical officers on both sides had the right to be released without parole if captured, Forwood refused. Fairchild refused to release him without it, and turned him over to a guard detail as a prisoner of war. Forwood escaped into the brush while being marched away and returned to the regiment later that evening. This was quite an embarrassing incident for Captain Cram, and might be the reason Forwood spent the rest of the month on detached service at the Cavalry Corps’ dismount camp near Dumfries, Virginia. He returned to the regiment before the battle of Brandy Station. During the Gettysburg campaign, Forwood was captured again. He was left in charge of the regiment’s wounded following the battle of Fairfield, among whose numbers was the other assistant surgeon, William H. Notson. This time he was released without incident, however, and rejoined his regiment for the remainder of the campaign. On October 11, 1863, the 6th U.S. Cavalry was caught in an exposed position near Brandy Station and engaged by superior numbers of Confederate cavalry. They were able to fight their way back across the Rappahannock, but Forwood received a severe gunshot wound to the chest, ending his field service during the war. Following his recovery from this wound, Forwood was assigned as the executive officer of Satterlee General Hospital in Philadelphia and served there until April 1864. He spent the next two months in charge of the medical stores ship Marcy C. Day in Hampton Roads. In June 1864, Forwood organized and built Whitehall General Hospital near Bristol, Pennsylvania. He commanded the two thousand bed hospital through the end of the war, until September 1865. On March 13, 1865 he was given brevet promotions of captain and major for faithful and meritorious service during the war. =After the war= Forwood was next assigned to Fort Riley, where he served until June 1867. He was promoted to captain on July 28, 1866, and fought a severe epidemic of cholera there later in the year. His service at Fort Riley was punctuated by several field expeditions of the 2nd Cavalry against hostile Indians along the upper Arkansas River. Forwood was transferred to Fort Larned in June 1867, where he served until July 1870, apparently keeping a wolf and a buffalo as pets. The post commander ordered him to get rid of the buffalo, terming it a \\"public nuisance.\\" On January 31, 1869, the post adjutant informed Forwood that \\"complaints have also been made of the howling of the wolf at night. It is therefore directed that you have the animal removed to someplace where it will not be an annoyance to the garrison.\\" It is unknown what Forwood’s response was to this directive, but apparently he complied. He was assigned to Fort Brady until October 1872, but a good part of this period was spent on a leave of absence studying yellow fever at a quarantine station near Philadelphia. He was also married during this leave, to Mary Osbourne on September 28, 1870. He was then assigned to Fort Richardson, Texas until September 1876. The next three years brought brief assignments to Raleigh, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, and Fort McPherson, Georgia. In December 1879, Forwood was transferred to Fort Omaha as the post surgeon. During the next three years, he served as a surgeon and naturalist for the annual military reconnaissance and exploring expeditions ordered by General Philip Sheridan. In November 1882 he was assigned to Chicago as the attending surgeon for the headquarters of the Division of the Missouri. He again accompanied the exploring expedition in the summer of 1883, this time in the company of President Chester A. Arthur and Secretary of War Robert T. Lincoln. He published his observations from these expeditions in 1881 and 1882. He remained at Chicago until December 1886. Following another leave of absence, he then served for three years as the post surgeon for Fort Snelling. On May 27, 1890, Forwood was assigned as an attending surgeon at the United States Soldiers’ Home in Washington, D.C., where he remained until December 12, 1898. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on June 15, 1891, and was appointed the professor of military surgery when the Army Medical School was organized in 1893. From 1895 to 1897 he chaired the departments of surgery and surgical pathology at Georgetown University. On May 3, 1897, he was promoted to colonel, ranking only behind the Surgeon General in the Medical Corps. He chaired the department of military surgery at the same university from 1897 to 1898 and received and honorary degree of LL.D. for his contributions. Forwood departed the university in the summer of 1898 to establish a large hospital and convalescent camp at Montauk, New York to deal with the huge numbers of sick soldiers returning from Cuba. He selected the site and oversaw the construction of a similar facility at Savannah, Georgia later in the same year. In December 1898 he was transferred to San Francisco, California as the chief surgeon of the Department of California. In 1901 he was assigned to duty in the office of the Surgeon General in Washington, and that fall was made president of the faculty of the Army Medical School. When Surgeon General Sternberg retired, Forwood was promoted to the post on June 8, 1902. He served as the Surgeon General for his last three months before compulsory retirement for age on September 7, 1902. He lived the rest of his life in Washington, dying after a prolonged illness on May 12, 1915. Forwood and his wife are buried in Section 1 of Arlington National Cemetery.

It is commonly known as the great willowherb, great hairy willowherb or hairy willowherb. Local names include codlins-and-cream, apple-pie and cherry-pie. Close-up of the flowers Description It is a tall, perennial plant, reaching up to 2 metres in height. The robust stems are profusely hairy with soft spreading hairs.Martin, W. Keble 1965. The New Concise British Flora in Colour; with nomenclature edited and revised by Douglas H. Kent and foreword by The Duke of Edinburgh. London: Book Club Associates by arrangement with Ebury Press/ Michael Joseph (1982) The hairy leaves are 2–12 cm long and 0.5–3.5 cm wide. They are long and thin and are widest below the middle. They have sharply toothed edges and no stalk. The large flowers have four notched petals. These are purple-pink and are usually 10–16 mm long. The stigma is white and has four lobes. The sepals are green. Distribution The native range of the species includes North Africa, most of Europe up to southern Sweden, and parts of Asia. It is absent from much of Scandinavia and north-west Scotland. It has been introduced to North America and Australia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats without dense tree-cover up to 2,500 metres above sea-level. Common habitats include marshland, ditches and the banks of rivers and streams. It flowers from June to September, with a peak in July and August. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome. A number of insects feed on the leaves including the elephant hawkmoth, Deilephila elpenor.

Depending on various factors, such as proximity to a tower, any obstructions such as buildings or trees, etc. this signal strength will vary. Most mobile devices use a set of bars of increasing height to display the approximate strength of this received signal to the mobile phone user. Traditionally five bars are used. (see five by five) Generally, a strong mobile phone signal is more likely in an urban area, though these areas can also have some \\"dead zones\\", where no reception can be obtained. Cellular signals are designed to be resistant to multipath reception, which is most likely to be caused by the blocking of a direct signal path by large buildings, such as high-rise towers. By contrast, many rural or sparsely inhabited areas lack any signal or have very weak fringe reception; many mobile phone providers are attempting to set up towers in those areas most likely to be occupied by users, such as along major highways. Even some national parks and other popular tourist destinations away from urban areas now have cell phone reception, though location of radio towers within these areas is normally prohibited or strictly regulated, and is often difficult to arrange. In areas where signal reception would normally be strong, other factors can have an effect on reception or may cause complete failure (see RF interference). From inside a building with thick walls or of mostly metal construction (or with dense rebar in concrete), signal attenuation may prevent a mobile phone from being used. Underground areas, such as tunnels and subway stations, will lack reception unless they are wired for cell signals. There may also be gaps where the service contours of the individual base stations (Cell towers) of the mobile provider (and/or its roaming partners) do not completely overlap. In addition, the weather may affect the strength of a signal, due to the changes in radio propagation caused by clouds (particularly tall and dense thunderclouds which cause signal reflection), precipitation, and temperature inversions. This phenomenon, which is also common in other VHF radio bands including FM broadcasting, may also cause other anomalies, such as a person in San Diego \\"roaming\\" on a Mexican tower from just over the border in Tijuana, or someone in Detroit \\"roaming\\" on a Canadian tower located within sight across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario. These events may cause the user to be billed for \\"international\\" usage despite being in their own country, though mobile phone companies can program their billing systems to re-rate these as domestic usage when it occurs on a foreign cell site that is known to frequently cause such issues for their customers. The volume of network traffic can also cause calls to be blocked or dropped due to a disaster or other mass call event which overloads the number of available radio channels in an area, or the number of telephone circuits connecting to and from the general public switched telephone network.  Dead zones  Areas where mobile phones cannot transmit to a nearby mobile site, base station, or repeater are known as dead zones. In these areas, the mobile phone is said to be in a state of outage. Dead zones are usually areas where mobile phone service is not available because the signal between the handset and mobile site antennas is blocked or severely reduced, usually by hilly terrain, dense foliage, or physical distance. A number of factors can create dead zones, which may exist even in locations in which a wireless carrier offers coverage, due to limitations in cellular network architecture (the locations of antennas), limited network density, interference with other mobile sites, and topography. Since cell phones rely on radio waves, which travel through the air and are easily attenuated (particularly at higher frequencies), mobile phones may be unreliable at times. Like other radio transmissions, mobile phone calls can be interrupted by large buildings, terrain, trees, or other objects between the phone and the nearest base. Cellular network providers work continually to improve and upgrade their networks in order to minimize dropped calls, access failures, and dead zones (which they call \\"coverage holes\\" or \\"no-service areas\\"). For mobile virtual network operators, the network quality depends entirely on the host network for the particular handset in question. Some MVNOs use more than one host, which may even have different technologies (for example, different Tracfone handsets uses either CDMA and 1xRTT on Verizon Wireless, or GSM and UMTS on AT&T; Mobility) or GSM and UMTS on T-Mobile US. Dead zones can be filled-in with microcells, while picocells can handle even smaller areas without causing interference to the larger network. Personal microcells, such as those for a home, are called femtocells, and generally have the range of a cordless phone, but may not be usable for an MVNO phone. A similar system can be set up to perform inmate call capture,https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/docs/summits/Combating-Contraband- Cell-Phones-in-Prison-Handout-v4.pdf which prevents cellphones smuggled into a prison from being used. These still complete calls to or from pre-authorized users such as prison staff, while not violating laws against jamming. These systems must be carefully designed so as to avoid capturing calls from outside the prison, which would in effect create a dead zone for any passersby outside. In the event of a disaster causing temporary dead zones, a cell on wheels may be brought in until the local telecom infrastructure can be restored. These portable units are also used where large gatherings are expected, in order to handle the extra load. Dropped calls A dropped call is a common term used and expressed by wireless mobile phone call subscribers when a call is abruptly cut-off (disconnected) during midconversation. This happens less often today than it would have in the early 1990s. The termination occurs unexpected and is influenced by a number of different reasons such as \\"Dead Zones.\\" In technical circles, it is called an abnormal release. One reason for a call to be \\"dropped\\" is if the mobile phone subscriber travels outside the coverage area—the cellular network radio tower(s). After a telephone connection between two subscribers has been completed, it must remain within range of that subscribers network provider or that connection will lost (dropped). Not all cellular telephone radio towers are owned by the same telephone company (though this is not true to all locations) be maintained across a different company's network (as calls cannot be re-routed over the traditional phone network while in progress), also resulting in the termination of the call once a signal cannot be maintained between the phone and the original network. Another common reason is when a phone is taken into an area where wireless communication is unavailable, interrupted, interfered with, or jammed. From the network's perspective, this is the same as the mobile moving out of the coverage area. Occasionally, calls are dropped upon handoff between cells within the same provider's network. This may be due to an imbalance of traffic between the two cell sites' areas of coverage. If the new cell site is at capacity, it cannot accept the additional traffic of the call trying to \\"hand in.\\" It may also be due to the network configuration not being set up properly, such that one cell site is not \\"aware\\" of the cell to which the phone is trying to handoff. If the phone cannot find an alternative cell to which to move that can take over the call, the call is lost. Co-channel and adjacent-channel interference can also be responsible for dropped calls in a wireless network. Neighbouring cells with the same frequencies interfere with each other, deteriorating the quality of service and producing dropped calls. Transmission problems are also a common cause of dropped calls. Another problem may be a faulty transceiver inside the base station. Calls can also be dropped if a mobile phone at the other end of the call loses battery power and stops transmitting abruptly. Sunspots and solar flares are rarely blamed for causing interference leading to dropped calls, as it would take a major geomagnetic storm to cause such a disruption (except for satellite phones). Experiencing too many dropped calls is one of the most common customer complaints received by wireless service providers. They have attempted to address the complaint in various ways, including expansion of their home network coverage, increased cell capacity, and offering refunds for individual dropped calls. Various signal booster systems are manufactured to reduce problems due to dropped calls and dead zones. Many options, such as wireless units and antennas, are intended to aid in strengthening weak signals. ASU Arbitrary Strength Unit (ASU) is an integer value proportional to the received signal strength measured by the mobile phone. It is possible to calculate the real signal strength measured in dBm (and thereby power in Watts) by a formula. However, there are different formulas for 2G, 3G and 4G networks. In GSM networks, ASU maps to RSSI (received signal strength indicator, see TS 27.007 sub clause 8.5). :dBm = 2 × ASU - 113, ASU in the range of 0.31 and 99 (for not known or not detectable). In UMTS networks, ASU maps to RSCP level (received signal code power, see TS 27.007 sub clause 8.69 and TS 25.133 sub clause 9.1.1.3). :dBm = ASU - 115, ASU in the range of 0.90 and 255 (for not known or not detectable). In LTE networks, ASU maps to RSRP (reference signal received power, see TS 36.133, sub-clause 9.1.4). The valid range of ASU is from 0 to 97. For the range 1 to 96, ASU maps to :(ASU - 143) < dBm ≤ (ASU - 140). The value of 0 maps to RSRP below -140 dBm and the value of 97 maps to RSRP above -44 dBm. On Android devices however, the original GSM formula may prevail for UMTS. Tools like Network Signal Info can directly show the signal strength (in dBm), as well as the underlying ASU. ASU shouldn't be confused with \\"Active Set Update\\". The Active Set Update is a signalling message used in handover procedures of UMTS and CDMA mobile telephony standards. On Android phones, the acronym ASU has nothing to do with Active Set Update. It has not been declared precisely by Google developers.

A census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, recorded a population of 78 Jews.Barron, 1923, p. 41 During the end of the British mandate, the kibbutz was the staging ground for Palmach operations: Night of the Bridges and the bombing of the Yarmuk Bridge (16–17 June 1946). After the 1947–1949 Palestine war, Ayelet HaShahar took over the land from the newly depopulated Palestinian village of Yarda.

He was also cast in more films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture than any other performer in American film industry. He was also credited as Frank Farnum. Life and career Farnum was born in 1878 in Boston, Massachusetts, and became a vaudeville actor at the age of twelve. He was featured in a number of theatrical and musical productions by the time he entered silent films near the age of 40. His Broadway credits include Keep It Clean (1929), Ziegfeld 9 O'clock Frolic (1921), Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic (1921), and Somewhere Else (1913). Farnum's career was dominated mostly by westerns.

He left films in 1925 but returned five years later at the advent of sound, only to find himself billed much further down the credits, if billed at all. However, he continued on in these obscure roles well into the 1950s. One of his three wives was actress Alma Rubens, to whom he was briefly married in 1918. The couple divorced in 1919. He had one daughter, Martha Lillian Smith, who was born in 1898.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat with orders to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Unofficial acquisition of a stern- wheeled steamer  Bloomer—a stern-wheel steamer built in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana—was laid up at the outbreak of the Civil War in the Choctawhatchee River in Alabama, about a mile south of Geneva, Alabama, by her owner, a loyal Union man. On December 27, 1862, a joint expedition composed of officers and men of Potomac and troops of the 91st New York State Volunteers, led by Lieutenant James H. Stewart took possession of her and delivered her to the Pensacola Navy Yard where she was repaired and armed. A small crew was placed on board and, on January 24, 1863, Acting Ensign Edwin Crissey assumed command. The ship was put in operation without being sent to an admiralty court to be libelled.  Civil War service  = Destruction of 380 salt works and the town of St. Andrews = Although she spent most of her naval career operating in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, her most notable service occurred in December 1863 during a brief tour of duty with the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. This operation in St. Andrew's Bay, Florida—in which she was assisted by her tender, the sloop Caroline, and the bark Restless—resulted in the destruction of 380 different salt works and of much of the town of St. Andrew's. Her commanding officer received high praise for Bloomer's part in the successful accomplishment of this mission. = Official acquisition by the Union Navy = Near the very end of 1863, Bloomer was at last ordered to the prize court of New Orleans, Louisiana, to be libelled. The final decree in the case, rendered on January 4, 1865, declared this was not a case of \\"prize\\" but of \\"salvage\\". Early in 1865, she was finally purchased by the United States Navy and continued on duty on the coast of Florida in the vicinity of Pensacola, Florida.  Sinking, raising, and sale into commercial service  In June 1865 she sank in East Pass, Santa Rosa Island, Florida. After the wreck was raised, it was sold on September 22, 1865 to S. P. Griffin & Co., of Woolsey, Florida. Redocumented as Emma on April 5, 1866, the vessel served a private owner until 1868 when she was sold to a foreign purchaser and disappeared from American shipping records. The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies of the War of the Rebellion (ORN) lists the Bloomer both as a sidewheeler and, later, as a sternwheeler One of the persons from Geneva who assisted in the raid was a pilot named Jones, who is not otherwise identified; however, records of the ORN show that a Thomas G. Jones was, at one time, in command of the Bloomer, after she was captured—perhaps in reward for his services.

Many year 6 students will do this project to teach them about responsibilities. \\" Fine won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She is one of seven writers with two such honors (no one has won three), having won the 1986 Medal for Goggle- Eyes. The earlier book uses a day school frame to recount a story of family life. Little, Brown published the first U.S. edition in 1994. The teachers were renamed and the students were moved from \\"class 4C\\" to \\"Room 8\\" for the American audience. Some libraries report the title Flour babies and the boys of Room 8. Synopsis The story centres around Simon Martin, a pupil in class 4C at an unnamed school. 4C is the class reserved for the school's worst students. As it so happens, a new student has arrived at the school, and, by sheer coincidence, his name is Martin Simon. The two boys are the complete antithesis of each other – Martin Simon passed all his science exams with flying colours, reads voraciously and even speaks and reads French fluently. The class teacher, Mr. Cartright, sends the boy to Dr. Feltham's class, and Simon, who had been sent there by accident, soon arrives. The class are choosing their options for their contribution to the school Science Fair. They wish they could work on one of the most exciting experiments – The Exploding Custard Tins, Soap Factory, or Maggot Farm, for example – but these have been reserved for those who passed their science exams. As a result, 4C have ended up having to choose between a series of boring experiments. First they have to choose a topic – their options are consumer studies, textiles, child development, nutrition, and domestic economy. Simon Martin is given the task of pulling a voting slip out of a tub; Martin Simon's slip comes out, and the topic he has chosen is \\"child development\\". The experiment which Dr. Feltham (an eccentric science teacher who organises the fair) has chosen for child development is 'Flour Babies'. Each boy is given a six-pound bag of flour, in rags to form the look of a baby, and he must care for it at all times, as if it were a real baby. They must also write a diary explaining how they cope with this responsibility. Needless to say, the boys are not happy with this experiment, and neither is their teacher. But Simon misunderstands a conversation he overhears between Dr. Feltham and Mr. Cartright, and thinks that they will get to kick the flour babies to bits at the end. Mr. Cartright decides to pick another topic, but Simon has already mistakenly informed the class about kicking the babies to bits; they like the idea and press gang him into letting them do the experiment. Simon becomes fond of his flour baby, while the others complain. Simon reflects on his own childhood: his Dad left home when Simon was just six weeks old, and never came back. His relationship with his mother has always been precarious, and Simon now begins to learn about the pressures of parenthood.

In 1975, Simonini had his best season, leading the team in tackles, and A&M; finished 10-2, good enough for 11th in the AP poll. Simonini was also a finalist for the Lombardi Award his final season. Pro career In the 1976 draft, the Baltimore Colts selected Simonini in the third round, 81st player selected overall. Selected one pick behind him by the Cincinnati Bengals was Reggie Williams, who went to a long career in the NFL. 1977 would be Simonini's first full season as a starter. He was credited with one interception and three fumble recoveries. The following season, with the NFL now at a 16-game schedule, Simonini started all 16 games. He would not start every game again until 1980. He only appeared in one game for the Colts in 1981, and finished his career that season with the New Orleans Saints. Simonini led the Colts in tackles from 1977-1980.https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-am-aggies/2019/10/01/former- texas-am-american-lb-ed-simonini-dies-cancer-65/ Throughout his career, Simonini was considered too small to play linebacker in the NFL, even though one of the best linebackers in the NFL, Tom Jackson of the Denver Broncos, was at 5'11\\" an inch shorter than Simonini. Despite his ability, Simonini was in constant danger of losing his starter role to players bigger and taller. In 1979, Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda informed Simonini that he'd lost his starter role to rookie Barry Krauss. Krauss, a highly touted first-round draft pick, was overmatched, and Simonini quickly regained his starting job. In one of his most memorable games, Simonini made a key stop of New England Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan, sacking Grogan during a roll out, and then on the very next play knocking down a pass to seal the Colts' 31-26 win. In 1981, Simonini broke his collarbone and missed the majority of the season after he tried to return too soon and re-broke the collarbone. In 1981, with the Colts dealing most of their key veteran players, and in a total rebuild mode with new head coach Frank Kush, Simonini requested his release and finished his career in New Orleans.http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-sp-catching-up- simonini-20141023-story.html Though he finished his playing career, the Saints traded Simonini to the Miami Dolphins, but he retired before actually playing a down of football with the franchise.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1241&dat;=19830807&id;=225TAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=A4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3139,1166986&hl;=en Death Texas A&M; announced that Simonini died of cancer on September 30, 2019.

As auxiliary bishop of Miami he had the honorific Titular bishop of Masuccaba (1971–1975). Early life Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Gracida was the second child of Enrique J. Gracida Carrizosa, an architect and engineer of Mexican descent, and Mathilde Derbes, a fifth-generation French- AmericanBackground of Bishop René Gracida Cajun. His mother was a devout Catholic while his father was less so, despite fleeing Mexico due to religious persecution. His great uncle, however, was a vicar general of a diocese in Mexico, and was very strict. Due to his strictness, his father hated Catholic clergy and was rather upset when René Henry Gracida became a monk. As a teenager, René was fascinated with the Jesuit martyrs of The Last of the Mohicans. When he became an adult, he entered Benedictine monastery. He was required to chose a religious name that will be permanent. He chose René Goupil, a French Jesuit lay missionary, which was approved by the diocese. War and education He was a tail-gunner in the 303rd Hell's Angels in World War II. After the war he attended Rice University, the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, and the University of Houston, where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture. He later attended St. Vincent College and St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. At St. Vincent Seminary, he earned a Masters of Divinity. In 1978 he was granted a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) from St. Leo College and was also involved with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Career Gracida was ordained a priest on May 23, 1959, when he was 36 years old. In 1971 he was appointed by Pope Paul VI as Auxiliary Bishop of Miami and was consecrated on January 25, 1972 as titular bishop of Masuccaba by Cardinal John Francis Dearden of the Archdiocese of Detroit, Archbishop Coleman Carroll of the Archdiocese of Miami, and Bishop Paul Francis Tanner of the Diocese of St. Augustine. He was appointed bishop of the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee on October 1, 1975 and installed on November 6, 1975. On May 19, 1983 Pope John Paul II appointed him as the bishop of the Diocese of Corpus Christi, where he remained until his resignation at 73 In 1985 René Gracida had accused a Planned Parenthood clinic in Rhode Island for carrying abortions and in 1990 he accused Rachel Vargas and Dr. Eduardo Aquino of the same crime and banned them from entering the church. In 1994, Bishop Gracida issued the interdiction, forbidding a politician from receiving Communion., On September 25, 2017, Gracida posted on his blog and publicly signed a \\"Filial Correction\\" of Pope Francis, being the first canonically regular bishop of the Catholic Church to sign the document. In 2018, he called excommunication over immigration policy as \\"Scandalous\\".

It is often expressed as a sales ratio of primary to secondary units, or as secondary units sold as a percent of primary. The secondary good/service may be an integral component of the primary purchase (e.g., Bluetooth circuits/capabilities sold within electronic devices) or it may require a further consumer decision (e.g., as in video games sold per unit of the primary console sold). For the latter, the association between the primary and secondary may be general and loose (e.g., DVD-Video discs purchased per primary DVD player sold), or may be the result of product- specific designs (e.g., as with console-specific video games, or sales of phone-specific accessories per unit of a particular mobile phone sold). The attach rate concept is widely used as a means of reporting desirable sales associations/outcomes in the computer/video gaming industry, and in technology-related marketing in general. While complexities of real situations can obscure interpretation, attach rates often provide a metric for marketers of both primary and secondary products, allowing them to assess and even forecast the impact of the popularity of a given technology platform. Rapid sales of primary products create the market for the secondary product; conversely, the sale of platform-specific secondary products provides an indication of longer term demand for the primary platform. Real interpretive complications in technology include the general rapid evolution of both primary and secondary products, as well as factors such as changes to attach rates over a product's life cycle (e.g., because of the unrepresentative behavior of early adopters).

For those requiring secondary decisions, the association between the primary and secondary may be general (e.g., the loose association between sale of one or more brands of DVD-Video discs purchased per primary DVD player sale), or may be the result of product- specific designs (e.g., the foregoing video game–console tight association, similarly with phone-specific accessories for particular mobile phones). The attach rate concept is widely used as a means of reporting desirable sales associations/outcomes in the gaming industry, though it is common in many technology-related marketing discussions. For instance, in an example related to computer or game console software, a situation may occur wherein: * Platform hardware type A has sold 1,000 units, and software publishers have subsequently sold 5,000 titles specific to Platform A, and * Platform B has sold 10,000 hardware units, and software publishers have subsequently sold 10,000 titles specific to Platform B. In this example, Platform A has a much higher attach rate (5 titles sold per hardware unit sold, or 5:1), versus Platform B (1 title sold per hardware unit sold, or 1:1) Hence, while in absolute terms, Platform B is outselling Platform A (by a factor of 10:1), the much higher attach rate of Platform A (5:1, vs. 1:1) has business implications. In particular, software publishers may view Platform A as the more attractive, depending on the rate of sales of each platform, because that platform only needs to sell an additional 1,000 units for their title sales to match the sales related to Platform B. Interpretations =Marketing= While complexities of real situations can obscure interpretation, attach rates can provide a measure for marketers of both primary and secondary products, allowing them to assess and even forecast the impact of the popularity of a given product (e.g., of a given gaming or other technology platform). Rapid sales of primary products such as game consoles, personal computers, and cell phones create the market for a host of secondary products. Conversely, in cases where the secondary product purchase requires a further customer decision—i.e., ignoring integral examples like the Bluetooth case—the sale of platform-specific secondary products provides an indication of longer term demand for that primary platform, or related versions of that platform, to continue to support the secondary product. Real circumstances in technology and other business sectors complicate interpretation of attach rates. These complications include the rapid evolution of both primary and secondary products (e.g., the evolution of gaming platforms away from being single use devices, and of games from having only a single means of distribution). As well, factors such as changes in attach rates early in life cycle (when behavior of early adopters of technology is unrepresentative of the overall market) and late (when consumer behavior may have changed with regard to how they use the primary product) also make interpretation and forecasting of attach rates difficult. =Strategic= Attach rates for products can factor into the decision of a primary product manufacturer to merge with or acquire a secondary product manufacturer, and can impact the valuation of businesses in such times of times of mergers and acquisitions.

It was founded in October 1928 by three Australian missionaries, Hudson Southwell, Frank Davidson and Carey Tolley. In 1975 the BEM merged with Overseas Missionary Fellowship (formerly the China Inland Mission). History The Borneo Evangelical Mission (BEM) was pioneered by Hudson Southwell together with two fellow missionaries Frank Davidson and Carey Tolley of Australia. They boarded an old cargo steamer from Melbourne in early October 1928 bound for Singapore. Travelling with them was Alexander Henderson, a pioneer of the Southeast Asian timber trade who had offered to help establish a base on the island of Borneo. Henderson left the team the following year. On 12 November 1928, Southwell and Henderson landed in Kuching, Borneo. The Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, gave permission to establish a mission in Sarawak and recommended starting in the Limbang area to the north-east. Davidson and Tolley were to join them later. Sarawak, together with Sabah and the Federation of Malayan States came together and formed Malaysia in 1963. With the increasing use of the Malaysian national language, Borneo Evangelical Mission (BEM) soon became Sidang Injil Borneo (SIB). Today, SIB churches may be found in Sarawak, Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia.

Regulatory inspection results are published as either an inspection and compliance summary or, elsewhere, a grade or score is all that is published. UK scheme On 1 January 2005 the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations came into effect and local councils slowly began to publish the information on the Internet and via certificates. However, there was no uniform grading system and many councils chose their own schemes, thus making comparison difficult. On 10 December 2008 the Food Standards Agency (FSA) board decided to approve a 6-tier scheme called the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and a 2-tier (Pass/Improvement required) Food Hygiene Information Scheme (FHIS) for Scotland. From November 2013 it became compulsory for food businesses in Wales to display stickers, similar legislation came into force in Northern Ireland in October 2016. FSA is introducing legislation for compulsory display of stickers in England. The official UK government ratings website includes ratings for all UK regions and is mobile device friendly, although no app is provided. The FSA data is publicly available for download http://www.food.gov.uk/about-us/data-and- policies/app Other commercial websites and smartphone apps are also available, together with reporting and analysis software to enable businesses to performance manage their compliance and compare with their competitors. Australia In Australia, where national food safety standards are brought into force by state government statutes and enforced at the state or local level, the New South Wales Food Authority commenced a pilot program with local governments in 2010 utilising A, B and C letter grades. This was expanded to a trial in participating local government areas in 2011 utilising an equivalent system of star ratings (5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars) and an accompanying interpretive grade (Excellent, Very Good or Good) to reflect the degree of compliance with minimum food safety standards. In late 2013 the program was enhanced to encourage further take-up. Participation in the program is voluntary.

He became the first Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands Protectorate, serving from 1896 (three years after the establishment of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate) until 1915.Solomon Islands at Rulers.org Life before appointment Woodford was born in Gravesend, Kent, the first son of Henry Pack Woodford, a wine merchant. He went to study at Tonbridge school where the headmaster introduced him to the study of natural history. In the early 1880s, Woodford worked for a time for the colonial government in Fiji. He undertook three journeys to the Solomons as a naturalist,Austin Coates. Western Pacific Islands. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1970; 228. and learned several of the local languages. Between 1885 and 1886 he made three unsuccessful attempts to reach the centre of Guadalcanal from his base on nearby Bara Island, to collect specimens for the British Museum.Janet Kent. The Solomon Islands. Harrisburg: Stackpole Books, 1972; 105. Woodford noted the decadence of the society in the Solomon Islands following contact with labour recruiters. In his book A Naturalist Among the Head-Hunters, he noted that cannibalism and killing had become common, and deplored the lawlessness. He wrote \\"I know no place where firm and paternal government would sooner produce beneficial results than the Solomons...while I believe that the natives themselves would not be slow to recognise the advantages of increased security to life and property. Here is an object worthy indeed of the devotion of one's life.\\"Coates, 225–226. Britain declared a protectorate over the islands in 1893, but did not establish a government. The High Commissioner of the British Western Pacific Territories, Sir John Bates Thurston, paid a visit, reporting that there was no means of raising revenue, and that no settled government could be established. He suggested the establishment of a Resident Deputy Commissioner, to attempt to control the firearms trade. The Colonial Office replied that the Solomons must pay for themselves, without indicating how that might be possible.Coates, 226–227. Woodford knew that there might be a Resident Commissioner appointed for the islands, and was working as an assistant in the High Commissioner's office, figuring that would improve his chances of being appointed. Thurston was away when the Colonial Office refusal came, and was able to write that a small salary recently voted on in the High Commission, and an annual imperial grant of £600, with further revenue to be raised through traders' and recruiters' licenses, as well as commercial prospects.Coates, 228. Furthermore, he wrote that he himself had been appointed Deputy Commissioner, and was proceeding to the islands to report. Woodford then went to Sydney, holding the despatch, to convince Thurston to sign it. Thurston did not have a high opinion of Woodford, but was convinced, and in his last days became a major supporter of him. With the appointment signed, Woodford set off for the Solomons. From 30 May to 10 August 1896, HMS Pylades toured through the Solomon Islands with Woodford, who was investigating the economic feasibility of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. On 29 September 1896, in anticipation of the establishment of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, Woodford purchased the island of Tulagi, which he has selected as the site for the administrative centre. Resident Commissioner Woodford's report from his first trip as Commissioner in 1896, impressed the Colonial Office, and he was given a small amount of money and permitted to hold the position provisionally for a year, though it remained precarious. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the labour trade operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Woodford returned to the Solomons in 1897, with six Fijian policemen and a whaleboat, and about six pence in reserve funds.Coates, 228–229. With this, he founded the colonial capital of Tulagi, on a small island just off the south coast of Florida Island. He urged the crown to assume possession of all unclaimed land, thereby preventing large-scale land purchases, which aroused the Colonial Office's mistrust of big business, and gave him £1200 to build a Residency.Coates, 229. Woodford established the first mails from the islands which travelled by sealed bag to Sydney, New South Wales, and from there on to their destination.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Commonwealth and British Empire Stamps 1840-1970. 112th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2010, pp. 123-126. A smallpox epidemic at the Anglican Mission settlement of Siota, and the need to impose quarantine, enabled him to get an assistant. Arthur William Mahaffy was appointed at the Deputy Commissioner in January 1889. He was based in Gizo, his duties included suppressing head hunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands. Woodford seized the opportunity provided by the Anglo-German Samoa Convention, in which Germany ceded the North Solomon Islands to Britain, to stress the extension of the area of his responsibility and get another sailing vessel and more police. That year he also established an administrative headquarters for the Western territory, at Gizo.Coates, 230. Civil administration was set up along the lines of the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands, starting in the Florida Islands, which were divided into five small districts, each under a chief responsible to Woodford. This political arrangement was welcomed by the Anglican Mission there.Coates, 231. Woodford's resources were still limited, however, and for major assistance he had to rely on ships sent by the Royal Navy. In 1910, when three missionaries were killed on Rennell Island, his only possibility was to close the island to outsiders, and when a murder was committed on Malaita, he had to appeal for to be sent to make a punitive raid.Kent, 112–113. Much of the interest in capital investment that Woodford sought was diverted to Banaba Island, when its rich phosphate discovered in 1900. However, Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore, who Woodford had been able to interest in commercial investment in the Solomons, persevered with his plans, buying German landholdings and trying to amass enough capital for large-scale coconut agriculture. In 1905 that land was sold to Lever's Pacific Plantations, and the rent it provided for the protectorate enabled the government to expand further.Coates, 231–232. Woodford, worried that the Melanesians were a dying race, supported a plan to import labourers from India, which was refused by the India Office.Kent, 111. The development of local plantations coincided with the end of the labour trade in Queensland, and the difficulties caused by the repatriation of the workers under the White Australia policy was predicted by Woodford.Coates, 233. Woodford left the islands in January 1914, and by that time the islands were largely pacified, and head-hunting had nearly died out. New Georgia and Malaita remained troubled areas, but a district office on the latter, at Auki, was established in 1909. However, after he left, much of his progress was undone. He retired from public life, and the protectorate government never regained the initiative that it had during his control. In the King's Birthday Honours list of 14 June 1912 Woodford was made an Ordinary Member of the Third Class, of the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Legacy Several animals in the Solomons, including Mynes woodfordi, Corvus woodfordi, Pteropus woodfordi, Nesoclopeus woodfordi, and a genus of birds, Woodfordia, were named after Woodford. He is also commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards: Lepidodactylus woodfordi and Sphenomorphus woodfordi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

This includes parabolic antennas and lens-type reflective antennas of all kinds. The effect is analogous to the circle of confusion in photography. In a perfect lens or parabolic reflector, rays parallel to the device's axis striking the lens or reflector all pass through a single point, the focal point. In an imperfectly constructed lens or reflector, rays passing through different parts of the element do not converge to a single point but have different focal points. The set of these focal points forms a region called the focal cloud. The diameter of the focal cloud determines the maximum resolution of the optical system. Lens-reflector artifacts, geometry and other imperfections determine the actual diameter of the focal cloud.  Satellite dish effects  A focal cloud can render a satellite dish rather inefficient in relation to its size in specific frequencies. If the imperfections are formed in a way that the phase shifts of reflected waves, at a large portion of the dish, are near 180 degrees between them and the feed horn, this results in self-cancellation of the specific frequency. For countering the effect, there are several techniques, either in construction of the reflectors or lenses, or in the way signal beams are concentrated. In satellite antennas, scalar rings are used to push the spread signal into the feed horn. Satellite- based dish antennas may be deformed intentionally to distribute radiated power over a desired \\"footprint,\\" typically shaped like a continent. Tidal action tends to move a satellite in a figure-8 pattern.

Map of the Falkland Islands Falkland Islands English is mainly British in character. However, as a result of the isolation of the islands, the small population has developed and retains its own accent/dialect, which persists despite many immigrants from the United Kingdom in recent years. In rural areas (i.e. anywhere outside Stanley), known as ‘Camp’ (from Spanish campo or ‘countryside’), Stay with us » Camping: Falkland Islands Tourist Board the Falkland accent tends to be stronger. The dialect has resemblances to Australian, New Zealand, West Country and Norfolk dialects of English, as well as Lowland Scots. Two notable Falkland Island terms are ‘kelper’ meaning a Falkland Islander, from the kelp surrounding the islands (sometimes used pejoratively in Argentina)‘Second Class Citizens: The Argentine View of the Falkland Islanders’, P.J. Pepper, Falkland Islands Newsletter, November 1992 and ‘smoko’, for a smoking break (as in Australia and New Zealand). The word ‘yomp’ was used by the British armed forces during the Falklands War but is passing out of usage. In recent years, a substantial Saint Helenian population has arrived, mainly to do low-paid work, and they too have a distinct form of English.  Settlement history  The Falkland Islands, a cluster of 780 islands off the eastern coast of Argentina, had no indigenous population when the British arrived to explore the islands in 1690. Continuous settlement dates only to 1833, when British forces removed 26 Argentinian soldiers from the islands and claimed the islands for the British. In 1845, the Capital city of Stanley, located on East Falkland, was established. Argentina also has a claim to the islands, and in 1982, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands. The British moved to defend the British control of the Islands, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher calling the Islanders \\"of British tradition and stock\\". In under three months, nearly a thousand people were killed, and over 2,000 were injured. British-Argentinian tension regarding claim to the Islands still exists, but as over 98% of Islanders voted to remain under British sovereignty in the last election, the identity of the island overall is overwhelmingly British. This history has implications for the linguistic features of Falkland Islands English, which is similar to British English but distinct in some vocabulary and phonology.  Phonetics and phonology  English in the Falklands is non-rhotic. This is consistent with other varieties of English in the southern hemisphere. One major difference between the English of the Falklands and other Englishes of the southern hemisphere is the onset centralization of /ai/, in which nice is pronounced /nəɪs/. Vocabulary The Falklands English vernacular has a fair number of borrowed Spanish words (often modified or corrupted). These include colloquialisms such as ‘che’, also encountered in Rioplatense Spanish from Argentina, and ‘poocha’ equivalent to ‘wow’.Are there places more British than the UK?, BBC News, 8 March 2013 or ‘damn’,Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary: Spanish-English/English-Spanish (from pucha, a euphemism for puta or ‘whore’).El gaucho Martín Fierro, José Hernández Editorial Pampa, 1963, page 247 They are particularly numerous, indeed dominant in the local horse-related terminology. For instance, the Islanders use ‘alizan’, ‘colorao’, ‘negro’, ‘blanco’, ‘gotiao’, ‘picasso’, ‘sarco’, ‘rabincana’ etc. for certain horse colours and looks, or ‘bosal’, ‘cabresta’, ‘bastos’, ‘cinch’, ‘conjinilla’, ‘meletas’, ‘tientas’, ‘manares’ etc. for various items of horse gear.Spruce, Joan. Corrals and Gauchos: Some of the people and places involved in the cattle industry. Falklands Conservation Publication. Bangor: Peregrine Publishing, 1992. 48 pp. Unlike the older English, French and Spanish place names given by mariners, which refer mainly to islands, rocks, bays, coves, and capes (points), the post-1833 Spanish names usually identify inland geographical locations and features, reflecting the new practical necessity for orientation, land delimitation and management in the cattle and sheep farming. Among the typical such names or descriptive and generic parts of names are ‘Rincon Grande’, ‘Ceritos’, ‘Campito’, ‘Cantera’, ‘Terra Motas’, ‘Malo River’, ‘Brasse Mar’, ‘Dos Lomas’, ‘Torcida Point’, ‘Pioja Point’, ‘Estancia’, ‘Oroqueta’, ‘Piedra Sola’, ‘Laguna Seco’, ‘Manada’, etc. External links *South Atlantic Ocean: Falkland Island English References English Category:British English Category:English dialects Category:Languages of the United Kingdom ","title":"Falkland Islands English"},{"id":"13914157","text":"Lennoxamine is an isoindolobenzazepine alkaloid, originally isolated from the Chilean barberry, Berberis darwinii.

(1999). Japans Kaiserhof in der Edo-Zeit, p. 146. His courtesy title was Shimōsa-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, later raised to Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. He was the 8th hereditary chieftain of the Manabe clan. Biography Akikatsu was born at the Sabae Domain's Edo residence as the fifth son of Manabe Akihiro. He became daimyō on the death of his uncle Manabe Akisane in 1814. Under Shōgun Tokugawa Ieharu he served in a variety of positions in the Tokugawa shogunate, including Sōshaban, Jisha-bugyō, Osaka jōdai, Kyoto Shoshidai and became rōjū in 1840. However, due to political disagreements with Mizuno Tadakuni, he was forced from office in 1843. In 1858, he was restored to the post of rōjū by the Tairō Ii Naosuke, and quickly was seen as Ii's right-hand man, taking a leading role in difficult situations, such as the Ansei Purge, the ratification of the Ansei Treaties, and the opposition to Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu from becoming shōgun. In particular, his heavy-handed approach to forcing Emperor Kōmei to accept the ratification of the Harris Treaty and his suppression of pro-Sonnō jōi samurai in Kyoto drew the wrath of Yoshida Shōin in particular, who made many inflammatory speeches and writings urging Manabe's assassination. After the assassination of Ii Naosuke and accession of Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu as Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, Akikatsu quickly fell from favour. He was dismissed as rōjū and forced to retire as daimyō in 1862. Furthermore, Sabae Domain was reduced in kokudaka by 10,000 koku. Akikatsu remained under house arrest to 1865. He was placed under house arrest again by the new Meiji government for suspicion of collaboration with Aizu Domain from 1868–1869. He died in 1884 and his grave is at the temple of Hokekyō-ji in Ichikawa, Chiba. Family His wife was a daughter of Matsudaira Yasutō of Hamada Domain, and his son and heir was Manabe Akizane. He had several other children, including Ōkōchi Nobuhisa (daimyō of Yoshida Domain), Ōkōchi Masatada (daimyō of Ōtaki Domain), and Manabe Akimichi, the final daimyō of Sabae Domain.

Life Robert Dean Frisbie was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 17, 1896, the son of Arthur Grazly Frisbie and Florence Benson. As a young man, he left his parental home to serve in the U.S. Army during World War I. After discharge from the military, doctors told him that his health was so bad that he would not survive another American winter. So, in 1920, he decided to explore the islands of the South Pacific Ocean. He arrived at his first destination, Tahiti, in that year, settled down to lead a life as a plantation owner in Papeete, and began to write about his travels. He also established the South Seas News and Pictorial Syndicate and began sending stories back to the U.S. for publication. In later voyages through Polynesia (spanning his entire lifetime), he regularly visited the Cook Islands, Samoa and French Polynesia. In writing down his observations of life in the Pacific, Frisbie followed the footsteps of other famous 19th century South Sea writers. One of his major influences was Robert Louis Stevenson.Interview by the Dutch writer Boudewijn Büch with Johnny Frisbie (13-05-1992). He was also well informed of the work of fellow travel writers in his time, with whom he kept in touch. = Life on Puka–Puka = In Tahiti, Frisbie (dubbed: \\"Ropati,\\" a phonetic approximation of \\"Robert\\" [en: Writer]) met Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, well-known co-authors of the Mutiny on the Bounty series. This encouraged Frisbie to write his first complete narrative, which marked the starting point of his career. The Book of Puka Puka, published in 1929 by The Century Company, related the tale of his eternal search for solitude on the far-flung Northern Cook atoll of Pukapuka. Frisbie writes that life on Pukapuka(...) \\"a barrier reef threaded with islets and sand cays; Danger Island, or Puka–Puka — Land of Little Hills. So it was called by the first Polynesians who came here, centuries ago.\\" (Chapter 1; Robert Dean Frisbie; My Tahiti; Doubleday; 1937) enabled him to escape \\"the faintest echo from the noisy clamour of the civilised world.\\" On Pukapuka Frisbie met 16-year-old Ngatokorua (Also known as Inangaro which, when translated, means \\"Desire\\"). They were married in 1928 on Penrhyn, Northern Cook Islands.Blauwzee; Boudewijn Büch; Atlas, 1994 (Dutch) \\"Nga\\" became the mother of their five children: Charles, Florence, William, Elaine and Ngatokorua. In 1930 the family sailed back to Tahiti and Frisbie started working on his second novel, My Tahiti (Little Brown & Co., 1937) and worked on another book, A Child of Tahiti,Robert Dean Frisbie Society which was never published. =Hurricane at Suwarrow= In the 1940s, after the death of Frisbie's wife, the family visited the uninhabited Northern Cook atoll Suwarrow and lived there for almost a year. The celebrated story of their hurricane survival on a tiny motu (islet) was serialized by in the Atlantic Monthly as The Story of an Island: Marooned by Request in 1943 and later in the novel The Island of Desire.Fanny Vandegrift (the wife of Robert Louis Stevenson) describes the island Suwarrow in 'The Cruise of Janet Nichol' (1915) as \\"the most romantic islet in the world\\". Another notable character in Frisbie's life was Tom Neale.An Island to Oneself; Tom Neale; The Quality Book Club, 1966 A loner inspired by Frisbie's tales of isolation on Suwarrow, he also lived alone on the atoll on three occasions (1952-1954, 1960-1964 & 1967-1977). After he returned from his second visit in 1964, he wrote the book An Island to Myself (Doubleday, 1966), in which he credits Frisbie as his inspiration. The book was republished in Great Britain as An Island to Oneself (Collins, 1966). =Johnny Frisbie= Florence Frisbie (better known as Johnny) was born on June 19, 1932 in Papeete, Tahiti, the second child of Robert Dean and Ngatokorua Frisbie. As a youngster encouraged by her father to write, Johnny kept journals in three languages (including Pukapukan). At the age of 12 she began an autobiographical children's novel based on these journals, Miss Ulysses of Puka-Puka, which deals with her life on the atoll and her bond with her father and family. Miss Ulysses was published by Macmillan in 1948. After her father's death in 1948, Johnny wrote another biography of her family, The Frisbies of the South Seas (Doubleday, 1959). =Death= In 1943, diagnosed with tuberculosis, Frisbie was evacuated by then U.S. Navy Lieutenant James Michener to a hospital on American Samoa. His recovery was spotty, but he continued to travel, write and publish until his death at age 52, on November 18 (or 19), 1948, in Avatiu (Cook Islands), from an apparent tetanus infection.Grave of Robert Dean Frisbie He was survived by his five children, who were subsequently raised by friends and relatives in New Zealand and Hawaii. Work Robert Dean Frisbie produced a great number of sketches, articles and books that were printed by several publishers in America. His first article was Fei-hunting in Polynesia (1923, Forum). Frisbie's autobiographical travel stories are of enduring value, offering detailed and humorous descriptions of island life in Polynesia and especially the Cook Islands. He also wrote many news stories for various periodicals like Pacific Islands Monthly. His work is marked by a passionate search for solitude, his concern for the fate of island locals in the face of outside exploitation, and his desire to write the perfect American novel. His output is very impressive considering his personal hardships. =Bibliography= Published books by Robert Dean Frisbie: *The Book of Puka-Puka (A Lone Trader on a South Sea Atoll) (1929) *My Tahiti (1937) *Mr. Moonlight's Island (1939) *The Island of Desire (The Story of a South Sea Trader) (1944) *Amaru: A Romance of the South Seas (1945) *Dawn Sails North (1949) Articles by R.D.F: *Fei-Hunting in Polynesia (1924) *Palmleaf Gambling Hells (1925) *The Island of Women (1926) *Prize-Fighting in the Pacific (1926) *Armchair Yachting: A Droll Discourse on the Rather Comfortable Technique of Yachting in the Tropics (1927) *At Home in Puka-Puka (1928) *Business as Usual (1928) *Adventures in a Puka-Puka Library (1929) *Fishing With King-of-the-Sky (1929) *Fishing for Steak and Eggs (1929) *The Sea Afire (1929) *Mrs. Turtle Lays Her Eggs (1929) *Puka-Puka Neighbors (1929) *Magic Dances (1929) *A Kanaka Voyage (1930) *The Sex Taboo at Puka-Puka (1930) *The Ghost of Alexander Perks, A.B.

The Yuchi Town Site is an example of historic Native American cultures adopting various strategies to maintain their cultural integrity in the face of European colonization and the expansion of the United States. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996. History The site was initially an Apalachicola village, indicated by graves, aboriginal pottery, trade beads, and other items. This phase of occupation is believed to date from 1650-1715, a time when Spanish influence in the region was present. At this time the Spanish established a short-lived mission at the village of Sabacola and maintained a garrison of troops at the town of Apalachicola. The Apalachicola allied with the Spanish in Florida during the 17th century against the English in the Carolinas and were ultimately destroyed as a culture. The next phase of occupation was by the Yuchi and would continue until their removal to Indian Territory in 1836. The Yuchi constantly shifted their alliances with various European powers. They had occupied the Savannah River valley until they were defeated by the Cherokee in 1681, then the Ocmulgee River valley until 1716. After this they occupied the area surrounding the Chattahoochee River and this is when they founded Yuchi Town. It is the largest known historic village site associated with the Yuchi.

It had a population of 20 Muslim households who paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olives, goats and/or beehives; a total of 3,700 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 117. In 1838 it was noted as a Muslim village, located in the Beni Malik area, west of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 124Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 59 A 19th-century traveler visiting the town found the remains of ancient foundations, rock-cut cisterns and a tomb that was said to have contained treasures. Father P.M. Séjourné, revisiting the site, noticed the ruins of a large church: \\"The mosaic pavement of an important church located northeast of the village has disappeared, at least for the moment, under a watermelon field. The scattered spoils of the Christian building have enriched the neighbouring modern mosque and many hovels nearby. Fragments of a graceful frieze, capitals with Corinthian acanthus carved in white marble, columns and dressed stones lie unused along the roads.\\" Another researcher, Victor Guérin, saw two columns from the church inside the local mosque.Guérin, 1875, p. 397 Based on these finds, it was concluded that the village was once Christian, and had a large three-nave church. Bethoron - (Bayt Ur) An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Bet Ur et-Tatha had 35 houses and a population of 185, though it only counted the men.Socin, 1879, p. 148 It was also noted to be in the Beni Malik districtHartmann, 1883, p. 118 also noted 35 houses In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Beit 'Ur et Tahta as \\"A village of moderate size on a low ridge with wells to the west. In the middle of the village is the sacred place of Neby 'Or, with a palm tree in the courtyard: near it is a well in the street.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 17 =British Mandate period= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Beit Ur al- Tahta had a population of 470, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Ramallah, p. 16 while at the 1931 census, Beit 'Ur al-Tahta had 117 occupied houses and a population of 611, still all Muslim.Mills, 1932, p. 47.

It was annexed by Jordan in 1950. In 1961, the population was 1,198 persons.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 24 It was further noted (note 2) that it was governed by a mukhtar. =Post-1967= Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Ur al-Tahta has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census conducted by the Israeli authorities was of 920, of whom 60 originated from the Israeli territory. In the 1980s and 1990s, lands belonging to Beit Ur al-Tahta were confiscated by the Israeli government to build Highway 443 along the Pass of Bethoron. A petition challenging the move submitted to the Supreme Court of Israel in September 1983 was rejected by Justice Aharon Barak who ruled that under international law, a military government have the right to infringe private property if a number of conditions are fulfilled, stating that \\"The step is taken for the benefit of the local population\\". Highway 443 initially served as a main approach road linking the 25,000 inhabitants of six villages to each other's and to Ramallah. After the outbreak of the Second Intifada, the Israeli military prevented Palestinian use of the road and blocked some parts of it without a legal order, and the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier closed off access to the old road, which lengthened the journey. In 2007, the Israeli High Court of Justice ordered the state of Israel to explain why the road has been blocked for seven years without a legal order and why Palestinians are prevented from using it. After the 1995 accords, 36.7% of village land was classified as Area B land, and the remaining 63.3% as Area C. Israel has confiscated land from the village in order to construct the Israeli settlement of Beit Horon.Beit ‘Ur at Tahta Village Profile, ARIJ, pp. 16-17 In October 2009, infrastructure improvements were completed in Beit Ur al-Tahta that included improved roads and street lighting.

Kanso began his career in New York. His works deal with contemporary, historical and literary themes, and are marked by figurative imagery executed with spontaneous and vigorous handling of the paint and often done on large-scale formats. They reflect movement and tension embodying intense colors and symbolic forms addressing social, political, and war issues. The Vietnam War and the Lebanese Civil War have profoundly affected the development and scope of his themes dealing with violence and war. His long-running Split of Life series encompasses an extensive range of enormous paintings depicting scenes of human brutality and suffering.Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life: Paintings 1974-1994, NEV Editions, Atlanta, GA, 1996 Life and work Nabil Kanso grew up in a house adorned with Italian and Oriental art. In 1961, he went to England, and attended the London Polytechnic studying mathematics and science. In 1966, Kanso moved to New York, and enrolled at New York University where he received BA and MA in art history, philosophy and political science. 1968, he committed himself to painting, acquired a studio in Manhattan, and embarked on developing his ideas and method of painting. Kanso was part of the post-modernist movement, which enveloped music, fine art, film, and writing. Characteristics of this style is stressing \\"communication\\" from artist to audience, and throwing out the traditional narrative the \\"life has meaning\\". That Creed of Modernism fell apart after skepticism in mankind's inherent goodness came about after the Holocaust.What Is Post-Modernist Art? Postmodernist Art: Definition, Characteristics, History of Postmodernism Movements, Contemporary Installation/Video Art: Turner Prize. Encyclopedia of Art Education. Web. 13 Apr. 2012. =1970–1979= In 1971, Kanso held his first one-man show at the 76th Street Gallery exhibiting 80 paintings that included portraits and nudes in compositions reflecting in varying degrees expressionist, romanticist and symbolist influences.Art Gallery: Eye on New York: Kanso's Show at 76th Street, January 1972Brown, Gordon: Kanso at 76th Street, Arts Magazine, New York, February 1972 Between 1971 and 1973 he held a series of solo shows that included the Wanderer, Danse Macabre, Birds of Prey, Place des Martyres, and Expressions.Bowles, Jerry: Kanso's Paintings Artnews, New York, July 1972Brown, Gordon: Kanso's Expressions, Arts Magazine, New York, February 1973 Although the exhibitions drew attention and reviews, the lack of sufficient subsistence forced the closing of his studio whose contents including over 700 works Kanso, Nabil.

Web. 12 Apr. 2012 were placed in storage, and, eventually, lost or destroyed.The Split of Life, pp.11-12 Between 1974 and 1979, Kanso took studios in different locations in the Carolinas, Atlanta, and New Orleans producing a large number of paintings. Among the works of this period are the series Vietnam (1974), Lebanon, which he began in 1975, at the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, One-Minute (1978–79) on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Jazz suite (1978–79) on jazz music, and Faust (1976–79) comprising over 100 paintings on Goethe's drama.Nabil Kanso: Faust: Paintings 1976-1979, NEV Editions, 1997 =1980–2007= In 1980, Kanso established a studio in Atlanta and held several exhibitions.Fox, Catherine: Artist inspired by War-torn Homeland, The Atlanta Journal- Constitution, July 8, 1984, pp. H1–2Fox, Catherine: Fantastic Visions, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 19, 1985, p. H2 In 1984, he went to Venezuela where his works were shown in Maracaibo (1985), Caracas (1987), and Mérida (1987–88). The exhibitions were an invaluable stimulant in initiating the Journey of Art for Peace through which his works were shown under the auspices of art museums, cultural institutions, and peace centers in extensive solo exhibitions that traveled internationally and particularly in Latin America.Spanish articles in Kanso displays his works by covering the entire walls of the exhibition space with his paintings.Kanso calls them \\"the moving murals\\", The Split of Life, p.11 The installation surrounding the viewer aims to convey the intensity between the reality of the subject matter and the actuality of painting, and reflect the artist's engagement with the canvases whose contents represent his visual life and relationship to conflicting Eastern and Western cultures and traditions.Kurlansky, Gail: Nabil Kanso's Split of Life Paintings: Looking for the Poet: Power, Death, and Sexuality, Art Papers, November/December 1986, pp.23–26 Among the works of this period are the series South Africa (1980), Apocalyptic Riders (1980), DreamVision (1980–81), Lebanon (1982–83), Apocalypse (1984), Warring Wings (1984–85), Othello (1985), the Cluster Paintings (1986–88), Leaves from the Theatre of War (1980s), The Dance of Salome (1988), America 500 Years (1989–91), Kuwait 1990–91, Living Memory (1993–94), Bosnia (1995–96), Portraits (1997–99), Iraq (2004–06). =Lebanese Civil War and Kanso= In 1958, Nabil Kanso had to stop going to school in Lebanon due to the civil war. In his biography, he talks about how he spent much of his time at the houses of friends and families doing sketches and painting to pass the day. The Lebanese Civil War gave a lot for young Kanso to paint about.Erminy, Peran, The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso, El Nacional, p.2, April 26, 1987, Caracas His painting The Vortices of Wrath (Lebanon 1977) is a perfect depiction of the country in a time of war. The dark grays and black make for a gloomy, sad mood. In the center, it appears as though there is a power struggle between rugged figures. There is one power trying to over come the other. The way kanso uses blurry images gives a creepy feel. While in the back ground it appears as though there are skeleton like figures. His brush strokes are very apparent and give the painting its life even though it is all about death. It is clear that Kanso drew from the time of the war by the way he make the paintings so solemn. The Lebanese Civil war was not the only influence in Kanso's work but also the wars in Vietnam and the continuing war in the Middle East. We can clearly see this in his paintings Desert Storm. Here he shows women suffering by losing a child becoming victims of war. \\"The victims,\\" an art critic writes, \\"are the newborn torn out of wombs or clinging to mothers fleeing natural catastrophes or political disasters.\\"Seaberg, Ronnog: Nabil Kanso: Life Work , Vår Lősen, pp.371-381, 1997, Stockholm, Sweden It is noted by some critics that motherhood is important with Kanso's women; you see mothers at the moment of birth and in death holding children in their arms. The bars that recur from one work to another are sometimes placed at the opening of the woman's womb. The children suffer with their mothers as fire, storms, or ice intensifies the human situation. People of different religions are united in suffering and passion in these works of art.Seaber, Ronnog, Life Work, Vår Lősen, p.380 The noted lack of greens in Kanso's art marks his criticism of destruction of the environment. Nothing can grow during war. Flesh and blood appears to be everywhere. Water is for drowning, or for freezing. Icicles look like hairy insect legs or barbed wire. The rarely discerned sky sometimes reveals a glimpse of the forefathers like pale blue ghosts look down at their descendants.Seaberg, Ronnog: Life work, p.380 War has a major influence in his work and has made his work become almost biblical and it's represented in his paintings dealing with war and apocalyptic themes, and the ApocalypseErminy, The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso, p.2 He uses apocalyptic science in his art work making them almost biblical by painting his work with earthquakes, floods, ice, fire and blood referring this to the bible's apocalypse. Nabil Kanso's apocalyptic themes can be said to be linking with the destruction of the Middle East due to war, to the destruction of the birthplace of Jesus and Christianity. =War and apocalyptic themes= War and apocalyptic themes are central focus of Kanso's works since the early seventies. They provide the primary basis for his large-scale paintings responding to war and depicting apocalyptic visionsNabil Kanso: The Split of Life, pp. 11-13, Nev Editions, 1996 \\"Over the course of his career,\\" an art critic writes, \\"Kanso created an extraordinary body of work dealing with war and apocalyptic themes that open up the visions of apocalyptic art.\\"Erminy, Peran: the Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso, El Nacional, p. 3, April 26, 1987, Caracas In dealing with horrors of war,\\" another critic writes, \\"Kanso creates enormous paintings that serve as powerful weapons in fighting war.\\"Fuenmayor, Carlos: Space Cry, Time Cry, Columna, pp. 8-9, May 21, 1987, Maracaibo \\"Kanso declares war on war,\\" reads a headline article on his Gulf War exhibition in Kuwait.Huwaidi, Sayed: Kanso Declares War on War, Al-Watan, April 23, 1982, Kuwait The paintings show the whole gamut of human suffering and pain. The tortured language itself makes his work a universal manifestation of solidarity and protest against the proliferation of war.Fuenmayor, Space Cries, p. 8 The canvases reveal a world permeated by a chain of chaos and violence in a hellish environment from which people are desperately trying to escape in order to survive.Erminy, Peran: the Apocalyptic Paintings, El Nacional, p. 3. They find themselves immersed in an incisive and violent totality in which they are trapped.Guevera, Luis: Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture, Exhibition Catalog, pp.5-6, Ateneo, 1987, Caracas The emotionally steering images draw the interest and involvement of the public in witnessing the violent events in scenes filled with pathos and tensions that reach extreme intensity.Erminy, The Apocalyptic Paintings, pp. 3-4 The depicted horror, one critic notes, present a form of interiority as for example in the interior of Afghanistan, Lebanon, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Vietnam. A total war, a pure war, one in which destruction is rallied to the absolute in conjunction with the corporeal and everything \\"else\\" is relegated to the status of target or cipher, a demarcation of the site of a bullet, bomb, or rocket. Hell is nothing but what it is.Sondheim: The Split of Life Paintings, Nexus, Atlanta, 1985 His paintings transmit images of the palpable reality of a world where pain, suffering, brutality, and destruction are everywhere.Rossi, Ildebrando: Expressions: A Protest Against War, Panorama, p.3, April 14, 1985, Maracaibo \\"They provide,\\" a critics notes \\"a powerful indictment and denunciation of wars in the Middle East and Central America. Hence the mural-scale format enveloping an enormous space in projecting harrowing images as a consequence of war.\\"Rossi: Expressions, Panorama, p.3Rossi, I: The Art of Nabil Kanso, Panorama, April 14, 1985, Maracaibo The reality of what is happening in a war zone and what is expressed in the painting underlines the relationship of the artist's mental and physical involvement with the work.Peran: The Apocalyptic Paintings, p.4 He expresses a juncture between his supercharged psyche and our anxiety and fear, provoking the explosion we see and feel in his paintings.Erminy: the Apocalyptic Paintings, p.4 \\"The intensity of the portrayed scenes heightens the atmosphere of fear and oppression\\", one critic remarks, \\"and awakens us or at least gives our dream an authentic vision of the final disaster.\\"Guevara, Luis: Between Horrors, p.12 They open a window through which we contemplate and ponder on our precarious existence, beginning with the most intransigent and total fact of contemporary fear: total extinction. \\"They reveal, the never-ending darkness existing in an ephemeral glare right before bursting. The power of weapons is a terrible and absurd reality which mutates the space of human warmth.\\"Guevara, Luis: Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture, pp.5-6 \\"The very idea of the possible destruction of the planet by nuclear war has totally changed our view of the world,\\" observed Octavio Paz.Jimenez, Maritza: Nabil Kanso Apocalypse, El Universal, April 30, 1987, Caracas \\"Meanwhile,\\" a critic notes, \\"the world debates on perpetual small wars undermining the planet with ongoing disasters. The destruction and devastation of war are shown to us in the images of Nabil Kanso who Venezuelans came to know him as the Painter of the Apocalypse.\\"Jimenez, Maritza: Nabil Kanso Paintings of the Apocalypse Herald a Reality of Universal Dimensions, El Nacional, p.1, August 25, 1987, Caracas He faithfully expresses orphanage, rage and the importance of living.Guevera: Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture, pp. 5-6 \\"His mural paintings,\\" a critic observed, \\"stand as a tribunal in interpreting and transmitting the voices that burst out of the canvases in a massive force, and plunge into an apocalyptic storm.\\"Fuenmayor: Time Cries, p. 9 =Kanso's style= Nabil Kanso's works have been said to be apocalyptic in many ways, in Kanso's works he paints scenes of destruction, destroyed buildings, and people usually naked with looks of horror on their faces. He uses red, orange, and yellow to resemble fire, dark colors as if he was painting a nightmare or a scene of hell. In carrying out his work Nabil Kanso appears calm and quiet. But the light of fire in the paintings look like nightmares which he has to work through, often spending several months on one painting.Bäckström, Lars: Nabil Kanso's Lebanon: Guernica of Our Time Ord & Bild, pp.42-45, January 1986, Stockholm, Sweden Kanso's outstanding mural-scale paintings are a cross between the specificity of Goya's 'Horror of War' and the universality of Picasso's Guernica. To stand in the central space surrounded by Nabil Kanso's 12-foot-high paintings is as close as you get to being in the middle of a fire. Using lurid oranges, yellows and reds, Kanso fills every inch of canvas with visions of violence and human suffering that rival medieval descriptions of Hell.Fox, Catherine: Fantastic Visions, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 19, 1985, p. H2 One painting went the entire length of the room, maybe 30 feet. I felt like a coward. It was almost impossible to look at the power and extravagance of these scenes, so I turned instead and looked at the faces of the other onlookers. In their faces were the reflections of the painted holocaust around us. I turned again to the painting which now entrapped is in a cage of feeling.Seaberg, Steve. An Artist Response Art Papers, p.51, November, 1985, Atlanta It is noted by some critics that \\"Kanso's highly expressive personal style evokes experiences and visions that reveal the inner essence of a reality lying beyond its external aspects\\".Erminy, Kanso's apocalyptics paintings, p.3 A view of a troubled world is portrayed in compositions whose imageries carry the art towards issues of human concern.Erminy, Apocalyptic Paintings, p.3 They record intense, harrowing images of haunting themes voicing universal expressions on human brutality and suffering. In the opinion of some art critics \\"Kanso strong colors and powerful brushstrokes blend with the subject matter: world chaos.\\"Figueroa, Hugo: The Paintings of Nabil Kanso, Panorama, p. 8, April 28, 1985, Maracaibo It is further noted that the battle against large formats cannot be won but with a strong determination and an absolute mastery of technique. These are inseparable and preconceived. The dynamic handling of the pictorial layout has a total identification with Kanso's topical matter. His powerful themes could in no way be handled with softer and milder style designed to make them palatable. By way of parallelism, Kanso's work is a harmony of style and subject matter.Figueroa: The Paintings of Nabil Kanso, p.8 =The Split of Life paintings= Main article The Split of Life The Split of life paintings comprise approximately 80 mural-size paintings executed between 1974 and 1994, and were the main focus of Kanso's work during the 15-year Lebanese Civil War that broke out in 1975Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life Paintings, NEV Editions, 1996 The works are characterized by the consistency and relatedness of their subjects and themes dealing with violence and war. In emphasizing the issues and bringing attention to the destruction, devastation, and suffering resulting from perpetual wars, Kanso took his paintings to various places in extensive exhibitions that traveled widely, particularly in Venezuela and Latin America. The exhibition of works related by subject and theme projected a sense of overall-ness, a sense of one painting running into another.Kurlansky, Gail: Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life: Looking for the Poet: Power, Death, and Sexuality, Art Papers, pp. 23-26, November, 1986 A reviewer of an exhibition in Maracaibo featuring works from 1976 to 1984, wrote \\"The synchrony and diachrony of the works cross a still point in which the show is no longer a total of 27 paintings, but only one.\\"Figueroa: The art of Kanso, Panorama, p. 4 A critic viewed the works linkage at an exhibition in Atlanta as \\"a net, a polyvalence of economic, cultural, political, and sexual discourse.\\"Kurlansky, The Split of Life, p. 24. The net is not just a formal manipulation to tie the divergent contents of the paintings together, but \\"a very real device that grew out of the complex discourse of the paintings and ultimately from the poetics of the painter.\\"Kurlansky: The Split of Life, Art Papers, p. 24. At a 10-year survey in Caracas a critic wrote \\"the installation of Kanso monumental paintings projects an immense space charged with a high level of intensity closely connected to the tension and anxiety that we face in the world today. His apocalyptic paintings offers us a voyage to the hells of our time.\\"Erminy, Peran: the Apocalyptic Paintings, El Nacional, p. 3, April 26, 1987, Caracas =Studios= right Early in 1967, Kanso set up a studio on East 20th Street at Gramercy Park South, and in 1968, moved to a larger studio on East 76th Street where it remained until 1974 when it was seized and its contents were placed in storage, and, eventually, lost.Fox, Catherine: Artist Inspired by War-Torn Homeland, Atlanta Journal/Constitution, pp. H1-3, July 8, 1984. For a period he worked in New York and in different cities in the South, and in 1980, he settled Atlanta where he acquired a spacious studio.Kanso, Nabil: Life-Task, Kanso Studio, August 2001, Atlanta For more than 20 years, the studio was an attractive place for many visitors. A critic described it as \\"filled with enormous paintings representing a kind of a nightmare about the war in Lebanon, which has been the subject of Kanso's large paintings since the war started in 1975.\\"Bäckström, Lars: Guernica of Our Time, Ord & Bild, pp. 42-45, January, 1986 Stockholm, Sweden It is not just the horrors of the war in Lebanon that he is painting, it is as much the disasters of war in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Rows of canvases are swarming with figures fleeing, fighting with each other, eating each other.\\"Bäckström, Lars: From Odessa to Atlanta, Democraten, p. 4, January 24, 1985, Uppsala, Sweden Another critic observed \\"canvasses rolled up in great numbers like mummies,\\" and noted the connection between the linen cloth in Egyptian wraps and Kanso's own life. His father founded a linen cloth business in Mexico.Seaberg, Ronnog: Nabil Kanso: Life Work, Vår Lősen, pp. 378-81, 1997, Stockholm, Sweden In describing a visit to his studio, an art critic wrote \\"walking around was like taking a tour of Dante's Inferno. With agitated brushstrokes and lurid oranges, Kanso has produced a roomful of frightening images reminiscent of late Goya's mural, all the more menacing because they are over 7 feet tall\\".Fox: War-Torn Homeland, Atlanta Journal, p. H5. A reviewer remarked \\"Startled is a weak word to describe my reaction. Every wall covered with paintings that reached the ceilings. In some places, the paintings were leaning against each other several deep. Others, lots, rolled up on the floor. It was hard to believe one man had done all of this. It wasn't just that the paintings were large but their content was brilliantly focused, it came from a seeming struggle going on in a landscape that appeared biblical.\\"Seaberg, An Artist Response, Art Papers, p. 51, November 1986 =Books= * The Split of Life: Paintings 1974-1994, NEV Editions, 1996, * Faust: Paintings 1976-1979, NEV Editions, 1997, * Othello 1985, NEV Editions, 1997, References External links *Official site *The Split of Life *Lebanon Paintings *Works for Peace *America series Category:Living people Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:Lebanese emigrants to the United States Category:American contemporary painters Category:Artists from New York City Category:Painters from New York (state) Category:American people of Lebanese descent Category:Druze people of Lebanese nationality Category:Artists from Beirut Category:Lebanese painters Category:Artists from Atlanta Category:Postmodern artists Category:Censorship in the arts Category:1946 births Category:New York University alumni Category:Druze people of American nationality Category:Lebanese artists ","title":"Nabil Kanso"},{"id":"13914379","text":"Aníbal Luis Paz Piuma (21 May 1917 – 21 March 2013) was an Uruguayan footballer who played as a goalkeeper for the Uruguay national team.

The first was military field music. This type of music included bugles, bagpipes, or fifes and almost always drums. This type of music was used to control troops on the battlefield as well as for entertainment. One example of controlling the troops was the drum beats setting the march cadence for the troops. Following the development of instruments such as the keyed trumpet or the saxhorn family of brass instruments, a second tradition of the all brass military band was formed.

Higher Mill was built in 1796 for William Turner, and Whitaker's Mill was built in the 1820s by the Turner family. In their early life they alternated between working wool and cotton. By 1920 they were working shoddy as condensor mule mills; and equipment has been preserved and is still used. The mills closed in 1967 and they were taken over by the Higher Mills Trust, whose trustees included historian and author Chris Aspin and politician Dr Rhodes Boyson, who maintained it as a museum. The mills are said to the most original and best-preserved examples of both cotton spinning and woollen fulling left in the country that are still operational. Following the withdrawal of its grant from Lancashire County Council, the museum closed to the public on 30 September 2016 for an indefinite period. However, the museum remained open for pre-booked school visits. In April 2018 the council announced that the museums would reopen to the general public for three days a week between April and November.  Location  Helmshore Mills lie within Helmshore, a village in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire. The village is south of Haslingden, broadly between the A56 and the B6235, approximately north of Manchester, and from the M65 motorway. Helmshore straddles the River Ogden, a tributary of the River Irwell. The village developed around the seven cotton and wool mills.  History  The Turner family had already been involved in textiles before the mills were built. Three of the six family members made their living from wool in Martholme, and three brothers from cotton in Blackburn. In February 1789, they paid £725 for land for a mill. The family built Higher Mill on a greenfield site in the parish of Musbury as a woollen fulling mill, but by 1792, three members of the family had dropped out of the enterprise. It was the son of one of these original six, a William Turner (1793–1852), who built the larger wool carding and spinning mill in the 1820s. The wool went to Middle Mill on Holcombe Road for weaving, then returned to Higher Mill for fulling and finishing. Turner instructed in his will that the mill should be sold on his death, which occurred in 1852. This mill was destroyed by fire in 1857, and was rebuilt in 1860 by Edward Turner. At some point after the end of the American Civil War and the return of cotton imports to Lancashire, the rebuilt mill started spinning cotton. When the mill was rebuilt, it was equipped almost but not completely by Messrs Walker & Hacking of Bury with machinery for processing raw cotton through to fine cotton spinning and (unlike in later years) weaving with power looms built by Dickenson of Blackburn. Due to later reconfigurations of the site, it is almost impossible now to see any evidence of this layout. In the 1920s, the mill was bought by L.Whitaker & Sons who installed cotton condensing equipment and the mill continued in that business until November 1978. Higher Mill came to be operated by Lawrence Whittaker in 1875 still using Turner's machinery, and his descendants continued to run it as a fulling mill until June 1967. The two families may have been distantly related, but by the 1920s the Whittakers were a well-known local family while the L. Whitaker & Sons group no longer had any Whitakers working for them and were owned and run by the Hardman family. The freehold of both mills in the Helmshore Mills Estate was bought by Lawrence Whittaker's family. =The Museum= When Rossall Whittaker died in 1971 leaving no male heirs, Higher Mill was saved by local enthusiasts who recognised its significance and had it scheduled as an Ancient monument, and bought it through a trust. Platt International, whose site was also in Helmshore, owned a significant collection of historic textile machines and agreed that they should be located in Higher Mill. The task of running a museum and maintaining the buildings put pressure on the trust, so in 1975 Lancashire County Council stepped in, taking a 99-year lease. Whitaker's Mill became vacant in 1978 and Lancashire County Council, seeing the advantages of having control of the two mills, bought the condensor mill. This allowed them to also purchase the Platt collection in 1985, keeping the site intact and forming a comprehensive museum of the Lancashire textile industry. The expertise, knowledge and experience of the site staff and Lancashire Museums Service is used by other sites including NT Quarry Bank Mill at Styal and the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester. Exhibits The museum divides its collections into three themed areas, representing the wool story, the cotton story and the spinning floor. The wool story shows the water wheel and fulling stocks and clay pots used to collect urine from the local cottages, which produced the ammonia needed for fulling. It goes on to show the later box system. There is a tenter frame, with the tenterhooks to show how the cloth was dried without shrinking and how teasels were used to lift up the nap. This was of course later mechanised and there is a teasel-holding frame known as the teasel raising gig. The cotton story illustrates firstly the hand weavers' cottage, with a frame loom with a hand-thrown shuttle; mannakins represent the weaver and two women spinning the yarn on different types of wheel. A child is shown hand-carding. It is here we see a 16-spindle spinning jenny that would have dated from about 1760, and a 50-spindle improved jenny. There is an original Arkwrights first carding machine. There is a complete sequence of machines that would have taken the bolls from the bales: opener, scutcher, breaker card, finisher card, draw frame and finally a complete Arkwright water frame dating from 1790. Sharing the floor at Whitaker's Mill is the equipment needed to prepare the waste cotton for the cards in the room above. There is a single cylinder picker for soft waste and a six cylinder devil for the hard waste. Spinning floor The spinning floor was one of two at this mill, and has all the equipment to breaker card the shoddy (recycled cotton) and to finisher card the slivers into rovings. These go onto the 714-spindle Taylor Lang spinning mules. Opening, scutching and mixing happened on the floor below. This is the only original and complete floor of its type left. Spun yarn is sent to sister museum Queen Street Mill on the outskirts of Burnley to be woven. Closure In November 2015 Lancashire County Council announced that it would withdraw funding from five of its museums: Fleetwood Museum, Helmshore Mills Textile Museum, Judges' Lodgings, Museum of Lancashire and Queen Street Mill because of what the leader of the council described as \\"the financial challenges facing the county council as we deal with relentless cuts to central government funding combined with rising demand for our services.\\" They were initially to close at the end of March 2016 but that month were reprieved until 30 September 2016. The museum closed on 30 September 2016, along with the other four Lancashire museums mentioned above, except for pre-booked school groups. Lancashire County Council's website stated that \\"Negotiations are underway to identify a new operator.\\" In April 2018 it was announced the museum would reopen on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from May 26 until 28 October 2018 and between Easter and the end of October 2019. The mills The whole site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument; Higher Mill is also a Grade II listed building. The associated chimney stack on the other side of Holcombe Road is also separately Grade II listed. Condenser spinning Fine spinning produced a lot of waste, so naturally this was recycled. This waste was the raw material of a condensor spinning mill. It came in three forms: loose staple, unspun rovings and spun thread (hard waste) that had been pirned but rejected. No matter its source, it had to be devilled (broken down) to staple, then scutched and carded in the normal way. After these processes the staple was very short, and the processing of the lap was different – a Derby Doubler was used to mix slivers into sliver lap. A notable feature of the mule was that the rovings were on a beam rather than on individual bobbins. As the fine spinning of cotton contracted, so did the need for condensing. Boilers and chimney Higher Mill and remote Whitaker Mill chimney When the steam engine was installed in Whitaker Mill, Lancashire boilers were ubiquitous. For maximum efficiency they required air to be drawn over the coals, and this was the function of the mill chimney. As these mills are set in a valley the airflow was irregular, so the chimney was built on the hill opposite and the flue passed over the river and underground to reach the chimney, providing the required updraught. The first boilers in Whitaker Mill were built by Hick Hargreaves of Bolton and were installed around 1855; at the 1868 auction the mill was equipped for fine cotton spinning with a number of power looms also on site. The later Lancashire boilers in Whitaker Mill, built by Yates and Thom of Blackburn, were taken out in the 1950s. The boiler for heating Higher Mill was of the Cornish type installed where the hub is now. Water Clean water was needed for processing the cloth. This was captured from field drainage on the hillside opposite and stored in a lodge on the farther side of the river, piped across when required. The water wheel, and later the engine condenser, could use the then highly polluted water from the River Ogden: a weir was placed 800m upstream and the water diverted into a long canal-like lodge that finished at the mill. Having passed over the pitch-back wheel, the water passed through a culverted tail goit back into the Ogden.

Early life Felix Alvarez was born at Old St. Bernard's Hospital, Gibraltar, to Felix and Laura Alvarez (née Parody). As a young boy, he attended St. Anne's Middle School in Gibraltar. Alvarez's family moved to London in 1959, living first near the Dalston/Hoxton area of the East End of London but spending the majority of his life in the South London areas of Clapham and Tulse Hill. Alvarez grew up bilingual in English and Spanish as do most Gibraltarians. Yet the experience of being \\"foreign\\" in 1960s London was not easy for him or his family. He has vivid memories of tobacconist notice boards full of accommodation \\"to let\\" signs saying \\"no coloureds or dogs\\". The experience of being different in an unaccepting society alerted him from an early age to the situation of the marginalised. As a teenager, Alvarez attended Wandsworth Comprehensive School, a progressive post-grammar school model, famous for its choir and close work with Benjamin Britten. It was during this period of his formative teenage years that, through personal contact, Alvarez joined Peter Hain in his Anti-Apartheid campaigns, work which he continued later at university as a young student in the early 1970s. LGBT rights =In London= Returning to London after 3 years in a northern university, Alvarez discovered the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), recently imported from the Stonewall riots of New York in the late 1960s. Becoming immediately involved in its activities, Alvarez was one of the founders of Britain's first Gay Community Centres, where pioneering work was undertaken to establish phone counselling, information and advice, and weekly community meetings to raise self-esteem and channel gay and lesbian anger towards change rather than towards self-damage. At this time, Felix Alvarez worked with the Lambeth Community Law Centre and the Brixton Housing Advice Centre in Railton Road. Alvarez went on to qualify in community and social work at Goldsmiths, University of London in 1978. Disillusioned with the downturn of fascist trends in London (with the rise of the British National Front), Alvarez took up the possibility of work in the Middle East, on what he considered to be an adventure, for 6 months. The adventure lasted 16 years, during which time Alvarez learnt Arabic and travelled the world. =In Gibraltar= In 1997, Alvarez returned to Gibraltar. One of his first undertakings on The Rock was to produce an in-depth study and MA thesis on bilingualism in the Gibraltar educational system from nursery schools all the way through to adult vocational training. This was entitled Primary Code and Private Space: Choice in the Host Classroom. A copy was deposited with the John Mackintosh Hall and has become a reference point for international researchers regarding the impact of bilingualism in a community. The research contained implications for Gibraltar's educational policies which, to date, have not been taken note of. Experiencing difficulties as a result of insurmountable bureaucracy and prejudice regarding his non-EU same-sex partner, Alvarez determined to start challenging discrimination of sexual minorities in Gibraltar. By this time Deputy Leader of a political party (the now defunct Independent Liberal Forum (ILF)), he persuaded his party to back him in the establishment of what was to be known as Gib Gay Rights (GGR). In a GBC television news broadcast on 4 September 2000, Alvarez announced that \\"the fear factor\\" was over as far as gay citizens were concerned. From then on, gay citizens would be demanding equal rights as full citizens of Gibraltar. As the work of the group expanded over the years, GGR has since become Gibraltar's foremost Human & Civil Rights organisation, and is currently known as Equality Rights Group (GGR). This is often abbreviated to ERG or ERG-GGR. Under his Chairmanship, ERG has achieved important changes in Gibraltarian society, prompting important debate on a range of social political issues, but in particular the following: * Connected Health: In a joint Report with drugs rehabilitation group Stay Clean, groundbreaking proposals for restructuring not only the institutions, but also the approach, policy and legislative frameworks for dealing with a long- standing drugs problem and increasing sexual health issues in Gibraltar. Alvarez has argued that the War on Drugs paradigm has merely fed the criminals and grown the problem of substance abuse. He argues for a regulatory framework instead, thereby advocating that currently illicit drugs (whether for recreational or medicinal use) be regulated and supplied by Government authorities and caring professionals. The evident connections between drugs and sexual health, while not always implied in co-morbidity, do interact within the paradigm necessary to destigmatise, humanise and give adequate responses to individuals. * Media: Gibraltar media outlets are few - but important to the public interest of Gibraltar's young democracy. The problem is that, being such a small marketplace, neither newspapers nor the State TV/radio stations in the territory can hope to survive economically without fundamental and substantial financial support from the Gibraltar Government. 'And that's a HUGE problem for Democracy!' says Alvarez. Advocating a re-think on the structuring of media outlets, Alvarez argues for a new scheme whereby outlets are guaranteed funding - yet are fully protected from political influence or interference 'so that the media workers themselves as well as the outlets can breathe freely and do the professional job they're supposed to of acting with independence not deference to those in power.' Alvarez recognises this to be one of the hardest nuts to crack - especially since advocating change in this respect faces a wall of resistance from the politicians and Political Parties, but also from the Managements of media outlets themselves. In a situation where media workers have no specific union representation (or may fear acknowledging it to their employers), the reality of the challenges do not escape Alvarez or those who work with him towards a freer Gibraltar. * Civil Society: The development of a Civil Society identity and awareness is one of the most fundamental and crucial tasks facing the Equality Rights Group, and a centrepiece of Alvarez's vision. 'Without an independent Civil Society, we're stuck and stagnant in our development,' adds Felix Alvarez. 'We can have a separate Judiciary, Legislature and Executive - but that's NOT the Rule of Law; a number of States have those three basic elements, yet Civil Society is intimidated - or worse still, locked up! Without a vital and vibrant Civil Society that knows the meaning of solidarity between its various elements, Democracy fails its potential. That's why we started the Independent Civil Society Awards event in 2013. It originated from our marking of International Day Against Homophobia each 17 May, and developed from there; so that now, IDAHO is part of the larger move towards solidarity with all of Civil Society in Gibraltar.' * An ongoing social education and awareness campaign through the media and political action which has seen a significant shift in public opinion in Gibraltar on issues affecting same-sex relations. So much so that neither silence nor taboo can any longer be said to describe the situation in Gibraltar on gay issues. * From a position where no politician or political party addressed gay rights, today the majority of politicians and political parties in Gibraltar have clear and positive pro-gay rights policies and stances. The ruling Gibraltar Social Democrats are now in a minority by not having clear pro policies. * The establishment of strong and important ties with organisations and high-profile politicians both at Westminster and Brussels * A campaign to pressure the Government of Gibraltar to introduce an EU directive introducing sexual orientation anti- discrimination provisions in employment law. In Gibraltar, this was introduced as the Equal Opportunities Act. * A campaign to equalise the gay age of consent. This having been successfully brought before British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Following a Declaration by the Supreme Court of Gibraltar as a result of the matter being contested by ERG, the Gibraltar Parliament equalised the age of consent for all at 16 in 2011. *A successful campaign to end discrimination against same-sex couples in the area of joint tenancy rights in Government housing. *Supported action leading to the obtainment of adoption rights for same-sex couples in Gibraltar. *Civil Partnership legislation: after 14 years of campaign, Alvarez finally succeeded in bringing civil partnership to Gibraltar when, on 21 March 2014, the Gibraltar Parliament approved the Civil Partnership Act 2014. In contrast to UK CP legislation, Gibraltar made the law applicable to all couples regardless of gender or sexual orientation (which means that heterosexual couples have equal access to the CP status); additionally, same-sex adoption rights are also enshrined within the law, thus formalising what was an already-standing prior judicial decision. *The first Civil Partnership ceremony was celebrated on 27 May 2014, opening opportunities for both same-sex and opposite-sex partners to enter into binding unions recognised in Gibraltar law. *Following several years of campaigning for the introduction of legal protections for minors in the area of sexual abuse, and a demand for a Sex Offenders Register to be brought into Gibraltar law, Parliament approved provisions under a new Crime Act which took effect in 2012 and which now offers full protection and establishes a Register. *The annual celebration of International Day Against Homophobia (IDAHO) in Gibraltar since 2012. The 2013 IDAHO was attended by the full political and institutional elite of Gibraltar: the Chief Minister and Ministers of Government, the Governor of Gibraltar, members of the Parliamentary Opposition, the Mayor of Gibraltar, the non-Parliamentary political parties, representatives of the various Unions in Gibraltar, as well as the Commissioner of Police and the Head of the Gibraltar Fire Brigade. As the Chief Minister of Gibraltar said on that occasion 'today here at IDAHO, all Constitutional players are present!' *The celebration of Pride Day in Gibraltar. The first such celebration was held on 15 June 2013 and is set to grow in importance. The key difference in Gibraltar's Pride is that it is specifically NOT limited to gay Pride. In line with Alvarez's view of equality and civil and human rights as an indivisible spectrum of human justice and endeavour, Alvarez clearly set a framework for the community at large to jointly celebrate, favouring thus the avoidance of isolation or ghettoisation of any specific sector of the community and encouraging social solidarity. The first Official Pride event (fully supported and sponsored by the Government of Gibraltar)was approved for celebration in July 2014. *The establishment of an annual Award recognising significant contributions to Human & Civil Rights in Gibraltar. The first award was presented in May 2013, with Barrister John Restano of law firm Hassan's being recognised for his landmark collaborative work with ERG on breakthrough litigation which saw the ending of discrimination against same-sex couples by Government in the area of joint tenancy rights in public housing, the equalisation of the age of consent, and the obtainment of adoption rights for same-sex couples. *The call for the People of Gibraltar's history to be recognised by the UK Government through consideration of an appropriate Honours Award. Alvarez's vision has always been the establishment of comprehensive links across other areas of discrimination – whether disability, age, children's rights or any other area of social concern. This was clear from the start, even before his setting up of GGR, when he actively held meetings with lawyers and other individuals to create interest in the setting up of a Gibraltar branch of British human rights organisation Liberty. Whilst that project did not prosper, Alvarez's vision has been comprehensive and unitary throughout. This has meant that GGR now considers itself a gay and human rights organisation. \\"Not only is a position of only fighting one's own corner fundamentally flawed from a human rights perspective,' says Alvarez, 'since human rights are indivisible in and of themselves, the issue of multiple discrimination is a very real one and no one can convince me, for example, that there are no gay people who are not disabled, nor of different ethnicities or migrant status, nor any other variety of elements. For the simple reason that human beings do not come in neat and exclusive packages: we are diverse. To lose sight of that is to lose sight of the core of what working in human rights is all about!'. Alvarez continues to steer the development of human and civil rights in Gibraltar - to include the rights of sexual minorities without exception. To do so, and in addition to his already strong academic background (a B.A. and M.A. as well as qualifications in social and community work, in addition to in the teaching of English as a Second or Other Language) he undertook a law degree (LLB). Committed to widening democracy, Alvarez continues to seek means by which more open and participative involvement of citizens concerned for human and civil rights can be furthered in the community of Gibraltar. In this, he says, 'my mind is constantly employed to avoid the possibility of satisfaction at what we have and what we have achieved - and to remain open at all times to change and improvement. Even if that should mean my being asked to leave at some point. It's the way it has to be! Clinging whether to power or to anything else is not the key to a dignified life whether at an individual or collective level!' Alvarez's Honouring Gibraltar campaign: Encompassing his vision of 'Rights for people - as well as The People', Alvarez has put forward a vision for Gibraltar which recognises the interconnection between Gibraltar's on- going political struggle for self-determination and identity and the applicability of a just society based on human and civil rights. Awards Alvarez was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to the advancement of equality and human rights in Gibraltar in the 2013 Queen's Birthday Honours. The OBE investiture by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace took place on 10 October 2013. Alvarez was also awarded the Gulf War Medal in late 1991 for his civilian services at the time of the first Gulf War in Iraq. Relation Alvarez's maternal grandfather was cousin to Emilio Alvarez, founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR), a political party instrumental in granting the Gibraltarians greater civil rights.

He was a leading figure in the National Liberal movement and president of the Danish Constituent Assembly in 1848. Early life Schouw was born on 7 February 1789 in Copenhagen, the son of wine merchant Paul S. (1751–1800) and Sara Georgia Liebenberg (1761–1826). He studied law at the University of Copenhagen. Scientific career He was already a lawyer when he in the summer of 1812 travelled to Norway with the Norwegian botanist Christen Smith. On this journey, he was strongly impressed with the conspicuous zonal division of the mountain vegetation and distribution of plant species in relation to altitude. Back in Copenhagen, he attended the lectures given by Martin Vahl and J.W. Hornemann. While earning for his living as a lawyer, he delved into the copious literature on plant geography, e.g. by Wahlenberg and von Humboldt. The first result of his efforts was a doctoral dissertation (1816): Dissertatio de sedibus plantarum originariis. In this thesis, he dealt with the question of Generatio aequivoca, that is the origin of species through continuous evolution, a view he advocated. He was then given a travel grant to study phytogeography in Southern Europe and to visit A. P. de Candolle in Geneva. The expectations of his scientific potential were so great that King Frederik VI granted him an extraordinary professorship of botany at the University of Copenhagen. In 1822, his most significant contribution was published: * Grundtræk til en almindelig Plantegeographie. Copenhagen, Gyldendalske Boghandels Forlag. German translation: Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Pflanzengeographie, Berlin 1823. His later scientific contributions turned out to be rather meagre. He planned a great work and gathered material for it during two journeys to Italy. However, he never had time to continue his work. Together with Jens Vahl and Salomon Drejer, Schouw was the publisher of Flora Danica fasc. 38. He succeeded Jens Wilken Hornemann as director of Copenhagen Botanical Garden in 1841-1852. In 1841, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Politics Joakim Frederik Schouw In the 1830s and 1840s, Schouw was one of the main leaders of the political movement that led to the first democratic constitution of Denmark, the June Constitution of 1849. The king appointed him as a representative for the university for the first Roskilde Provincial Assembly in 1834 (a, a recognition of the growing importance of the liberal movement (but he belonged to the moderate wing), where he was immediately elected as its president with 37 votes against 18 votes to Lauritz Nicolai Hvidt and 11 votes to the Conservative bishop J. P. Münster. He was later reelected at Viborg Provincial Assembly with all votes against one and was reelected until 1840 when he was no longerappointed by the king, probably as a result of the government's discontent with his claim of the Provincial Assembly's independence. He was much engaged in Scandinavism and in the Schleswig-Holstein Question. He was a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly but refused to become a minister because he, unlike the government, favoured the division of Schleswig. He published Dansk Ugeskrift in 1831–36 and again 1842–46, followed by Dansk Tidsskrift 1847–50. Personal life LPeter Gemzøe: Susette Dalgas Schouw married Susanne (Susette) Marie Augustine Peschier Dalgas, (1798-1844), a daughter of priest at the French Reformed Church in Fredericia Jean Marc Dalgar (1756–1811). They first met each other in her brother Christian Dalgas' home in Livorno. Schouw's travel companion, Henrik Stampe, married another Dalgas sister, Christine, who was also there at the time. The wedding took place on 24 April 1827 in Christiansborg Chapel in Copenhagen. H. W. Bissen's bust of Schouw outside the University of Copenhagen's main building Schouw had an official residence in Charlottenborg after his appointnemnt to professor and director of the botanical garden in 1841. The botanical garden was then located next to the building. The lively Grundtvegian home was frequented by many visitors from the Danish world of culture, His daughter Georgia married the painter P. C. Skovgaard. Schouw was a member of the Committee for the Establishment of Thorvaldsens Museum and served as one of the executors of Bertel Thorvaldsens will and gift letter to the city of Copenhagen. He was also a board member of the museum. Herman Wilhelm Bissen created a bust of Schouw in 1851. A bronze cast of the bust was in 1856 installed outside the University of Copenhagen's main building on Frue Plads. It was the first sculpture of a non-aristocratic person in the public real in Copenhagen. He died on 28 April 1852 and is buried at Assistens Cemetery.

Introduction  Keith has been writing about and working with the arts in New Zealand for almost half a century. He has published a number of books on cultural and social history and cooking as well as the arts. He has contributed reviews and comment on the arts and urban and social issues for numerous magazines and newspapers since writing a weekly column of art news and reviews for the Auckland Star from 1962 to 1975. With Gordon H. Brown he wrote the first history of New Zealand art, An Introduction to New Zealand Painting, published by William Collins in 1969. Keith worked at the Auckland Art Gallery from 1958 to 1970, as Student Assistant (1958–61), Assistant Keeper (1961–64), and Keeper of the Gallery (1965–70), before working as a freelance journalist, writer and art consultant. Keith has been, at times, a controversial figure in the arts. In the 1980s his art history sustained repeated attacks by art historians such as Francis Pound, who criticised An Introduction to New Zealand Painting for its reliance on the 'harsh clarity of New Zealand light' as an explanation for why New Zealand painting followed particular styles. In the early 1990s Keith became embroiled in a public dispute about his role in the National Art Gallery of New Zealand's controversial purchase of two paintings by Charles Goldie. Willing to stand up publicly for his opinions, Keith has played a significant role in the artistic life of New Zealand since the late 1950s. Keith has been a consistent critic of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, referring to it as a \\"theme park\\", the \\"cultural equivalent to a fast-food outlet\\" and \\"not even a de facto national gallery\\" but seems to have moderated his opinion more recently when making a case for exhibition space on the Auckland waterfront. He is married to the costume designer Ngila Dickson.  Media career  Keith has been a regular radio and television broadcaster and worked on the pioneer arts program Review as reporter and director. He made the first television program on New Zealand art, Waterfall to Waterfall in 1962 and in the late 1960s he made a six-part series on New Zealand art for Radio New Zealand.

In 1982, with Bruce Morrison, he made Profiles, a series of six half- hour documentaries on contemporary New Zealand artists Tony Fomison, Richard Killeen, Neil Dawson, Greer Twiss, Philip Clairmont and Jeffrey Harris. He wrote four scripts for the pioneering television drama series Pukemanu and was principal writer for Section Seven. In 1984 he wrote and presented the two- hour series Housing New Zealand in the Twentieth Century, and presented two series of Kiwi Shorts. His most recent project was the arts documentary The Big Picture,The Big Picture, – TV Series, IMDB directed by Paul Swadel and produced by Fiona Copland of Filmworks, which garnered three nominations at the 2008 New Zealand Screen Awards, and won Best Series and Best Music Awards.THE BIG PICTURE – 2008 Awards  Arts career  Keith completed his Diploma in Fine Arts at the Canterbury School of Fine Art in 1956 and worked briefly at the Christchurch Press before gaining employment at the Auckland City Art Gallery. In 1960 he completed a studentship at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, followed by a Museums Diploma from the Museums Association of Great Britain in 1964. In 1967 he toured the United States on a six-month Carnegie Corporation Fellowship. In 1970 he was one of a group who set up the Regional Arts Federations in opposition to the original Arts Council. He served as national president Actors Equity and founding president of the Writers Guild. Appointed Chairman of the restructured Arts Council from 1975 where he served for six years, board member of the Council of the National Art Gallery, Museum for 14 years and chair of the National Art Gallery for nine. At the arts council he established the Maori and South Pacific council. In 1976 he persuaded the Muldoon government to present the major Colin McCahon painting Victory over Death to the newly opened National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. He was a member of the board that set up the Museum of New Zealand and a member of its interim board. He has sat on the board of the Auckland Art Gallery and has been consultant to a number of public and private art galleries.

She also wrote household management books, etiquette books, novels, short stories and articles for magazines and newspapers. Biography Leslie was born on November 15, 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Lydia Baker and Robert Leslie, both originally from Maryland. Her father, a clock and watchmaker, was a friend of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, according to Eliza. The family moved to England in 1793 when Leslie was five years old for about six years. She was the eldest of five children. Two of her siblings, Charles Robert Leslie, who lived in London, and Anna Leslie, were artists. Her brother Thomas Jefferson Leslie graduated from West Point and her other sister, Martha “Patty,” married the book publisher Henry Charles Carey.Wikisource:The Female Prose Writers of America: With Portraits, Biographical Notices, and Specimens of their Writings/Eliza Leslie/Autobiography Following her father’s death in 1803, her mother operated a series of boarding houses. They moved from their home on High Street to a boarding house on South Sixth Street, then Spruce Street, and, finally, to 1 Minor for the last two years of her mother’s life before she died in 1824. Leslie attended the cooking school of the famed Mrs. Goodfellow for two terms, and her first book was based on notes she had taken of Goodfellow’s class recipes, although in the introduction she insisted the recipes were \\"original, and have been used by the author and many of her friends with uniform success.\\" Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats first published in 1828, became a success and went through eleven editions until 1839. Career Leslie’s Directions for Cookery, in its Various Branches (1837), sold at least 150,000 copies and stayed in print into the 1890s, making it the most popular cookbook of the century. It was a generalized work, written to appeal to all classes and to city or rural dwellers from all regions. Some of her nine cookbooks were more specialized. Using the French she learned as a child, Leslie translated French recipes for Domestic French Cookery (1832) and wrote an entire book on cornmeal recipes, The Indian Meal Book (1847). She was a prolific writer of fiction and nonfiction works for juveniles and adults. Almost yearly, between 1836-1845, Leslie edited an annual gift book called The Gift: A Christmas and New Year’s Present, with contributions from Edgar Allan Poe (which included the first appearances of five short stories including \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" \\"Manuscript in a Bottle,\\" and \\"The Purloined Letter\\"), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The Wild Goose seen in 1962 before its major renovation, by Arthur Beaumont Wild Goose was featured in the 1968 film Skidoo where she was the yacht, named Mother, of a reclusive mob boss named \\"God\\" played by Groucho Marx. The yacht was used extensively with scenes shot from the exterior and in the wheel house, cabins, engine room, upper and lower decks. This ship was also featured in the 1967 film The President's Analyst, doubling as a Canadian spy ship. The travels of the ship were well documented during Wayne's ownership in the 1993 book On Board with the Duke authored by his former captain Bert Minshall. Minshall was on Wild Goose for 16 years with Wayne. The vessel is still in operation for dinner cruises in Newport Beach, California by Hornblower Cruises.

He is a Belgian archaeologist and paleoanthropologist whose main field of study has been the Palaeolithic period. Education Bringmans enrolled at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, where he received a bachelor's degree in Archaeology and Art History and where he received a master's degree in Archaeology. Bringmans then continued at the same university at the Laboratory of Prehistory (Dir. Prof. Dr. (now Emeritus) Pierre M. Vermeersch), where he spent his early career, for a Ph.D. in Archaeology. His doctoral dissertation (2006) read: \\"Multiple Middle Palaeolithic Occupations in a Loess-soil Sequence at Veldwezelt- Hezerwater, Limburg, Belgium\\". Patrick M.M.A. Bringmans wrote his dissertation under the direction of Prof. Dr. Pierre M. Vermeersch, a Belgian geographer and archaeologist who had been trained in European prehistoric archaeology by Belgian geologist Frans Gullentops and French prehistorian François Bordes. Vermeersch worked on both the Paleolithic of Europe and Africa. Patrick M.M.A. Bringmans is also the author of veldwezelt-hezerwater.blogspot. Archaeological work Dr. Bringmans has excavated widely on prehistoric Belgian and Egyptian sites including Veldwezelt-Hezerwater, Belgium and Sodmein Cave, Egypt. Bringmans was the field director of excavations at the Middle Paleolithic site of Veldwezelt-Hezerwater from 1998 to 2005. He has also been co-director of the \\"Belgian Middle Egypt Prehistoric Project\\" in 1999 and 2001. This research project of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven was established in 1976 by Prof. Dr. Pierre M. Vermeersch, who remained the head- director until 2003. In 2006, Bringmans was appointed as Head Curator at the archaeological museum in Heerlen, The Netherlands. In 2008, Dr. Bringmans was invited to serve as a Guest Professor of Paleoanthropology at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. Archaeological theories Bringmans' research and teaching interests include archaeological method and theory, Quaternary research, geoarchaeology, especially loess-stratigraphy and paleosols, lithic technology, dating methods in archaeology and human evolution. The majority of Bringmans' archaeological work has been centered on Neandertals in Western Europe, and more particularly on the stone tools, which are thought to have been the primary mode of their \\"technology complex\\". One of his main research interests concerns the changing pattern of human dispersal under shifting late Middle and Late Pleistocene climates in NW Europe. In his Ph.D. dissertation Bringmans has combined climatic modeling, geology, archaeology and oxygen isotope analysis to find out when and how NW Europe could have been occupied by Neandertals. He claims that terrestrial sediment archives (e.g. loess) provide detailed records of past climatic variability and change on millennial and sub-millennial time scales. Climate-proxy records can be obtained from most terrestrial sediments, as has been the case at Veldwezelt-Hezerwater. Bringmans believes that NW Europe was too hostile for humans during the interglacial/glacial climate extremes. He also claims that NW Europe seems to have been a bit of a wasteland during much of the late Middle and Late Pleistocene as well. According to Bringmans, only a few well-preserved archaeological sites such as Veldwezelt-Hezerwater, Maastricht-Belvédère and Dahlen, Meudt offer unique snapshots of Middle Paleolithic people appearing in NW Europe for a short spell and then going away again. Bringmans claims that the number of Neandertals present in NW Europe may have fluctuated significantly from one period to the next, especially near the margins of ecological tolerance.

Dr. Bulkeley Bandinel (21 February 1781 – 6 February 1861) was a British scholar, ecclesiastic and librarian. Early life He was born in the parish of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, first-born son of Rev. Dr. James Bandinel of Netherbury by his wife, Margaret (née Dumaresq). His ancestors, originally from Italy, had moved to Jersey early in the seventeenth century. His father was the first of the family to settle in England.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: 'Bandinel, Bulkeley (1781-1861)' by Mary Clapinson Bulkeley was named after his father's friend, Viscount Bulkeley of Cashel. Educated at Reading under Richard Valpy and then at Winchester College, Bandinel entered New College, Oxford, in 1800 (B.A. 1805, M.A. 1807, B.D. and D.D. 1823) and was a Fellow there until 1813. He was ordained as a priest in the Church of England in 1805. Career During Admiral Sir James Saumarez's Baltic campaign of 1808, Bandinel served a short while as chaplain on board ; but, returning, he settled in Oxford and rose within the University's ranks. From 1810 he was Sub-Librarian of the Bodleian Library under his godfather John Price, and rose to become Bodley's Librarian in 1813 upon Price's death. It was a position he held until his own death in 1861. Bandinel was Dean of New College and Proctor of the University in 1814, and a Delegate of the University Press from 1813. In addition, his clerical posts included curacies at nearby Wytham from 1816, and at Albury, Oxfordshire, from 1820; then in 1822 he was promoted to the rectory of St Andrew's Church, Haughton-le-Skerne formerly held by his brother-in-law, Thomas Le Mesurier. But Bandinel, occupied with administering the Bodleian and paying from his own purse for bold acquisitions of rare books and manuscripts, rarely visited his living in the North and the parish was run by a curate in his place. The Bodleian's collections increased greatly under his direction and his knowledge of literary circles was rarely seconded. His patience with both ill-informed library visitors and colleagues would often run thin, many a guest falling victim to his short temper, but it is said that his courtesy was guaranteed to anyone of note who wished to consult him. He was one of the three contributors to Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica. Macray in his Annals of the Bodleian LibraryMacray's Annals of the Bodleian Library recounts that Bandinel resigned his librarianship in 1860 \\"after forty-seven years of office as in the capacity of Head, and a total of fifty of work in the Library... At the age of seventy-nine the natural infirmities of age were felt by himself to incapacitate him for the duties which he had so long and so regularly discharged; while at the same time the continually increasing pressure of work and requirements of the Library made those duties much more onerous than they had been even a quarter of a century before.\\" He gave way to his subordinate, Henry Octavius Coxe. Personal life Bandinel married, in 1813, Mary Phillips, daughter of John Phillips of Culham, Oxfordshire, and died without issue in 1861 at his home, 31 Beaumont Street, Oxford.

The Annals of Ulster for 643 say:Annals of Ulster, AU 643.7 > Here there is doubt as to who reigned after Domnall. Some historiographers > say that four kings, namely Cellach and Conall Cóel and the two sons of Áed > Sláine, namely Diarmait and Blathmac, ruled in shared reigns. All four putative successors to Domnall had been his allies at the great Battle of Mag Rath in 637, where Congal Cáech was defeated and the authority of the Uí Néill re-established, and it is not implausible that all four ruled together. Conall is mentioned as the commander of Domnall's forces at the Battle of Sailtír, a naval battle which defeated the forces of the Cenél nEógain and Dál Riata on the same day as Mag Rath in 637.AU 637.1; Mac Niocaill, pg.96 He ruled from 643-654.king lists in Book of Leinster give him 15 year reign and Laud Synchronisms 14 years The king lists have Cellach and Conall reigning before Diarmait and Blathmac.Charles-Edwards, pg.485 Both Cellach and Conall are omitted from the earliest king lista late 7th century poem called Baile Chuinn.Charles-Edwards, pg.484 Their cousin Óengus mac Domnaill may have attempted to take power in the north.

Most efforts that claim this label operate in low-income or middle-income areas, and have adopted at least some of the tactics and organizing techniques pioneered by Saul Alinsky and his Industrial Areas Foundation. Other organizations in this tradition include PICO National Network, Gamaliel Foundation, and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART). They focus on building political power in the hands of an organization of local residents, and using that power to influence issues the organization defines as important. Congregation-based Community Organizing (CBCO) works through local synagogues, churches, and mosques as the primary institutional sponsors of this work. Common characteristics: *Faith-based: They ground their organizing in the moral values and traditions that stem from religious faith, to varying degrees and often quite powerfully. See religion and peacebuilding. *Broad-based: They are typically ecumenical or interfaith, and many include schools, unions, or a variety of other community-based institutions like neighborhood associations. *Locally constituted: They organize in areas that range from large neighborhoods to entire cities. Although linked into the national and regional networks discussed above, they emphasize local grassroots organizing. *Multi-issue: Their purpose is to instruct local congregational authorities about how to effectively address a variety of pressing issues facing their communities. *Professionally staffed: CBCO groups hire professionals to recruit and train leaders to work with their religious communities on a personal and regular basis.

While it is not exclusive to black creators, it does strive to honor those who have made the greatest contributions to the comics medium in terms of both critical and commercial impact. By doing so, the goal is to encourage more diverse and high quality work across the board and to inspire new creators to add their voices to the field.

They are particularly diverse in the New World, though scarce in the tropics, and in the Old World they can be found primarily in the Palaearctic and Africa, but absent from Australia and tropical Asia. They tend to be associated with xeric or sandy habitats. The \\"facial foveae\\" of Panurgines are not broad, velvety depressions as in Andreninae, but reduced to grooves or pits at the upper margin of the eyes. The apex of the marginal cell of the wing is truncate, and the trochanteral scopa is reduced. Panurgines also frequently have yellow markings in locations other than on the face, a feature not seen in any other subfamilies of Andrenidae. Most members of this subfamily are oligolectic, with highly specialized floral associations, especially in desert species.

Silos & Smokestacks was designated as a national heritage area in 1996. The name is intended to reflect both the farms and industries that constitute agribusiness. The Silos & Smokestacks region covers the northeast third of the state of Iowa, including thirty-seven counties. The cities of Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Waterloo, Dubuque, and Iowa City are all located within the region. The National Park Service recognizes over 90 community and privately operated sites in the area that interpret the story of American agriculture. These range from dairy farms and museums to vineyards and tractor assembly plants. Included in the area are the Amana Colonies, Living History Farms, and Brucemore, a few of Iowa's best known tourist attractions.

This list of prehistoric hexacorals (Scleractinia) is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all genera that have ever been included in the hexacorallia which are known from the fossil record. This list excludes purely vernacular terms. It includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered scleractinia. Naming conventions and terminology Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include: * Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen. *Nomen nudum (Latin for \\"naked name\\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen. *Nomen oblitum (Latin for \\"forgotten name\\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal. *Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list. *Nomen dubium (Latin for \\"dubious name\\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list. { id=\\"toc\\" border=\\"0\\" ! :  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  See also } A Aspidiscus cristatus from the Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous) of southern Israel; oral view.

(The other two are Black-a-Tor Copse on the West Okement at SX565892 and Piles Copse on the River Erme at SX644620.) Geography It lies at an altitude of 380–410 metres in the valley of the West Dart River near Two Bridges, at grid reference SX612774. The source of the Devonport Leat, at a weir on the West Dart River, is just north of the wood. Start of Devonport Leat near Wistman's Wood Preservation status This is one of the highest oakwoods in Britain and, as an outstanding example of native upland oak woodland, was selected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1964. Choose \\"View citation\\" to access the citation (pdf file). It is also an NCR site and forms part of the Wistman’s Wood National Nature Reserve. The wood was also one of the primary reasons for selection of the Dartmoor Special Area of Conservation.Dartmoor SAC web page http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929 Description The wood is split into three main blocks (North, Middle and South Groves or Woods), which in total cover about 3.5 ha (9 acres). These occupy the sheltered, south-west facing slope of the valley, where a bank of large granite boulders (\\"clatter\\") is exposed, and pockets of acid, free- draining, brown earth soils have accumulated. Additional copses of scrub extend beyond the main body of the wood, suggesting that it originally extended over the entirety of the clatter deposits on the hillside. In the present day, the clatter outside of the main wood is covered in bracken, bilberry, and occasional gorse.Tansley, A.G., The British Isles and their Vegetation, Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1965. P. 299–302. Wistman's Wood is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall and has been managed since 1961 under a nature reserve agreement with the Nature Conservancy Council, English Nature and Natural England. There is no active management, but many people visit the site on foot (mostly accessing the southern end of South Wood), and cattle and sheep have free access where the terrain permits, outside of a small fenced exclosure in South Wood. =Flora= The trees are mainly pedunculate oak, with occasional rowan, and a very few holly, hawthorn, hazel, and eared-willow. The oaks are distinguished by their dwarf habit, and rarely reach more than 4.5 m (15 ft) in overall vertical height. The trees also developed highly contorted forms with procumbent trunks, and their main branches tend to lie on or between the rocks on the forest floor. A few trees reach 6-7.6 m (20-25 ft) in height; these also tend to have more vertical trunks and spread crowns. Tree branches are characteristically festooned with a variety of epiphytic mosses and lichens and, sometimes, by grazing-sensitive species such as bilberry and polypody. The horizontal habit of the trunks and limbs allows organic debris and humus to accumulate on them, favoring extensive growth of epiphytic vascular plants. These occur in much greater variety than in other British woodlands; in addition to polypody, which is the most common recorded epiphyte, and bilberry, these include many of the same species found on the forest floor. On the ground, boulders are usually covered by lichens and mossy patches – frequent species include Dicranum scoparium, Hypotrachyna laevigata, Rhytidiadelphus loreus and Sphaerophorus globosus – and, where soil has accumulated, patches of acid grassland grow with heath bedstraw, tormentil and sorrel. In places protected from livestock, grazing- sensitive plants such as wood sorrel, bilberry, wood rush and bramble occur. A fringe of bracken surrounds much of the wood, demarcating the extent of brown earth soils. The wood supports approximately 120 species of lichen. =Fauna= The wood is home to a large population of adders. History Wistman's Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely to be a left-over from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor c. 7000 BC, before Mesolithic hunter/gatherers cleared it around 5000 BC. Photographic and other records show that Wistman's Wood has changed considerably since the mid-19th century; at the same time climatic conditions have also generally become warmer.Proctor, M.C.F., Spooner, G.M. and Spooner, M. 1980. Changes in Wistman’s Wood, Devon: photographic and other evidence. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 112, Pages 43-79.Mountford, E,P., Backmeroff, C.E. and Peterken, G.F. 2001. Long-term patterns of growth, mortality, regeneration and natural disturbance in Wistman’s Wood, a high altitude oakwood on Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 133, Pages 231-262. Over this period, the older oak trees have grown from a stunted/semi-prostrate to a more ascending form, while a new generation of mostly straight-grown and single-stemmed oaks has developed. The oldest oaks appear to be 400–500 years old, and originated within a degenerating oakwood that survived in scrub form during two centuries of cold climate. In c. 1620 these old trees were described as \\"no taller than a man may touch to top with his head\\". Tree height increased somewhat by the mid-19th century, and during the 20th century approximately doubled (in 1997 the maximum and average height of trees was around 12 m and 7 m respectively). In addition, a wave of marginal new oaks arose after c. 1900, roughly doubling the area of wood. Part of the evidence for these changes comes from a permanent vegetation plot located in the southern end of South Wood. This is the oldest known of its kind in British woodland, with a small part having been recorded by R. Hansford Worth in 1921.Christy, M. and Worth, R.H. 1922. The ancient dwarfed oak woods of Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 54, Pages 291-342. The Buller Stone, a boulder to the east of the wood, commemorates an attempt in 1866 to date the trees, when Wentworth Buller (with permission from the Duchy) felled an oak. It was estimated to be 168 years old. Myths, art and literature The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth century accounts. One tradition holds that it was planted by Isabella de Fortibus (1237-93). The wood is described in detail and discussed as a point of great interest in The Tree, a 1978 essay on naturalism by English novelist John Fowles. The name of Wistman's Wood may derive from the dialect word \\"wisht\\", meaning \\"eerie/uncanny\\"Westwood, Jennifer (1985), Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain. Pub. Grafton Books, London. . P. 32. or \\"pixie-led/haunted\\".

Backbeat Books, , Earlier that year, Adler recorded demos with 10cc's Graham Gouldman at Strawberry Studios. Prior to Roogalator, Adler had also played with Smooth Loser, a band formed with Jeff Pasternak, the brother of BBC disc-jockey Emperor Rosko. Bass guitarist Tony Lester, guitarist Chris Gibbons and drummer Malcolm Mortimer (G.T. Moore and the Reggae Guitars), were members for a time. Mortimer returned to Adler for an early incarnation of Roogalator before leaving to join Ian Dury in Kilburn and the High Roads . History Roogalator played their first live show in November 1972, at a talent night staged at the Marquee Club in London to muted response. Adler, killing time between the Irish Country and Western circuit and jam sessions with Ginger Baker's African drummers, spent time in Paris studying jazz theory. He returned to London to form the second line-up of Roogalator with drummer Bobby Irwin, pianist Steve Beresford and keyboardist Nick Plytas. The band recorded a demo which resulted in a booking agency deal. Neither Beresford nor Irwin wanted to proceed. With their first live shows ahead, Adler and Plytas rebuilt the line-up. Drummer Dave Solomon, a bandmate of both Plytas and Beresford in a Motown cover band, replaced Irwin. Irwin, noting the band was still minus a bassist, gave a copy of the demo to Paul Riley, a member of the successful pub-scene band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers. Riley joined Roogalator just before their September 1975 debut, and for a time it was his fame that attracted the band's first press notices. They became one of the fixtures on the mid-'70s London pub rock scene, establishing themselves as unique on the pub circuit. Drawing from Adler's experience on the Cincinnati club circuit of the late '60s, Roogalator offered an angular, minimalist funk sound which was at odds with the standard country, blues, and early rock sounds and created a distinctive blueprint for what would become the Britfunk explosion of the early '80s. In November 1975, the band recorded demos for United Artists Records and met Robin Scott, who would become their manager, producer and record label chief. In January 1976 they supported Dr. Feelgood at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. The show was by their own consensus a disaster and marked the end of the classic line-up. Within weeks, Solomon quit, to be replaced by the returning Bobby Irwin. Riley also departed. Adding bassist Jeff Watts, Roogalator recorded a John Peel session on 13 May 1976 and embarked on a European tour. The tour was marred by the theft of all their possessions from their van. Watts and Irwin departed to reunite with Riley in the Sinceros, which he was now managing. Encouraged by Scott, Adler recruited a new rhythm section; bass guitarist Julian Scott (brother of Robin) and drummer Justin Hildreth. In early summer 1976 Roogalator signed a one-off single deal with Stiff Records and released \\"All Aboard\\"/\\"Cincinnati Fatback\\". The band continued gigging returning to the BBC for a second Peel session on 28 October 1976. In 1977 the band released another one-off single, \\"Love And The Single Girl\\", on Virgin Records. They declined a recording contract with Virgin who had insisted that they also sign a publishing contract in addition to a recording contract. The band returned to the BBC for a third and final session with Peel on 16 August 1977. The band released their debut album, Play It by Ear, in 1977 on manager's Scott's Do It Records label, essentially an opportunity to preserve the band's repertoire on vinyl. The album was well-received but sold poorly. The band played at ‘Front Row Festival’, a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor, Islington, in late November and early December 1977. This resulted in the band’s inclusion, alongside the likes of Wilko Johnson, the Only Ones, the Saints, the Stranglers, X-Ray Spex, and XTC, on a hit double album of recordings from the festival. The Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival compilation LP (March 1978) reached number 28 in the UK Albums Chart. When Plytas left, the band opted not to replace him and continued to gig as a trio, releasing in 1978, one more single, \\"Zero Hero\\" and demoing a second album. Hildreth was next to quit to be replaced by Nick Monnas (from Stomu Yamashta band). Adler, discouraged by the constant changes in the line-up and with feelings that the band had run its course, disbanded Roogalator in July 1978, with many of the songs intended for their second album being reworked for his solo debut, The Danny Adler Story. Roogalator's repertoire was later re-issued on the Cincinnati Fatback compilation album.

Route description  The route begins at Highway 10 in the center of Cruz Bay. Highway 20 runs along the northern shore of St. John, passing through Virgin Islands National Park. The road serves many popular beaches, including Cinnamon Bay and Trunk Bay. The highway travels along the coast for most of its length, and has several turnouts for scenic overlooks. The roadway begins to bend into the center of the island, in the process passing several small houses and buildings. Highway 20 has one auxiliary route along its length, Highway 206. The configuration of the eastern portion of the highway Highway 20 has an unusual configuration near its eastern terminus. Near Highway 10, the road splits into two. The northern section, carrying eastbound traffic heads toward the eastern shore, but abruptly ends at an unnumbered road. Traffic wishing to continue on Highway 20 must make a 45 degree turn and continue westbound to meet the other stretch of road. Traffic heading west on Highway 20 simply turns left onto the southern branch and rejoins eastbound traffic a short distance later. This discrepancy causes the mileage of the road to change depending on which direction the road is traveled. After passing through the unusual configuration, the roadway proceeds southeastward. It passes through the center of the island, until its reaches its eastern terminus, an intersection with Highway 10 near the island's south shore.  Major intersections  The entire route is located on the island of Saint John. Auxiliary route Highway 206 (John Head Road) is a road on St. John, USVI. It is an auxiliary route of Highway 20. Running just over a mile from Highway 20 south to Highway 10, the road serves a few residential dwellings and as a connector between the two main roads on St. John.

It runs in a northwest to southeast direction from LA 29 in Whiteville to U.S. Highway 90 (US 90) north of Raceland. Along the way, the highway serves the cities of Opelousas, Lafayette, New Iberia, Morgan City, and Houma. LA 182 is generally bannered as a north-south highway north of Lafayette (where it largely parallels US 167) and as an east-west highway from Lafayette to Raceland (where it parallels US 90). Today, most of LA 182 follows the previous alignments of US 90 and US 167 before their re-routing onto newer four-lane alignments. Additionally, the former US 90 alignment between Lafayette and Raceland was once part of the earlier Old Spanish Trail and is still known as such in many places along the route. Route description =Whiteville to Lafayette= From the northwest, LA 182 begins at an intersection with LA 29 in an area of northern St. Landry Parish known as Whiteville. It proceeds in a southeast direction to an intersection with LA 10 in Beggs. Here the two highways turn to the south and begin a concurrency, passing through an interchange with I-49 south of Macland. In Washington, LA 182 and LA 10 intersect LA 103, which heads to Ville Platte to the west. In Nuba, the concurrency with LA 10 ends at an intersection with US 167 as LA 10 turns west to follow US 167\\\\. Just to the east, US 167 joins I-49 through Opelousas to Lafayette. In Opelousas, LA 182 intersects US 190 on its path between Eunice and Krotz Springs. South of Opelousas and an area known as Shuteston, LA 182 turns to the east into Sunset and the adjacent Grand Coteau. Here it intersects LA 93, which connects LA 182 to I-49/US 167 just to the east and proceeds toward Arnaudville. LA 182 crosses over I-49/US 167 with ramps to frontage roads that connect to the LA 93 interchange. Just after exiting Grand Coteau, LA 182 turns to the southeast and crosses into Lafayette Parish. Soon after crossing the parish line, LA 182 intersects I-49 (still concurrent with US 167) once more and turns to the south through Carencro. LA 182 curves to the southeast, enters the city of Lafayette, and intersects I-10 between Lake Charles on the west and Baton Rouge on the east. =Lafayette to Morgan City= Nearing downtown Lafayette, LA 182 intersects US 90 (Cameron Street) and begins a concurrency with US 90 Business along University Avenue. From this point to the remainder of its route, LA 182 follows the former alignment of US 90. At Johnston Street, LA 182 and US 90 Business intersect US 167, which is now separated from I-49 and runs southwest to Abbeville. A few blocks later, US 90 Business turns northeast onto Pinhook Road to rejoin US 90\\\\. Meanwhile, LA 182 turns southwest and follows the same thoroughfare, curving southeast out of Lafayette and into Broussard. Here LA 182 intersects LA 89-1 connecting to Youngsville just to the south. Nearing the parish line, LA 182 approaches US 90 and runs alongside it briefly. It then crosses US 90 via an interchange and intersects LA 96 to St. Martinville, turning southeast along the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad tracks into St. Martin Parish. LA 182 passes briefly through the southwest corner of St. Martin Parish, intersecting LA 92-1 in an area known as Cade. It then crosses into Iberia Parish, immediately intersecting LA 88\\\\. LA 182 enters New Iberia and separates to follow St. Peter Street eastbound and Main Street westbound throughout the city limits. It intersects a number of state highways, including LA 86, which follows Bayou Teche north to Loreauville, and LA 14, which proceeds west through Delcambre to Abbeville. LA 182 also begins to parallel Bayou Teche out of New Iberia, through Jeanerette, and into St. Mary Parish. In St. Mary Parish, LA 182 passes through Baldwin and Franklin, cutting across some wide bends in Bayou Teche. In Baldwin, LA 182 intersects LA 83, which heads west to Cypremort Point. Southeast of Franklin at a point known as Calumet, LA 182 briefly joins US 90 across the Wax Lake Outlet bridge. Splitting from US 90, LA 182 proceeds along Bayou Teche and the Lower Atchafalaya River through Patterson, Bayou Vista, and Berwick with no state highway junctions. In Berwick, LA 182 again connects with US 90 but maintains its own parallel bridge crossing over the Lower Atchafalaya River/Berwick Bay into Morgan City. =Morgan City to Raceland= In Morgan City, LA 182 proceeds briefly along Brashear Avenue then curves south through an interchange with US 90 and an intersection with LA 70 (9th Street). Here the route becomes co-signed as US 90 Business out of Morgan City and into Assumption Parish. After crossing Bayou Boeuf, LA 182 passes briefly through the southern tip of Assumption Parish. The concurrency with US 90 Business ends at an intersection with LA 662 just inside the parish line as US 90 Business heads north on that highway to reconnect with its parent route. After crossing into Terrebonne Parish, LA 182 intersects LA 20, which heads toward Schriever and Thibodaux. Here, in an area known as Gibson, LA 182 turns to the southeast away from US 90, which bypasses Houma to the north. LA 182 follows a long stretch of Bayou Black into Houma where it turns north across the bayou at an intersection with LA 315\\\\. The highway continues through Houma on Barrow Street and crosses Bayou Terrebonne, where it makes a jog onto New Orleans Boulevard via a brief concurrency with LA 24, Houma's main thoroughfare. LA 182 follows New Orleans Boulevard north out of town and crosses into Lafourche Parish. Just south of Raceland, LA 182 engages in an interchange with US 90 and continues north into town. Reaching Bayou Lafourche, LA 182 turns east briefly onto LA 1 before turning north and crossing the bayou. The highway reaches its end at a final junction with US 90, which continues northeast toward New Orleans. History The original route of LA 182 as designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering included only the northernmost section from LA 29 in Whiteville to LA 10 in Beggs. It was subsequently extended southeast over former sections of US 167 and US 90 bypassed by newer, four-lane alignments (built under the temporary designation of LA 3052). The upgraded US 167 was later absorbed into the southernmost part of I-49. The first extension of LA 182 occurred about 1962 when US 167 was shifted onto a new four-lane alignment between Opelousas and Sunset. Around 1965, this alignment was extended south from Sunset to Lafayette (as US 167) and from Lafayette to Broussard (as US 90). At this time, a section of US 90 west of Morgan City was bypassed. LA 182 now continued south from Sunset along former US 167 to Lafayette, along former US 90 to Broussard, and was co-signed with US 90 to Calumet. Here, LA 182 split from US 90 to follow the two bends of Bayou Teche that had been bypassed between Calumet and Berwick. The intervening section of US 90 was gradually re-routed over the next two decades onto its current alignment as follows: * From Broussard to LA 88 northwest of New Iberia about 1967 * From LA 88 to LA 14 in New Iberia about 1969 * From LA 14 to LA 85 near Jeanerette about 1971 * From LA 85 to LA 316 east of Jeanerette by 1976 * From LA 316 to LA 83 in Baldwin by 1979 * From LA 83 to LA 182 at Calumet about 1981 Meanwhile, the US 90 bypass of Raceland was opened in 1978 with the old alignment becoming LA 3198 and LA 3199\\\\. LA 182 replaced these routes upon its final extension in 1999 with the completion of the US 90 freeway between Morgan City and Raceland.

Tired of waiting for help from the authorities, the villagers under Reverend Father Panangodan (Thilakan) and Philipose Muthalali (Jagannatha Varma) decide to hire a hunter. The hunter whom they wanted had recently died, so his son Varunni (Mammootty) is summoned to the village. The uncultured life of Varunni soon became a headache for the village. The villagers try to avoid the drunkard hunter. However, a woman named Bhagyalakshmi (Sunitha) (whose mother was killed by the leopard) befriends Varunni. This relation makes Thomaskutty (Mahesh), who is in love with Bhagyalakshmi, jealous. Seeing Varunni talking to Bhagyalakshmi, Thomaskutty gets angry and starts fighting with the hunter. In the fight, Thomaskutty accidentally slips and falls from the top of the cliff. Varunni feels responsible for the death of Thomaskutty and confesses secretly to Reverend Father Panangodan. Father Panangodan realises the big heart inside the hunter. He decides to protect Varunni despite the objections from the villagers and arranges a livelihood for him. Varunni gradually starts to help the villagers and the family of Thomaskutty. The villagers also develop a soft corner for the hunter. Meanwhile, the leopard again comes to the village and Varunni fails to kill it. The leopard escapes with a wound. The preparations of the betrothal of Thomaskutty's sister Annamma (Urvashi) is going on. But the groom fails to show up at the function. At the directions of Father Panangodan, Varunni decides to marry Annamma. This makes Bhagyalakshmi, who was in love with Varunni, jealous. On the eve of the wedding, she informs Annamma that Varunni had killed her brother Thomaskutty. Varunni gets exposed on the wedding day and flees to his hut. On reaching the hut, Varunni finds his dog barking alarmingly. He concludes that the dog has rabies and kills it. Soon he spots the leopard at the top of his hut and realizes that his dog was actually signalling about the leopard. He manages to kill the leopard with an axe. The villagers celebrate the death of the leopard. However, the police soon arrive and arrest Varunni for murdering Thomaskutty.

The festival was cancelled in 2010, its third year due to the financial troubles of the festival's president, Benjamin Williams.  History  Reggae music originated in Jamaica in the 1960s and has grown to become a worldwide cultural and musical expression. The inaugural Ottawa Reggae Festival was held in 2008 as a one-day event. An added day became the Heineken Dance Party designed to showcase local and regional artists along with Disc Jockeys all from the reggae industry. The 2008 line-up included Canada's Dancehall and Reggae artist Jamilean, UK artist Maxi Priest, Canada's Reggaeton musician El Neggro, Bermudian Collie Buddz, and Toronto's Snow. Since the inaugural year, the festival has received support from the community and the Ontario Arts Council, the City of Ottawa and Heritage Canada. It became a member of Ottawa Festivals, but it is no longer a member in 2019. The Ottawa Reggae Festival also hosts community events around the nation's capital throughout the year. These events include the 46th Anniversary Celebration of Jamaican Independence with the Ottawa Rapidz, a Canada Day Block Party downtown and Marley Night event celebrating Black History Month. As of 2019, the event has grown to a 3-day long international festival. Coca-Cola partnered with the festival's green team, making it possible to recycle over of cardboard, plastic and aluminum.  Controversy  In its third year, The Ottawa Reggae Festival has come under fire for financial mismanagement, artist no-shows, and cancelled performances. On August 21, 2010, monies and receipts were seized from the festival's beer tent following a court ruling against the festival from A. Raoul Nembhard, the festival's former chief financial officer. Nemhard claimed that he had not been reimbursed for his out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the previous year's festival. On August 22, 2010, the last day of the festival, the entire day of performances was cancelled with its headlining acts, Sean Paul and Ky- mani Marley, pulling out. Many of the vendors and performers feared that they would not be paid. Sean Paul's representative, Headline Entertainment, cited a lack of confidence in the festival's ability to pay Paul's $50,000 appearance fee after delays in obtaining a deposit from the festival. Sean Paul took to Twitter to blame the promoters for disorganization and to apologize to his Canadian fans.Sean Paul's Twitter Comment L3 magazine, sponsor and publicist of the festival, issued a release blaming the President Benjamin Williams for the festival's financial troubles.Reggae Fest Pulls Plug on Final Day The Ottawa Sun The festival's board of directors also released a statement criticising the 25-year-old Williams for his \\"youth and inexperience\\" and poor financial decisions.

Bourn ran and controlled the Empire Mine and the San Francisco Gas Company, he was an investor in Spring Valley Water Company, and he led a merger to what later became Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Bourn II was the builder of many estates in California, including Filoli, the country estate in San Mateo County, California. Biography Bourn was born in San Francisco, California in 31 May 1857, the second child of mining entrepreneur William Bowers Bourn I and Sarah Esther Chase. He was educated at Union College, St. Augustine’s College, an Episcopal missionary college in Benicia, and the University School in San Francisco. While attending the University School in San Francisco, 17 year old Bourn lived full-time with his father and his 21 year old cousin Willis Ingalls visiting from the East Coast. The two boys were trained to work alongside Bourn the elder and learned about business dealings and mining. His father accidentally shot himself in the stomach in their San Francisco Nob Hill home and died on July 1874. A few months later in 1875, he left for England and a classical education at Cambridge University. He returned to California in 1878 to help his mother manage the family business interests. He reorganized the Empire Mine, significantly improving operations at the mine. He opened a bank in Grass Valley and became a director of the San Francisco Gas Company. By 1887 he had sold his mining interests. In 1888 he partnered with E. Everett Wise and other investors to build the mammoth Greystone Cellars in Napa Valley. Bourn bought Wise out, but sold it entirely in 1894 in the midst of the phylloxera scourge. Bourn reacquired control of the Empire Mine in 1896.McQuiston, F.W., 1986, Gold: The Saga of the Empire Mine, 1850-1956, Grass Valley:Empire Mine Park Association, In the 1890s he spearheaded the merger of electricity and gas companies in San Francisco, which would later become the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and in 1890 began significant investments in the Spring Valley Water Company, which would be bought by the city government of San Francisco in February 1929 and, with the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir expansion which Bourn had opposed, become its water supplier. Bourn was regularly pilloried by the San Francisco Chronicle as a thief and scoundrel for water rates, but Bourn replied that the company needed to earn a reasonable return on its investments and was also making provision for future population growth.  Personal life  Bourn was married in 1881 to Agnes Moody. They had two children together, a son and a daughter. The first born was son William Bowers Bourn III, born in 1882 and he died one day later. Their second born was daughter Maud born in 1883. Bourn and his wife built their country estate Filoli in Woodside, California in 1915. Bourn suffered a stroke in 1922, which kept him in a wheelchair. In 1929, his daughter Maud died from pneumonia in Manhattan, New York. By 1929, he had sold the Empire to Newmont Mining Corporation. William Bowers Bourn II died at Filoli and was buried in the Bourn Family Cemetery with his wife and daughter on the property.

The HDMT provides a set of baseline data on community health metrics for San Francisco and development targets to assess the extent to which urban development projects and plans can improve community health. The HDMT also provides a range of policy and design strategies that can advance health conditions and resources via the development process.  Background  In the San Francisco Bay Area, between the mid- and late- 1990s, the bustling information economy brought multitudes of young people to the Bay Area and Silicon Valley’s technology-inspired new economy.San Francisco Department of Public Health. \\"Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment (ENCHIA).\\" Housing was notoriously difficult to find, with vacancy rates at less than 2%.U.S. Census Bureau. Washington, D.C. \\"Housing Vacancies and Homeownership - Annual 2005: table 6a.\\" Accessed 2010-10-25. During this period, average rents increased by 30% and the cost to buy increased dramatically. Although the economic recession triggered by the dot-com bubble brought the city’s vacancy rates to pre-boom levels, the Bay Area continued to encounter pressure for new housing development due to extraordinary levels of unmet demand and its high profitability. This phenomenon occurred elsewhere in California and throughout the country, in both urban and suburban settings.  Land Use and Health  Historically, health inequities were associated with differences in health behaviors and health care access and utilization. Today, however, many believe that these inequities result from differences in access to the social, economic, and environmental resources necessary for health. Increasingly, inter-disciplinary research demonstrates that the root causes of disease and illness, as well as strategies to improve health and well-being are dependent on community design, land use, and transportation.U.S. Green Building Council. Washington, D.C. \\"LEED for Neighborhood Development.\\" Accessed 2010-10-25.National Association of County and City Health Officials. Washington, D.C.\\"Land Use Planning 101 Resources.\\" Accessed 2010-10-25. Changes in societal conditions can affect many individuals simultaneously, and have broad and diverse impacts on multiple health outcomes. The value of this tool is that it focuses on broadening the range of social, economic, and environmental resources needed for health on a population level. It does so by recognizing a range of resources needed for optimal health at the societal level and identifying measurable and actionable ways to meet those needs through urban development. It combines quantitative analysis of health indicators with a qualitative assessment of whether plans and projects meet tool development targets. SFDPH has recognized that it has a legitimate agency interest in integrating health considerations into land use decision-making. While SFDPH does not have formal decision-making authority regarding land use and development decisions, a number of drivers brought SFDPH to understand that it has a potentially important role. Drivers include: * Community organizations’ struggles to limit the negative impacts of development in their communities * Local experience among SFDPH staff that environmental health outcomes were associated with land use and transportation decisions * National public health research that “the built environment” was associated with chronic health outcomes * An international movement to develop tools and methods for HIA’s of public policy The first driver for SFDPH to be involved in land use was that community groups were struggling with the pace of development in their neighborhoods. In addition, they were dissatisfied with the responsiveness of the Planning Department to address neighborhood needs and concerns, including displacement of existing residents and jobs, and an overall lack of infrastructure to support a complete neighborhood. Many groups called for community planning processes and specifically community, social, and economic impact assessments of land use changes to be conducted as part of or complementary to the environmental impact report required by CEQA.California Natural Resources Agency. Sacramento, CA. \\"California Environmental Quality Act: Summary.\\" 2005-05-25. The second driver was that SFDPH increasingly recognized that environmental health and justice issues in San Francisco had roots in land use and transportation planning decisions. For example, SFDPH environmental health inspectors frequently observed that families lived in housing conditions that caused a variety of health outcomes such as asthma and lead poisoning. However, because of the high costs associated with improving these conditions, landlords often would not take action. In addition, the high cost of housing made it difficult or families to leave their homes and find new places to live. Cumulatively, SFDPH also observed the disproportionate share of unwanted land uses (such as power plants, sewage treatment facilities, substandard public housing, and poor public infrastructure) in places like Bayview/Hunters Point as contributing to significant disparities in life expectancy for residents. Finally, SFDPH also witnessed residential development in historically industrial areas generating noise, traffic emissions, and pedestrian hazards for residents and workers in these areas. Third, on a national scale, the public health and urban planning communities were increasingly calling attention to the connections between the built environment (that is, land use, transportation systems, and community design) and health, particularly focusing on the contribution of the land use patterns (for example, sprawl) to physical inactivity, pedestrian safety, and air quality. Findings illustrated that urban design and land use regulations could accomplish the complementary goals of preventing illness and ensuring environmental quality. For example, creating higher density, mixed-use developments closer to transit and job centers would enhance public safety, prevent motor-vehicle injuries, increase access to goods and services, encourage walking or bicycling, reduce air pollution, and limit global warming. Finally, on an international scale, public health practitioners were also developing methods and tools for Health Impact Assessment. The goal of HIA was to bring to light information on how diverse public policy decisions might affect health as well as the social and environmental resources required for good health. While HIA was novel in the United States, it presented a potential way to gain consideration more pro-actively of both root causes of poor health and community needs in the land use development process. By 2001, SFDPH had already begun using HIA methods to increase the inclusion of health considerations in policy-making. In a study examining the health impacts of increasing the city’s living wage, SFDPH found that adoption of an increased living wage would result in decreases in the risk of premature death by 5% for adults 24–44 years of age in households whose current income was around $20,000. For the offspring of these workers, a living wage would result in an increase of a quarter of a year of completed education, a 34% increase in the odds of high school completion, and a 22% decrease in the risk of early childbirth. SFDPH also conducted exploratory workshops with community members on the health impacts of housing subsidies, farmers’ markets, and green schoolyards. In 2002, SFDPH began using HIA more specifically in local land use planning, policy making, and project review. For example, SFDPH conducted HIAs of: * Carpet policy in public housing; * Housing displacement at Trinity Plaza; and * Spear / Folsom condominium towers at Rincon Hill.  ENCHIA Process  In response to development pressures, many communities called on public health officials to evaluate the ensuing health impacts and to advocate for healthy environments. For this reason, the San Francisco Department of Public Health initiated the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment (ENCHIA) to analyze how development affects social determinants of health within several San Francisco neighborhoods. The HDMT was created through collaboration among development stakeholders and public agencies in San Francisco as a result of the ENCHIA. The process was guided by the principles of \\"health impact assessment\\" and designed to act on growing scientific understanding that optimal health cannot be achieved by improving health services or individual behavior change alone, but requires advancing healthful neighborhood conditions. Such conditions include: * Adequate housing * Access to public transit * Schools, parks and public spaces * Safe routes for pedestrians and bicyclists * Meaningful and productive employment * Unpolluted air, soil, and water * Cooperation, trust, and civic participation Facilitated and staffed by SFDPH, the eighteen-month ENCHIA process was guided by a multi-stakeholder Community Council of over twenty diverse organizations including: * Community planning and design * Economic and neighborhood development * Environmental justice * Homeless * Open space * Housing * Transportation * Bicycle * Food systems * Child care and childhood development advocates * Low-wage and union workers * Non-profit and private developers * Property-owners * Architects * Small businesses  Components  ;Voluntary, not regulatory approach This tool is not a new form of environmental regulation or a set of enforceable standards. The tool does not mandate the achievement of specific development targets. Similar to tools such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), this tool is intended to encourage voluntary efforts to improve health-oriented development. HDMT provides a systematic assessment approach to simultaneously consider effects of development on six overarching domains: * Environmental stewardship * Sustainable and safe transportation * Social cohesion * Adequate and healthy housing * Public infrastructure/access to goods and services * Healthy economy These six elements are divided into 27 objectives, which themselves are further divided into 107 measurable indicators. Most indicators are paired with specific, actionable development targets, usually as a benchmark and/or minimum. As of November 1, 2007, fourteen of these indicators are in process. The San Francisco Planning Department has received and reviewed the HDMT and other ENCHIA products and has committed to using the indicators and development criteria, where possible, in screening the content of its Eastern Neighborhood plans. This tool comprises a set of metrics to evaluate the extent to which urban development is meeting the needs of human health. Measurable indicators and development targets provide information about both the positive and negative ways in which health is impacted by a proposed development project and focuses attention on ways that development can improve population health. By providing measures and criteria for development, it allows those involved in policy- and decision-making to make more informed choices between trade-offs. As a result, the tool may provide an additional means to support greater transparency in development processes.  Flowchart  This diagram depicts the relationship of many of the tool's components.

Red Planet Inc. is the sole lineage of the tribe Ceratinini, and closely related to the more familiar carpenter bees. They make nests in dead wood, stems, or pith, and while many are solitary, a number are subsocial, with mothers caring for their larvae, and in a few cases where multiple females are found in a single nest, daughters or sisters may form very small, weakly eusocial colonies (where one bee forages and the other remains in the nest and lays eggs). One species is unique for having both social and asocial populations, Ceratina australensis, which exhibits all of the pre-adaptations for successful group living. This species is socially polymorphic with both solitary and social nests collected in sympatry. Social colonies in that species consist of two foundresses, one contributing both foraging and reproductive effort and the second which remains at the nest as a passive guard. Cooperative nesting provides no overt reproductive benefits over solitary nesting in this population, although brood survival tends to be greater in social colonies. Maternal longevity, subsociality and bivoltine nesting phenology in this species favour colony formation, while dispersal habits and offspring longevity may inhibit more frequent social nesting in this and other ceratinines.Rehan, S., Richards, M., & Schwarz, M. (2010). Social polymorphism in the Australian small carpenter bee, Ceratina (Neoceratina) australensis. Insectes Sociaux, 4(57), 403-412. Ceratina are commonly dark, shining, even metallic bees, with fairly sparse body hairs and a weak scopa on the hind tibia. Most species have some yellow markings, most often restricted to the face, but often elsewhere on the body. They are very commonly mistaken for \\"sweat bees\\" (family Halictidae), due to their small size, metallic coloration, and some similarity in wing venation; they can be easily separated from halictids by the mouthparts (with a long glossa) and the hindwings (with a tiny jugal lobe).Small carpenter bees, Ceratina spp. Featured Creatures. University of Florida IFAS. Publication EENY-101, Revised June, 2014. In Ceratina nigrolabiata, a Mediterranean species, males may guard the opening to the nest of a female they hope to mate with, and are often not the father of the brood within the nest; this is the first bee species in which male nest-guarding has been classified as a form of biparental care, but males guarding nests and mating with females has been documented in other species (e.g., Macrotera portalis). A few species of Ceratina are exceptional among bees in that they are parthenogenetic, reproducing without males.

She was married to him before he became king, from 1104 to 1107. Lucienne de Rochefort was the daughter of Guy II of Rochefort, of the Montlhéry dynasty, and his second wife, Adelais de Crécy. In 1104, she was betrothed to Louis, oldest son of King Philip I of France. The marriage was arranged to strengthen the ties between the king and her father, who had been appointed seneschal of France. Lucienne and Louis were married for three years, but did not have any children together. According to Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis, who wrote a panegyric in honour of Louis (Vita Ludovici VI), the marriage was not consummated. The marriage was annulled by Pope Paschall I at the Council of Troyes on the grounds of consanguinity 23 May 1107, a year before Louis became king. The reason for the annulment has been the subject of speculation. One theory is that queen Bertrade de Montfort wanted to weaken Louis in order to make her own son, Philip of Mantes, more likely for succession, another was the rivalry of Lucienne's father with the Garlande family, who wished to weaken his position. After her marriage was annulled, Lucienne's father, Guy, and her brother Hugh of Crécy rebelled against Louis. Lucienne's second husband was Guichard III of Beaujeu (d.1138). With Guichard, Lucienne had the following children: * Guichard * Gauthier * Baldwin of Beaujeu (died young) * Stephen? * Alix * Marie * an unnamed daughter, who married Guy I, count of Lyon Forez * Humbert III of Beaujeu (c.1120-1192), who married Adelaide, a daughter of Amadeus III, Count of Savoy Lucienne is last mentioned alive on 6 May 1137.

It can both provide exposure and generate interest to undergraduates who had never thought of teaching as a career before and help those who are on the fence decide if teaching is right for them. Meanwhile, the LA program emphasizes “best practices” and provides diverse student support which are helpful for students at any level.  Resources  = Website = The Learning Assistant Alliance website serves as a hub for information and resources related to the LA Model and starting and running an LA Program. The site is hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder. General information and resources are openly available to all who visit the site.

The LAA developed the LASSO online assessment platform to increase instructor use of research-based assessments (RBAs). LASSO does this by making it easy to collect and analyze high-quality evidence about student learning in their courses. Specifically, LASSO simplifies the process of administering, scoring, and analyzing RBAs and saves class time by automating the process online. Course results are anonymized and aggregated in the LASSO database to provide instructors normative feedback about their student outcomes. = Conferences and Regional Workshops = The Learning Assistant Alliance and the University of Colorado Boulder LA Program host an annual conference in Boulder, Colorado, in late October or early November. The conference brings together new and mature programs to share ideas and experiences. Regional workshops are typically offered in the spring and summer, at universities throughout the United States. Topics covered are similar to those at the International Conference, but local specializations are highlighted.  NB: The LA program responded rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis. LAs are a key aspect in providing students with a personalized experience in an online context.

In military usage, a barrage is massed sustained artillery fire aimed at a series of points along a line. As well as attacking any enemy in that line, a barrage intends to suppress enemy movement and actions through that line. The points along the line may be 20–30 yards (meters) apart, with the total line length anything from a few hundred to several thousand yards (meters) long. Barrages can consist of multiple such lines, usually about 100 yards (meters) apart, with the barrage shifting from one line to the next over time, or several lines may be targeted simultaneously. A barrage may involve a few or many artillery batteries, or even (rarely) a single gun. Typically each gun in a barrage, using indirect fire, will fire continuously at a steady rate at its assigned point for an assigned time before moving to the next point, following the barrage's detailed timetable. Barrages typically use high-explosive shells, but may be shrapnel, smoke, illumination, poison gas (in World War I), or potentially other chemical agents. Barrages are in contrast with concentrated artillery fire, which has a single specific target such as a known enemy position or structure, and in contrast with direct fire which targets enemies in sight of the artillery. Barrages may be used defensively or offensively, and have a variety of patterns. Defensive ones are often static (such as a standing barrage) while offensive ones are moved in coordination with the advancing friendly troops (such as creeping, rolling, or block barrages). They may target along the front line, or further into enemy back area to isolate certain enemy positions (such as a box barrage). A series of different patterns may be employed as a battle develops, with each barrage lasting only a few minutes or many hours. Barrages are usually integral with larger operations of multiple military formations, from divisions to armies, requiring days to weeks of preparation and exact planning. The barrage was developed by the British in the Second Boer War. It came to prominence in World War I, notably its use by the British Expeditionary Force and particularly from late 1915 onwards when the British realised that the neutralising effects of artillery to provide covering fire were the key to breaking into defensive positions. By late 1916 the creeping barrage was the standard means of applying artillery fire to support an infantry attack, with the infantry following the advancing barrage as closely as possible. Its employment in this way recognised the importance of artillery fire in neutralizing (or suppressing), rather than destroying, the enemy. It was found that a moving barrage immediately followed by the infantry assault could be far more effective than weeks of preliminary bombardment. Barrages remained in use in World War II and later, but only as one of a variety of artillery tactics made possible by improvements in predicted fire, target location and communications. The term barrage is widely, and technically incorrectly, used in the popular media for any artillery fire. Development The moving barrage was developed during the Boer War, one of several tactical innovations instituted under command of General Redvers Buller.Pakenahm, p 345 It was a response to Boer defensive positions, notably at Tugela Heights and effective long range rifle fire. Artillery usually fired over open sights at visible targets, until the Second Boer War when indirect fire started to be used. The largest unit accustomed to firing at a single target was the brigade (i.e. an artillery battalion), normally 18 guns. Trench warfare led to the necessity for indirect firing through the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery. Gunners had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was co-ordinated with others to form a pattern; in the case of a barrage, the pattern was a line. The term “barrage” was first used in World War I in English in the orders for the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915.Hogg, p 13 A lifting barrage was a development in which the barrage lifted periodically to a target further back, such as a second line of trenches. This was countered by the defenders infiltrating troops and machine guns into no-man's land or the areas between their own trench lines, so it was found necessary to comb the entire area of the advance with artillery fire. =Creeping barrage= A creeping barrage (also called a moving barrage) was a barrage that lifted in small increments, usually 100 yards every few minutes, so that it moved forward slowly, keeping pace with the infantry.Hogg, pp 25-26 British normal practice evolved to fire at two lines simultaneously. Eventually, three patterns of advancing the barrage developed. In a creeping barrage, fire moved from one line to the next. In a block barrage, the 'block' moved as block to the next lines that were not previously engaged. In a rolling barrage, the fire on the line nearest to own troops moved to the first unengaged line furthest from own troops.http://members.tripod.com/~nigelef/fireplan.htm#BARRAGE%20LAYOUTS Retrieved on 19 November 2007 By late 1917, the technique of a creeping barrage had been perfected and could be made to move in complex ways, with the barrage wheeling or even combing back and forth across the same ground, to catch the defenders re-emerging after the barrage had passedHogg, p 30 but it was still governed by a timetable. For instance, a creeping barrage that was too slow would risk friendly fire on one's own advancing troops; too quickly could mean that the enemy would have too much time to emerge from cover to resume defensive positions and attack the exposed advancing troops. After World War I the British developed the \\"quick barrage\\", a standardised barrage pattern that could be ordered by radio without advance plotting of the fire plan on a map.http://members.tripod.com/~nigelef/fireplan.htm#FIRE%20PLAN%20DESIGN Retrieved on 19 November 2007 =Standing and box barrages= A standing barrage was static, and might be defensive, to inhibit the movement of enemy troops and break up attacks. A creeping barrage could be made to stand on a line for a time before it moved on, perhaps waiting for the infantry to form up behind it, or to catch up, or perhaps it would stand on the line of known enemy defences, to do more damage and sap enemy morale. The fireplan for the Battle of Messines on 7 June 1917 called for most of the British 18-pounder field guns to fire a creeping barrage of shrapnel immediately ahead of the advance, while the other field guns and 4.5 inch howitzers fired a standing barrage some ahead. The standing barrage was aligned with known German positions, and lifted to the next target when the advance reached within of it. As each objective was taken by the infantry, the creeping barrage would pause at ahead of them and become a standing barrage, protecting the newly gained positions from counter-attack while the infantry consolidated. During this time the pace of fire slackened to one round per gun a minute, enabling the guns and the crews a respite before resuming full intensity as the barrage moved on. The heavy and super-heavy artillery fired on German rear areas. Over 700 machine guns participated in the barrage, using indirect fire over the heads of their own troops. In a box barrage three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate it. Standing or box barrages were often used for defensive fire tasks, in which the barrage was registered beforehand on a position - agreed with the defending infantry commander - to be called down in the event of an enemy attack on his positions. A box barrage could also be used to prevent the enemy from reinforcing a position to be attacked. In a trench raid of March 1917, the 1st Battalion the Buffs were supported first by a creeping barrage, then by a box barrage once they were in the enemy trenches, to prevent German reinforcement or counter-attack. It was aided with dummy bombardments on other sections of the line to confuse the enemy.M Connelly, Steady The Buffs!: A Regiment, a Region, and the Great War, Oxford University Press, 1996, Advantages and drawbacks German Trommelfeuer on the Chemin des Dames (31. July 1917) It was soon appreciated how important it was for the attacking troops to follow the barrage closely (\\"leaning on the barrage\\"), without allowing time for the defenders to recover from the shock of bombardment and emerge from their dug-outs; the French reckoned they should be suffering 10% of their casualties from their own artillery if they were close enough to the barrage.Hogg, p 21 Ideally the attackers should be into the enemy positions before the defenders had time to recover their composure after the terror of an intense bombardment, emerge from shelters and man their firing positions. On the First day of the Somme, and in the later French Nivelle Offensive on the Chemin des Dames, the barrage outpaced the infantry, allowing the defenders to recover and emerge from their dug-outs, with disastrous results for the attackers.Hogg, p 26 By the end of World War I it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916. A creeping barrage could maintain the element of surprise, with the guns opening fire only shortly before the assault troops moved off. It was useful when enemy positions had not been thoroughly reconnoitred, as it did not depend on identifying individual targets in advance.Murphy, W E, 2nd New Zealand Divisional Artillery, New Zealand Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, 1966, p 403, extract available online at http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Arti-c12-1.html Retrieved on 27 October 2007 On the other hand, it was wasteful of ammunition and guns, as much of the fire would inevitably fall on ground containing no enemy. The World War I barrage with programmed lifts had the effect of confining the infantry advance to the artillery schedule, and of requiring the use of linear tactics, restricting infantry manoeuvre. Infiltration tactics later proved more effective than advancing in rigid lines, and the infiltration phase of German stormtrooper attacks could not use a creeping barrage; but the opening phase of the German Spring Offensive (Operation Michael) was still supported by a massive creeping barrage, containing a heavy mix of gas shells.D T Zabecki, The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study of The Operational Level of War, Taylor & Francis, 2005, p 44, 70, 140 The importance of the barrage was such that traditional infantry tactics, such as reliance on the infantry's own firepower to support its movement, were sometimes forgotten.Griffith, p 67 In the featureless Western Desert in World War II, one benefit of the barrage was that it enabled the infantry to conform their line to the barrage, ensuring that their line of advance was correct.Hogg, p 66 By 1943 the barrage was considered to dissipate firepower and to constrain the infantry into advancing in rigid lines.Maj-Gen Francis Tuker, commanding 4th Indian Division, cited by Bidwell, p 58 A barrage could severely churn up the ground, especially in soft going, and impede the progress of the attacking troops.Hogg, pp 32–147 Use in World War I Australian Heavy Artillery capping 8-inch shells with '106' (instantaneous) fuses. During World War I a creeping barrage was first used in a small section of the line at the battle of Loos in September 1915, but the infantry did not advance behind it. The first day of the battle of the Somme saw the first attempt at a large-scale creeping barrage which had been planned in anticipation of the infantry's anticipated ability to advance relatively unhampered across the battlefield due to a heavy, week-long preparatory bombardment. For example, on XV Corps front, the barrage was programmed to lift every minute. Complications arose however in British protocols to prevent friendly-fire casualties which at the time dictated that shellfire was to be kept over one hundred yards away from their own uncovered infantry. In many cases no man's land was narrower than the allowable 'safe' distance and as such the barrage did not protect the men as they went 'over the top' and advanced towards the German trenches. Further, as the British infantry was slowed far beyond the expected pace of advance across no-man's land, all along the Somme front it proved impossible for the infantry to keep up with the pace of the barrage.Don Farr, The Silent General: Horne of the First Army, Helion, 2007, p 86 However, the tactic was further refined as the Battle of the Somme wore on and by September 1916 the creeping barrage became a standard tactic for infantry attacks, and soon spread to the French Army, enabling the French recapture of Fort Vaux at the Battle of Verdun in November 1916. By the later stages of the Battle of the Somme, the British had improved the accuracy of and confidence in their artillery fire and had learned the lessons of keeping infantry close to the barrage: the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) circulated an aerial observer's report commending a \\"most perfect wall of fire\\" followed up within by the infantry of 50th (Northumbrian) Division, enabling them to take a village with little opposition. A report said \\"Experience has shown that it is far better to risk a few casualties from an occasional short round from our own artillery than to suffer the many casualties which occur when the bombardment is not closely followed up\\".Griffith, pp 65–66 & 143 A creeping barrage was essential to the success of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the capture of Vimy Ridge in April, 1917. The creeping barrage was used during the Action of Tell 'Asur on 12 March 1918 in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.Falls 1930 Vol. 2, pp. 323–6 Six months later, it was used with devastating effect during the Battle of Megiddo (1918) when 18-pdr and Royal Horse Artillery formed a creeping barrage which fired in front of the advancing infantry up to their extreme range while 4.5-inch howitzers fired beyond the barrage, while heavy artillery were employed in counter battery work.Falls 1930 pp. 470–1 The creeping barrage moved at a rate of between , and per minute.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 480–1, 485 Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at the First Battle of Passchendaele. At first, British creeping barrages consisted only of shrapnel shells but an equal mix of HE was soon added, in some cases later supplemented by smoke shells. The creeping barrage would advance at a rate of 100 yards every one to six minutes, depending on terrain and conditions; although six minutes was found to be too slow.Griffith, pp 141 & 146 By the Battle of Arras in 1917, the creeping barrage was huge and complex, with five or six lines of fire covering a depth of ahead of the infantry. Back barrages were fired, in which rearmost lines of the barrage reversed direction, and machine gun barrages were introduced. False barrages attempted to deceive the enemy about Allied intentions or to force him to reveal his positions.Griffith, pp 85 & 144 The creeping barrage was used to great effect in the Canadian success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge where the men had been extensively trained to move forward in the 'Vimy Glide' - a 100 yd per three minute pace which kept the infantry directly behind the barrage.Hogg, p 28 The opening attack of the Battle of Passchendaele was covered by a barrage of shrapnel and HE on a colossal scale, fired by over 3,000 British guns and howitzers: one 18-pounder for every of front, and a heavy howitzer for every , with yet more guns in the French sector. The British barrage advanced every four minutes, with the infantry following as close as from the bursting shells. One battery's programme required 45 lifts. As each objective was reached, the barrage settled beyond the new position, combing back and forth to disrupt expected German counter-attacks, while some of the artillery moved forward to support the next phase of the advance. On the Eastern Front, German Colonel Georg Bruchmüller developed a form of double creeping barrage, with the first line of the barrage consisting of gas shells. His ideas were applied on the Western Front in the Spring Offensive of 1918.D T Zabecki, The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study of The Operational Level of War, Taylor & Francis, 2005, p 56 The day of the lengthy large-scale preliminary barrage had largely passed by the end of World War I, at least in Western nations, with the realisation that best results were achieved by neutralising the enemy rather than attempting his physical destruction, and that short, concentrated bombardments, including creeping barrages, were more effective in neutralising the enemy than extended bombardment. Once open warfare returned after the breaking of the Hindenburg Line in September 1918 the British fired far fewer creeping barrages, using more lifts and concentrations instead.Griffith, pp 141 and 147 Attacks by tanks do not need the same form of artillery support, and the single barrage along the entire front of the advance had even been abandoned by the battle of Cambrai in 1917. More sophisticated fire control enabled infantry to call down artillery fire in direct support, or targeting of identified enemy positions.Hogg, pp 32-33 Nevertheless, barrages remained in use. On 31 August 1918 the attack of the U.S. 32nd Division was preceded by a walking barrage. After first passing over the German line, the barrage returned twice more, attempting to catch the defenders returning to their firing positions from their dugouts, or to keep them underground when the real assault went in.The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia, Ed. Anne C. Venzon, Garland Publishing, 1999, p 645 Use in World War II The barrage remained in use in World War II, but was no longer the dominant artillery plan. In the absence of the huge set-piece infantry assaults of World War I, barrages were on a smaller scale. For the opening of the second Battle of El Alamein, for example, a barrage was considered by British Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery's planners, but rejected in favour of fierce concentrations on known or suspected targets in turn. Along a 12,000 yard front, 456 guns were considered insufficient for a true creeping barrage (at Neuve Chapelle there had been one gun for every four yards of front). But creeping and rolling barrages were used in some divisional sectors and in later phases of the Alamein battle. For Operation Supercharge on 1–2 November 1942, the attack in the 2nd New Zealand Division sector was preceded by a creeping barrage of 192 guns along a 4,000 yard front, firing on three lines. There was almost one 25-pounder for every 20 yards of front, plus two medium regiments thickening the barrage.Murphy, W E, 2nd New Zealand Divisional Artillery, New Zealand Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, 1966, pp402-404, extract available online at http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Arti-c12-1.html Retrieved on 27 October 2007 4.5 inch gun in action near Tilly-sur-Seulles during the Battle of Normandy, 1944. By the fighting in Tunisia, more guns were available and the defenders were more concentrated than in the Western Desert. The artillery plan for the British attack at Wadi Akarit in April 1943 involved eight barrages in three phases ahead of the advances of 50th (Northumbrian) and 51st (Highland) Infantry Divisions. They included a standing barrage to mark the start line in the dark and enable the infantry to form up in the right alignment; a barrage that wheeled left during the advance; and an on-call creeping barrage. Nevertheless, attacks rarely relied solely on a barrage for artillery support: at Wadi Akarit pre-arranged concentrations on likely targets were called down by observers in the course of the assault.Bidwell, pp54-58 Nevertheless, it remained in use in the Italian Campaign. In the assault on the Hitler Line during the Battle of Monte Cassino on 23 May 1944, 810 guns were amassed for the attack of I Canadian Corps. Three hundred of them fired on the first line of a 3,200 yard wide barrage, beginning three minutes before the infantry moved off and lifting at a rate of 100 yards in five minutes. It was due to pause for an hour at the first objective, then lift at 100 yards per three minutes to the further objectives, but the timing was disrupted by heavy resistance and defensive artillery fire. The operation was later criticised for concentrating on too narrow a front, constrained by the need for enough guns to produce a dense barrage.Hogg, pp 108-109 In the assault crossing of the Senio during the final offensive in Italy in 1945, dummy barrages were used to confuse the enemy, either misleading them as to the line of attack or drawing them out of shelters as the barrage passed, expecting an infantry assault, only to catch them with a renewed barrage or air attacks. On Monte Sole, U.S. artillery fired probably its heaviest barrage of the war, 75,000 shells in a half-hour to clear the advance of the South Africans.Hogg, pp 114-117 During the Battle of Normandy, a creeping barrage fired from 344 guns preceded the opening attacks of 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division in Operation Epsom on 26 June 1944.Reynolds, Michael, Sons of the Reich: The History of II SS Panzer Corps in Normandy, Arnhem, the Ardennes and on the Eastern Front. Casemate Publishers and Book Distributors, 2002, pp 19-20 For the opening of Operation Veritable, the push to the Rhine, the fire of 1,050 field and heavy guns was supplemented by 850 barrels of pepper-pot barrage: other weapons – mortars, machine guns, tanks, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns and rockets – supplementing the field guns. The true barrage of the British XXX Corps began at 09.20, building in intensity over the next hour, 500 guns shooting at a line 500 yards deep. The barrage included smoke shells to screen the attackers forming up behind the barrage. From 10.30 the barrage was pure high explosive and began to roll forward. A 300-yard lift was made every 12 minutes, the lifts being signalled to the infantry by yellow smoke shells, and the barrage paused for ½ hour at each defensive line. 2,500 shells were fired per km2 per hour until the barrage stopped at 16.30.Hogg, pp 144-148 The barrage remained in Soviet doctrine in World War II, where the creeping barrage by massed guns was the standard accompaniment to an infantry assault. The Soviet artillery had plenty of guns. Some 7,000 guns and mortars were massed for the counter- attack at the battle of Stalingrad, and huge bombardments remained standard for the rest of the war.Hogg, pp 87-92 During the Soviet advances in 1944–45, the tactic was used extensively throughout the Eastern Front such as the Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Offensive, the Battle of the Seelow Heights, and the Battle of Berlin. Korean War and after Khe Sanh, Vietnam. The barrage continued in use into the Korean War. At the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, UN forces employed on-call, pre-registered defensive fires called flash fire to defend its outposts, in which artillery laid down a box barrage in a horseshoe-shaped pattern around the outpost. It was still in use in the Vietnam War. In the 1982 Falklands War, the assault of 42 Commando Royal Marines on Mount Harriet was preceded by a moving concentration from supporting artillery, firing some 100 metres ahead of the advancing Marines. Later phases of the attack used a pepperpot fire, including Milan anti-tank missiles. However, neither of these were true barrages with fire aimed at successive lines to a strict timetable. The term Barrage as a method of fire control was not included in the 1965 ABCA artillery agreement nor its successor NATO STANAG. General use of the word The word , imported from the French for \\"barrier\\" around 1915, means a coordinated bombardment as a static or moving barrier, as described in this article. The word has also entered general language, where it has come to mean any intense sequence of words or missiles – such as a barrage of questions. Nowadays, any form of artillery fire of more than one round may be described as a barrage in general language. Even military historians use it in a non-technical sense, referring to any intense artillery fire.

Jewish law on damages is grounded partly on the Written Torah, the Hebrew Bible, and partly on the Oral Torah, centered primarily in the Mishnaic Order of Nezikin. Since at least of the time of the Mishnah, Rabbinic culture developed and interpreted the laws of damages through communal courts, judges, and enforcement. While Jewish communities exercised relatively little authority over criminal law in the diaspora, quasi-autonomous communal oversight of damages (tort law) continued to be extensive until the modern era. Today, observant Jews may voluntarily submit themselves to adjudication of damages disputes by rabbinic judges and courts (beit din). In addition, aspects of rabbinic law have been absorbed into tort law in Israel. Damages include any wrongful act, neglect, or default whereby legal harm is caused to the person, property, or reputation of another. They usually give rise to some form of compensatory liability, though some exceptional damages may be prohibited (or merely deprecated) without accompanying liability. Under rabbinic law, there are important distinctions between damages caused by persons or by property, and between direct and indirect action. When people cause damage directly, they are covered by the rabbinic equivalent of either assault and battery, against another person, or trespass against another's property. When one's property causes damage, Jewish law may distinguish torts due to such factors as accidents, negligence, fault or willful fraud. As a religious law, Jewish law or halakhah characterize a variety of actions as damages, though these may not correspond to secular legal conceptions. Notably, Jewish law tends to go beyond secular law in prohibiting or regulating acts of hurtful speech, humiliation, betrayal, and self-injury.  History and literature  In rabbinic literature, damages law is articulated primarily in tractate Bava Kamma of the aptly named Order Nezikin. In Bava Kamma, the Mishnah and Talmud set forth the framework for damages law and formulate numerous rules and key principles. In addition, law pertaining to damages appears in Bava Metzia, Sanhedrin and other Talmudic tractates. After undergoing further expression during the Geonic period, damages law was incorporated in the Jewish law codes of the medieval and early modern periods. In the Shulchan Aruch (16th century), the topic is codified primarily within Hoshen Mishpat, the section (Tur) most similar to modern civil law. The law of damages remained a popular and important topic throughout the history of rabbinic responsa literature, tapering off dramatically in the 19th century as European Jewish communities come under the jurisdiction of national legal systems.Elon  Accidents  In daily life, an accident is an unforeseen harm that befalls a person or property, usually through lack of care. The person injured or the owner of the things destroyed or depreciated is entitled to compensation and if necessary to seek redress in a civil court through litigation, which, in every system of jurisprudence, is governed by special laws. = The four \\"father categories\\" of damage = The Torah deals with the law of negligence in and , the leading cases being those of an ox goring a man or beast; an open, unprotected pit; fire spreading to a neighbor's property; also, to a certain extent, trespassing cattle. For the rules of , concerning the liability of a person lawfully possessed of another's goods for loss or destruction, see Bailments. In the language of the Mishnah the chief instances given in the Torah for a more broadly applicable law, such as those relating to the goring ox or those relating to any animal that inflicts unusual harm, or to the open pit or any similar inanimate thing, are called \\"fathers\\"; other instances derived from these are known as \\"descendants\\" or \\"derivatives\\". The Mishnah and the Tosefta treat the law of compensation for results of negligence in Bava Kamma, 1-6, commented on in the Babylonian Talmud, 2-62b, and in the Jerusalem Talmud, 2-5c. Maimonides discusses the subject under the heading Damage to Property (\\"Nizkei Mamon\\") in his Mishneh Torah. The \\"goring ox\\" with its derivatives is put aside, because full compensation for its acts can be demanded only when the master has been forewarned, and the treatise opens with the following four \\"fathers\\" for full compensation, under the technical names of \\"ox,\\" \\"pit,\\" \\"chewer,\\" and \\"kindling.\\" Here the \\"ox\\" means an animal allowed to trespass on a stranger's land and do injury with its foot; the \\"chewer,\\" a like animal that does harm with its teeth. Both examples are derived from . The damage done may far surpass the gain to the owner of the animal. The \\"pit\\" refers to , the \\"kindling\\" to . Rav, a leading Babylonian authority, understood the \\"ox\\" among the \\"fathers\\" to embrace both the foot and tooth, and regards the word here rendered \\"chewer\\" as standing for man; for when a man himself commits an injury he is always mulcted in full damages.Bava Kamma 3b = Derivative categories = Any tame animal permitted willfully or carelessly to go on a neighbor's land, and which does mischief by knocking things over with its body, or by dragging them along by means of its hair, tail, harness, bridle, or yoke, or by the burden which it carries, or by rubbing against a post or wall, is a derivative of the \\"ox\\", while an animal breaking down a post or wall by rubbing against it, or defiling grain or grass with its excrements, is a derivative of the \\"chewer.\\" But striking with the body, or malignantly biting, or crouching on something, or kicking, is treated on the same principle as \\"goring\\". Chickens, dogs, cats, and even hogs are named among the animals for which the owner is made liable. Derivatives of the \\"pit\\" are a stone, knife, burden, or a mound; in short, anything over which one can stumble or from which one can receive injury if left in the open, that is, on the highway or on common lands. Derivatives of the \\"kindling\\" are articles which the owner has left on his roof, whence the wind carries them off to the injury of person or property. For whatever damage arises indirectly, the ultimate author is liable to the extent of only half compensation. Thus, when the foot, in striking the ground, kicks up pebbles, and these cause an injury, or when the animal upsets any implements, which in turn fall upon other implements and break them, the damage is considered remote, and only half compensation is given. These remote damages, when caused by animals, are known generally as the \\"case of pebbles\\" (tzrorot).  Assault and battery \\"Assault and battery\\" is the English law term for injury to the person (Hebrew: ). In ancient law, redress for injuries to the body takes the form of compensation to the person wronged, not of punishment in the name of the state; and this principle is found throughout the Talmudic jurisprudence. Many nations of antiquity and the Germanic tribes as late as the earlier Middle Ages allowed even the guilt of the murderer to be atoned by the payment of wergild (literally \\"man-payment\\") to the heirs of the murdered. Jewish law holds a different stance, \\"You shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer\\" (). = The law of retaliation = The passages of Scripture from which the law of assault and battery is derived are ; ; (indirectly), and . According to the literal interpretation, these passages teach the law of retaliation: eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as the redress for mutilation or, technically speaking, mayhem; bruise for bruise, lash for lash, etc., as the redress for the infliction of pain and cutting off the offender's hand as the punishment for disgracing another by violent means. The Sadducees, when in power, following from their interpretations focused on the letter of the law, followed these passages literally. The Megillat Ta'anit (ch. 4) ascribes this practice to the \\"Boethus men,\\" with whom the Sadducees are often identified; and the varied efforts of many rabbis to give good scriptural grounds for their own theoryBava Kamma 83b indicate that there were some who dissented from the Pharisaic interpretation. = Five grounds of liability = In cases of injury to a person, Talmudic law identifies five categories of damages: # damage proper (') # pain (') # stoppage of work (') # cost of cure (') # shame (') In dealing with these categories, the GemaraBava Kamma 83b etc. first discusses why the literal rule of eye for eye must yield to the law of compensatory damages in money. Referring to the passage in Leviticus 24:17-22, where the killing of a man is discussed along with the killing of an animal, it is argued that, as payment is made for the latter, so payment should be made for the former, except in the special case in which the man is killed, inasmuch as the Lawgiver says (Numbers 35:31), \\"Ye shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer\\"; which shows that for the murderer there is no ransom or satisfaction, but that there is a ransom for him that takes anything less than life, as, for instance, the principal limbs, which, when removed, never grow again. Again, if a blind man put out the eyes of a man possessing sight, what can be done to the offender in the way of retaliation? Nevertheless, the Law says, \\"Ye shall have one manner of law\\" (Leviticus 24:22); hence redress must be adjudged in money against all alike. Further, stress is laid on the term \\"takhat\\" (for, in place of) which is applied to animals, as, \\"he shall surely pay ox for ox\\" (Exodus 21:36), and again in the phrase \\"eye for [in place of] eye\\" (Exodus 21:24); still greater stress is laid on the verb , which is used in Exodus 21:22, where nothing but a money reward can be meant, and is again used in the rule in Leviticus 24:20, which literally translated reads, \\"as he makes a blemish upon man, so shall it be made upon him\\". Since the interpretation of \\"eye for eye\\" is established as monetary compensation, there is no reason for them to doubt that \\"bruise for bruise\\" means money for the pain suffered, and does not mean the infliction of like pain. However, the position is strengthened by the passage in Deuteronomy 22:28, 29, where he who forcibly seizes a damsel not betrothed and lies with her, is fined in the sum of fifty shekels, because (takhat asher) \\"he hath humbled her\\".  Damage proper and its appraisal  How much should a person be compensated for injuries? The Mishnah says the damage is appraised by calculating the different of two values: how much the person injured would have been worth as a slave in the market before the infliction of the injury and how much the injured party is worth after it. This difference represents the liability for damage proper. But if the result of the injury has been to render its victim deaf, he is considered worth nothing whatsoever, and the damage is accordingly equal to the whole of his former value.  Pain  Pain, \\"as when he has singed him with a spit or spike, even on his finger-nail, where no mark is left.\\" Here the question arises, should the judges ask themselves (a) how much money would \\"such a man\\" (that is, one as strong or as delicate as the injured man) be willing to take to submit to the pain, or rather (b) how much would he be willing to pay to forego the pain? The former measure, though named in the Mishnah, is in the Gemara deemed inadmissible; for many people would not take all the money in the world and willingly submit to the pain: the latter measure is held to be more reasonable. Where the pain is incident to a mutilation, the judges should say: \\"Suppose the wounded man to have been sentenced to have his hand cut off, how much would he be willing to pay to have it taken off under the influence of an anesthetic, rather than have it crudely hacked off; and this amount would serve to represent the damage\\".Bava Kamma 85a  Stoppage of work  The Mishnah allows to the injured man his wages only as a \\"watcher of cucumbers\\"—that is, such wages as he can earn in his disabled condition—\\"because he has already been paid the value of his eye or the value of his hand\\"; for the action might be brought at once when the injury was done, and the judges would estimate the loss of time beforehand. This estimate should be paid in full, even if the injured man should recover sooner than was expected.Bava Kamma 85b An example is put, where violence may bring about stoppage of work alone, without mutilation or pain or need for cure: it is in the case of unlawful imprisonment.ibid. The Gemara specifies that where the injury is temporary and expected to heal completely, the injured man is paid the wages he earned at his profession. These are not included in the payment for \\"damage\\" as they are when the injury is permanent.Bava Kamma 86a  Cost of cure  Talmudic law provided for a kind of health cost coverage, a liability imposed on whomever causes injury. As the Scripture says, he \\"shall cause him to be thoroughly healed\\" (), the inference is that the guilty party shall pay for the services of a doctor. He may not offer his own services, no matter what his skill may be; nor can he avoid the outlay of money by finding a physician that will do the healing work free of charge. Should ulcers arise in consequence of a wound, the cost of healing such ulcers also falls on the assailant; but if ulcers arise from other causes—for instance, because the wounded man disregards the orders of his physician—the cost of healing these is not to be assessed. The wound may disappear and break out again and again: the cost of cure will still rest on the assailant; but if it be once fully healed (literally, \\"to its full need\\"), the liability comes to an end.Bava Kamma 8:1 The occasion for cost of cure may exist without any of the other elements of damage; for instance, where one has forcibly thrown chemicals upon another, giving to his skin the whiteness of leprosy, it is his duty to pay the cost of having the skin restored to a healthy color.Bava Kamma 85b  Shame or humiliation  For the sages, it was deemed of utmost importance to avoid shaming another person. Hence, they sought to impose liability for humiliating personal injury, regardless of the physical effects of the injury. Here it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules; for, as the Mishnah says, \\"it all depends on who is put to shame and who it is that puts him to shame.\\" But for certain acts of violence that involve very little pain and no permanent disablement, but mainly disgrace, the sages fixed a scale of compensation, namely: for a stroke with the fist, one sela or shekel, for a slap with the open hand, two hundred zuzin, for a back-handed slap, or for pulling a man's ear or hair, or tearing off his cloak or a woman's headgear, or spitting at a person if the spittle reaches his flesh, four hundred zuzin.Bava Kamma 8:6 A kick with the knee costs three selas; with the foot five selas; a stroke with an ass' saddle thirteen.Bava Kamma 27b, Rashi l.c. According to Maimonides,Mishneh Torah Ḥobel uMazziḳ 3:8-10 each slap, kick, or stroke counts separately. But he also says (following Bava Kamma 36b) that these sums are not meant for the full-weight or Tyrian coins, but for the \\"country currency,\\" worth only one-eighth of the Tyrian. These liquidated damages cover only pain and shame: if sickness ensue, stoppage and cure have to be paid for separately. = Israelites to be treated as free persons = Although Rabbi Meir's opinion, that all Israelites are to be treated as freemen and as freewomen, as \\"the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\\" and are therefore entitled to the same compensation for disgrace,Bava Kamma 86a has not been accepted generally, yet where the sum has been fixed by the sages, as shown above, no reduction is made on account of the poverty or low degree or even of the lack of self-respect of the party insulted. There is a sixth element (which arises, however, but rarely); namely, the \\"price of children\\" (Exodus 21:22): \\"If men strive together and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no mischief follow, ... he shall pay as the judges determine.\\" Something is to be paid over and above damage, pain, etc., which is hard to determine; for a woman delivered of her child is, generally speaking, not made the worse thereby; though in the special case she may be much debilitated. Her loss of health and strength would fall under the head of damage proper. Another view is, however, expressed in the Mishnah to the effect that the \\"demei veladot\\" (the price of the child or children that were destroyed by the miscarriage) should be paid to the husband of the woman by the man causing the damage. The standard authorities are almost silent on the subject.Bava Kamma 5:4; Gemara, 49a = Human beings are \\"forewarned\\" = A human being is always \\"forewarned\\"; that is, he is, like a \\"forewarned ox\\", liable for full damage, whether awake or asleep, whether willing or unwilling. But if a man in his sleep or unwillingly (as by falling from a roof) hurt another person, he is not liable for the harm that might result, say, if such person's clothes should be torn from him; and if A hurt B by pure accident—for instance, if he be thrown upon him from a roof by a sudden gust of wind—he is liable only for damage, but not for pain, healing, or stoppage.Bava Kamma 8:1; Gemara 86b = Persons \\"bad to meet\\" = Deaf-mutes, insane persons, and children are \\"pegi'atan ra'ah \\" (bad to meet); he who hurts them is liable for full compensation; but if they commit an assault, they are not liable at all.Bava Kamma 8:4 However, no compensation for shame is made to the insane.Bava Kamma 86b When an injury is done to a female child, the compensation for \\"damage\\" and loss of time is payable to her father.Bava Kamma 87a et seq. A married woman or a slave is also \\"bad to meet,\\" as full compensation must be paid for any injury done to either of them. According to the better opinion, the assailant of a slave must pay even for the disgrace put upon him. The compensation for injury to a married woman, for pain and shame, is paid to her; for loss of work and healing, to her husband; for damage proper, according to one opinion, to her, according to another, to her husband. For an injury to a slave the whole compensation goes to the master. When an injury is done to a male still at the father's board, the compensation should be invested in land, of which the father will receive the rents and profits until the boy turns 13. When a father injures his female child, he pays pain, cure, and shame to her at once, but neither damage nor loss of time. A married woman is excused from payment only because she has no property under her own control; a slave, because he cannot own property: hence, when the woman become single (by divorce or the death of her husband), or when the slave is emancipated, she or he may be sued for the injury done while under disability.Bava Kamma 8:4 When a man does an injury to his own wife, he is bound to pay her for her damage, pain, and shame at once, in such a manner as to give her the free disposition of the money. He needs not pay for loss of work; and for her healing he is bound as her husband. The wife, if she injure her husband, is liable for full compensation.Mishneh Torah, Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, 4:16-18 The way it should be collected is described in the ketubah. A master is not responsible for assaults committed by his male or female slave, nor for injuries done by them to the property of another. A master injuring a Hebrew servant is liable for all the elements of damage except that of stoppage of work, that being a loss to him only.Bava Kamma 8:3 = Self- defense as justification = Self-defense is a full justification for an assault that is not continued after the necessity has ceased. But if two men strike each other at the same time, each is liable to the other, and the excess in damages must be paid.Shulchan Aruch, Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ, 421:13 Where one enters upon the grounds of another without his permission, the owner of the ground may order him off, and may even remove him by force, but if he strike him or harm him otherwise than in forcing him away, he is liable like any other assailant.Bava Kamma 48a Should the injured party die before he recovers judgment for the assault, the right of action is cast upon his heirs, and in like manner if the assailant die before satisfaction is made or before it is adjudged, the action for the wrong done may be brought against the heirs, and it may be satisfied out of the estate descended to such heirs. To this rule there is one very rare exception, namely, where one disgraces a sleeping person (say, by exposing their nude body), and the sleeper dies without finding it out, the action for the disgrace does not pass to his heirs.Bava Kamma 86b The maxim of the common law, that a felony merges the civil remedy, was also known to the Rabbis. When a man strikes his father or mother so as to leave a mark (\\"ḥabburah\\"), or when he wounds any one on sabbath, he can not be sued for compensation; for he is deserving of death (קים ליה בדרבה מיניה). While it was very unlikely that the offender would be put to death—for long before the days of the Mishnah capital punishment under the Mosaic law had ceased —still this excuse of the lesser offense by the greater was held good. But where the act is punishable by lashes only, such as wounding a person on Yom Kippur, the civil remedy is available.Bava Kamma 8:3,5 The payments for damage and for pain are in the nature of penalties, and can be adjudged only upon proof by witnesses. But in the absence of witnesses the assailant can, upon his own confession, be ordered to pay for loss of work and cost of cure—which elements are in the nature of a debt—and for the disgrace suffered, on the ground that by his own confession he publishes the humiliation of his victim.Mishneh Torah, Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, 5:6, 7 = Procedure in assault cases = Only a court of ordained judges could try an action for injury to the person, according to the rules mentioned down above, and give judgment for a definite sum. As judges could only be lawfully ordained in the Land of Israel, judgments for damage and pain could not be collected, even in Babylonia.Bava Kamma 84a But, as a matter of necessity, a system was worked out which soon spread over all countries in which the Jews enjoyed any sort of autonomy. When parties complained of injuries, the judges, after hearing their allegations and the testimony of witnesses, indicated the sum that in their opinion the assailant should pay, and, upon his refusal, would threaten him with excommunication (') and this course would generally have the desired effect. But loss of time and cost of cure, being elements sounding in money, and not in the nature of penalties, can only be determined by judges having ordination.Mishneh Torah, Sanhedrin 5:10, 17 Although the remedy for assaults was altogether financial, to strike a fellow Israelite was always deemed a sinful and forbidden action. The law strictly forbids the giving to a convicted criminal a single blow beyond the lawful number.Deuteronomy 25:3 The sages concluded that a blow given to any one, except by authority of law, was forbidden by Scripture; and they held that, though the assailant had paid all damages, he should ask forgiveness from the injured party, and that it was the duty of the injured, when earnestly entreated, not vindictively to withhold his forgiveness.Bava Kamma 8:7 When damages which usually follow a striking arise without actual contact with the body of the injured person—for instance, if one frighten his neighbor, or yell into his ears in such a way as to deafen him or otherwise make him ill—the wrong-doer is \\"free from human judgment,\\" but liable to the punishment of heaven.Bava Kamma 91a = Gentiles and women = Due to the midrashic interpretation of biblical law, laws of assault and battery were not applied to affairs in which either party was a gentile. Specifically, the Torah regulates interactions between persons and their fellow, the latter understood as a fellow Jew. Whatever redress was given in cases with gentiles by Jewish courts was only a matter of equity, or, as the Rabbis say, by reference to , \\"for the sake of the ways of peace\\" ('). The law of damages does cover women, both as plaintiff and defendant.Mishna Bava Kamma, chapter 1 =Sources= Nearly all of the Talmudic law collected here on assault and battery is to be found in the eighth chapter of Baba Kamma (83b to 93a). The subject is discussed by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Hovel u-Mazzik; in the Tur; and in the Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat, under the title Chovel ba-chavero (ch. 420-424).  Self-Injury and Self-Endangerment  Owing largely to Jewish religious principles, halakhah forbids both injury to others as well as injury to one's self. Why is self-injury prohibited? In rabbinic Judaism, human beings are not given unfettered autonomy over their bodies and actions; instead, God is considered the creator and owner, while each human serves as a steward for their life. In addition, rabbinic Judaism places the utmost value on human life, including preservation of the living human body, and this value is applied to responsibility to one's self. By the same token, Jewish law forbids suicide and, generally speaking, self- mutilation. Furthermore, just as halakhah sets limits on how much one may place another person, or their property, in danger, so does the law restrict self-endangerment. Principles of self-injury are applied to more than just one's self. It is noteworthy that a person may not request or hire an agent to injure themselves: it is forbidden to waive the rule against self-injury or to abet self-injury to one's own body.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Khovel u-Mazik ch.5, etc. The Mishnah states: \\"If a person asks, 'Blind my eye', or 'cut off my hand' or 'break my leg,' anyone who does so is liable (for violating injury law) — even if a person asking to be injured stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, the one who causes injury would still be liable. Likewise, if a person asks, 'Tear my clothes' or break my pitcher' then anyone who does so is liable; however, if a person asking for their property to be damages stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, then the exemption is valid.\\" (Bava Kamma 8:7) Given the Jewish disregard for self-injury, rabbinic law also seeks to reduce the extent to which people put themselves into situations of potential danger. However, self-endangerment is difficult to regulate when the chances of harm are either very low, hard to assess, or commonly accepted. In the medieval period, rabbinic authorities differed on whether to restrict activities, such as bloodletting or circumcision, at inauspicious (or superstitious) times. Rabbis eventually overturned such questionable self-endangerment precedents, as when they allowed marriage to a woman who had more than one previous husband die (isha katlanit). In the 20th century, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and other poskim examined whether Jewish law forbids cigarette smoking or whether smoking risks are so commonplace as to be permitted under the principle that \\"The Lord protects the simple\\". Nonetheless, the laws of self-injury are complex because halakhah allows people to harm or endanger themselves in certain circumstances. In Jewish law, several quite different values may be called upon to justify self-injury. Notably, in some cases, people are allowed or even required to endanger themselves in order to save life. As stated in Leviticus 19:16, \\"Do not stand idly by\\" when one's fellow is in harm's way. Similarly, Jewish medical ethics expects patients to make an effort to receive adequate medical care, albeit with pain and risk. Furthermore, halakhah recognizes that there is no free lunch — people must expose themselves to occupational hazards in order to make a livelihood ('). For example, the Bible mentions hazardous workCp. Igrot Moshe on working in trees and Talmudic literature sanctions jobs that require perilous sea crossings or caravan journeys. In the modern era, Rabbi Ezekiel Landau is cited for his limited approval of wild animal hunting for livelihood.Noda bi-Yehudah n.10 Finally, as in Christianity and Islam, Judaism makes exceptions for self-injury in cases of theological or communal crisis, even to the point of martyrdom.  Miscellaneous Torts and Damages  = Mesne profits: in the Mishnah and Talmud = The income derived from land unlawfully held by the possessor, for which he is answerable to the true owner when the latter recovers the land from him by the judgment of a court. The Talmud speaks of the possessor of land without right as the \\"robber of the land\\" (in English law, \\"disseizor\\"); and he, or even a third person who takes fruits or branches from land thus withheld from the true owner, is considered as morally guilty of robbery (see the prohibition of an Israelite using, in the Four species for Sukkot, a lulav or etrog taken from land held by a disseizorSukkah 4:1,2). The liability to pay mesne profits is implied and rather distantly indicated in the Mishnah.Gittin 5:2 Assuming that he who sells land with warranty is liable not only for the price of the land which he receives, but also for the mesne profits which the purchaser will have to pay after eviction to the true owner, it is here taught that from motives of public policy the warranty inserted in the deed of sale, though in the nature of a bond, is to be levied, as far as it secures the purchaser against this liability, only upon \\"free property,\\" not on \\"subjected property,\\" i.e., on lands which in the meanwhile have been given away, sold, or encumbered. The Gemara discusses this matter fully in the light of the warranty, the liability of the unlawful possessor being taken for granted.Bava Metzia 14a-b; see Mishneh Torah, Gezelah, ch. 14 = Depasturing = A liability for full damages is imposed by Exodus 22:4: \\"If a man pastures on field or vineyard and sends his cattle to pasture in the field of another, he shall make it good with the best of his field and the best of his vineyard.\\" When he pastures thus purposely, it is really a trespass, but the liability for \\"foot or tooth\\" is often as full when beasts go of themselves into the domain of another. Accidental injuries of this kind have been referred to under accident. But when an animal eats the neighbor's produce, is the owner liable for the harm done, or only for his profit by its eating? In the case put in Scripture he is of course bound for the former. Other cases are thus put by Maimonides.Mishneh Torah Nizkei Mamon, 3:6-12; drawing from Bava Kamma 14-27 passim = Willful and accidental = Liability for damages varies depending on whether accidental damage may be anticipated. The following examples are instructive and serve as precedents. When, from necessity, one's animal eats an unusual food, e.g., when a donkey eats fish, the owner pays full damage. (Liability applies on the grounds of the injured party, but if on the highway, the owner pays only the amount which he has profited). Where a beast of prey enters the grounds of the injured party and tears or devours a domestic animal, the owner of the beast is liable for full damage, because it is its nature to act in the manner as it did. In contrast, if a dog should trespass and eat lambs or a cat eat grown hens, only half damage is due since this is unusual. When a donkey, finding bread in a basket, eats the bread and breaks the basket, the owner pays full damage for both. Where a beast, whether walking or standing, eats grass from the middle of a square, the owner pays what he profits, where it eats from the side he pays full damage. For what it eats out of the door of a shop, its owner is required to pay the equivalent of what he has profited thereby; from the interior of the shop, full damage. If, walking along the road, a beast eats off the back of another beast, only the saving in fodder is paid for. If it jumps out of its place, full damage is due. If one's beast glides or stumbles into another's garden and eats, etc., the owner owes only for what he profits, even if the beast goes from bed to bed, or stays in the garden all day. If instead it walks into the garden in the regular way, there is liability for full damage. So, also, if it is pushed into the garden by a companion, for the owner should lead his herd in single file. = Unintentional injury = Though \\"a man is always forewarned\\", that is, liable for his actions, asleep or awake, intentional or unintentional (see ), there is a broad exception to the rule, specifically, when the mischief is done on the ground of the injuring party. For what a man does within his own domain, he is liable in damages only if it was done willfully; but he is not liable if done either unconsciously or under compulsion. Where a man climbs a ladder, and a rung falls out under him and strikes another, he is liable if the rung was not strong enough or not well set; but if it was strong and well set, the harm done is regarded as providential, and he goes clear, even if it happened within the domain of the injured party; while on his own ground he would go clear in either case.Mishneh Torah, Ḥobel 4:3,4, based on Bava Kamma 28 = Betrayal: informers = The man of violence (\\"annas,\\" generally denoting an arbitrary or cruel official of the Gentile kingdom) is often mentioned in the Talmud and the codes. The most odious among torts was that of betraying the person or property of a fellow Israelite into the hands of the annas (mesirah).See Bava Kamma 5a, 114a; Mishneh Torah Ḥobel, 8; Shulchan Aruch Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ 328 In the Shulchan Aruch it is put thus: \\"He who [by informing] delivers up property into the hands of an annas, whether Gentile or Jew, is bound to make good, from the best part of his estate, whatever the annas has taken, though he has not handled the thing at all, but has only shown the way; and if he dies, the damage done is levied from his estate in the hands of his heirs.\\" The informer is excused if he has given information under bodily duress; but if he has handled the property himself, he is liable even then; for a man has no right to save himself at the cost of another. Further on, a religious sanction is given to this civil liability: \\"He who delivers up an Israelite, either in his body or in his property, to the Gentile has no share in the world to come.\\" On the strength of a case reported in Bava Batra 116a, it is also said that it is not only permissible but meritorious to kill an informer in order to put a stop to his villainous trade. = Slander and insult: elder \\"put to shame\\" = In ordinary assault and battery, an incidental insult or humiliation needs to be paid for separately. However, when there is only an insult and no physical assault, such as one spits at another person without reaching the body (even if it reaches the garment), there is no ground for recovery.Bava Kamma 91a Along these lines, a Palestinian amora recounts the tradition that \\"He who shames another by words is free from everything.\\" But the Jerusalem TalmudJerusalem Talmud, Bava Kamma 6c makes an exception in favor of the \\"elder,\\" meaning a rabbi. Thus: \\"He who puts an elder to shame pays him the price of his shame. One Meshullam affronted R. Judah ben Ḥanina: the matter came before R. Simeon ben Lakish; and he fined Meshullam a litra of gold.\\" This precedent was carried into the Halakhah; and all the Geonim followed it. They applied it to every scholar, and thus the rule appears in the code of Maimonides.Mishneh Torah, Ḥobel 3:5 where the penalty is put at 35 denarii of gold; but he adds that in Spain many of the scholars waive their privilege. While others than scholars have no civil remedy for insult or slander, the act of \\"blanching a man's face in public\\" or that of \\"attaching a nickname to one's neighbor\\" is, as has been seen in Ona'ah, among the unpardonable sins punished in the future world. It is also foundKetuvot 46a that the sin of \\"bringing out an evil report\\" (slander) is fully recognized, based on , but there is no legal remedy for the wrong done.

Education and early career Muller studied Law at Leiden University. After graduating with an LL.M. degree in 1984, he became a lawyer for the Amsterdam office of law firm Baker & McKenzie. In 1989, he joined the management team of offshore company Heerema in Leiden. A management buyout made him part owner of salvage and towing company Wijsmuller in IJmuiden. From 1992 onwards, Muller led several companies, such as Emergo Mode Groep (Emergo Fashion Group), which would be launched on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange as McGregor Fashion Group. Spyker Cars Muller and Maarten de Bruijn bought the name to the Dutch car company Spyker Cars in 2000, renewing the Spyker name which had been used surrounding car production in the 1920s. Muller was the CEO of the company until May 16, 2007, when he was succeeded by Michiel Mol. Muller continued to work for the company as chief designer for a period, but returned to the CEO seat later the same year, due to the split up between Spyker Cars and Spyker F1 (later Force India) while Mol continued as CEO for the latter. Muller was found guilty of sharing insider information in 2007. He sent an email to bank Theodoor Gilissen, requesting they not sell shares used as security for a personal loan. In the email Muller stated that Spyker would soon release a favourable press-release, which would increase the value of his shares. Victor Muller was initially fined €96,000. The fine was reduced in May 2012 to €11,400. On 2 December 2014 Spyker NV was granted a financial restructuring by the Dutch court \\"Midden Nederland\\". Spyker needs protection from creditors for its liquidity problems. Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “Over the past few years, Spyker has faced a number of serious difficulties and challenges resulting from, among others, the legacy of the F1 era and the acquisition of Saab Automobile AB,”. On 18 December 2014 Spyker NV was declared bankrupt by the Dutch court \\"Midden Nederland\\". Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “In 2000 our objective was to found a global sports car manufacturer, and we did just that. During this time we deployed several challenging activities. These have affected the company , and contributed to our decline,”. Once in an interview with Tech Toys 360 by Channel Discovery Science, he said that the first word he said in his childhood was \\"car.\\" He was interested in cars since his childhood. He started collecting cars before he got a drivers license. Saab Automobile AB Muller was also the chairman of the company Swedish Automobile, which was formed after the takeover of Saab Automobile by Spyker Cars. Saab Automobile was declared bankrupt in December 2011. A meeting on Saab's bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg on the 16 April 2012. In April 2012, the Swedish curators made public that SAAB has a debt of over US$2 billion after subtracting the value of assets. In March 2011, a Swedish biography of Victor Muller was published, Cirkus Muller, by journalist Jens B Nordström. In August 2012, Muller, stated that Spyker Cars will sue General Motors over Saab's bankruptcy. Muller, stated, \\"Ever since we were forced to file for Saab Automobile’s bankruptcy in December of last year, we have worked relentlessly on the preparation for this lawsuit, which seeks to compensate Spyker and Saab for the massive damages we have incurred as a result of GM’s unlawful actions\\". On 22 June 2013, a District Court Judge dismissed the case. According to Judge Gershwin A. Drain, \\"General Motors had a contractual right to approve or disapprove the proposed transaction,\\" and \\"The court is going to grant the motion to dismiss the matter.\\" Spyker Cars NV appealed the ruling. The appeal was heard at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The court said on Friday October 24, 2014 that GM did not intentionally interfered with the Dutch company's effort to sell Saab to Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co, leading to Saab's bankruptcy. Judge Eugene Siler said GM's actions were not malicious, and that it had \\"legitimate business concerns\\" about the sale, including who would benefit from Saab's use of its technology. Siler said that Spyker's claim was \\"fatally flawed\\". Since May 2013, Muller, has been a prime suspect of corporate tax evasion. As of 19 February 2016 Muller will be prosecuted by the Swedish tax authorities. In 2017, a Swedish court ruled him not guilty.

Career =Player= De Canio, a full back, played mostly with Serie C1 and Serie C2 teams, his lone season in Serie B being 1979–80 with Matera, marking his debut in the division on 16 September 1979 against Genoa. He retired in 1989 with amateur team Pisticci, of which he successively became head coach. =Coach= De Canio started his coaching career in 1989 with Promozione team Pisticci, immediately winning the league, being thus promoted to Serie D. He served as Pisticci boss for four more seasons before joining Serie C2 team Savoia during the 1993–94 season, and winning the promotion playoffs the following season. In 1995–96 he coached Siena of Serie C1, leading the Robur to an eighth place. In 1996–97 he signed for Serie C1 minnows Carpi, a team which featured a young Marco Materazzi among their players, and led the Emilia-Romagna side to a surprising fourth place which allowed them to play the promotion playoffs. In 1997–98 he moved to Serie B club Lucchese, hardly saving them from relegation with a final 16th place. Initially with no club for the following season, De Canio was then signed by Pescara, where he narrowly missed a surprising promotion to the top flight. De Canio took charge of a Pescara side that had slumped to 13th place in 1997–98 and lost two of its opening three matches in 1998–99. He guided i biancoazzuri to 63 points, finishing fifth, just one point from fourth, and only missed out on promotion due to the incredible, much-discussed victory of Reggina at Torino on the last day of the season (13 June 1999), which was called a few minutes early due to a pitch invasion. Following his departure from Pescara, it finished 13th again the next season. His impressive coaching performance with Pescara caused interest by Serie A club Udinese, which appointed him for the 1999–2000 season. His first Serie A campaign ended in an eighth place for the bianconeri and a place in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, which they successively won, thus ensuring a place in the UEFA Cup 2000–01. In 2000–01, after a very impressive start, Udinese entered into a long result crisis which brought to De Canio being sacked on 19 March 2001 following a home loss to Parma and his replacement with Luciano Spalletti, who managed to save the club from relegation. In 2001–02, De Canio was appointed as Napoli boss with the goal to lead the azzurri back to Serie A; however he failed to do so, as Napoli ended their Serie B campaign in fifth place, six points shy of the fourth Serie A spot. He consequently left Napoli and was appointed at the helm of Reggina during the 2002–03 season replacing sacked Bortolo Mutti, maintaining their place in the Italian top flight after winning a tie-breaking playoff to Atalanta. During the 2003–04, De Canio was called to replace Roberto Donadoni at the helm of Serie B club Genoa, which were fighting to escape relegation despite their initial promotion claims, leading the club to a final 16th place in the league table. He was later sacked by Genoa only a handful days before their Serie B 2004–05 debut to appoint Serse Cosmi at his place. He was then appointed on January 2005 by Serie A minnows Siena, a team which he already coached some years earlier, to replace Luigi Simoni, leading his side to escape relegation for two consecutive seasons. Queens Park Rangers De Canio was announced as first team coach of English Championship team Queens Park Rangers on 29 October 2007, succeeding the recently sacked John Gregory. He started his QPR experience with a 2–0 home win to Hull City on 3 November. Rangers signed several players during the January transfer window: Ákos Buzsáky who had previously been on loan from Plymouth Argyle, Hogan Ephraim from West Ham, Kieran Lee on loan from Manchester United, Gavin Mahon on loan from Watford, Matthew Connolly from Arsenal, Patrick Agyemang from Preston and Fitz Hall from Wigan. Early in January QPR also managed to secure striker Rowan Vine in a permanent move following his brief loan spell which had ended in December. During his period in charge of the club, De Canio became a very popular figure among the QPR faithful, due to the style and flair he brought back to their game. As a result he was, along with the club's owners, immortalised in the supporters' song \\"Gigi De Canio, Bernie and Flavio\\" (to the tune of La donna è mobile). De Canio left the club by \\"mutual consent\\" after the end of the season in May 2008, having guided them to fourteenth place in the Championship. His record at the club comprised 12 wins, 12 losses and 11 draws in 35 games. It has reported that his return to Italy was partly due to a bid to save his marriage. Back to Italy On 9 March 2009 De Canio signed a contract to become head coach of Serie A relegation battlers Lecce, replacing Mario Beretta at the helm of the salentini, but did not manage to save the side from relegation. On 31 May 2009 US Lecce announced De Canio had refused to extend his contract with the club; however, on 6 June the club officially confirmed to have reached an agreement with the former QPR manager, who guided the giallorossi back to the top flight, as league runners-up, in their 2009–10 Serie B campaign. He was sacked on 22 May 2011 as Lecce finished 17th at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 22 April 2012 he was hired again as Genoa head coach, in a desperate attempt to save the team from relegation, until 22 October 2012 when he was sacked. On 20 October 2013, De Canio returned into management as he accepted to take over from Rolando Maran at the head of endangered Serie A club Catania. On 15 March 2016, he was appointed manager of Udinese.http://app.football- italia.net/?referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.football-italia.net%2F81327%2Fofficial- udinese-appoint-de-canio#article/footballitalia-81327 He was let go at the end of the season on 19 May.http://www.football-italia.net/84559/official-udinese- appoint-iachini On 21 February 2018, he was appointed manager of Serie B club Ternana. In April 2018 he was one of 77 applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job. He was fired by Ternana on 19 January 2019. Name spelling Some sections of the media, particularly the English language media commonly misspell his surname as Di Canio, instead of the correct De Canio.

As well as day places, the school offers boarding options for pupils from year 7 (age 11) and is situated in of countryside close to London. Although it is currently an all-girls school, it is planning to start to go co-ed in January 2020, bringing boys into Pre- Reception through Year 2. The school is planning to go completely co- educational in 2023. History In 1749 'The Society of Stewards and Subscribers for Maintaining and Educating Poor Orphans of Clergymen' was set up in London and charitable donations to it were made by wealthy people, including the royal family and politicians. In 1760 Princess Amelia gave £100 and in 1791 George III donated £500, being part of the proceeds of one of Mr Handel's musical performances in Westminster Abbey. A school for 20 girls was set up in a house in Southwark, London, and the boys were sent to an existing school in Thirsk, North Yorkshire.'The History of St Margaret's School Bushey 1749-2009' by Enid Jarvis. Published by St Margaret's Guild 2009. On 28 April 1809, the Society was Incorporated at the sole expense of the Bishop of Durham and it became the Clergy Orphan Corporation. The Clergy Orphan Corporation paid for a new school building to be erected on land bought in St John's Wood next to Lord's Cricket Ground, and both boys and girls moved there in 1812. In 1852 the boys moved to Canterbury (now St Edmund's School).'The History of St Margaret's School Bushey 1749-2009' by Enid Jarvis. Published by St Margaret's Guild 2009. The St John's Wood site was sold in 1895 to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincoln Railway and the school building demolished. Today the Lord's Indoor Cricket School stands on the exact site of the old Clergy Orphan Corporation School. The eminent architect Alfred Waterhouse was commissioned to design and build a new school on land bought at Bushey, Hertfordshire and, while this was being done, the girls moved to temporary premises at Windsor.Chapter 4 'The History of St Margaret's School Bushey 1749-2009 by Enid Jarvis The new school was ready by 1897 and in September of that year, 80 clergy orphans, their teachers and formidable Headmistress, Miss Emily Baylee, moved in. This Waterhouse building is Grade II listed. Miss Baylee renamed the school after Saint Margaret of Scotland who was thought to be a good role model for the girls. In 1902 the first fee-paying pupils were admitted and in 1940 the first day girls were admitted. In 1996 the two schools, St Margaret's at Bushey and St Edmunds's at Canterbury, ceased to be owned by the Clergy Orphan Corporation and became fully independent schools. St Margaret's is now solely a fee paying school. Notable former pupils The Old Girls' Association of St Margaret's was established in 1897; in 1909 it assumed the name of \\"St Margaret's Guild\\". The Guild is very active and maintains contacts with old girls and produces an annual magazine.

During the money primary candidates raise funds for the upcoming primary elections and attempt to garner support of political leaders and donors, as well as the party establishment. Fund raising numbers and opinion polls are used by the media to predict who the front runners for the nomination are. This is a crucial stage of a campaign for the presidency, as the initial frontrunners who raise the most money appear the strongest and will be able to raise even more money. On the other hand, members of the party establishment who find themselves losing the invisible primary, such as Mitt Romney in the 2016 race, may abandon hope of successfully running. During the invisible primary appeals are made and meetings held with the political elite: party leaders, major donors, fundraisers, and political action committees. In contrast to the smoke-filled room where a small group of party-leaders might at the last minute, in a small meeting room at a political convention, determine the candidate, the invisible primary refers to the period of jockeying which precedes the first primaries and caucuses and even campaign announcements. The winners of the invisible primary, such as Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush in 2016, come into the first primaries and caucuses with a full war chest of money, support from office holders, and an aura of inevitability. Winners of the invisible primary have the support of the leaders of their political party and, in turn, support the political positions of their party; they are insiders, part of the party establishment. They do not always win, as Hillary Clinton did not in 2008. There is little or no campaign advertising using TV, particularly by the candidate, during this period, although online advertising may be used to build mailing lists of grassroots supporters and small contributors.

The project started in October 2002 with the general aim of building a scientific information system made up by the leading journals of all the knowledge areas edited in and about Latin America. Since its creation, its goal is: to give visibility to the scientific production generated in Ibero-America, that is underestimated worldwide due to various factors like low investment in science and technology, low participation of Latin American scientists in some of the main currents of science, as measured by percentage of articles by Latin American authors in established electronic databases e.g., MEDLINE, and the low impact of that production. Participation, measured by percentage of articles by authors of Latin America in such databases was very low in the dominant repositories e.g., 2.7% in the Science Citation Index (SCI). As of 2015, Redalyc is an information system that also evaluates the scientific and editorial quality of knowledge in Ibero-America.

Beall stated: > \\"Many North American scholars have never even heard of these meta-publishers > or the journals they aggregate.

The Motion draws attention to work by Vessuri, Guedon and Cetto emphasizing the value of SciELO and Redalyc to the development of science in Latin America and globally: “In fact, Latin America is using the OA publishing model to a far greater extent than any other region in the world… Also, because the sense of public mission remains strong among Latin American universities… these… initiatives demonstrate that the region contributes more and more to the global knowledge exchange while positioning research literature as a public good.”Vessuri, H.; Guedon, J.-C.; Cetto, A.

A variation with slightly different bodywork was known as the Thunder. Unlike Monogram's static models which were produced in the United States, both the Lightning and Thunder were produced in Japan by Yonezawa Toys and sold in their home market as the Wave Hunter. The partially ready-to-run kits came equipped with Yonezawa's proprietary electronics and mechanical speed control for the drive motor preinstalled. Control was via a 27 MHz stick-type radio. Since the Yonezawa onboard electronics did not have a battery eliminator circuit, it was necessary to install four \\"AA\\" alkaline batteries in addition to the supplied 7.2-volt, 1200mAh nickel-cadmium battery pack for the Mabuchi RS-540 drive motor. Since both cars were intended for the entry-level market, chassis layout was extremely simple. The modular rear end was located to the chassis tub by a hinge joint. Rear suspension damping was via a single vertically mounted spring shock absorber. The equally simple front suspension consisted of a trailing arm on either side, each damped by a spring shock. Like models of the time from Tokyo Marui, the Monogram cars suffered from extremely brittle plastic components, easily broken in even a minor collision. By 1989, Monogram had quietly withdrawn from the radio control market.

Sometimes known as Crazy Coaster on the park's website, or Floorless Coaster, as the sign in front of the ride's queue announces, the ride in Chinese is known as 衝瘋飛車. Insane Speed has two trains numbered 1 and 2, but the park usually only uses one on off-peak days due to the extremely low number of riders in the queue. Insane Speed has a removable metal floor in the station which collapses after the train has loaded and the restraints have been checked, allowing the air gates to open and the trains to depart. The floor rises again to let the next train unload once it has come to a complete stop. For restraints, riders have a simple over-the-shoulder restraint with grab bars mounted on them, and a seat belt which must be inserted into a catch mounted on the restraint. Ride experience The trains are dispatched right up the 131 foot lift hill. Once riders reach the top, they enter B&M;'s signature pre-drop element and there is a jolt as the train disengages the chain and goes into a small banked turnaround. Riders then plunge down a steep drop into the vertical loop, then go through a dive loop which turns them back 180 degrees towards where they had just come from and swoop dangerously close past the queue path as the drop down and do a 180-degree banked turnaround to the left through the loop. The train then exits a trim brake and rises to the right where riders will experience airtime as they are yanked down another drop towards the interlocking corkscrews. The train turns through a corkscrew to the right, then turns 180 degrees left and enter the second corkscrew to the right. Finally, riders enter a 4-G double helix to the right and pull into the brakes as the camera flash goes off at the end of the brake run. The riders will then make a left turn into the block brakes and switch track and return to the station once the line ahead is cleared.

History =First foundation= Interior of the former abbey church Windberg Abbey was founded by Count Albert I of Bogen with the assistance of Bishop Otto of Bamberg on the site of the original seat of the Counts of Bogen. Initially it was not a specifically Premonstratensian foundation, but was transferred to the order as an already established community between 1121 and 1146. The choir of the church was dedicated on 21 and 22 May 1142 by Heinrich Zdik, Bishop of Olmütz, in the presence of Count Albert. Duke Vladislav II of Bohemia secured the endowment of the monastery by granting it the properties of Schüttenhofen (now Sušice) and Albrechtsried. The foundation was dedicated in honour of the Virgin Mary and in 1146 raised to the status of an abbey. After the extension of the abbey church it was dedicated on 28 November 1167 by the Premonstratensian abbot of Leitomischl (now Litomyšl) and Johannes IV, bishop of Olmütz. The abbey was secularised and dissolved during the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803. The church became a parish church and the abbot's house the residence of the parish clergy. The monastic buildings passed into private ownership, and from 1835 were used for a brewery. =Second foundation= In 1923 the monastic community was re- established here by Premonstratensians from Berne-Heeswijk Abbey in the Netherlands. As of 2005, 33 Premonstratensian canons live in Windberg. Roggenburg Priory near Neu-Ulm is a priory of Windberg Abbey. In around 1955, the then abbot, Fr. Norbert Backmund, visited Beeleigh Abbey near Maldon in Essex, England, and was hosted by its owner Mr William Foyle, founder and owner of Foyles Bookshop. Beeleigh Abbey had been a Premonstratensian abbey founded in 1180 and dissolved by Henry VIII in 1536. This was the first visit to Beeleigh Abbey by a Premonstratensian abbot since the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The abbey church The church is a three-aisled basilica with transept. It mostly originates from the 12th century and shows the influence of Hirsau Abbey. The monumental chief portal is especially impressive; the north portal is somewhat simpler. The tower, built in the 13th century, received its present form as recently as 1750 - 1760. The Baroque high altar was made between 1735 and 1740, and contains a statue of the Virgin from about 1650. The pulpit dates from 1674. The stucco work in the church interior was created by Mathias Obermayr, who also made the four extremely detailed side- altars, two of which are dated 1756.

S. ARMY OF THE WEST by Norma Baldwin, p. 205 used during the California gold rush, journal keeper in 1848 and 1849, early US western settler of several communities, and Mormon missionary to Canada. Service in the Mormon Battalion In 1848, several men who had served in the Mormon Battalion were still working in California, waiting to proceed to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake as soon as a pass should open. According to a previous arrangement a company of eight people started May 1, 1848, Sgt. David Brewett being elected Captain, to pioneer, if possible, a wagon road of the Sierra, Nevada mountains eastward. At that time the Truckee route was still impassable. This company consisted of David Brewett, Captain Ira J. Willis, James C. Sly, Israel Evens, Jacob G. Truman, Esra Allen, J. R. Allred, Henderson Cox and Robert Pixton. Three days' travel brought the group to Iron Hill where the deep snow made further travel impossible. One man's donkey was completely buried in the snow except his ears. The group climbed to the top of the mountain, where they could see only snow-capped mountains ahead. They decided to postpone the enterprise until later in the season. So far as they could judge, a wagon road would at least be possible and perhaps a success. One day's travel took them back from snow to a warm spring atmosphere where flowers bloomed and vegetation was far advanced. On May 1, 1848, several men from the battalion, and others from Sacramento Valley subscribed $512.00 and bought two brass cannons from Captain John A. Sutter, to be taken to Great Salt Lake for the benefit of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Journal of History (Salt Lake: LDS Church archive; May 1, 1848 entry)(Names and amounts listed; James C.

Personal life  Wyatt is the daughter of Bernard and Ann Baum Sakowitz (July 28, 1913 - January 18, 2010, San Antonio), a prominent couple in Houston's Jewish circles. They were married in July 1933. Ann was once in negotiations with Louis B. Meyer for a movie acting contract, but abandoned it on Bernard's objection. They also had a son, Robert T. Sakowitz (born c. 1939), known as the merchant prince of Houston. The Sakowitz family owned the Sakowitz fashion specialty stores. Oscar Wyatt and Robert Sakowitz did not get along. Wyatt married oil magnate Oscar Wyatt in 1963. They have four sons, Steven Bradford Wyatt, Douglas Bryan Wyatt (born c. 1957), Oscar Sherman \\"Trey\\" Wyatt III, and Bradford Allington Wyatt.  Sakowitz stores  Russian immigrants Tobias Sakowitz and brother Simon founded Sakowitz Bros. specialty department store in 1902, in Galveston, Texas. The business thrived and expanded in the first half of the twentieth century. Their first Houston start started in 1908. The Sakowitz brothers became leaders in Houston's Jewish community, chairing the building campaign of Congregation Beth Israel, in 1922 and 1923. Both later served terms as president of the congregation. In the early 1950s, Tobias was still at the helm, and opened a number of major stores, including a 254,000 square foot, Alfred Charles Flynn-designed flagship store at the northeast corner of Main and Dallas Streets in downtown Houston. Nine other stores followed in Texas, and eight others in Oklahoma and Arizona. In 1957, Tobias' son Bernard took over the chain. Eighteen years later, Bernard's son Robert took over, Lynn and Robert nominally ran the business together upon the death of their father in 1981, but Lynn claimed to be a mostly passive partner. Robert's reign was short-lived. In 1985, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. It took on an Australian construction company, L.J. Hooker as a partner. After the 1987 stock market crash, sales plummeted at the stores, and an Australian interest rate jump pushed Hooker into bankruptcy, too. Sakowitz, Inc. closed in 1990. In 1991, a family rift between the Wyatts and Sakowitzes over its disposition went to court. Lynn's children claimed Robert had pilfered the company assets, driving it out of business, but Robert countered that Lynn had been part of the business investment approval process. Their mother, Ann, sided with Robert, and was forced to give up a stipend provided by the business due to the lawsuit. The Sakowitzes won the suit, but a judge set it aside. After a federal injunction blocking the retrial, the families settled out of court. Robert Sakowitz continued as a business magnate, starting consultants Hazak Corp., in 1991, specializing in business strategies and marketing.

Since the early 2000s, Sega Toys markets itself distinctively from the Sega brand, with some occasional collaboration between the two. An example of their collaboration is Sega and Sega Toys producing the UFO Catcher prize games jointly, where Sega manufactures the arcade equipment, while Sega Toys produces the prizes. Diapet / Cherryca Phenix is the name of a series die-cast toys produced by Yonezawa Toys of Japan after that company took over the brand. They were mostly produced in the 1:40 scale. While Yonezawa is best known for producing tinplate toys of particular accuracy and in the scale of 1:24-1:18, Diapet toys are smaller die-cast replicas. Their quality and realism made them popular for Asian children and collectors alike, however, this commercial success failed to be replicated in the United States. The word \\"pet\\" is the Japanese equivalent of \\"small\\" or \\"cute.\\" Diapet toys continued being produced through the 1990s. Other popular die-cast brands to come out of Japan include Asahi Model Pet, Miniature Pet, Micropet, Cherryca Phenix, Tomica and Collectoy. Of them, Tomica (from Tomy of Japan) is the best-known to US collectors.

She is a Professor of the Graduate School (Anthropology) at the University of California, Berkeley and Creative Director and President of the Center for Digital Archaeology (CoDA), a recently established non-profit organization. Before going to Berkeley, she taught at Harvard University and University College London. Tringham is probably best known for her work at Selevac (1976-1979) and Opovo (1983-1989), Serbia, at the Eneolithic tell settlement of Podgoritsa, Bulgaria (1995), and at the well-known site of Çatalhöyük (1997-), Turkey. Early life and hobbies Tringham was born on 14 October 1940 in the village of Aspley Guise in Bedfordshire, England. She was the middle sibling with two older brothers and a younger brother and sister. When she was five years old, her family moved to London where she attended primary school until she was eleven. After she won a scholarship to an all-girls high school, part of the Girls Public Day School Trust in north London, her family moved to Hampstead. During high school she learned Latin and Greek and was active in children's clubs at the Natural History Museum in London, where she was introduced to proper research methods. As she was growing up, her mother encouraged her to question authority and realize the contexts in which these authorities are based. This early advice would lead to some of her innovative ideas and methods. She started playing violin at age nine and kept playing until around the age of eighteen. Throughout her college career she played the guitar and sang folk songs that she had collected from the various countries she visited. Later on in life she began choral singing in Boston and then sang in the California Bach Society. After a few years she joined the San Francisco Symphony Chorus in 1984 where she has helped record several CDs and a Grammy Award-winning song of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. Other hobbies growing up included fencing, volleyball, racquetball, skiing, hiking, and oil painting. Education Having first excavated in the Natural History Club at age thirteen, she knew she wanted to be an archaeologist by the time she was sixteen. She received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Edinburgh in the Department of Archaeology. She chose Edinburgh for its pan-European perspective. The head of the department, Stuart Piggott, encouraged Tringham to excavate at an Iron Age bog site in Denmark. Following this excavation she surveyed along the Pasvik River in Norway. She was on her way to becoming specialized in Scandinavian archaeology. However, there was a major changing point in her career during her junior year as a result of a trip to do fieldwork in Czechoslovakia. While here, she excavated the Neolithic site of Bylany with Bohumil Soudsky. It was here where she became fascinated with the archaeology of Eastern Europe and her research interests, although altered to a certain extent, still remain in that region. She wrote both her senior B.A. thesis and Ph.D. dissertation on Eastern Europe. The former was on Neolithic clay figurines of Eastern Europe, while the latter was called The Earlier Neolithic in Central Europe: A Study of the Linear Pottery Culture and their Relationships with the Contemporary Cultures of South-East Europe. She received her Ph.D. in 1966. Five years later she dedicated her first book, Hunters, Fishers, and Farmers: 6,000-3,000 B.C, to V. Gordon Childe, Stuart Piggott, Bohumil Soudsky, and Peter Ucko. Professional career =Research and theoretical interests= Throughout her career, Tringham has brought many innovative ideas to archaeology and challenged its traditional perspectives. She attempts to influence the methods used by archaeologists, thus giving more identity to the past. Some of her specific interests include prehistoric archaeology, European prehistory, archaeology and popular culture, and architecture and gender aspects in prehistory. Lately, her research has been on the life history of buildings and the construction of built space. In her first book Hunters, Fishers, and Farmers: 6,000-3,000 B.C. she asserted that archaeologists should stick to the more scientific analyses of artifacts. She argues one should stay away from formulating speculative social interpretations from the artifacts. However, she now feels that this strict scientific approach is a weakness and argues that one should utilize social theory to try and construct a prehistory. Tringham uses a feminist archaeological perspective when it comes to discussing her interests in gender relations and households. In her own words, \\"How to express the complexities of a feminist practice of archaeology-multiple interpretations of archaeological data at multiple scales, allowing multiple voices from past and present to be heard.\\" To her, the masculine standpoint in archaeology overlooks the microscale (domestic) aspect, therefore devaluing the role of women in ancient societies.Tringham, Ruth 1991 \\"Households with Faces: the Challenge of Gender in Prehistoric Architectural Remains\\" in Engendering Archaeology: Women and Prehistory by Gero, J. and Conkey, M. Blackwell Publishers: Oxford. pp. 93-131. Earlier in her career she avoided defining gender relations, but now she states that studying the household in archaeology is crucial to not only gender relations, but also archaeology as a whole. Although she has feminist views on certain things, such as emphasizing the importance of microscale aspects in prehistory, this does not mean that she loses her objectivity to other ideas. Margaret Conkey and Ruth Tringham have collaborated on a public multimedia device that challenges the Goddess movement, which tries to portray the past matricentrically. To them, the movement is based primarily on a feminist agenda.Conkey, Margaret and Tringham, R. 1995. \\"Archaeology and the Goddess: Exploring the Contours of Feminist Archaeology\\" in ‘’Feminisms in the Academy: Rethinking the Disciplines’’. University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor. =Notable excavations= Çatalhöyük, Turkey Çatalhöyük, a 9,000-year-old site, is the best-preserved Neolithic site to date. Some archaeologists believe it to be the earliest town of mankind because of the complex artifacts located in this area and their social implications. Tringham is the Director of the Berkeley Archaeologists of Catalhoyuk (BACH), which is under the overall director of operations, Ian Hodder. To Tringham, Cataloyuk is important not only because it encourages a team of archaeologists to think and record the basis and implications of their actions, but also because it can make the practice of feminist archaeology a reality. Selevac, present day Serbia The book, Selevac: A Neolithic Village in Yugoslavia, is based on excavations that she did at the Selevac site in former Yugoslavia. It was a cooperative project under Harvard, Berkeley, and the National Museum of Belgrade between 1976–1978. As a site report on Vinča cultures that occupied it between 5,000 – 4,400 BCE, this book illustrates the project's four main objectives. The first was to study the chronology and cultural evolution of the Neolithic cultures. Next, the project was investigating the socioeconomic transformation processes of early agricultural societies. Third, the book tries to study the settlement pattern variation between the unenclosed settlements and the deeply stratified settlements of the Vinča culture. The last aim was to examine the regional settlement pattern.Milisauskas, Sarunas. \\"Review of Selevac: A Neolithic Village in Yugoslavia\\" by Eds. Ruth Tringham and Dusan Krstic in American Journal of Archaeology 96. No. 4 (Oct. 1992): pp. 765-766.Tringham, Ruth and Dusan Krstic. Selevac: A Neolithic Village in Yugoslavia. Pg 4-5 She tries to trace the evolution of the village once food technology is introduced and making it a permanent, sedentary village.Bartel, Brad. \\"Review of Selevac: A Neolithic Village in Yugoslavia\\" by Eds. Ruth Tringham and Dusan Krstic in American Antiquity 58. No. 3 (1993): pp. 590-591. Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk, Serbia Located at Vojvodina in the lower valley of the Timis River, north of the Danube, Opovo-Ugar, which was occupied between 4700-4500 BCE, belongs to the Vinča-Pločnik culture and is another site that provides information on the socioeconomic developments during the Neolithic. The importance of this site, which was excavated in the 1980s, was the method of excavation and the analysis of architecture technology. In other words, the project wanted to investigate the degree of settlement permanence by looking at the occupation duration of the houses. Furthermore, she wanted to investigate the emergence of the household as a primary social unit and how it changes throughout history. This ties in with her future interests that deal with gender relations and microscale aspects in archaeology. However, at this time she said she was a ‘remedial’ feminist archaeologist because she believed that it was not credible to give \\"faces\\" to people of prehistory in order to \\"recreate\\" life as it actually was. =Pedagogical methods= She is internationally known for her work using digital media, specifically multimedia, to record and teach archaeology. This interest led to the founding of the Multimedia Authoring Center for the Teaching of Anthropology at Berkeley. For this innovation in digital education, Ruth Tringham, along with her colleagues Margaret Conkey and Rosemary Joyce, was awarded Berkeley's Educational Initiatives Award in 2001. A similar award was the Presidential Chair in Undergraduate Teaching (1998), which she earned by incorporating multimedia techniques in teaching archaeology.

This identification has the format of a telephone number, in accordance with the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). The association of a location routing number with a telephone number is required for local number portability. Function In the US, the location routing number is a ten-digit number following the specifications of the North American Numbering Plan. The LRN is stored in a database called a Service Control Point (SCP) that identifies a switching port for a local telephone exchange. Using LRN, when a telephone number has been dialed, the local telephone exchange queries or \\"dips\\" a routing database, usually the SCP, for the LRN associated with the subscriber number. The LRN removes the need for the public telephone number to identify the local exchange carrier. If a subscriber changes to another telephone service provider, the current telephone number can be retained, and only the LRN needs to be changed. In addition to supporting service provider telephone number portability, an LRN also supports the possibility of two other types of number portability: service portability (for example, ordinary service to ISDN) and geographic portability. History In 1996, the US Congress mandated a change in local telephone service that allows any carrier to enter a local market. The new regulation provided for local number portability (LNP), which permitted the servicing of telephone numbers from other wire centers than that the given by the NPA-NXX prefixes of each number. In practice, a subscriber can keep a telephone number when moving to another exchange area by a process called porting a telephone number. Every ported telephone number has an LRN assigned. Virginia-based NeuStar has been contracted with developing and maintaining the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) to support the implementation of local number portability.

Name  His personal name Mochuo is Chinese transcription of his Turkic name Bögü, () meaning \\"wise\\". The same name occurs in the Sogdian version of the Karabalsagun inscription (821 AD).Akadémiai Kiadó, 1985, Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, p. 146 He used the name Bögü Chor ShadClauson, ED, p. 427 during Ilterish's reign.Sertkaya, 1995, p. 81Aydın, 2011, p. 12 His regnal name Qapaghan (in Turkish sources Kapgan, Kapagan or Kapağan) comes from the Old Turkic verb \\"kap-\\" meaning \\"to conquer\\", which the derivative Qapaghan means \\"the Conqueror\\".  Early years  He was born around 664. In 681, he assisted his brother, Ilterish Qaghan, in a revolt against Tang dominion, and succeeded in reviving the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. In 689, he led a raid to frontier areas. In reaction, Empress Wu sent Huaiyi to fortify. He advanced to Zi River (紫河, a tributary of the Yellow River) but did not encounter Tujue forces. He erected a monument at Chanyu Tower (單于臺, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) before withdrawing.  Reign  In 692, he succeeded his brother as khagan. His succession was seen as usurpation in China.Old Book of Tang, Vol. 194-I In 694, Qapaghan attacked Ling Prefecture (roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and Wu Zetian commissioned Huaiyi, assisted by the chancellors Li Zhaode and Su Weidao, to defend against Qapaghan attack, but before the army could set out, Qapaghan withdrew, and therefore Huaiyi's army never launched. In summer 696, The Khitan chieftains Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong, brothers-in- law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui (趙文翽), the prefect of Ying Prefecture (, roughly Zhaoyang County, Liaoning), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan. Armies that Wu Zetian sent to suppress Li and Sun's rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which in turn attacked Zhou proper. Khagan encouraged the Khitan's Li- Sun Rebellion (696–697) to eventually attack and plunder successful Khitan on their rear, to his full benefit. Meanwhile, Qapaghan Qaghan offered help and yet was also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan—including an attack against Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li's death, that captured Li's and Sun's families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 205. Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 206. Wu Zetian tried to allay the situation by making peace with khagan at fairly costly terms—the return of Turkic people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Turks with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Qapaghan launched another attack on Khitan's base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat. Empress Wu gave him the title Ilterish Da Chanyu (頡跌利施大單于), Ligong Baoguo (立功報國), Generalissimo of the Left Guards (左衛大將軍) as well as Duke of Guiguo (歸國) and Qianshan Khagan (迁善可汗), literally meaning \\"Good moving khagan\\" in 695. After securing Chinese border, in winter, he turned his attention to further expansion to north, notably subjugating Yenisei Kyrgyz and killing their khagan. While preparing an attack on Turgesh forces, his khatun died, so invasion had to be called off. In 698, Qapaghan demanded a Tang dynasty prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China under his influence. When Wu Zetian sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu (武延秀), to marry Qapaghan's daughter instead. Zhang Jianzhi opposed, stating, \\"In ancient times, no Chinese imperial prince had ever married a barbarian woman as his wife.\\" This opposition drew displeasure from Wu Zetian, as she wanted peace with Turks, and she demoted Zhang to be the prefect of He Prefecture (合州, modern northern Chongqing). Khagan nevertheless rejected the prince. He had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage; instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained Wu Yanxiu and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). He created Chinese general Yan Zhiwei (阎知微) as Southern Khagan (南面可汗) persuaded Yan to help invade cities of Zhaozhou and Dingzhou. Zhou general Murong Xuanjiao (慕容玄皦) also submitted to Qapaghan with 5000 soldiers. In August 698, Qapaghan attacked Dingzhou, captured and killed its governor Sun Yangao (孙彦高), burning the city alongside. Wu Zetian angered to the point that she issued a proclamation that if anyone killed the khagan would be granted title Prince. She subsequently renamed him Zhanchuo (斩啜, meaning \\"chopped head\\") as a play on his name Mochuo. In September, Zhaozhou was also attacked, deputy governor Tang Boruo (唐波若) handed over the keys and governor Gao Rui (高睿) was immediately executed. In October, khagan let Yan Zhiwei (阎知微) to go back to China, who was captured and executed on charges of treason.  Reforms  In 699, he appointed his younger brother Ashina Duoxifu as Tölös shad, meaning governor eastern wing, his nephew Ashina Mojilian as governor of western wing with each of them commanding 20000 men, also putting his son Bögü as their overseer, creating him as lesser khagan. He was also given command of Onoq with 40000 men.  Later reign  In 703, he sent Tonyukuk for another marriage proposal. Wu Zetian accepted the proposal; in exchange, Wu Yanxiu was released on khagan's order. However, Emperor Zhongzhong's accession changed political climate. In 705, Tujue forces commanded by Mojilian entered Lingwu, defeating Shazha Chongyi (沙吒忠义), he was dismissed from service. Angered Zhongzhong declined marriage proposal and proclaimed prize for anyone willing to kill khagan. In 711, khagan sent a marriage proposal to Ruizong, this time intending to marry a Tang Princess. Emperor Ruizong accepted and created a daughter of Li Chengqi, the Princess Jinshan (金山公主). Excited khagan sent his son Ashina Yangwozhi (阿史那楊我支) to Changan. However, the decision was soon reversed by newly enthroned Xuanzong. Later that year Turgesh forces were crushed by Tonyukuk in Battle of Bolchu. Certain Bars Beg (or probably Suluk) was appointed chief of Turgesh and married Mojilian's daughter. In 713, Karluks were defeated by combined forces of Kapaghan, Mojilian and Kul Tegin. In 714, February Inel, Tonga Tegin and khagan's brother-in-law Huoba Elteber Ashibi attacked Beiting, during the siege Tonga Tegin was killed, while Ashibi fled to Tang in fear, where who would be renamed Huoba Guiren (火拔歸仁) and created a general. In 715, due to his cruelty, some his men and a number of tribes, including his Korean son-in-law Gao Wenjian (高文簡) and Ashide son-in- law Ashide Hulu (阿史德胡禄) submitted to Tang. Rebellions of tribes followed later.  Death  Khagan was on his way back from suppressing the revolting Tiele tribes of Huihe, Tongluo, Baixi, Bayegu and Pugu, was ambushed killed by a Bayegu tribesman named Xiezhilue (颉质略) on July 22, 716 while passing through a forest. His severed head was sent to Changan.Grousset, Empire of the Steppes, page110  Family  According to Cuisenier, he married El Bilga Khatun, a widow of his brother.

He sanctioned the Constitution of 1886 that created the Republic of Colombia proceeding the United States of Colombia. A Samarian Costeño, he became president of the Sovereign State of Magdalena, and Antioquia, Governor of Panama, and held various Ministries during his career as a politician. Early life and education José María Campo was born on September 8, 1832 in Santa Marta, Magdalena in what was then the Republic of New Granada. He was the first child of Andrés del Campo and María Josefa Serrano, and brother of Juan Campo Serrano (who also signed the constitution of 1886 as the delegate of the state of Bolivar). He completed his studies in the Seminario Conciliar de Santa Marta, and later attended the Colegio Provincial Santander, where he studied Law and Philosophy. He was married to Rosa Riascos García. Political career =Magdalena= Campo started his political life in his home state of Magdalena. There he served various positions at different levels of government, he was a member of the legislative assembly of Magdalena, Prosecutor General, and member of the Chamber of Representatives and Senate of Colombia for Magdalena. He also served twice as President of the Sovereign State of Magdalena, first between 1871-1874, and from 1879-1884. His administrations were focused mainly on the construction and expansion of railways to foment commerce and industry in the region and connect the country with the port, part of this goal was accomplished in 1881 when contracts were made to start the construction of a railroad to connect Santa Marta with El Banco. =Antioquia= During the Colombian Civil War of 1885 José María Campo served as Civil and Military Chief of the Sovereign State of Antioquia between March 14, and September 21 of 1885. His administration's goal was to contain the civil insurgency and discourage political opposition. One way Campo did this was by redistricting some of electoral districts that favored the radical rebels, like the districts of La Unión and Pabón. As in Magdalena, Campo was interested in the fomentation of railways, something he accomplished on August 18, 1885 when negotiations with the private sector were made to improve and expand the railways of Antioquia. General Campo left the Presidency of Antioquia to represent the Constituent Assembly in Bogotá. =Ministries= General Campo became an active member in the administrations of various presidents as a member of their Council of Ministers. The first post he had in these was in 1882 during the presidency of Francisco Javier Zaldúa, where he was Minister of Public Instruction in charge of national education, a post he got again on April 1, 1884, when Ezequiel Hurtado also made Campo his Minister of Public Instruction. In the administration of Rafael Núñez, he worked in two ministries, the Ministry of War, in which he had to confront the Civil War of 1885, and the Ministry of Finance, which he left to go to Antioquia. His last ministerial post was as Minister of Government during the presidency of Miguel Antonio Caro. Presidency 1886-1887 On December 9, 1885 the Constituent Assembly elected Rafael Núñez as president, Eliseo Payán as vice president, and José María Campo as designate. J.M. Campo came to power in a very unusual way; on March 30, 1886, president Núñez presented his resignation to Congress due to his poor health condition caused by dysentery. The Vice President, as the next in line of succession, had many enemies in congress, and on May 4, Congress revoked Eliseo Payán of his position as vice president. On April 1, 1886, with no vice president and the president resigning, the Presidential- designate José María Campo as the next in line to assume the executive power was sworn in as Acting President of the United States of Colombia. =Policies= The Train of the Savanna, a project of President Campo. The National Pantheon, located in the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino Of the short presidency of Campo some of the policies of importance that were made were more of a local impact than of large national impact policy. Some of the projects of his administration were the contracts for the installation and construction of public lighting and potable water services to Bogotá. He also continued advocating for rail transportation and railways, and in 1887 the Train of the Savanna started operating connecting Bogotá with the near cities of Facatativá and Zipaquirá, and it continues in service today. One of the Decrees made by Campo as President of Colombia was in regards to the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino, the house where the Libertador Simón Bolívar died. The house was of private property and the owners had offered to sell it to the government, but for an outrageous amount of money. In an executive order in 1886, Campo seized the property and placed it under the administration of the Department of Magdalena to administer it. Although he was allowed, Campo did not choose to live in the Palacio de San Carlos, the then Presidential Palace, opting to continue living at his normal residence. =Constitution of 1886= The Constituent Assembly that was called in session in 1885 by Rafael Núñez to draft a new constitution passed its final resolution on August 4, 1886. The next day, President Campo and his Council of Ministers sanctioned the constitution, making it official and changing the name of the country to Republic of Colombia, and in so, Campo become its first president. Post- Presidency The 1st President of the newly established Republic of Colombia, stepped down on January 6, 1887 ceding the power to Eliseo Payán, who in the absence of Núñez became acting president. =Panama= José María Campo was once again called into politics and war to go to Panama, where the Liberal rebels were fighting the Conservative government, as Panama was one of the stages of the Thousand Days War. Because of his political and military credentials he was named Governor of the Department of Panama, replacing the then governor, Facundo Mutis Durán, in January 1900. Campo came in strong, he brought reinforcements to the region from different parts of the country, as by now the war was concentrating its efforts on Panama and the Caribbean Region. He used the strategic impact of railways to mobilize troops and clear adjacent areas. The war however was getting more complicated, and General Campo had to leave to Barranquilla to buy weapons and bring reinforcements passing on the governorship to Alejandro Orillac as acting governor. Although General Campo’s leave cause an intensification of the rebel forces, the war came to an end in 1902, cementing the way for the separation of Panama from Colombia. Death and legacy José María Campo died in his home in Santa Marta on February 24, 1915 at the age of 82. He is considered by many as the most influential Samarian in history. His most enduring legacy by far was the Constitution of 1886, which was the country's fundamental law for almost 105 years, until it was replaced by the Constitution of 1991.

Life and career Beard, a great-grandson of 14th Vice President John C. Breckinridge, was born into a well-to-do family and grew up at the Westbury HotelThe Westbury Hotel 15 East 69th Street - Condopedia on East 69th Street in Manhattan. His relationship with his parents was cool, to judge by his quip \\"I never saw my mother up close.\\" He attended the Taft School, where he was a leader at the humor magazine, and he decided to become a humor writer after reading Catch-22. He then went to Harvard University (from which he graduated in 1967) and joined its humor magazine, the Harvard Lampoon, which circulated nationally. Much of the credit for the Lampoon's success during the mid-1960s is given to Beard and Douglas Kenney, who was in the class a year after Beard's. In 1968, Beard and Kenney wrote the successful parody Bored of the Rings. Henry and Kenney would become longtime friends and collaborators. Many commented on how exact opposite they were. Kenney described Beard as \\"the oldest guy who was ever a teenager\\". In 1969, Beard, Kenney and Rob Hoffman became the founding editors of the National Lampoon, which reached an average monthly circulation of over 830,000 for the year 1974 (and the October issue of that year topped a million sales). One of Beard's short stories published there, \\"The Last Recall\\", was included in the 1973 Best Detective Stories of the Year. During the early 1970s, Beard was also in the Army Reserve, which he hated. (Subscription required.) In 1975, the three founders cashed in on a buy-out agreement for National Lampoon; Beard received US$2.8 million and left the magazine.Karp, Futile and Stupid, p. 224 After an \\"unhappy\\" attempt at screenwriting, he turned to writing books of humor.Karp, Futile and Stupid, p. 372 Those that have reached the New York Times Best Seller list are Sailing: A Sailor's Dictionary (1981, with Roy McKie), Miss Piggy's Guide to Life (1981), Leslie Nielsen's Stupid Little Golf Book (1995, with Leslie Nielsen), French for Cats (1992, with John Boswell), and O.J.'s Legal Pad (1995, with John Boswell and Ron Barrett). Other notable books include Latin for All Occasions (1990), The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook (1992, with Christopher Cerf), and What's Worrying Gus? (1995, with John Boswell). =Personal life= The New York Times has described Beard as \\"enigmatic\\". Among the enigmas, apparently, is his birthdate. Not even the year of his birth appears in the Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication data of his books or in various Web and print sources. However, Josh Karp's biography of Doug Kenney says that Beard was \\"a nearly thirty-year-old man\\" when he left the National Lampoon on March 18, 1975,Karp, Futile and Stupid, p. 246 and an article published on November 29, 1987, gives his age as 42. The birth year given above, 1945, is based on these two statements. Public records show that a HENRY N BEARD was born on June 7, 1945, in New York, NY. According to Josh Karp, Beard is remembered from his Harvard years as patrician, a pipe smoker, not over-concerned with the appearance or cleanliness of his clothes, misanthropic but not malicious, capable of understanding and organizing any subject, a gifted student who occasionally wrote parodic papers. He was prematurely mature and the Harvard Lampoon's arbiter. As a comic writer he excelled at parody, and his hero was S. J. Perelman. All these characteristics meant that he was an excellent partner with Kenney, who was flamboyant, fond of poses, and given to seeing humor where others recoiled. Speaking of Beard's National Lampoon years, the comedy writer Chris Miller remembers that Beard \\"knew everything\\" and that he said on leaving the Lampoon that he was sick of being the father to all the writers. (Beard would have been about 30.) The comic writer and actor Tony Hendra says that at the beginning of Beard's tenure, he was painfully shy, though he was the magazine's authority over what material was used. In the next few years, he went through \\"the greening of Beard\\", growing his hair, switching from cheap beer to expensive whiskey, and in 1974, forming a relationship with the writer Gwyneth Cravens.Karp, Futile and Stupid, p. 201 In 1991, an article in a reliable publication said that Beard and Cravens divided their time between Manhattan and a renovated boat shed in East Hampton and referred to them as partners. A 2006 interview in a different publication said that Beard and Cravens had married. Also in 2006, Karp wrote that \\"reportedly\\" the couple had added California to their list of addresses and that Beard played golf almost daily but never kept score.

He is notable for administering the oath of office to President Theodore Roosevelt following the assassination of President William McKinley. Education and career Born on December 18, 1860, in Buffalo, New York, Hazel read law in 1882. He entered private practice in Buffalo from 1882 to 1894. He was Commissioner of Corporation Taxes for the State of New York starting in 1894. He was a delegate to the 1900 Republican National Convention. Federal judicial service Hazel was nominated by President William McKinley on May 18, 1900, to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, to a new seat authorized by 31 Stat. 175. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 5, 1900, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on March 5, 1931, due to his retirement. =Nomination controversy= Hazel's nomination was opposed by the Buffalo Bar Association, which considered him unfit for judgeship. A group of five lawyers went to New York City on the association's behalf for the purpose of meeting with the Association of the Bar of the City of New York to express their opposition. Contemporaneous accounts indicate that it was a dispute between Platt and anti-Platt rings then prevalent in New York.\\"Lawyers Oppose Hazel's Appointment,\\" New York Times (front page) (May 30, 1900) =Roosevelt oath of office= Judge Hazel swearing in Roosevelt following McKinley's death On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz. Roosevelt was vacationing in Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so he went on a planned family camping and hiking trip to Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks. In the mountains, a runner notified him McKinley was on his death bed. Roosevelt pondered with his wife, Edith, how best to respond, not wanting to show up in Buffalo and wait on McKinley's death. Roosevelt was rushed by a series of stagecoaches to North Creek train station. At the station, Roosevelt was handed a telegram that said President McKinley died at 2:30 AM, September 14, 1901.The new President continued by train from North Creek to Buffalo. He arrived in Buffalo later that day, accepting an invitation to stay at the home of Ansley Wilcox (now the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site). It was there, on the afternoon of September 14, 1901, that Hazel administered the oath to Roosevelt. =Notable cases= In 1909, Judge Hazel issued an order cancelling the naturalization of Jacob A. Kersner, at the request of the United States Attorney's office, and thus stripping the citizenship of his ex-wife, the Anarchist orator Emma Goldman, who had gained United States citizenship in 1887 by her marriage to Kersner. Ten years later, in 1919, the Wilson administration used Hazel's voiding of her citizenship as the basis for ruling that Goldman could be deported to Russia as an \\"alien anarchist,\\" along with 248 other \\"undesirables,\\" on the USAT Buford. Judge Hazel heard the 1910 to 1913 lawsuit by the Wright brothers who alleged patent infringement against manufacturer Herring-Curtiss Company and inventor Glenn Curtiss. Hazel ruled in February 1913 for the Wrights, and on appeal a higher court agreed with this decision in 1914.Head, James. 2008. Warped Wings. Mustang, Oklahoma, U.S.: Tate Publishing. The decision was controversial for so favorably interpreting the uniqueness and priority of the technical achievements of the Wrights, and it has been argued that this broad interpretation of their intellectual property slowed aviation developments in the U.S.Shulman, Seth.

Aims The goal of genetic epistemology is to link the validity of knowledge to the model of its construction– i.e. the context in which knowledge is gained affects its perception, quality, and degree of retention. Further, genetic epistemology seeks to explain the process of cognitive development (from birth) in four primary stages: sensorimotor (birth to age 2), pre- operational (2-7), concrete operational (7-11), and formal operational (11 years onward). As an example, consider that for children in the sensorimotor stage, teachers should try to provide a rich and stimulating environment with ample objects to play with. Then with children in the concrete operational stage, learning activities should involve problems of classification, ordering, location, conservation using concrete objects . The main focus is on the younger years of development. Assimilation occurs when the perception of a new event or object occurs to the learner in an existing schema and is usually used in the context of self-motivation. In Accommodation, one accommodates the experiences according to the outcome of the tasks. The highest form of development is equilibration. Equilibration encompasses both assimilation and accommodation as the learner changes how they think to get a better answer. Piaget believed that knowledge is a biological function that results from the actions of an individual through change. He also stated that knowledge consists of structures, and comes about by the adaptation of these structures with the environment. Piaget's genetic epistemology is halfway between formal logic and dialectical logic. Piaget's epistemology is midway between objective idealism and materialism. Piaget's schema theory #Thought passes through a series of stages of development; at each stage there applies formal logic at a specific stage of differentiation which may be characterized by an algebra in which exactly such-and-such a mathematical structure applies, corresponding to the axioms of logic at that stage; this logic is manifested first in actions, then at a relatively early stage in sensorimotor operations (in the specific mathematical sense of the word, as opposed to \\"actions\\" which are equivalent to relations but not yet mathematical operations), and finally in operations which express thoughts, conscious purposive activity. #The material basis for transition from sensorimotor intelligence to representation and from representation to conceptual thought is the interiorisation of practical activity. #The successive stages of concepts manifested in child development imply relations of deduction in mathematical logic and in the development of thinking in other planes of development, such as in the history of science and the history of knowledge in the anthropological domain.\\"Genetic Epistemology\\" by Jean Piaget (1968) Piaget draws on the full range of contemporary mathematical knowledge, a vast empirical base of observation of the learning of very young children built up at his institute and reports of observations of older children and a general knowledge of the development of knowledge in history. (1) From the standpoint of dialectical logic, we must agree that at each stage of development, at each \\"definition of the Absolute\\" in Hegel's terminology, formal logic is applicable. Piaget's proof of this is striking, and his demonstration of how the stages of development in child thought pass through a specific series which is deductive in a specific sense from the standpoint of mathematics is original and profound. However, from the standpoint of understanding development (and this is Piaget's standpoint), what is important is not the definition of each stage but the transition from one to the next; and for this it is necessary to demonstrate the internal contradiction within the logic of that plane. Since Piaget draws on mathematical logic more developed than what was known to Hegel, it will be necessary to investigate these structures to see if this speculative proposition proves to be valid. (2) The concept of interiorisation is indeed the basis of the materialist view of the development of thought. However, Piaget, as a professional child-psychologist falls prey to the objective idealism of any professional, of elevating the subject matter of his particular profession from being an aspect of the material world to being its master. [The charge of objective idealism is qualified, for Piaget is quite unambiguous that relations conceived of in thought exist objectively in the material world]. Thus, since his body of authoritative empirical work is in relation to early childhood development, he imposes the schema appropriate to this semi-human subject on to adolescent development, speculates on its possible reflection in anthropological development and confounds it with the history of development of science and philosophy. I say \\"confounds\\" because Piaget is aware that his schemas do not seem to apply in this domain. In this sense, the charge of objective idealism would seem unfair, but from confounding he does not go further and seek the implication of this lack of correspondence, but seeks to minimize it. By focusing on early childhood (as indeed he must; that is his profession, and his institute has contributed a vast body of empirical material), Piaget sees what is biologically (zoologically?) human but not what is socially (historically) human, and humanity is essentially social, after all. (3) On the plus side, it has to be said that Piaget deals once and for all with any idea of innate intelligence, and makes fully convincing the prospect of a fully genetic (i.e. developmental) elaboration of intelligence, assuming only animal instincts such as grasping and sucking and sensorimotor \\"equipment\\" capable of reflecting highly developed relations. A weakness in Piaget's theory could be that there isn't proof in how one transitions from one stage to the next. Can someone progress from one stage forward, but revert backwards, and then move forward again?  Types of knowledge  Piaget proposes three types of knowledge: physical, logical mathematical, and social knowledge. Physical knowledge: It refers to knowledge related to objects in the world, which can be acquired through perceptual properties. The acquisition of physical knowledge has been equated with learning in Piaget's theory (Gruber and Voneche, 1995). In other words, thought is fit directly to experience. > \\"Piaget also called his view constructivism, because he firmly believed that > knowledge acquisition is a process of continuous self-construction. That is, > Knowledge is not out there, external to the child and waiting to be > discovered. But neither is it wholly performed within the child, ready to > emerge as the child develops with the world surrounding her ... Piaget > believed that children actively approach their environments and acquire > knowledge through their actions.\\" > \\"Piaget distinguished among three types of knowledge that children acquire: > Physical, logical-mathematical, and social knowledge. Physical knowledge, > also called empirical knowledge, has to do with knowledge about objects in > the world, which can be gained through their perceptual properties... > Logical-Mathematical knowledge is abstract and must be invented, but through > actions on objects that are fundamentally different from those actions > enabling physical knowledge.... Social Knowledge is culture-specific and can > be learned only from other people within one's cultural group.\\" See also *Constructivist epistemology *Cognitive psychology *Educational psychology *Evolutionary epistemology *General semantics *Genetic structuralism *Learning styles *Learning theory *Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny *Theory of cognitive development Notes References  * Category:Developmental psychology Category:Educational psychology Category:History of psychology Category:Epistemology ","title":"Genetic epistemology"},{"id":"13916588","text":"Néstor Oscar Craviotto (born 3 October 1963 in La Plata) is an Argentine football manager and former player, who played as a defender.

An example is the English phrase \\"take a bite out of\\", which is semantically similar to the simple verb \\"bite\\". The concept has been used in studies of German and English. Other names for a stretched verb include \\"supported verb\\", \\"expanded predicate\\", \\"verbo-nominal phrase\\", and \\"delexical verb combination\\". Some definitions may place further restrictions on the construction: restricting the light verb to one of a fixed list; restricting the occurrence of articles, prepositions, or adverbs within the complex phrase; requiring the eventive noun to be identical or cognate with a synonymous simple verb, or at least requiring the stretched verb to be synonymous with some simple verb. In English, many stretched verbs are more common than a corresponding simple verb: for example \\"get rid [of X from Y]\\" compared to the verb \\"rid [Y of X]\\"; or \\"offer (one's) condolences [to X]\\" vs \\"condole [with X]\\".

She is the daughter of political activists Olga Benário Prestes and Luís Carlos Prestes. She was born in Barnimstraße Women's Prison in Berlin and was handed over to the care of her paternal grandmother, Leocádia Prestes, at age 14 months. Her mother Olga was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp and from there to a former psychiatric hospital in Bernburg in 1942, where she was gassed. In 1964, Prestes achieved a degree in Chemistry from the then \\"University of Brazil\\", now known as the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Two years later she gained a Masters in Organic Chemistry.  Life in the USSR  At the beginning of the 1970s, Prestes moved into exile in the USSR. In August 1972, she was indicted in Brazil for political activities, with the Conselho Permanente de Justiça para o Exército (the Army supreme court) sentencing her in absentia to 4 years and 6 months in prison. In December 1975 Prestes earned a Doctorate in Political Economics from the Institute of Social Science in Moscow and four years later in September 1979, the Brazilian courts reduced Prestes's sentence by four years as part of a wider amnesty.  Return to Brazil  In 1989 Prestes received a Doctorate in History from the Fluminense Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, with a thesis named A Coluna Prestes (The Prestes Column), which was the movement commanded by her father of almost 1500 men fighting against the presidency of Artur Bernardes. She is now a retired Associate Professor of Brazilian History, but she continues teaching on the Master's and Doctorate's Compared History Program at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Stevens (born 1963) is an American chemist and structural biologist, Director of the at ShanghaiTech University and Provost Professor of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, and Director of the Bridge Institute at the University of Southern California. Biography Stevens was born into a military family. In 1969 his father died in the Air Force, and his mother took several part-time jobs to support the family. He was raised in Auburn, Maine. In 1980, Stevens joined the Army under their split option training program and conducted basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey and advanced individual training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. While engaged in his military service, Stevens entered the University of Southern Maine in the Computer Science program in 1981. However, an enthusiastic professor (John Ricci) converted him to the study of Chemistry. He spent two summers working as an intern at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island with Professor Ricci, and Drs. Thomas Koetzle and Dick McMullan, where he first learned how to determine the molecular structure of compounds by X-ray and neutron diffraction. While there he also met a University of Southern California research team led by Dr. Robert Bau; after he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at USM, he entered the University of Southern California in pursuit of a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chemistry working with Professor Robert Bau and Nobel Laureate Professor, George Olah. He completed his Ph.D. in 26 months, graduating in 1988. Although science is a major part of his life, Stevens climbs mountains with his wife and children and runs ultramarathons including the Vermont 100 Mile Endurance RunVermont100 race results 2006 and American River 50 Mile Endurance Run,American River 50 Miler race results and in 2011 he successfully completed the 156 mile Marathon des Sables across the Moroccan Sahara Desert. Scientific career After obtaining his Ph.D., Stevens accepted a postdoctoral position in 1988 in the lab of Nobel Laureate William N. Lipscomb, Jr. in the chemistry department at Harvard University where he focused on the large allosteric enzyme aspartate carbamoyltransferase. Stevens, R. C., & Lipscomb, W.

In 1991, he accepted a tenure-track position at the University of California, Berkeley in the chemistry department with a joint appointment in neurobiology. His initial research as an assistant professor focused on structural neurobiology and immunology, combining chemistry, structural biology and protein chemistry with a specific biological interest in understanding how the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily works. A seminal collaboration for Stevens was with Professor Peter G. Schultz where they jointly published a series of Science and Nature papers describing the immunological evolution of antibodies through careful structural studies.H. D. Ulrich, E. Mundorff, B. D.

After the initial experience with structure based drug discovery from 1992–1997 with Gilead and Tamiflu, Stevens focused on understanding the basic mechanism of how Botox (botulinum toxin) works, and on ways to use this scaffold for next generation protein therapeutics. In parallel to the work on botulinum toxin, he worked on the enzymes involved in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway, specifically the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases including phenylalanine hydroxylase. From 1999–2004, Stevens was involved in the startup of Syrrx that developed the marketed drug Nesina for type II diabetes. From 2000–2010, Stevens has worked with BioMarin Pharmaceutical to develop Kuvan (tetrahydrobiopterin) and assisted in the design and development of PEG-PAL (pegylated Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) as treatments for mild and classical phenylketonuria (PKU).H.

In 2008, Stevens started Receptos that developed an S1P1 agonist for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease and in 2011 he started RuiYi (now Bird Rock Bio) that developed an anti-CB1 antibody for liver fibrosis. Biotechnology Startups Stevens has started four biotechnology companies (Syrrx (1999), MemRx (2002), Receptos (2009), and RuiYi (2011)), all focused on structure based drug discovery and each company started with one of his former Ph.D. students. *Syrrx, started with UC-Berkeley Ph.D. student Nathaniel David and colleague Peter G. Schultz, was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceuticals in 2005 for the high-throughput structure based drug discovery platform, and because of a phase II clinical candidate alogliptin known to inhibit the enzyme DPPIV and is now an approved drug known as Nesina. *MemRx, started with Ph.D. student Mike Hanson and Jun Yoon, was acquired by Sagres Discovery in 2003 for the membrane protein expression technologies, and the combined entity was later acquired by Novartis in 2005. *Receptos,www.receptos.com started with Ph.D. students Mike Hanson, Chris Roth and staff scientist Mark Griffith along with TSRI colleague Hugh Rosen, focused on GPCR structure based drug discovery with a primary interest in inflammation and oncology in phase III for multiple sclerosis and IBD. On July 14, 2015, Celgene announced that it will buy Receptos for $7.32 billion in cash.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/07/14/celgene- receptos/30168919/https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/14/celgene-to-acquire-receptos- for-more-than-7b.html *In 2011, Stevens, with Paul Grayson and his former TSRI graduate student Fei Xu, started RuiYi, a biologics GPCR company located in Shanghai, China. The company was acquired by Anaphore in 2012.www.ruiyibio.com The company currently has one drug in phase II clinical trials for RA and a drug in place for liver fibrosis.

This is one of Simpson's most accessible works. He used similar orchestration to that used by Ludwig van Beethoven in his early symphonies, with the exception of high D trumpets being used instead of the standard B flat trumpets. The work is in three movements: * I Allegro grazioso * II Largo cantabile * III Non troppo allegro, ma con brio The first movement opens with mysterious muted string lines in simple triple time which gracefully develops in a similar way to classical form. The tonal conflict in this Symphony centers on B and the tonalities a major third above and below it (G and E-flat). The second movement is remarkable in the way that it is a palindrome (the same backwards as forwards) if one removes the last few bars. In all there are thirteen variations on the viola theme which opens the movement, and many of the motives within the movement are palindromic to ensure formal cohesion. The finale makes an ironic end to the symphony, with its themes and brass/timpani interjections creating a sort of Beethovenian hilarity. Even so, this movement has its fair share of dissonance which is always a distinctive feature in Simpson's writing.

It originally aired on October 25, 2007, and was watched by 6.95 million viewers.  Plot  After Elliot almost kisses J.D. in the on-call room, she begins to question her engagement with Keith. The episode then focuses on epiphanies by the main characters. Elliot realizes she carried on a meaningless relationship due to her desire to be married; consequently, she calls off the wedding twice. J.D. realizes his tendency to sabotage himself and yearns to avoid it, but fails when he refuses to believe that the Janitor has a girlfriend named Lady. Meanwhile, Turk is challenged with choosing the semi-annual candy bar he is allowed to eat because of his diabetes. He, too, has an epiphany and decides to make a random selection. Throughout the episode, Dr. Cox, Turk, and Dr. Kelso pull together to diagnose a very charming patient, Joe Hutnik. Cox, upon telling Dr. Beardfacé that if he wants to lose the nickname \\"Beardface\\", he has to shave his beard, realizes that his initial diagnosis of Lyme disease was correct, citing Occam's Razor (which J.D. references internally while holding a Razr cell phone). In this case, the patient's tick bite was not discovered because it was under his hair. J.D. consults Turk about Kim, because he feels he's only with her because she is pregnant with his child. He realizes that's true—but because of the trauma of his parents divorcing, he will stay with Kim even though he's not in love with her. Continuity * Carla tells Elliot and J.D. not to obsess over their own hypocrisies because it is human nature to want what's best for others even if you have difficulty following your own advice. She also says that she doesn't want to have to repeat this advice \\"two weeks from now\\". Two episodes later, in \\"My Inconvenient Truth\\", she repeats the same rant to Elliot and the Janitor. * Turk mentions that the only girl who was good for J.D. was \\"Mole Butt\\". He is referring to Elliot, whom he previously addressed with this nickname in \\"Her Story II\\" when mentioning J.D's previous girlfriends. * Turk can now grow a full head of hair, whereas in previous seasons (for instance, in \\"My Way Home\\") he was said to be balding and only able to grow hair in patches. * At the beginning of the episode, the words \\"Veer felt at\\" and \\"Peace Sam\\" are seen on the locker behind J.D. \\"Peace Sam\\" can also be seen in the episode \\"My Screw Up\\". * The Janitor's girlfriend Lady is played by Kit Pongetti, who previously appeared as Dr. Mitchell in the season two episode \\"My Philosophy\\". *The discovery of a tick bite under a patient's hair was used as a plot device two weeks later in \\"Ugly\\", an episode of House. Reception Television Without Pity gave this episode a B rating, and questioned whether the show was becoming a daytime soap due to the plot of the sixth season finale and this episode. Travis Fickett of IGN complimented Scrubs consistent quality and resolution of the previous episode's cliffhanger, and gave it an 8.4/10 (\\"Impressive\\") rating.

The Order was introduced by Prince Nikola I of Montenegro in 1869. It is sometimes said that this order was actually introduced much earlier by Prince-Bishop (Vladika) Peter II Petrović-Njegoš. The Order is bestowed upon prominent members of the Petrović-Njegoš family, as well as to prominent foreign citizens, and is currently held by all four Princes and Princesses of the Royal House. The name of Prince Danilo, the first Montenegrin ruler with a purely secular title, is inscribed on the Decoration. This is often attributed to the fact that the Order was a prototype for the other dynastic Order of Prince Danilo I. The Order was named after the Patron Saint of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, Prince-Bishop (Vladika) Peter I Petrović, the person who effectively obtained independence for Montenegro, and to whom is attributed the creation of the modern Montenegrin State.

Background  The album is one of Streisand's best-selling albums and is ranked as one of the best-selling Christmas albums of all time. The cover photograph of the album was taken on June 16, 1967, during the rehearsal for her concert, A Happening in Central Park. The album is also Streisand's last album to use Columbia's \\"Stereo 360 sound\\" banner, and the last to be issued originally in monaural and stereo. Most copies of the LP edition seen today are stereophonic. Many of the tracks from this album were re-issued in 1970 as Side 1 of a compilation album titled Seasons Greetings from Barbra Streisand...and Friends, pieced together by Maxwell House Coffee and Columbia Special Products. (Side 2 of the compilation featured various tracks from Streisand's Columbia labelmates Doris Day, Jim Nabors, and Andre Kostelanetz.) The album was released on CD in November 1989. It was remastered and reissued once again in October 2004 for the Columbia Records \\"Essential Holiday Classics\\" series. The album was yet again reissued in October 2007 to commemorate the album's 40th anniversary. On May 5, 1999, A Christmas Album was certified Quintuple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of five million copies in the United States. Critical reception Reviewing the album for AllMusic, William Ruhlman gave it a retrospective four and a half (out of five) stars and called it \\"a timeless classic\\", stating that \\"If Simply Streisand ... indicated that Streisand was overly reverent when it came to standards, reverence was no problem with seasonal fare.\\" Commercial performance On Billboard magazine's special year-end weekly Christmas Albums chart, A Christmas Album spent all five weeks that the chart was published in late 1967 at No. 1, making it the best-selling holiday album of 1967 in the U.S. The album charted for the first time on Billboard's weekly Billboard 200 album sales chart in December 1981, peaking at position No. 108 during a five-week chart run. For the week ending November 24, 2012, the album re-entered the Billboard 200 chart at No. 195 and climbed to No. 183 the following week. It has also reached No. 38 on the Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. For the week ending January 6, 2012 the album re-entered the Billboard Holiday Album Sales chart at No. 46 and climbed to No. 31 the following week.

The speakers of a certain language usually have names that do not exist in another language. Even when the name has a common root or refers to the same historic or religious figure, different languages will spell and pronounce the name in a unique way. Thus a name with identical spelling in two languages may be of interest to parents of Third Culture Kids, or immigrants. Examples =Differentiated spelling= Children named after Alexander the Great, Saint Alexander, or any other Alexander are known as: *Alexander in German and English. *Alexandre in French, Catalan and Portuguese. *Alejandro in Spanish, although commonly nicknamed Alex, just like the female name Alejandra. Sandro/a is a common variation. *Alessandro in Italian. Female: Alessandra. *Alexandru in Romanian, shortened to Alex or Sandu. *Alexand'r (Russian Cyrillic: Александр) in Russian, with Александра as a female name. *Alexandr in Czech, nicknamed Alex, with Alexandra being the female name. *Aleksandar (Serbian Cyrillic: Александар) in Serbian, often shortened to Aleksa (Алекса). *İskender in Turkish. *Eskandar or Sekandar in Persian. *(al-)Iskandar in Arabic. *Yeskend'r (Kazakh Cyrillic: Ескендір) in Kazakh. *Sándor in Hungarian. *Santeri in Finnish, which is shortened from Aleksanteri. Or variations thereof. Some languages don't have this or other names. This is the case with many Chinese names that are not translatable into English. Today, personal names are seen as untranslatable, but this has not always been the case. George Walker Bush is referred to as George Walker Bush except in places where that name is impossible to render in the local alphabet. For example, in Azerbaijani the name is rendered Corc Uolker Buş because the Azerbaijani alphabet lacks the letters J and W, but has a letter ş which corresponds to the English \\"sh\\" sounds. Historically, learned Europeans were often identified with Latinized versions of their names. Christopher Columbus was published as Christophorus Columbus. In Modern Italian, the same name is Cristoforo Colombo, in Portuguese as Cristóvão Colombo (formerly Christovam Colom), and in Spanish as Cristóbal Colón. Christophorus is the Latin version of the Greek Χριστόφορος (Khristóphoros). =Exotic naming= Along with the comparatively slow changes in child-naming customs, many parents throughout the world give their child a name that does not have a common translation in their own language like Adabel Anahí, sometimes as an aspirational gesture. =Rarely used male bilingual names in English and Spanish= *Aaron (rare in Spanish) *Abel (rare in English) *Abraham (rare in both languages) *Amos (rare in both languages) *Brendan (rare in Spanish) *Bruno (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Caleb (rare in both languages) *Crispin (rare in both languages) *Hugo (identified with the French language both in English and Spanish) *Jon (rare in both languages) *Leon (rare in both languages) *Levi (rare in both languages) *Mario (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Noel (rare in Spanish) *Oliver (identified with the German language in Spanish) *Roman (identified with the French language both in English and Spanish) *Saul (somewhat rare in both languages) *Tobias (rare in both languages) *Tristan (rare in both languages) *Xavier (rare in both languages: associated with French and Catalan) = Commonly used male bilingual names in English and Spanish= *Adrian *Benjamin *Christian *David *Daniel *Damian *Felix *Gabriel *Isaac *Ivan *Julian *Lucas (disambiguation) *Martin *Oscar *Sebastian *Ruben *Samuel *Simon (disambiguation) *Victor (disambiguation) =Rarely used female bilingual names in English and Spanish= *Adabel (rare in both languages) *Aida (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Alda (rare in both languages) *Alma *Anahí (most rare in English) *Belinda (rare in both languages) *Brenda (rare in both languages) *Calista (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Dora (rare in both languages) *Edwina (rare in both languages) *Edilma (rare in English) *Juliana (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Leonora (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Marla (rare in both languages) *Martina (rare in both languages) *Norma (rare in both languages) *Tamara (rare in both languages) *Ursula (identified with the Italian language both in English and Spanish) *Virginia (rare in both languages) *Zoe (identified with the Greek language both in English and Spanish) = Commonly used female bilingual names in English and Spanish= *Abigail - Rare in Spanish *Adelaide/Adele/Adeliza/Alix/Adela - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Amanda *Amelia/Amalia - The English spelling is tolerated in Spanish *Andrea *Anna/Ana - The English spelling is tolerated in Spanish *Annabel/Anabel - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Barbara - Rare in Spanish *Cecilia *Christina/Cristina *Claudia *Diana *Dolores - Rare in English *Elaine/Eliana - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Emily/Emilia - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Emma *Gabriela/Gabriella *Gemma - Rare in Spanish *Helen/Helena/Elena - The bold spelling is tolerated in English and Spanish *Irene *Julia *Lisa - Rare in Spanish *Linda - Rare in Spanish *Mary/Maria - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Marcia - Rare in Spanish *Maura - Rare in English *Melinda - Rare in Spanish *Micaela - Rare in English *Miriam - Rare in English *Monica/Mónica *Naomi - Rare in Spanish, this name is actually a trilingual name as it exists in Japanese too. *Olga - Rare in English *Olivia *Patricia *Paula *Pauline/Paulina - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Pamela - Rare in Spanish *Priscilla/Priscila - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Rose/Rosa - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Sarah/Sara - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Serena - Rare in Spanish *Sophie/Sofie/Sophia/Sofia - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Susan/Suzan/Susann/Susanne/Suzanne/Susanna/Susannah/Susana - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Sylvia/Silvia - The English spelling is tolerated in Spanish *Tanya/Tania - The Spanish spelling is tolerated in English *Theresa/Therese/Teresa - the bold spelling is tolerated in English and Spanish *Veronica/Verónica *Victoria Other common bilingual names *Sahara (Japanese and Hindi) *Handa (Japanese and Punjabi) *Yuri (Japanese, usually female, and Russian, male) *Hana (Japanese and Czech; both female) See also *Multilingualism *Alexandre (disambiguation) *Benjamin (disambiguation) *David (name) *Daniel References *Baby Name Wizard: Name Voyager *Freakonomics Revised and Expanded: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D.

History London, Midland and Scottish Railway poster advertising the opening of Perry Barr Greyhound Stadium in Birmingham, in April 1928. Modern greyhound racing has evolved from a form of hunting called coursing, in which a dog runs after a live game animal – usually a rabbit or hare. The first official coursing meeting was held in 1776 at Swaffham, Norfolk. The rules of the Swaffham Coursing Society specified that only two greyhounds were to course a single hare and that the hare was to be given a head start of 240 yards. Coursing by proxy with an artificial lure was introduced at Hendon, on September 11, 1876. Six dogs raced over a 400-yard straight course, chasing an artificial hare. This was the first attempt to introduce mechanical racing to the UK; however it did not catch on at the time. The oval track and mechanical hare were introduced to Britain in 1926, by Charles Munn, an American, in association with Major Lyne-Dixson, a key figure in coursing. Finding other supporters proved to be rather difficult, and with the General Strike of 1926 looming, the two men scoured the country to find others who would join them. Eventually they met Brigadier-General Critchley, who in turn introduced them to Sir William Gentle. Between them they raised £22,000 and launched the Greyhound Racing Association. On July 24, 1926, in front of 1,700 spectators, the first modern greyhound race in Great Britain took place at Belle Vue Stadium, where seven greyhounds raced round an oval circuit to catch an electric artificial hare. They then hurried to open tracks in London at the White City Stadium and Harringay Stadium. The first three years of racing were successful financially, with attendances of 5.5 million in 1927, 13.7 million in 1928 and 16 million in 1929. Racing The greyhound racing industry in Great Britain currently falls under two sectors: that registered by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), and a sector known as 'independent racing' or 'flapping' which is unaffiliated to a governing body. =Registered racing= thumb Registered racing in Great Britain is regulated by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) and has been UKAS accredited since 2010. All in the registered sector are subject to the GBGB Rules of Racing and the Directions of the Stewards, who set the standards for greyhound welfare and racing integrity, from racecourse facilities and trainers' kennels to retirement of greyhounds. There are Stewards' inquiries, and then disciplinary action is taken against anyone found failing to comply. The registered sector consists of 19 racecourses and approximately 880 trainers, 4,000 kennel staff and 860 racecourse officials. Greyhound owners number 15,000 with approximately 7,000-8,000 greyhounds registered annually for racing. =Independent racing= Independent racing, also known as 'flapping', is held at three racecourses. The numbers of trainers, kennel staff, owners and greyhounds involved in independent racing is unknown because there is no requirement for central registration or licensing, and no code of practice. In England, standards for welfare and integrity are set by local government, but there is no governing or other regulatory body. Stadiums In the 1940s, there were seventy seven licensed tracks and over two hundred independent tracks in the United Kingdom, of which thirty three were in London. Now there are 19 registered and three independent stadiums. =Registered stadiums= Nottingham Stadium Towcester Stadium Shawfield Stadium Sheffield Stadium There are 19 active Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) registered stadiums in the UK, with 18 in England and one in Scotland.

Greyhound Derby This race must have minimum prize money of £50,000. The competition has six rounds and attracts around 180 entries each year. There are two derbys in Britain: the Scottish Greyhound Derby held at Shawfield Stadium, and the English Greyhound Derby formerly held at Wimbledon and Towcester. The 2019 competition will be held at Nottingham. In addition, the Irish Greyhound Derby, held at Shelbourne Park, is open to British greyhounds. There used to be a Welsh Greyhound Derby but the event finished in 1977 after the Arms Park track in Cardiff closed. In 2010 the Northern Irish Derby was introduced. Category One Race These races must have minimum prize money of £12,500. They can be run between one and four rounds but must be completed within a 15-day period, except for special circumstances. In any event the competition must be completed within 18 days. Category One races replaced competitions called classic races in the 1990s. Category Two Race These races must have minimum prize money of £5,000. They can be run with one, two or three rounds but must be completed within a 15-day period. Category Three Race These races must have minimum prize money of £1,000. They can be run over one or two rounds and within a nine-day period. A category three race can be staged over one day but must have minimum prize money of £500. Invitation Race A special type of open race usually staged by the promoter in support on the night of other opens. This will be proposed to the committee by the Greyhound Board or by a promoter, with the racers being invited into the competition rather than the usual process. The minimum prize money for these races is £750. Minor Open Race This is any other open race. The minimum added money for these races is £150.  Graded racing This is any other race staged at a track, and prize money is varied. This kind of racing is the core of most stadiums and some of the racing can be viewed in betting shops on the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS). The Racing Manager selects the greyhounds based on ability and organises them into traps (called seeding) and classes (usually 1-9) with grade 1 being the best class. * A class represent standard races * B class represent standard races+ * D class represent sprint races * S class represent staying races * M class represent marathon races * P class represent puppy races * H class represent hurdle races * Hcp class represents handicap races \\\\+ Only used if a track has an alternative standard distance. Racing jacket colours and starting traps Greyhound racing in Britain has a standard colour scheme. The starting traps (equipment that the greyhound starts a race in) determines the colour. Races with eight greyhounds are no longer held. * Trap 1 = Red with White numeral * Trap 2 = Blue with White numeral * Trap 3 = White with Black numeral * Trap 4 = Black with White numeral * Trap 5 = Orange with Black numeral * Trap 6 = Black & White Stripes with Red numeral * Trap 7 = Green with Red numeral (no longer used) * Trap 8 = Yellow and Black with White numeral (no longer used) A racing jacket worn by a reserve bears an additional letter 'R' prominently on each side. Racing greyhounds and welfare =Treatment of racing greyhounds= Greyhound racing at registered stadiums in Great Britain is regulated by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB). In Britain greyhounds are not kept at the tracks and are instead housed in the kennels of trainers and transported to the tracks to race. Licensed kennels have to fall within specific guidelines and rules and are checked by officials to make sure the treatment of racing greyhounds is within the rules. In 2018 licensing and inspecting trainer's kennels was conducted through the government-approved, UKAS accredited method. When a greyhound is due to race or trial at a track it's health and condition must be checked by the veterinary surgeon at kennelling time and again before they are permitted to race, the weight must be recorded by officials and random drugs tests are conducted. =Retirement= When the greyhounds finish racing they are retired under the GBGB bond scheme (introduced in 2020) which ensures the homing costs are met.. Owners may keep the dog for breeding or as pets, or they can send them to greyhound adoption groups. The Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) have introduced measures to locate where racing greyhounds reside after they have retired from racing and from 2017 the retirement data has been available to the public. Concern among welfare groups is the well being of some racing greyhounds who are not adopted upon their retirement, and that they may subsequently be put down or sold by their owners, however the GBGB require all owners to sign a retirement form indicating the retirement plans. The main greyhound adoption organisation in Britain is the Retired Greyhound Trust (RGT). The RGT is a charity but is partly funded by the British Greyhound Racing Fund (BGRF), who gave funding of £1,400,000 in 2015 and rehomed 4,000 greyhounds in 2016. In recent years the racing industry has made significant progress in establishing programmes for the adoption of retired racers. Many race tracks have established their own adoption programmes in addition to actively cooperating with private adoption groups throughout the country. There are also many independent organisations which find homes for retired Greyhounds including Forever Hounds, Greyhound Gap, Celia Cross Greyhound Trust and Bark Inn Kennels. Several independent rescue and homing groups receive some funding from the industry but mainly rely on public donations. In 2016, 1,500 greyhounds were rehomed by independent groups. In 2018 several tracks introduced a scheme whereby every greyhound is found a home by the track, these include Kinsley and Doncaster. =Injuries= The most recent independently verified published figures show that the 2019 injury rate was 1.21% which equated to 4,970 from 410,607 runs. The most common injury was a hind limb muscle at 1104 (0.27%), this was followed by foot injuries 1088 (0.26%), wrist 792 (0.19%), hock 765 (0.19%), fore limb muscle 504 (0.12%), for long bone 94 (0.02%) and hind long bone 29 (0.01%), other equated to 594 (0.14%).{{Cite weburl=https://s3-eu- west-1.amazonaws.com/gbgb-prod-assets/wp- content/uploads/2020/06/30075420/GBGB-2019-Injury-and- Retirement.pdftitle=Injury and Retirement Datapublisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain =Drugs= The Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) actively works to prevent the spread of drug usage within the registered greyhound racing sector. Attempts are made to recover urine samples from all six greyhounds in a race. Greyhounds from which samples can not be obtained for a certain number of consecutive races are subject to being ruled off the track. If a positive sample is found, violators are subject to penalties and loss of their racing licenses by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB). The trainer of the greyhound is at all times the \\"absolute insurer\\" of the condition of the animal. The trainer is responsible for any positive test regardless of how the banned substance has entered the greyhound's system. Due to the increased practice of random testing, the number of positive samples has decreased. Over a one year period from 2017-18, over 15,000 greyhounds were tested by the GBGB 'flying squad' which returned four positive cocaine tests. These cases resulted in disqualification or suspension for the offending parties. =Controversy= Isolated incidents have occurred that resulted in national newspaper articles. In 2012, there was a report of greyhound cadavers being sold to research labs used for students to practice upon. Liverpool University Animal Training School has stated that it received the remains of dogs put to sleep because it was essential to improving animal health and welfare. Charles Pickering, a greyhound breeder from Lincolnshire was exposed offering 'slow' dogs to the Liverpool school as live subjects. The Greyhound Board of Great Britain Disciplinary Committee found Pickering in breach of rules 18(i), (ii) and (iii), 152 (i) and (ii), 174(vi) and 174(xiv) (a) and (b) and ordered that he be made a Warned Off person (life ban) and fined the sum of £5,000. Greyhounds were sent to builder David Smith, in the North East of England who destroyed greyhounds with a captive bolt gun, he was unqualified to do so. Smith faced a fine and jail sentence and anyone found to have sent a greyhound to him was warned off for life.

He won the 2010 Auckland mayoral election on 9 October 2010 and was sworn in as Mayor of Auckland on 1 November 2010, being the first to hold that title for the amalgamated Auckland \\"Super City\\", and was re-elected in 2013.New Zealand Herald: Super City elections 2013: Brown to wield the knife Brown had previously been elected mayor of Manukau City in October 2007, the second time he ran for that office. Brown is married to Shirley Anne \\"Shan\\" Inglis, and has three daughters: Samantha, Olivia and Victoria.  Early years  Brown was born in Taumarunui, a small town in the King Country of the central North Island of New Zealand. His family moved to Otara, South Auckland when he was seven years old. He attended Mayfield Primary School, Papatoetoe Intermediate School and De La Salle College. He remembers his youth in prosperous small-town New Zealand fondly, remarking on them as \\"generous, generous days\\". His life growing up has been described as revolving around family, church, school and community. His parents, Tom and Ngaire, were described as strong believers in social equity and social justice as well as active in the community life. While not having grown up fully in Auckland, his family often travelled to see relatives there, his parents having originally moved to Taumarunui from South Auckland. A lawyer by profession, Brown was a partner at law firm Wynyard Wood, and co- founded the Howick Free Legal Service. In 1990, Brown was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Political career He was first elected to the Manukau City council in 1992, and continued as councillor until 2004 when he did not run for re-election. He was also the chairperson of the Counties Manukau Health Council from 1998. Brown first ran for mayor of Manukau City in 2004, and narrowly lost to long serving mayor Sir Barry Curtis by fewer than 600 votes. Brown had considered requesting a re-count due to the closeness of the vote, but decided that he had not been close enough to warrant it. Despite his affiliation with the New Zealand Labour Party since age 17, Brown did not run for election in the 2005 general election, and instead returned to working for Wynyard Wood. =Mayor of Manukau City= Brown announced his candidacy for the Manukau City mayoralty in 2006, Barry Curtis announced that he would not be running for re-election, and Brown's main opposition were former Olympic runner Dick Quax and radio personality Willie Jackson. Brown resigned from Wynyard Wood in 2007 to focus on his candidacy full-time. In August 2007, both Quax and Brown were polling \\"neck and neck\\". Brown ran on several policies, including; capping rates at the cost of inflation, increasing public transport, and working with youth in the region. Brown won the election in October 2007 with more than 32,000 votes; his next closest rival Dick Quax had less than 18,000, and the election was humorously termed a 'Lenslide' by some. He was sworn in on 26 October 2007 at the Manukau City Council hall. On 31 May 2008 he suffered a heart attack, while at a music awards ceremony. The condition arose from a previously unrecognised congenital heart problem and Brown was admitted to Auckland Hospital. Brown had successful heart bypass surgery two days later and made a full recovery, returning to mayoral duties after a few months. His wife acknowledged that the attack was not stress- related, but rather a family issue, with Len's mother having died from a heart attack at 47. =Mayor of Auckland campaign= In August 2009, Brown announced that he would run for the mayoralty of the combined Auckland \\"super-city\\" in the 2010 Auckland mayoral election. His campaign speech focused on delivering public transport, public ownership of the region's public assets, environmental protection, economic and social development. He won the position by a majority of 65,945 votes over main rival candidate, Auckland City mayor John Banks, on 9 October 2010, spending approximately $390,000. Credit- card and expense issues In June 2010, Brown came under media attention for matters relating to his spending on his council credit card and other council expense claims, which included items of a personal nature like toys, groceries and insect repellant. His subsequent explanations for these purchases were also scrutinised at a council meeting, where Brown repeatedly slapped his face and got emotional. An advisor later explained that Brown's emotional behaviour was attributable to his use of a Maori tradition, which Brown subsequently denied. Another council expense claim included an $810 dinner at a restaurant, which Brown has refused to discuss who was in attendance. He noted that the event was a fundraiser for a local singer for which the Council bought a table, an explanation later supported by the artist. =Mayor of Auckland= thumb As Mayor of Auckland, Brown was an advocate for the proposed City Rail Link, to boost public transport usage. In June 2013, the National Government agreed to financially support construction of the rail project, and construction began in late-2015. City Rail Link starts. Auckland Transport 21 December 2015. Brown was re-elected to the mayoralty in 2013, gaining 46.6% of the vote. In response to the low voter turnout (at 34% the lowest ever recorded in Auckland), Brown said the next election should include electronic voting and take place on one day, instead of being spread out over three weeks. In late 2015, he stated he would not contest the mayoralty at the 2016 election, and was succeeded as mayor by Phil Goff as a result of that election.  Extramarital affair  Days after his October 2013 re- election, stories broke regarding Brown having a two-year extramarital affair with Bevan Chuang, a younger woman who served on an Auckland Council advisory board, and having sex with Chuang in the mayoral office and town hall. Brown released a statement confirming the affair, though not the details on where they had sex. Later in the week, Chuang claimed to have been pressured to go public by a member of mayoral rival John Palino's election team, which she later regretted doing. The Auckland Council launched an investigation into spending by the mayor, which backed up his insistence that he never spent council money on Chuang. The report did find that he had received undisclosed upgrades from hotels around the city. The Serious Fraud Office determined that the matter did not require further investigation or prosecution, and leave to bring a private prosecution for corruption was denied by the Solicitor-General for lack of proper evidence.

KCIS is powered at 5,000 watts by day, using a non-directional signal.Radio-Locator.com/KCIS The daytime transmitter is co-located with the studios and offices, on Freemont Avenue North at Kings Garden Drive in Seattle. But to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 630, it reduces power at night to 2,500 watts, using a directional antenna. The nighttime tower array is off Kaltenborn Road in Snohomish. Programming During the day and evening, KCIS airs mostly national religious shows hosted by Christian leaders such as Jim Daly, David Jeremiah, Chuck Swindoll and June Hunt. Overnight and during some daytime hours, the station plays soft Christian music. History In 1954, the station signed on as KGDN. It was originally a 1,000 watt daytimer station operating from King's Garden, the former name of Crista Ministries.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-247 The call sign referred to King's GarDeN. In 1960, KGDN added an FM station at 105.3 MHz. At first it was simulcast with KGDN but later switched to separate religious programming and Christian music. Its first call sign was KGFM, later KBIQ and today KCMS, still co-owned with KCIS. In the 1970s, the power was boosted to 5,000 watts, but still as a daytime-only station.

In some motel and hotel rooms, small apartments, college dormitories, or office buildings, a kitchenette consists of a small refrigerator, a microwave oven, and sometimes a sink. New York City building code defines a kitchenette as a kitchen of less than 7.4 m2 (80 ft2) of floor space. Example of kitchenette located in a small studio apartment of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. In hotels and motels Kitchenettes are a common feature in hotel and motel guest rooms and often contain a coffeemaker, a bar refrigerator, commonly called a mini-bar. Some hotel kitchenettes have provisioned refrigerators that have an interior sensor feature used by management to monitor guest use of the refrigerator's contents and thus charge for the consumables, which typically include soda, beer, and liquor. In Britain In British English, the term kitchenette also refers to a small secondary kitchen in a house. Often it is found on the same floor as the children's bedrooms, and used by a nanny or au pair to prepare meals for children; the same feature can be found in hotels such as some in London. Small apartment style The word kitchenette was also used to refer to a type of small apartment prevalent in African American communities in Chicago and New York City during the mid-twentieth century. Landlords often divided single-family homes or large apartment units into smaller units to house more families. Living conditions in these kitchenettes were often wretched; the author Richard Wright described them as \\"our prison, our death sentence without a trial\\".Jerry Washington Ward and Robert Butler. \\"Kitchenettes\\".

The station broadcasts an oldies-classic hits-sports radio format to the Seattle metropolitan area. The station, established in 1922, is currently operated by S-R Broadcasting Co., Inc., a locally owned company. KRKO broadcasts at 50,000 watts, the maximum power for commercial AM radio stations. But it uses a directional antenna at night because it operates on a regional broadcast frequency and must protect other stations on AM 1380. It is also heard on a 250 watt FM translator, 95.3 MHz K237GN in Everett. Current Format KRKO calls its format \\"Everett's Greatest Hits\\" which is heavy on the 1970s, with a splash of the 60s and 80s. The morning show features radio veteran Tim Hunter (formerly of KOMO, KLSY, The Wolf) heard weekdays 6 to 9 a.m. While a music-based format, KRKO continues to cover local and regional sports in Western Washington State, including high school football and basketball. Live play-by-play affiliations include the Everett AquaSox minor league baseball (Seattle Mariners affiliate), Everett Silvertips (Western Hockey League), NHL Vancouver Canucks and two racing networks, Motor Racing Network (MRN Radio) and Performance Racing Network (PRN Radio). Two of the local sportscasters are Bill Kusler and Tom Lafferty. History KRKO was the fifth radio station in Washington to receive a license from the Department of Commerce. The original license hangs on the wall in the station and is dated August 17, 1922. The Department of Commerce issued call sign KFBL to the radio station at the time. Otto and Robert Leese started the radio station on the second floor of their auto repair shop on 28th and Rucker in downtown Everett. The station has been locally operated since it was licensed in 1922. The Leese brothers transferred control of the station to their engineer, Lee Mudgett, in the 1930s, and Mudgett later transferred control to the Taft family in the late 1930s. The station remained under Taft family ownership until the late 1970s. The Taft's Washington, D.C. attorney, John Marple, operated KRKO with some investors for a few years. Then in the early 1980s, an Everett area investment group led by a local beer distributor, Niles Fowler, acquired control of the station. Control of KRKO was transferred back to a member of the Taft family following a sale of the station in the mid-1980s, but in 1987, new local investors Art Skotdal and Roy Robinson purchased the KRKO assets and the Skotdal family continues to operate KRKO today. On September 4, 2009, two of the station's four radio towers were toppled by vandals. A sign left at the scene said the eco-terrorist group Earth Liberation Front was responsible. The station transferred its radio transmission to a backup site and remained on the air at reduced power. KRKO operated from the damaged site at full daytime power and reduced nighttime power until both of the destroyed towers were replaced on August 16, 2010. On October 4 and 5, 2014, KRKO was the only radio station in North America broadcasting a 100% digital signal during historic tests for NAB Labs, a division of the National Association of Broadcasters. KRKO suspended analog transmissions for eight hours on Saturday and four hours on Sunday for daytime and nighttime tests, respectively. KRKO was the fourth commercial AM station in North America to test all-digital daytime transmissions. KRKO currently broadcasts using HD Radio technology alongside its analog signal.HD Radio Guide for Seattle-Tacoma KRKO began a sports radio format in 2000, featuring programming from Fox Sports Radio.

A manor house or fortified manor-house is a country house, which has historically formed the centre of a manor (see Manorialism). The term is sometimes applied to relatively small country houses which belonged to gentry families, as well as to grand stately homes, particularly as a technical term for minor late medieval castles more intended for show than for defence. History Hermitage manor was in the old Hemlingford Hundred in the county of Warwickshire. Hemlingford was one of the four hundreds that the English county of Warwickshire was divided into, along with Kington, Knightlow and Barlichway. It was recorded in the Domesday Book under the name of Coleshill. The hundred covered northern Warwickshire, including Birmingham, Solihull and Tamworth. A hundred was under a lord/lords, becoming hereditary, a steward was appointed in place of a sheriff. The importance of the hundred courts declined from the seventeenth century, and most of the powers were extinguished with the establishment of county courts in 1867.County Courts Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 142) s.28 The remaining duty of the inhabitants of a hundred to make good damages caused by riot was ended in 1886, when the cost was transferred to the county police rate.Riot (Damages) Act 1886 (49 & 50 Vict. c. 38), s.2 Although hundreds had no administrative or legal role after this date, they have never been formally abolished, nor have their hereditary peers. The Manor was first recorded in the court of King Henry I of England (1100–1135). It was recorded in Worcester Cathedral. Huge Del Ermytage was permitted a fortification of a trihedral moat (moat of three sides). It is said to have been built in this parish by Hemeric, incumbent at the time when Robert de Ceraso was the local lord.Dugd. 978. It was given by Gilbert Picot to the Prior and Convent of Worcester; his son William increased the estate and it was valued at £1 14s. in 1291.Tax. Eccl. (Rec. Com.), 257.

Soc.), 237. Thereafter it was passed to Samuel Jewkes Esquire of Wolverley in the county of Worcester. Samuel Jewkes heir; Talbot Jewkes (Sergeant at Arms) sold and surrendered the manor under the court of Queen Anne (1702–1714) to John Adcock, Yeoman of Meriden in the county of Warwickshire. John Adcock’s heir, Mary Adcock in the year 1770 surrendered the manor in her last will and testament at the Prerogative Court at Lichfield to John Cooper-Royle, citizen, to alienate to him and his for ever. In accordance with this, the right and title of the Manor of the Hermitage shall not be sold or any have the power to sell it until no lawfully begotten seed is living. Present day In modern day, Hermitage Manor is situated near Little Packington, Great Packington and Maxstoke – An area affiliated with the more modern Packington Hall. It is 1½ miles north-east of St Bartholomews church in Little Packington. The current hereditary Peer is Lord Matthew Jenkins of Lichfield, having had the title passed to him from his late grandfather – Charles William Denis Cooper-Royle in 2005.

On May 31, 1982, at Midnight, 1590 became KJET with an Alternative Rock format, which was starting to emerge in popularity at the time.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1982/RR-1982-06-18.pdfhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Mediatrix/Mediatrix-Seattle-1986.pdf The first song on \\"KJET\\" was \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts. The station gained immediate popularity with its primary target audience of young adults, as the market did not have an alternative station on FM radio, which was where most music formats were migrating towards. In addition, the station also had a following outside of Seattle, particularly at night, due to its signal strength, where it was receivable in Eastern Washington and as far north as Alaska. However, due to financial troubles, KJET signed off at 3 p.m. on September 23, 1988, with \\"Through Being Cool\\" by Devo as the final song.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1988/RR-1988-09-30.pdf After that, the station became KQUL, with a 1950s/60s oldies format, and was completely satellite-fed from the \\"Kool Gold\\" network. (Adams Communications bought the station in 1989, with Chrysler Capital Corporation buying the station in December 1992 due to Adams' bankruptcy.) KQUL would change its call letters back to KZOK in November 1989, and on February 1, 1990, KZOK-AM became Seattle's home for the Z-Rock network, which then changed to a simulcast of KZOK-FM in October 1993. On September 8, 1994, after Chrysler Capital sold the station to current owner Salem Communications, KZOK-AM became KPOZ with a \\"positive Country\\" format, which would later transition to Christian music.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-07-01.pdf The KLFE call letters came into effect on August 1, 1995. Brokered Russian programming would be added in 2000. On November 15, 2010, KLFE switched to its current conservative talk format, featuring hosts such as Bill Bennett, Mike Gallagher, Dennis Prager, Dennis Miller, Hugh Hewitt, and Mark Levin. Salem's own Michael Medved, based in Seattle, is not heard on the station due to his existing contract with KTTH.Completing The Seattle Trifecta: Salem To Add Conservative Talker Radio Insight.

It is located southwest of Summerhill. Agher Demesne Turn left at the crossroads; continue a kilometre down the road and on the left is the entrance to Agher Demesne or also called Agher Pallis. This was the seat of the Winter family, and had a number of out-houses, gardens, and orchards. The residence was situated in a demesne of about 350 acres. It is said that the cottages on his estate were excellent, showing Winter's regard for comfort of his tenants and employees. =Agher House= Agher House faced east with the wing to the south side. The gardens included trees and shrubs, with a pond to the west of the house. The Winters had many servants including a butler, cook, housekeeper and maids as well as a coachman, a carpenter and a gardener. In the early 1930s Colonel Winter sold the estate to the Irish Land Commission. The Land Commission divided the land among some local people and people from the west and south of Ireland. The Commission tried to sell the house but could get no offers and in 1947 a decision was taken to demolish the house by controlled explosion. The rubble was pushed into the basement of the former mansion and a modern house was built beside it. The site retains some original features like the entrance, gate lodges, out-offices and the farmyard. Agher Church Jonathan Swift Agher Church is the local Anglican church. The church holds a very important stained-glass window made by Thomas Jervais. It is the second- earliest known Irish-made stained-glass window. The unusual subject is St Paul preaching to the Athenians on top of Mars Hill outside the Court of Areopagus. The window was originally erected in the private chapel of the nearby Dangan Castle, the former stately home and seat of the Wellesley family (the childhood home of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), which burnt down in the 1809. The window was presented to Agher by the O'Connor family, who were then occupying Dangan. Soon after the new Agher Church was constructed, Samuel Winter erected a family burial vault in the churchyard. Agher church was re-built in 1902. The church's history goes back to 1407, when The Reverend W. Edwards and Reverend N. Vale was a part of the clergy. The poet, political writer, and clergyman Jonathan Swift (1667–1745) was rector of the Church of Ireland Church at Agher. The adjoining cemetery contains the graves of the Winter family, who provided the land on which the church was built in 1802. Members of the O'Higgins Family who were descended from the Barons of Ballynary in County Sligo and of whom Bernardo O'Higgins of Chile was a kinsman are also buried in Agher Cemetery. Agher Church is in the Rathmolyon and Dunboyne Union of parishes. The rector of the union is Rev. Eugene Griffin. Sport Summerhill Golf Club is a 9 hold golf course located on the Rathmolyon end of the area close to the Rahinstown Estate. It is owned by the Nangle family. As of 2013, the captain was Joe Crowe. Agher's local Association football (soccer) club is Park Celtic Summerhill. Originally formed in the 1980s as Agher Park FC, with just one team playing in the Meath and District League, the club grew to 12 teams by 1995. Agher Park FC amalgamated in 2009 with another local club Summerhill Celtic to become Park Celtic Summerhill.

This station is one of three high school radio stations in the Seattle Metro area, the other two being KNHC, and KASB. KMIH also services as the only FM service licensed to the City of Mercer Island and as such is used as one of the primary emergency communication methods for the city. History Prior to its move to 88.9, KMIH broadcast at 104.5, when through a series of FM realignments, KMCQ, a station licensed to The Dalles, Oregon, was relocated to nearby Covington, Washington. This resulted in KMIH being relocated to its current frequency because of its class-D status, but was allowed to stay at the 104.5 frequency as they worked out an arrangement that allowed KMCQ to do testing during KMIH's off-air hours until the transition was completed. On August 27, 2008, KMIH and KMCQ finalized the move. KMIH also has a translator at 94.5 transmitting from Capitol Hill to cover downtown Seattle, which is not covered by 88.9's 30-watt signal. The translator would be sold to Bonneville International in late 2016, dropping its simulcast of KMIH to become a translator for Bonneville's KTTH. On January 31, 2017, after a period of stunting, KMIH dropped their rhythmic CHR format and flipped to AAA, branded as \\"The Bridge.\\" In late December 2019, KMIH has partnered with Transistor.fm to bring their shows onto streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.
