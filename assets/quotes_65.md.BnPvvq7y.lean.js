Each year around 180 pupils are admitted to Year 7 (aged 11 or 12) on the basis of examination, however the local education authority also assigns students without a school to this school. It is the oldest surviving foundation of its kind in the Archdiocese of Westminster. History St Aloysius' College was founded in 1879 by the Brothers of Mercy as a Roman Catholic independent boarding and day school and then a grammar school. The control of the college was passed to the De La Salle Brothers in 1960. It turned comprehensive in 1971 with the reorganisation of the English education system and merged with another local boys comprehensive (St. William of York) in the 1980s. The school went through a turbulent period during the 1990s with declining academic standards and the subsequent loss of its sixth form. It reopened the sixth form in September 2010 and admitted a small number of girls. It was awarded the Sportsmark and Artsmark awards. It also featured in a Dispatches special on Channel 4 documentary Undercover Teacher. The school is used by the National Youth Theatre for many of its auditions and courses. Academics Pupils generally take 10 or 11 GCSE subjects. The sixth form is part of a collaboration of local schools in the area known as the Islington Sixth Form Consortium.

Layout  Arizona Center features two office buildings, retail and a 24-screen AMC theatre. One Arizona Center is 240 feet (73 meters) tall and has 19 floors. It was completed in 1989. This tower houses various legal firms with Snell and Wilmer being the largest. Other tenants include the Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitor's Bureau (PHX CVB) and the main corporate offices of the Harlem Globetrotters. Two Arizona Center stands at 260 feet (79 meters) tall and has 20 floors. It was completed in 1990 and is the headquarters of local electric utility Arizona Public Service or APS. Retail offers a variety of restaurants, boutiques and tourist shops, which include Canyon Cafe, Mi Amigo's Mexican Grill, Subway, and more. The large central plaza at Arizona Center includes richly landscaped courtyards and fountains designed by SWA Group, which won a National Merit Award by the American Society of Landscape Architects for its work on the plaza. Nearby, a 30-story Sheraton Phoenix Downtown hotel opened in the fall of 2008. Also, several high-end condominium projects in the downtown area are under construction, newly opened, or in the planning stages.  History  Arizona Center was designed by The Rouse Company (on its festival marketplace model, which worked to great success in other cities) and opened in the fall of 1990 to great fanfare and high expectations, as it was considered one of the original components of the ongoing downtown revitalization efforts in Phoenix taking place since the early 1990s. Arizona Center at night The expectations were high since it was developed by the same firm that created the highly successful Faneuil Hall Marketplace (Boston) and Harborplace (Baltimore). Arizona Center was expected to be a retail, dining and entertainment magnet which would jump-start interest in downtown redevelopment, but some critics felt suburban-oriented Phoenix was not ready to embrace a downtown development of this caliber. Critics have also pointed out the relative scarcity of permanent upscale apartment and/or condominium housing in the immediate vicinity as a factor in the lackluster performance of the mall. Most of the residential districts surrounding the downtown area are middle-to-lower income, not adequate to support the middle-to-high-end marketing mix that Arizona Center set out to provide. Many of the initial retailers struggled to attract customers, and by 2003, the large second-story food court, similar to those found in suburban shopping malls, was closed and reconfigured into the Phoenix regional office of Detroit-based architectural firm SmithGroup. The Rouse Company was acquired by General Growth Properties in 2004. After going through bankruptcy, GGP sold Arizona Center to CommonWealth REIT in 2011. Arizona Center began a major renovation in 2017, to be completed in 2018.

Matlock Jr."},{"id":"8889545","text":"Alonzo Walter Highsmith, Sr. (born February 26, 1965) is an American football executive, former fullback, and former boxer. He is a personnel executive for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He served as the vice president of player personnel for the Cleveland Browns from 2018 to 2019. Before that, Highsmith served as a senior personnel executive for the Green Bay Packers for six seasons from 2012 to 2017. He is also played in the NFL for the Houston Oilers, Dallas Cowboys, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played college football at the University of Miami. Early years Highsmith attended Christopher Columbus High School, where he played defensive end and helped his team reach the state championship final in 1982, while receiving All-American, Florida high school Defensive Player of the Year and the Dade County Athlete of the Year honors. He also played basketball and ran track. College career Highsmith accepted a scholarship from the University of Miami over offers from Notre Dame University and the University of Michigan. Although he was recruited by Howard Schnellenberger to play defense, he was converted to fullback before his freshman season started. He was a member of the 1983 Hurricanes squad that won the national championship, and led the team in rushing during the 31-30 victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. In 1984, Jimmy Johnson arrived as the new head coach and named him a starter as a sophomore, rushing for a team leading 906 yards on 146 carries (6.2 average) and 11 touchdowns. One of the hardest working players on the team, he would develop into a complete fullback that could run, block and catch. As a junior, he registered 451 rushing yards on 117 carries (3.9 average) and 6 touchdowns, including a school record 88-yard touchdown reception against East Carolina University. In his last year, he was recognized as the nation's best fullback, while posting 442 rushing yards (led the team) on 105 carries (4.2 average) and 8 touchdowns. Highsmith finished his college career with 1,914 rushing yards (second in school history), 2,935 all-purpose yards (fifth in school history), 25 career touchdowns (tied for first in school history) and five 100-yard rushing games (tied for second in school history). In 1997, he was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Houston Oilers= Highsmith was selected by the Houston Oilers in the first round (third overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. He reported to the team after a long contract holdout, that saw him miss 6 months and 6 games. As a rookie, he played in 8 games (3 starts) and registered 106 rushing yards. In 1988, he started 16 games, rushing for 466 yards (third on the team) on 94 carries for a 5-yard average, while developing into one of the best blocking fullbacks in the NFL. In 1989, he started again 16 games, led the team in rushing with 531 yards and was second on the team with 6 total touchdowns. During the 1990 season, Jack Pardee became the new Oilers head coach and implemented the run and shoot offense. The team decided that Highsmith wasn't a good fit for new system. On September 3, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a second round (#38-Darryll Lewis) and a fifth round (#136-Tim Roberts) draft choice. =Dallas Cowboys= Although he had started 40 straight games with the Houston Oilers, he had a series of offseason knee surgeries, that had doctors recommending against the Dallas Cowboys acquiring him in 1990, based on a knee condition that could potentially end his career. Head coach Jimmy Johnson, knowing Highsmith from his playing days at the University of Miami, ignored the medical advice and went ahead with the proposed trade on September 3. He played in 7 games (5 starts) and was the lead blocker for rookie Emmitt Smith, before being placed on the injured reserve list after not being able to fully recover from his previous knee surgery. He had 19 carries for 48 yards and 3 receptions for 13 yards. The next year, he had a contract holdout, that forced him to miss most of training camp. He returned as the third-string fullback and played in only 2 games, before being waived on October 1, 1991. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= On October 3, 1991, Highsmith was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Due to his chronic knee condition, he was released on October 7, 1992. Highsmith retired after playing in 65 games, posting 283 rushing attempts for 1,195 yards (4.2 avg.) and 7 touchdowns. He also had 42 receptions for 428 yards (10.2 avg.) and 3 touchdowns. Boxing career Following his football career, Highsmith became a professional boxer. Over a four-year career, Highsmith amassed a 27‚Äì1‚Äì2 record in the heavyweight division. Twenty three of those victories came by way of knockout. One of Highsmith's opponents in professional boxing was another former NFL player turned boxer, Mark Gastineau.  Front office  In 2012, he accepted a Senior Personnel Executive position in the front office of the Green Bay Packers. On January 2, 2018, it was reported that he would be joining the Cleveland Browns as their vice president of football operations. On January 10, it was confirmed that Highsmith would join the Browns, just as the Vice President of Player Personnel. After consulting for the Seattle Seahawks in the 2020 offseason, he accepted a full-time position as a personnel executive with the team on June 12, 2020. Personal life His father, Walter Highsmith, was a successful football player and coach. He, like Alonzo, played for the Oilers in 1972. He also played for the Montreal Alouettes, with and Alonzo playing football and basketball in Montreal as a teenager. Walter was a former head coach for Texas Southern University and enjoyed several coaching stints in college football and the CFL. One of Highsmith's sons, also named Alonzo Highsmith Jr., was invited to training camp with the Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs and the Washington Redskins.

In brutal fighting lasting about three weeks, the IPKF took control of the Jaffna Peninsula from the LTTE, something that the Sri Lankan Army had tried but failed to do. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE at the cost of 214 soldiers and Officers .\\"Operation Pawan. The Battle for Jaffna\\" Background The Tamil Tigers had fought to establish a Tamil homeland, separate from Sri Lanka, in the northern and eastern portion of Ceylon (Tamil Eelam). This effort led to a series of armed conflicts with the Sri Lankan military. In the late 1980s India, feeling considerable pressure from its Tamil nationals, began to intervene on both a diplomatic and military basis. Negotiations led to the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, signed in Colombo on 29 July 1987, under which the Sri Lankan government agreed to give the nation's provinces more power and autonomy and withdraw its troops to their barracks. The Tamil rebels were to surrender their arms as well. Most Tamil groups, including the Tigers, had not participated in the talks. Only reluctantly did they agree to surrender their arms to the Indian Peace-Keeping Force as provided by the Accord. Even so, many rebels did not surrender their weapons, and the situation quickly flared into active confrontation. The Tigers declared their intent to continue armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam and refused to disarm. The IPKF soon found itself engaged in a bloody police action against the Tigers, which culminated in the rebels being cornered on the Jaffna Peninsula, at the northern end of the island. The IPKF set out to complete its mission of disarming the LTTE by taking Jaffna by force. The Operation By 7 October, the Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) had issued directives to the IPKF, laying down its operational parameters. It was to: *Seize/destroy LTTE radio and TV transmission equipment in the Jaffna Peninsula *Seize or jam the LTTE communications network *Carry out raids on LTTE camps, caches and strongpoints *Detain and interrogate personnel manning LTTE offices in the East to gain information. In case of resistance, force to be used. *Actions to further consolidate the hold of the IPKF in the region The first IPKF operation was launched on 9 October 1987. Code-named Operation Pawan (Hindi for Wind), it was expected to neutralize LTTE operational capability in and around Jaffna. This included the capture or neutralization of the LTTE's chain of command\\"Nobody sounded even a Last Post for our dead in Colombo\\" Gen. Harikat Singh to Josy Joseph. rediff.com which was expected to leave the rebel movement directionless in the face of the impending assault on the LTTE strongholds by the IPKF. On the nights of 9 and 10 October, the IPKF raided and captured the LTTE radio station at Tavadi and the TV station at Kokkuvil, while the printing presses of two LTTE-sponsored newspapers were destroyed. These operations also led to the capture of nearly 200 Tiger rebels.\\"Accord, Airlift, and Discord\\" Bharat-rakshak.com In retaliation, the LTTE ambushed a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy near Tellipallai, killing four Jawans, as well as an IPKF post at Tellipallai with automatic weapons and mortar fire on an IPKF post. Later that day the Tigers ambushed a 10 Para Commando jeep on patrol, killing all five occupants. On 10 October the Indian 91st Brigade, consisting of three battalions and led by Brig. J. Ralli, also began its push into Jaffna.\\"The Tamil Militants-Before the Accord and After\\" Hellmann-Rajanayagam D. Pacific Affairs, Vol. 61, No. 4. (Winter, 1988‚Äì1989), pp. 603‚Äì619 =The Jaffna University Helidrop= The first battle signalling the real beginning of Operation Pawan was the heliborne assault on the Jaffna University headquarters of the LTTE by a detachment of Indian Para (Special Forces) and Sikh Light Infantry soldiers on the night of 12 October. This was planned as a quick commando raid to capture the top LTTE leadership and local commanders who, according to Indian intelligence, were supposed to be in the building at the time and was thus expected to cut short the battle for Jaffna.\\"Descent Into Danger. The Jaffna University Helidrop\\" Bharat- rakshak.com The plan was to land 17 commandos from the 10th battalion of the Parachute Regiment to secure the football field. A second wave was to follow with a platoon (30 troops) from the 13th battalion of the Sikh Light Infantry. The heliborne troops were to link up with the 4th battalion of 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) of 72 Brigade and the Sikh Light Infantry troops advancing on the ground. The operation ended in disaster as the LTTE, having intercepted IPKF radio transmissions, set up an ambush. The helidropped troops came under intense fire from LTTE positions, forcing the Mil Mi-8 helicopters to abandon the insertion midway through the operation. During the ensuing battle, which lasted throughout the night, 29 of the 30 Sikh Light Infantry troops and 2 of the 17 commandos were killed before detachments of the 65th Armoured Regiment were able to extract the commandos from their defensive positions. After the Sikh Light Infantry platoon's signaller was shot by LTTE snipers early on in the battle, the unit lost contact with the Indian High Command at Palay Air Base. The sole survivor of the platoon, Sepoy Gora Singh, was taken prisoner by the LTTE under the command of Pawan Kashyap. It was not until his subsequent release during the conflict that the fate of the unit was known. =Battle for Jaffna= As the battle for Jaffna progressed, the IPKF advance came under intense and vicious opposition from the Tigers. Fighting in built- up and an as-yet unevacuated Jaffna, the Indian High Command insisted that the slow advance was, in addition to Tiger resistance, more a result of reluctance on the part of the IPKF to use heavy weaponry to clear LTTE defenses. Furthermore, all the approach roads had been laced with Claymore mines or explosives by the Tigers in its years of fighting with the Sri Lankan army. The Tigers also made extensive use of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) which could be remotely detonated from over a kilometer away. During this time Eastern Command of the Indian Navy, supported by the Coast Guard, was key in establishing a long blockade around northern Sri Lanka from October 1987 to disrupt the Tigers' supply and communication routes. It was at about this time that the MARCOS forces (Marine Commandos) of the Indian Navy first went into action. Detachments of the IMSF (Indian Marine Special Forces, as the MARCOS was then known), along with a battalion of the 340th Independent Brigade of the Indian Army, provided beach reconnaissance around Jaffna and Batticaloa. The 340th Brigade was one of the first IPKF units to be deployed, and served until operations in the Trincomalee area were complete. The IMSF, at this time, also provided security patrols along the coast road west of Jaffna until the 41st Brigade took charge in November. On 15/16 October the IPKF stopped its advance to stabilize the front. Palay, the major operations headquarters for the 54th Infantry Division, was also secured from Tiger attacks. At this time the Indian Air Force undertook a massive airlift to reinforce the 91st with three brigades and heavy equipment, including T-72 tanks and BMP-1 fighting vehicles. Air traffic controllers worked round the clock to fly in troops and equipment. Indian Airlines is said to have contributed to the airlift, using its Boeing 737s to deliver troops. This short interval also saw the introduction of Mi-8 medium helicopters and the first use of the Mi-25 gunships of No. 125 Sqn, along with HAL Cheetah light helicopters. By end of October the IAF had flown 2200 tactical transport and 800 helicopter sorties. Now reinforced, the IPKF resumed the battle for Jaffna. The tanks and armored fighting vehicles are said to have been effective protection against anti- personnel mines. However, even with this defense the IPKF advance was torturous in the face of the Tigers' sniper fire. They would take up positions on rooftops, in trees and even in coconut palms. Equipped with powerful telescopic infra-red sights, they were able to selectively take out officers and radiomen, inflicting a heavy toll and bringing the advance to a grinding halt. Helicopters flying below 2000 feet were also vulnerable, with at least five being shot at and damaged before the Mi-25s took up their offensive role. The IPKF adapted quickly, with its officers taking off the pips of their ranks, wearing slouch hats and carrying oversize back packs. However, as the advance got bogged down, the battalions, instead of maneuvering around the defenders, were forced to commit more troops under orders from New Delhi. In addition, the LTTE increasingly began to deploy anti-tank mines, taking a further heavy toll on IPKF forces. A frustrated IPKF cut off the power to Jaffna in an attempt to counter this. IPKF communication lines were extensively mined by the LTTE, which further compounded the sometimes perilous situations that the Indian troops faced. It was not before the IMSF commandos broke out of the besieged Jaffna port and cleared the heavily mined Navanturai Coastal Road that a crucial link-up between 1 Maratha Light Infantry in Jaffna fort and the advancing troops of 41st Brigade could be established that secured the Nallur area. On 21 October the commandos conducted a successful amphibious raid against an LTTE base at Guru Nagar.India. Marine Commando Force Special Operations.Com It was also toward the end of the Jaffna campaign that the IPKF started the use of Mi-25s for close air support\\"Crocodiles into the Attack\\" . No. 125 Helicopter Squadron. Bharat-rakshak.com when they flew against LTTE positions in Chavakacheri village on 23 October 1987. =Culmination= Ultimately, however, after two weeks of bitter fighting the IPKF had wrested control of Jaffna and other major cities from the LTTE, but operations were to continue well into November, with major operations coming to an end with the fall of Jaffna Fort on 28 November. Throughout the duration of Operation Pawan, the casualties suffered by the IPKF had been put at between 600 and 1,200. In addition to the LTTE's defensive operations alluded to above, the IPKF's problems were compounded by the fact that the Tigers, using classic guerrilla tactics, blended in with the local population. The IPKF also came face-to-face with child soldiers of the LTTE, something it had not expected. This was only the beginning of the IPKF's three-year campaign to neutralize the LTTE. By the time Jaffna fell, the LTTE had merely exfiltrated out of the town, moving south to the jungles of Vavuniya. Its hardcore fighters moved to the safety of the jungle by skirting the Jaffna coast from Point Pedro to Elephant Pass, sheltered by the criss-cross of waterways in the impenetrable Nittkaikulam jungle. In the Jaffna sector, although the LTTE had shifted out of the town itself, it nevertheless harassed the 54th Division's efforts to consolidate its positions using IEDs and anti-personnel mines. In turn, the IPKF was able to disrupt the LTTE's activities with regular raids that led to the capture of large caches of rebel weaponry. Brig. Manjit Singh was later replaced by Brig. J.S. Dhillon, under whom the 54th underwent considerable modifications of its operations routine. Small, highly mobile units became the staple of the 54th's operations. The IPKF at this point still consisted mostly of an overstretched 54th Division. Following the Jaffna operation, the 36th Infantry Division, along with two additional brigades, took over the Vavuniya sector and the Trincomalee-Batticaloa axis. This relieved the 54th Division which, led by Brig. Singh, could now focus on consolidating the Jaffna sector.\\"Shifting to the Jungles\\" Bharat-rakshak.com The 4th Mountain Division and the 57th Infantry Division were deployed still later in February 1988 to take charge of Vanni and Batticaloa from the 36th. Criticism India's foreign intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing trained the LTTE to keep a check on Sri Lanka, which had helped Pakistan in the Indo-Pak War by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. When Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi sent the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region, the disastrous efforts of the IPKF was blamed on the lack of co-ordination between the IPKF and RAW. Its most obvious manifestation was the Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ in the Jaffna University campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the RAW and the dropping paratroopers became easy targets for the LTTE, and a number of Indian soldiers were killed. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi is also blamed as a fallout of operation Pawan in Sri Lanka.Sachi Sri Kantha.

History The society began as the \\"Public Schools Exploring Society\\" in 1932 by Surgeon Commander George Murray Levick RN, who had been a member of Captain Scott's final Antarctic Expedition of 1910-13. It was later renamed the \\"British Schools Exploring Society\\", then became BSES Expeditions, before adopting its current name in 2012. For 80 years, British Exploring has provided the opportunity for young people, aged 16-25 years old, from different schools, universities and many other walks of life to take part in valuable adventure and environmental research projects in challenging areas of the world from the Arctic to the Amazon Rainforest. Led by experts drawn from a host of professions such as universities, teaching and the Services, all the expeditions aim to help in the development of young people through the challenge of living and working in remote and testing areas of the world. =Norwegian polar bear attack= In August 2011, a party of teenagers in Norway was attacked at night by a polar bear leading to the death of a seventeen-year-old boy and injuries to several others. Both the Norwegian authorities and a private enquiry commissioned by BSES and chaired by a UK high court judge criticized the expedition's defective gun, and inadequate warning arrangements, the judge ruling that the accident was preventable. However, in July 2014, a coroner cleared the BSES of neglect as failure \\"was not total or complete.\\" Membership British Exploring is a society formed from those who have taken part in a British Exploring expedition. Typically, students aged 16‚Äì25 apply to take part in an expedition and are selected by interview. When a student successfully completes a British Exploring expedition and is recommended by the expedition Chief Leader, they are admitted to the society. Society members may vote in the AGM, and help to govern the future of the society. Another way of entering the society is by becoming a leader. Expedition locations British Exploring is most well known for its expeditions to the Arctic, but has mounted expeditions from The Amazon, India, Kenya and Papua New Guinea among many others. Funding and charity work Participants are expected to raise money to pay for expeditions through personal fundraising. A typical expedition may cost in the region of ¬£4000 (excluding flights). However the Society also works with a youth charity Catch 22 to enable young people \\"not in employment, education or training\\" to undertake a 3 week expedition. It claims that over 90% of them are in employment afterwards. Science projects Early expeditions collected valuable fieldwork data and brought back specimens for the Natural History Museum and the British Museum. Currently British Exploring collaborates with a range of scientific research institutions from universities and world- respected scientists and in-country NGOs and conservation organisations. The expeditions contribute to long-term research projects by: * Helping to gather objective scientific data * Involvement in local community conservation and education initiatives Many of the Society's full members, who qualify as such by successfully completing a British Exploring expedition, have gone on to play a leading role in major international adventurous and scientific projects. Notable members The society has a strong record of developing young people, and its alumni include: * David Rhind, Vice-Chancellor of City University, London, began his early surveying with British Exploring as a Young Explorer in a 1962 expedition to Swedish Lapland. Prof Rhind was previously Director General and Chief Executive of The Ordnance Survey of Great Britain (1992‚Äì98). * John Chapple went on an expedition in the 1950s and went on to become the Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, between 1989 and 1992.

Career Pollet was born on 20 June 1936 in La Madeleine, Nord, in France. His film career started in 1958, when he did a short film set in Paris called Pourvu qu'on ait l'ivresse..., in which Pollet filmed the movements of dancers' silhouettes. Pollet built on the images and themes from this first film in many of his later works, by incorporating elements of popular comedies imbued with both burlesque and melancholic elements. In the early 1960s, Pollet began exploring another approach to filmmaking with the film M√©diterran√©e, which he made over two years with Volker Schl√∂ndorff. Pollet tried to create a form of poetic film, using texts and commentaries by writers such as Philippe Sollers, Jean Thibeaudeau, and Francis Ponge. In the 1990s, he was paralyzed after a train accident, and so he filmed his last movies in the areas around his house in the French town of Cadenet.

Village summary Gao Village is a village that remains rather near to the main Tang Dynasty - thus being within China. Around chapter 18, Sanzang and Sun Wukong would arrive at this seemingly small village. Gao Village is run by an old man named Square Gao and his hard working villagers. This village is reputed for its amount of vegetarian food - as seen with Zhu Bajie, Square Gao's son-in-law. After Bajie is effectively subdued by Wukong due to his exceedingly gluttonous and lustful ways, this village's overall provisional production rises to a large margin. Sanzang, Wukong, and his new disciple all soon leave this village and continue their journey westward. This village would not be shown again following Bajie's subjugation during chapter 19. Featured Characters *Lady Gao Lady Gao is the daughter of Square Gao, a man seen as the head of Gao Village. Lady Gao is the last woman who would have to suffer ill treatment by the sex crazed pig, Zhu Bajie - - a later disciple of Sanzang. At some point, Square Gao had insisted for his daughter to be rescued. After Pig is asleep and the lady is sitting inside their worn out barn-like area, Wukong retrieves Lady Gao. Through her appearance, this is what could be seen: *Her cloudy hair was tangled and unkempt, Her face was filthy and unwashed.'' *Her orchid heart was as pure as ever, But her beauty lay in ruins.'' *There was no blood or life in her cherry lips, And her limbs were crooked and bent.'' *A sad frown on her forehead, Her eyebrows pale;'' *Weak and frightened, Only daring to whisper.'' Following this, Lady Gao reveals the truth about Pig - - he leaves during the night and appears at dawn in fear of her father exorcising him. Thus, the lady is retrieved to her father with relative ease. Sun Wukong himself would afterwards copy her appearance and play in her role while with Pig. After Sanzang, Pig, and Wukong all leave on their journey after a major event, Lady Gao truly gives her expression of thanks and is never shown again afterwards. *Square Gao Square Gao is the head of Gao Village, in which he is always complaining about his son-in-law. This son-in-law of his happens to be Zhu Bajie, a sex crazed pig. Zhu Bajie had forced Square Gao his son-in-law so that he could attain his daughter as his own wife. As later seen, Bajie eats up all the food that Square Gao has as his daughter's \\"husband\\". After Sanzang and Wukong arrive to this village, Square Gao immediately appears before them and pleads for a request to rescue his daughter. After Wukong is in the process of rescuing his daughter, Square Gao effectively calls out his daughter's name and she is effectively saved. After the whole issue is resolved, Square Gao awards Wukong and Sanzang greatly with a banquet and expresses his utmost thanks. After this arc, Square Gao is never shown again at any point. *'Zhu Bajie - see main article Conflicts/Battles Overall in this arc, Zhu Bajie would battle it out against Sun Wukong atop a mountain slope at the time of night - - a neighboring mountain of Gao Village. After this battle rages on for many days and there are varied retreats, Wukong eventually talks with the Bodhisattva Guanyin about this issue. After Wukong tells Zhu Bajie what she had told him, Pig joins Sanzang and Wukong as promised to the compassionate Guanyin.

Features of Wynford's works Wynford used a distinctive plan of placing the chapel and great hall end to end; this occurred at Windsor Castle (the chapel and hall were united as a single hall by Sir Jeffry Wyatville for George IV), and at Winchester and New Colleges. The two colleges also have cloisters that are next to rather than surrounded by the main college buildings, which form a separate courtyard consisting of as well as the great hall and chapel, an entrance gate with tower above, sets of rooms for scholars and fellows opening off staircases, a library, accommodation for the Warden. The kitchen, bakery and other service buildings are in a separate wing at New College, but surround a second courtyard at Winchester College. New college also has a bell tower next to the cloister. These were the very first educational buildings in England to be designed as a complete entity and, as such, they influenced later college buildings such as King's College, Cambridge, Eton College & Magdalen College, Oxford.

Overview  Adam Tas (pronounced \\"Ah-dum Tuss\\") was born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One of his aunts and her German husband, Henning H√ºsing, came to the Cape in search of fortune. When he was 29 (1697), Tas joined them and stayed at Meerlust, their Stellenbosch home. Two years later he was appointed Standard Bearer to the Burgher Infantry. In June, 1703 he married Elizabeth Von Brakel, the wealthy widow of Joris (Hans J√ºrgen) Grimpen, who owned a collection of farms in the district. Tas became secretary of the \\"Brotherhood\\", which viewed the Dutch East India Company (VOC) administration at the Cape as corrupt and dictatorial. Like other senior VOC officials, the governor, Willem Adriaan van der Stel also owned a farm, Vergelegen. These VOC officials soon started a corrupt trading monopoly with the VOC which seriously hampered the free burghers' ability to make a living. By 1705, a third of all the farms in the colony belonged to just 20 officials. Tas and H√ºsing drafted a petition, accusing local VOC officials of abusing the company's trading monopoly, and managed to persuade 63 of the 550 Cape free burghers to sign it. Without informing the local officials, the signed petition was sent directly to the VOC headquarters in Amsterdam. The petition was rejected and Van der Stel became aware of its existence. Tas was arrested on 28 February 1706, escorted in chains to Cape Town, and convicted. Van der Stel had parts of Tas‚Äôs diary copied (13 June 1705 through 27 February 1706) as evidence. (Large fragments of this copy was rediscovered in 1911 by A.C.C. Lloyd, a librarian at the National Library of South Africa) After he was convicted, Tas was thrown in the \\"Black Hole\\" - a damp dungeon completely devoid of any light located in the Castle of Good Hope. However, since 31 of the signatories were Huguenots, and because the Netherlands was at war with France, the rejected petition generated belated concern in Amsterdam. The fear was that the discontent might convince some to become spies for the French. The VOC dismissed van der Stel, and ordered his return to the Netherlands (23 April 1707). VOC officials were subsequently forbidden to own any land at the Cape of Good Hope. Thirteen months into his incarceration Tas was released. Upon gaining his freedom, Tas named his home \\"Libertas\\" (Latin: freedom) in honor of the occasion, and allocated a new meaning (\\"Tas is Free!\\") to the name. The property, located on the outskirts of Stellenbosch is currently part of a strawberry farming operation. It includes a homestead extended by a later owner with the date of 1771 on the Cape Dutch gable.

Situated in the heart of the Vall√©e d'Aulps, as well as being the home to an active farming community, it is popular with holiday-makers in the Summer, for walking, and in the Winter for skiing as it is a part of the massive Portes du Soleil ski area. The inhabitants are called (in French) the \\"Jovan√©tiens\\". The commune is spread over 40,2 km2 has 1,189 inhabitants, 6,900 beds for tourists, 464 main residences, and 1,358 secondary residences. The population density is 29,58 inhabitants/km2. Saint-Jean-d'Aulps is surrounded by the communes of Seytroux, Le Biot, Abondance, Essert Romand and Bellevaux. The closest town is Thonon les Bains 25 km away. The river \\"la Dranse de Morzine\\" is the main water course through the village. In the commune, at an altitude of 805m, is the ski-area \\"l‚ÄôEspace Roc d‚ÄôEnfer\\". One can ski between 900m and 1800m above sea- level and offers, amongst wild, unspoilt, and preserved terrain, 20 pistes (ski-runs) givings a total of 40 km of tracks. A large portion of these tracks are covered by artificial snow-making machines to make the skiing more snow- sure in lighter Winters. Saint-Jean-d'Aulps also offers many summer-time activities, namely: rock climbing, via ferrata, walking and hiking, mountain- biking routes, fishing, and para-gliding. History The village grew up round Aulps Abbey, a Cistercian monastery founded at the very end of the 11th century and suppressed in 1793 during the French Revolution. The buildings were reduced to ruins in 1823 when they were quarried for stone to rebuild the village's parish church. Culture Being a Winter skiing resort town and Summer holiday destination activity in the town tends to be seasonal with an influx of tourists twice a year. As for the permanent residents, there is a higher-than-normal percentage of non-French residents (mostly British). These residents are typically involved in the skiing and tourism industry in the Portes du Soleil serving clients in their local language. In addition to this type of work there is an active sheep, cattle, and dairy farming community. Ski The skiing area in Saint-Jean-d'Aulps is situated above the town and is called Espace Roc d'Enfer, or La Grande Terche. The skiing area covered by the larger Portes du Soleil lift pass which includes 14 resorts in France and Switzerland. The ski area does not link directly to the other Porte du Soleil stations however. There is a shuttle bus from the tourist office in Saint- Jean-d'Aulps to Morzine, Les Gets and Avoriaz in the winter season. The local ski area, La Grande Terche, is around 8 minutes from the town centre by car. A free shuttle bus also brings people from the village to the skiing area. Although the area is limited in terms of lifts and marked pistes, the pistes offer a good variety of varied skiing and in particular a large amount of off- piste terrain. This tends to remain unskiied days after the larger resorts are tracked out. At the base of the gondola lift there are a couple of restaurants and bars and a ski hire shop. Le Roc d'Enfer is home to the Circuit Roc d'Enfer, a marked, posted set of red ski runs which is broken into two 5 km sections of uninterrupted Alpine skiing set in a calm valley. The two 5 km sections are linked by a chair- and then drag-lift at the village of La Chevrerie in the Vall√©e Verte. Twin towns Saint-Jean-d'Aulps is twinned with Santec, Finist√®re, France.

It was on the Fallowfield Loop railway line, a suburban railway which looped around the south of the city and terminated at the former Manchester Central railway station. The station closed to passengers in 1958, but its building, on the corner of Wilmslow Road and Ladybarn Road, still stands. History Map of the Fallowfield Loop Line The initial section of the Fallowfield Loop line was opened by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Cheshire Lines Committee) between and Fallowfield on 1 October 1891. The following year, the remaining section between Fallowfield and Fairfield opened on 2 May 1892. The line provided a new route for the MS&LR; to run trains from into Manchester, and local stopping services ran between Manchester Central and through Fallowfield. The line stretched from the Hope Valley line at Fairfield and Gorton railway stations through Levenshulme South and Fallowfield onto Wilbraham Road and Chorlton-cum-Hardy before joining a section of line from Old Trafford to Manchester Central. The Fallowfield station building was constructed in a red brick mock Tudor style on a road overbridge straddling the loop line. There were two platforms which were accessed from the street-level booking office by canopied walkways down to track level, a signalbox in the middle of the westbound platform and a nearby goods yard equipped with a 5-ton crane to the south. In 1897 the MSLR became the Great Central Railway and in 1923 the line was absorbed into the LNER. Over this period the Fallowfield Loop line suffered from competition from alternative rail services into Manchester provided by the LNER from and later from the electric trams. By the 1930s the LNER had greatly reduced the stopping services and mostly used the line for express trains. After 1948, the line was under the ownership of the nationalised British Railways. Briefly, consideration was given to electrification of the line, but instead the local stopping services were withdrawn and Fallowfield station closed to passenger services on 7 July 1958. Express services out of Manchester Central continued to use the line until that terminus was closed in 1969 following the Beeching cuts. For another two decades the line was used by freight trains until the line closed completely in 1988, with the stations sidings being used by the London Brick Company.

Overview  In 2019, Coquitlam Public Library had: * 935,238 visits to the Library * 60,670 active customers * 1.35 millions items borrowed. History The library was first established in Centennial Secondary School in 1967. By the early 1970s, it was clear that the school library was not meeting the demands of the growing community. In 1972, led by the Coquitlam Chapter of the Canadian Federation of University Women, a town meeting was called to discuss the need for an official public library. It was not until June 14, 1976, that the municipality passed a by-law to officially create the Coquitlam Public Library under the Provincial Library Act. A public Library Board was established in 1977. By 1981, the Library had developed into three different branches throughout Coquitlam. Two of the branches, Ridgeway and Cottonwood, were amalgamated into one when the City of Coquitlam built the Poirier branch in 1989, and the remaining branch, Lincoln, was moved to the City Hall building in 1998 and renamed the City Centre branch. The Poirier branch was extensively renovated and expanded in 2008-2009. In 2011 the City of Coquitlam announced that it had purchased the ground floor portion of a building across from the City Centre Mall to serve as the new City Centre branch. The new location nearly tripled the library's space to 31,000 square feet, and the $15 million cost for the facility and expansion came primarily from revenues collected from the Hard Rock Casino. The City Centre Branch opened in 2013. Coquitlam Public Library‚Äôs mobile library service, the Library Link, was started in 2009 to bring Library service to outlying geographical areas in Coquitlam. When the book bus was destroyed by a fire in May 2014, Metro Ford in Port Coquitlam generously provided a van as a temporary replacement before the library purchased a second-hand bookmobile from Sno- Isle Libraries in Washington. With this vehicle, the Library Link was able to expand service to several days a week and attend community events and festivals throughout the year. Branches The library has two branches as well as a mobile library service called the Library Link. * The City Centre branch (1169 Pinetree Way) houses an Innovation Hub that provides community access to new and emerging technologies such as 3D printing and virtual reality experiences. * The Poirier branch (575 Poirier Street) includes a Digitization Station in the Local History Room, which the public can use for free to convert photographs, slides, audio cassette tapes, VHS tapes and more to digital file formats. * The Library Link provides library service to multiple locations throughout the city and has been visited over 56,000 times by community members. The Library Link also attends various special events throughout the community.

Hornfischer, calls the greatest upset in the history of naval warfare. Published by Bantam Books in February 2004, the book won the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature in 2004 from the Naval Order of the United States. A Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Military Book Club, the book tells the story of the remarkable two-and-a-half-hour sea battle fought on October 25, 1944, in which Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague's task unit, known as \\"Taffy 3\\" (7th Fleet's Task Unit 77.4.3), of \\"jeep carriers\\" and their \\"tin can\\" escorts rose to the impossible challenge of beating back an overwhelming force of Japanese battleships and cruisers under Vice Adm. Takeo Kurita. Survivors of the four U.S. ships lost in the battle‚Äî, , , and ‚Äîthen struggled to survive a two-day-ordeal adrift at sea awaiting rescue. A fifth ship from Taffy 3, the escort carrier , was sunk in a kamikaze attack immediately following the Japanese withdrawal. Two TV documentaries based on Hornfischer's book have been produced. The first of them, produced by Lou Reda Productions and premiering on The History Channel on November 11, 2005, featured interviews with Hornfischer and veterans of the battle. It was followed by an episode of Dogfights on the History Channel, titled \\"The Death of the Japanese Navy\\", premiering on December 29, 2006, which featured a sophisticated CGI rendition of the sea battle. Episode 9 of Battle 360 dealt with the Battle of Leyte Gulf. However, given that Battle 360 was focused on USS Enterprise, the only survivors who recounted the battle were Enterprise sailors and airmen. In this episode, there were no survivors of the Taffy 3 interviewed. In fact there is no mention of any of the Taffy 3 ships or their captains except Ernest E. Evans of the destroyer Johnston. The episode skirts the fundamental issue of how close the Japanese came to annihilating Taffy 3.  See also  * CDR Ernest E. Evans * LCDR Robert W.

It is the first film to feature Dharmendra and his real-life sons Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol together. Previously Sunny and Bobby had worked together in Dillagi (1999) and Dharmendra and Sunny had also appeared together in Sultanat (1986) and Kshatriya (1993). Kiron Kher, Shilpa Shetty and Katrina Kaif play the female leads. The film opened to an excellent response across India and emerged as a hit overseas as well. Dharmendra plays the role of a disgraced ex-boxer Baldev Chaudhary who tries to wash a stain in his boxing career through his sons Angad and Karan (Sunny & Bobby Deol). Dharmendra had earlier played the role of a boxer in the film Main Intequam Loonga (1982). Footage from that film is used as flashback scenes in this film to show Baldev's career as a boxer. Plot Former Olympic medallist boxer Baldev Choudhary (Dharmendra) is disgraced while competing for the World Heavy weight championship when a betting syndicate falsely accuses him of drug doping. He tries to erase this stain upon his honour by training up his son, Angad (Sunny Deol) but financial difficulties keep them from achieving his dream. He trains a local boy to get into a media hyped TV boxing show, but is dropped for a better coach at the last minute. Baldev's younger son Karan (Bobby Deol) has just launched his first music album. Realising his father is depressed, he gives up his own dream of a musical career to become a boxer and please his father. Karan persists with training and wins a series of fights, thinking that victory will bring his family together. The final match is with the current world heavy champion; Karan is tricked and he ends up paralysed in a hospital bed. Baldev, who wanted to wash a stigma is now about to lose his son. When Karan reveals the world heavy champion cheated, Angad decides to return to boxing and win the title for his father. He eventually brings the world heavyweight champion belt to India in triumph, however meanwhile Karan suffers liver damage and requires a liver to survive. A guilt stricken Baldev pleads with the doctors to use his liver, but the doctors reject the idea. In a stroke of luck, a liver is given to Karan through an unknown donor. In the end, Baldev who was going to give up his life for Karan, is instead alive and happy with his family.

Leo was born in Des Moines, Iowa, but was raised in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1973, he moved to Chicago, Illinois and subsequently became a guitarist of the short- lived Eddie Boy Band. The band then traveled to Los Angeles, California two years later, where they recorded an album for MCA Records (which was the first record Leo had made). The Eddie Boy Band, however, was unsatisfied with the sound quality of the album, and they disbanded shortly afterward. In 1979, four years after the Eddie Boy Band broke up, Leo began touring with J. D. Souther as a guitarist. And over the next few years, he would record and tour with the likes of Kim Carnes, Jimmy Buffett and Glenn Frey. During this time, Leo also began a songwriting career. In 1983, he scored his first hit when Crystal Gayle reached Number One on the Billboard Country Singles chart with his composition, \\"Baby What About You.\\" That same year, Leo recorded a pop album for Warner Bros. Records titled Rockin' on 6th, and he made his first venture into music production, when he produced Timothy B. Schmit's 1984 album, Playin' It Cool. In 1985, Leo moved to Nashville, Tennessee to focus more on his writing and producing careers. The first album he produced while in Nashville was the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1987 project, Hold On. One of the tracks from that album, \\"Baby's Got A Hold On Me\\" an up-tempo song he co- wrote with Jeff Hannah and Bob Carpenter, scored him his first hit as a producer on the R&R; charts. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Leo wrote songs and produced albums for many country music artists and groups, such as Alabama, Restless Heart, Kathy Mattea, Reba McEntire and LeAnn Rimes, among others. Also during this time, he spent four years serving as vice president and head of A&R; at RCA Records' Nashville division. Among the artists he signed during his tenure at RCA Nashville were Martina McBride and Lari White. As of 2016, Leo continues to be active in the music business. Among his more recent projects are writing songs and producing albums for the likes of Brenda Lee, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, Kenny Chesney and Dustin Lynch, as well a collaboration project with other fellow Nashville musicians, naming themselves the Vinyl Kings. His projects in the late 2000s include the production of two Emerson Drive albums, Countrified and Believe, both of which Leo co-produced with Alabama bass guitarist Teddy Gentry. Additionally, Leo has also produced the 2012 self-titled second album from the group Love and Theft and their 2015 album, Whiskey on my Breath. All told, he has performed on over 150 records, produced 21 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, written six singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country Singles chart, and won 6 BMI Millionaire awards.

McDonald (born March 11, 1966) is an American judge and former politician from Connecticut. He serves as an associate justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. He previously served as a member of the Connecticut State Senate from 2003 to 2011, representing the state's 27th district in Stamford and Darien as a Democrat. McDonald resigned from the legislature on January 4, 2011 to serve as Governor Dan Malloy's chief legal counsel, a post he left to join the bench. Early life and career A Stamford native, McDonald is the son of Alex and Anne McDonald. His mother was a sixth-grade teacher who represented Stamford in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1991 to 2003. McDonald was educated at the Stamford Public Schools (Stark, Dolan and Stamford High School), and completed a Bachelor's degree in Government from Cornell University. He completed a Juris Doctor at the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1991, and served as managing editor of the Connecticut Journal of International Law. McDonald was a litigation partner with Pullman & Comley, LLC, in Stamford from 1991. He also worked as Director of Legal Affairs for the City of Stamford from 1999 to 2002. McDonald also served on the Stamford Board of Finance from 1995 to 1999, as the board's chairman from 1997 to 1999, and as co-chair of the Audit Committee from 1995 to 1997. He served on the Stamford Board of Representatives from the Cove from 1993 to 1995. Political career McDonald won narrow election to the Connecticut Senate in 2002, defeating his Republican opponent, Michael Fedele (who later served as Lieutenant Governor), by 53% to 47%. He was re-elected in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. He served as Deputy Majority Leader and as Senate Chair of the Judiciary Committee. In 2006 and 2007 McDonald challenged the decision of Connecticut Chief Justice William J. Sullivan to delay publication of a court decision in an effort to promote the chief justice candidacy of his colleague, Justice Peter T. Zarella. Sullivan challenged the power of a legislator to subpoena him to appear at a hearing, which led to a court challenge. In 2007 McDonald opposed a special session of the General Assembly to address parole issues following the horrific home invasion murders in Cheshire, stating \\"Legislating by bumper sticker motto is not the way to go.\\" Other Democrats were more willing to respond as Congressman Chris Murphy proposal making home invasion a federal crime. McDonald relented under public pressure and a special session was held January 22, 2008 to pass laws declaring home invasion a class A felony and reforming the parole board. McDonald opposed a Three Strikes Law favored by Governor Jodi Rell to mandate life terms to career violent criminals; that measure failed to pass. Rell reiterated her call for a Three Strikes bill on March 31, 2008 following the kidnapping and murder of an elderly New Britain woman committed by a sex offender recently released from Connecticut prison. Following the New Britain crime, McDonald lambasted the prosecutor who had handled the assailant's previous case, Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who agreed to a plea bargain which sentenced the defendant to an eight-year prison term. Defense lawyer Norm Pattis called McDonald a \\"knucklehead\\" for attacking Connelly as soft on crime, noting Connelly was responsible for most of the death penalty convictions in Connecticut. In March 2009 McDonald and Judiciary committee co- chair Mike Lawlor proposed a bill (SB 1098) to regulate the management of Roman Catholic parishes in Connecticut. Opponents charged the bill would violate the separation of church and state clause in the First Amendment. Judicial career After two years of serving as Governor Dan Malloy‚Äôs chief legal counsel, McDonald was nominated to a seat on the Connecticut Supreme Court on December 27, 2012. His nomination required the approval of the Connecticut General Assembly. The Joint Committee on Judiciary of the Connecticut General Assembly approved his nomination by a vote of 40‚Äì2 on January 14, 2013. On January 23, his nomination won the approval of the Senate by a vote of 30‚Äì3 and of the House by a vote of 125‚Äì20. He took his seat on the bench the following day. In November 2017, the Chief Justice of Connecticut Chase T. Rogers announced that she would retire in February 2018. Governor Malloy announced on January 8, 2018, that he had nominated McDonald to be the next Chief Justice, to succeed Rogers. However, in March 2018, McDonald‚Äôs nomination was rejected by the Connecticut Senate in a 19-16 vote, with all 18 Republican state senators voting no. If he‚Äôd been confirmed, McDonald would have been the first openly gay person to serve as chief justice of a U.S. state supreme court. Governor Malloy subsequently nominated justice Richard A. Robinson to be chief justice, instead of McDonald. Personal McDonald is gay. His campaigns have won the backing of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. McDonald married Charles Gray in 2009. He is one of ten LGBT state supreme court justices currently serving in the United States.

He lectured at the Sorbonne and Oxford, served briefly on the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation in Paris after World War I, and spent fifteen months imprisoned in Dachau and Buchenwald, where he developed heart disease.Warburg Institute Archive, General Correspondence, R. Eisler to J. Skemp, 3 April 1946. He is best remembered today for advancing a new picture of the historical Jesus based on his interpretation of the Slavonic Josephus manuscript tradition, proposing a dual currency system to control inflation, and arguing for a prehistoric derivation of human violence in Man into Wolf: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism, and Lycanthropy. His life and work intersected with those of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alois Riegl, Gilbert Murray, Karl Popper, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, G. R. S. Mead, Aby Warburg, Fritz Saxl, Gershom Scholem, Martin Buber, and Walter Benjamin. Life = Early Life and Education = Eisler was born in Vienna on 27 April 1882. After gymnasium, Eisler attended the University of Vienna, where he received his first doctorate in economics. In 1902, he published Studien zur Werttheorie (Studies on Value Theory, 1902), a collection of five essays belonging to ‚ÄúThe Second Austrian School of Value Theory,‚Äù associated with his teachers Christian von Ehrenfels and Alexius Meinong. Around 1904 he traveled through the Mediterranean visiting museums and archaeological sites. When he returned to Austria in 1905, he took a second doctorate in Art History under Alois Riegl and Franz Wickhoff at the University of Vienna Institute of Art History. In 1908, Eisler converted to Roman Catholicism in order to marry Rosalia ‚ÄúLili‚Äù von Pausinger, an Austrian baroness and the daughter of the landscape painter Franz von Pausinger. = Attempted Art Theft in 1907 = On 9 June 1907, during a trip to Italy, Eisler visited the library of the Archbishop‚Äôs Palace in Udine to photograph some codices. After Eisler had finished taking photographs and left, the librarian noticed that a fifteenth century codex called the Virginis et Passionis was missing and called the authorities to report the theft. The police picked up Eisler for questioning, and while he was being held at the station he grabbed a pen knife from a desk and stuck it into his throat, but the wound was superficial. Upon confessing to the theft, Eisler was confined to await trial and, as a foreigner, he was held without bail. In his jail cell one night, Eisler broke a bottle of disinfectant and tried to slash his left wrist with a shard of glass. This wound, too, was stitched up by a doctor, who also diagnosed Eisler with malaria. At his trial, in which Hugo von Hoffmannsthal testified as a character witness, Eisler confessed to having taken the codex and was ultimately allowed to pay his court costs and avoid jail time so that his family could take him to a sanitarium in nearby Gorizia. = Service in World War I = From 1914 until 1917 Eisler served as an officer in Austria- Hungary‚Äôs 59th ‚ÄúErzherzog Rainer‚Äù Infantry Regiment, and was awarded the silver medal and was made a knight of both the Order of Francis Joseph and the Iron Cross. = Connections to the Warburg Circle in Hamburg = Eisler‚Äôs contacts with the ‚ÄúHamburg School‚Äù of art history, which included Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl and the philosopher Ernst Cassirer, began in the early 1920s. During this period, Eisler also introduced Gershom Scholem to Warburg‚Äôs circle. On 3 December 1922, Eisler went to Hamburg to give a paper titled ‚ÄúOrphische und altchristliche Kultsymbolik‚Äù (‚ÄúOrphic and Early Christian Cult Symbolism‚Äù) at the Bibliothek Warburg and received spontaneous applause at the end of his lecture. Warburg himself was taking a leave of absence, having suffered a nervous breakdown in 1918. It was Saxl, Warburg‚Äôs secretary who had read Orpheus the Fisher and invited Eisler. As they were setting the date, Eisler began to try Saxl‚Äôs patience with his frequent requests: before he had even arrived, Eisler wanted to set up two more lectures, one on ancient seafaring and another on the history of money, the latter being an area of his scholarship that he seemed convinced would be of special interest to Warburg, whose brothers were major figures in the world of finance. In 1925 Saxl published Eisler‚Äôs Orphisch-dionysische Mysterien-Gedanken in der christlichen Antike (Orphic-Dionysian Mystery Thought in Early Christianity) in the Vortr√§ge der Bibliothek Warburg (Warburg Library Lectures). Writing from the Bellevue Clinic in Kreuzlingen, Warburg, who was much concerned with professionalism and distinguishing himself from the amateur scholars of his day, vehemently opposed Eisler‚Äôs invitation. He later complained about Eisler‚Äôs excessive ‚Äúchutzpah‚Äù and insisted that he did not want to attract ‚Äúsuch people‚Äù and provide ‚Äúa stage for immodest dilettantes.‚Äù At the time, Warburg was suffering from severe depression and was subject to ‚Äúterrible tantrums and phobias, obsessions and delusions which ultimately made him a danger to himself and his surroundings and lead to his confinement in a closed ward.‚Äù In 1924, having recovered from his breakdown, Warburg sought Eisler‚Äôs help with his own work and corresponded with him on the topic of the Zoroastrian god Zurvan. When Warburg died in 1929, Eisler asked to write his obituary for a scholarly journal. And upon his own death, Eisler‚Äôs widow donated most of his papers to the Warburg Institute‚Äôs archive. = Diplomatic and Scholarly Work in Paris = In 1925, with the recommendation of the classicist Gilbert Murray, Eisler took a diplomatic post in Paris as a deputy chief of the Institut International de Cooperation Intellectuelle (International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation) which had been created at the invitation of the French government to work with the League of Nations‚Äô International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation. However, Eisler accepted the position and moved into a large rented apartment in Paris without first obtaining the permission of the Austrian government, who lodged a complaint with the League of Nations. While in Paris, Eisler received a visit from Scholem and Walter Benjamin. Scholem later described the encounter: > ‚ÄúThe visit we paid Eisler in the deserted rooms of his luxury apartment‚Äîthe > ‚Äúofficial people‚Äù had already disassociated themselves from him‚Äîwas a > depressing experience for us. Eisler, however, cheerfully discussed his > discoveries about the person and role of Jesus as the leader of a political > revolt. We realized we were witnessing a sad turning point in the life of an > unusual human being.‚Äù While in Paris, Eisler gave lectures on the Slavonic Josephus manuscript, a version of Josephus's The Jewish War that Eisler argued was translated by a ‚ÄúJudaisizing heretic‚Äù from a lost Greek version of an unattested Aramaic original, and was therefore free from the Christian censorship coloring every other version of the text. In a letter to The Times of 17 April 1926, Eisler laid out the new narrative of Jesus‚Äôs ministry and death that the reconstructed manuscripts described: > There is no doubt now that the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem and > the ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù of the Temple were considered by Jews, as well as by Romans, > as a revolutionary rising against the Roman government‚Ä¶ Yet it is very > important to see that even this hostile and prejudiced statement does not > imply an accusation that Jesus started this rising against the Roman army of > occupation, but admits that He was urged by His zelotic followers upon the > path which led to the conscious self-sacrifice on the Cross. This argument became the basis for a two-volume work in German, ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüœíŒ£ ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïœíŒ£ Œüœí ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïœíŒ£ŒëŒ£: Messianische Unabh√§ngigkeitsbewegung vom Auftreten Johannes des T√§ufers bis zum Untergang Jakobs des Gerechtenn ach der neuerschlossenen Eroberung von Jerusalem des Flavius Josephus und den christlichen Quellen (Jesus, the King Who Did Not Reign: The Messianic Independence Movement from the Appearance of John the Baptist to the Downfall of Jacob the Righteous after the Newly Discovered ‚ÄúConquest of Jerusalem‚Äù by Flavius Josephus and the Christian Sources, 1929-30). A year later he published a shorter English edition titled The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist According to Flavius Josephus‚Äô Recently Rediscovered ‚ÄòCapture of Jerusalem‚Äô and Other Jewish and Christian Sources (1931). = Congressional and Parliamentary Testimony on Monetary Reform = In the early 1930s, as the world was suffering the Great Depression, Eisler turned his attention back to economics, the subject in which he earned his first doctorate. With a plan to reverse inflation and stave off future financial crises, he wrote three books for popular audiences on how to reform the banking system: This Money Maze: A Way Out of the Economic World Crisis (1931), Stable Money (1932), and, with economist Alec Wilson, The Money Machine: A Simple Introduction to the Eisler Plan (1933). Eisler drew on an historical practice from the Italian Renaissance called ‚Äúbanco-money‚Äù to argue for a dual currency system that would create an effective negative interest rate by removing the zero lower bound. Eisler presented this system to the British Parliamentary Finance Committee Review in 1932 and the U.S. Congress‚Äôs Committee on Banking and Currency in 1934, where he argued that if Great Britain and the United States both adopted his plan, ‚Äúthey could completely revolutionize the world and achieve such prosperity and such wealth as cannot be dreamed of under present circumstances.‚Äù Neither government implemented his plan. = Connections to Eranos = In 1935 Eisler was invited to give a lecture on lecturing about the identity of the author of the Fourth Gospel at the Eranos conference, which marked the beginning of his connection to Carl Jung. Jung had already been reading Eisler and went on to cite his work on Orphic symbolism in his 1935 essay ‚ÄúDream Symbols and the Individuation Process‚Äù and subsequently in a lecture series on Nietzsche‚Äôs Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The 1935 edition of the Eranos Jahrbuch (Eranos Yearbook) published the paper he had presented in the form of an essay titled ‚ÄúDas R√§tsel des Johannesevangeliums‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Riddle of the Gospel of John‚Äù). Eranos founder Olga Fr√∂be-Kapteyn reported to Jung that one of her cats had allowed Eisler to witness her birthing a litter, which had raised him in her estimation. Another Eranos attendee, Ernst Robert Curtius, called Eisler ‚Äúa real aufkl√§rer [enlightener]‚Äù and commented: \\"[Eisler] showed with uncanny clarity, where the cold dialectic of the white man‚Äôs intellect leads‚Äîto a petrifaction, a rigor mortis of the world as a concept. What remains is the inner malaise of Solomonic world-weariness.\\" = Imprisonment in Dachau and Buchenwald = Following the Anschluss in March 1938, Eisler wrote to Oxford asking about being appointed to the Wilde Readership in Comparative and Natural Religion, thereby gaining a way out of Nazi-controlled Europe. Gilbert Murray stepped in and secured him the Oxford post, which he was to have taken in October and held for three years. But on May 20, Eisler was arrested and sent to Dachau under ‚Äúprotective custody‚Äù as prisoner 16547. Lili Eisler stayed behind in Unterach am Attersee, trying to get her husband released. Because she refused to divorce him, her inherited properties in Salzburg and Upper Austria were confiscated. Eisler was eventually transferred to Buchenwald on 22 September 1938. At Buchenwald, prisoners worked from first light until dark and in 1938 and 1939, when Eisler was there, they were often made to work after dinner until one in the morning under floodlights. Eisler later reported having been confined to \\"'the solitary confinement of the 'black bunker.'\\" His fellow Austrian Jewish scholar, Heinrich E. Jacob, author of a landmark 1944 study of the history of baking and bread, was confined along with Eisler in the camps. In the acknowledgements section of his book, Jacobs thanks him directly, writing, ‚ÄúI also wish to thank my friend Robert Eisler, historian of religion, who in the dark days of Dachau and Buchenwald, kept awake my hope to finish and to publish this book.‚Äù In September 1939, Eisler wrote to a friend about his time in the camps: > [It] may interest you that I have had some very fruitful and comforting > discussions with one highly educated and intelligent member of the primitive > Christian adventist community of the so-called Biblical Scientists, the > members of which are mostly in the German concentration camps (about 500 in > Buchenwald) and more cruelly treated even than the Jews because they believe > Hitler to be the foretold Anti-Christ, the Kingdom of God as a political > organisation to be realized here on earth as a reign of justice and loving > kindness and because they refuse military service. I was greatly surprised > to learn that this man who had studied Hebrew and Greek as well as theology > in order to be a preacher and teacher among his brethren (they have no > clergy) should have read my German ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüœíŒ£ ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïœíŒ£ and derived from it what > he felt to be the strongest possible confirmation of his own and [the > founder of the sect] Judge Rutherford‚Äôs interpretation of the gospels! = Last Years in England = After his release, Eisler made his way to England via Italy and Switzerland and arrived in September 1939 to find that Oxford had appointed the Anglo-Catholic philosopher and historian of religion Edwin Oliver James to the readership in his absence. At first, Eisler was assured that James, a full professor at Leeds, would step down now that Eisler had arrived, since ‚Äúno Englishman would profit [from] such a situation.‚Äù But James, Englishman though he was, declined to give up his post, and so the university made a concession to Eisler, allowing him to deliver his scheduled 1938 lectures on ‚Äúthe pre-Hellenic populations of Crete and the Aegean‚Äù in the Michaelmas terms of 1939 and 1940, and to receive a stipend of ¬£156. Eisler and Lili, who arrived in June 1940, stayed with a series of friends until Lili found work as a cook in return for modest lodging and bus fare for her husband‚Äôs one day a week in the library. The same month his wife finally joined him in England, Eisler was sent to another prison camp, this time by the British government, who had begun interning Jewish refugees on the Isle of Man. He was released in September due to his heart trouble. The 1940s were years of frustration for Eisler. His body was badly damaged by his fifteen months in the camps, probably compounded by earlier war injuries and the long- term effects of malaria. He was suffering angina pectoris as well as severe pain in his hands and shoulders from bone degeneration, and he may have developed diabetes. In this state, Eisler tried to earn a living with a scattering of essays and lectures and occasional employment as a financial consultant or tutor. For extra money and when his health allowed, he sometimes worked stoking the boiler in his building. He applied for funding for a series of lectures on the fourth gospel from The Hibbert Trust, a Unitarian endowment that offered grants to those seeking to ‚Äúcontribute to the education, knowledge or understanding of Unitarianism or liberal religion.‚Äù It was denied, prompting him to angrily accuse the board of bias against non- Christians. In 1942 Eisler proposed to the BBC a broadcast reading of his reconstruction of Ecclesiastes for Ash Wednesday. It was likewise rejected. In 1946 he approached them once more with the same proposal and when he was rebuffed this time, he again claimed religious discrimination and, unsuccessfully, took his case to the Joint Committee on Matters of Religious Liberty. In September 1941, Esther Simpson, secretary of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning, wrote a one-paragraph note to Eisler asking about his current employment so that she could update the Society‚Äôs records. Two days later, she received four pages covered front and back with crabbed handwriting detailing Eisler‚Äôs many indignities, humiliations, and rejections since coming to England. On the last page is written: > If the Society wanted to do something, one would think that something could > be done to alleviate one‚Äôs feelings of being utterly useless and unwelcome. > I have therefore decided to give you an exact survey of the facts, although > I feel sure that the only result will be to convince you more than ever that > I am a very square peg impossible to fit into any of the well-rounded and > polished but rather narrow holes available in this country‚Ä¶ I have arranged > with the Oxford professor of anatomy who has very kindly undertaken to > utilise for teaching purposes and the benefit of science what I shall leave > here when I finally depart from this queer world and thus to relieve my > guarantors from what I understand might be a final expenditure of at least > [¬£40] to close my account.R. Eisler to E. Simpson, 14 September 1944. Despite his obvious depression and failing health, Eisler was still remarkably productive in the 1940s and producing some of his best work. He was lecturing throughout London on a wide variety of topics, including ‚ÄúThe Philosophic Basis of Modern Physics.‚Äù 1946 saw the appearance of the lavishly illustrated The Royal Art of Astrology, drawn from some of his earlier work in Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt and motivated partly by Eisler‚Äôs fear that astrological newspaper columns were encouraging ‚Äútotalitarian dictatorship and abject mass servitude to an alleged fatality.‚ÄùR. Eisler to J. Skemp, 3 April 1946. That same year, after eight years of silence, he sent a 250-page manuscript to Scholem outlining his plan to implement Zionism and solve the Palestine problem with > a committee consisting of three Anglican theologians and three strictly > Orthodox rabbis to rule on the credentials of all Jews living in Palestine. > Those who were not deemed kosher enough to be allowed to remain in the > country as pious worshippers were to be given the choice of returning to > their countries of origin or (if they wanted a Jewish state) of taking > possession of the second district of Vienna (the Leopoldstadt) as well as > the entire city of Frankfurt am Main; these territories were to be evacuated > by the Germans and placed under international guarantees as a Jewish state. Scholem mailed it back with the one-word reply, ‚ÄúGenug‚Äù (‚Äúenough\\"), and they never spoke again. In 1948, he delivered a lecture to the Royal Society of Medicine that was later published as Man into Wolf: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism, and Lycanthropy. Robert Eisler died on 18 December 1949, reportedly with the essay he was finishing, ‚ÄúThe Passion of the Flax,‚Äù at his bedside. There were two obituaries in The Times. The second one, written by his friend Cyril Goldsmid (the scion of a powerful Anglo-Jewish family) describes him as ‚Äúpossessed of encyclopedic knowledge,‚Äù but ‚Äúentirely devoid of intellectual arrogance.\\" Works *Studien zur Werttheorie (1902) The Theory Of Values *Die Legende vom heiligen Karantanerherzog Domitianus, Mitteilungen des Instituts f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichtsforschung 28, Innsbruck 1907 *Die illuminierten Handschriften in K√§rnten (1907) *Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt, two volumes (1910) Internet Archive link (vol. 1 only) *Die Kenitischen Weihinschriften der Hyksoszeit (1919) *Orpheus the Fisher: Comparative Studies in Orphic and Christian Cult Symbolism (1921) *Das Geld (1924) *Orphisch-Dionysische Mysteriengedanken in der christlichen Antike (1925) *Iesous Basileus ou Basileusas, two volumes (1929/30) *The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist (1931) pdf link *This Money Maze (1931) *Stable Money (1932) *Monetary Theory and Monetary Policy (1934) *Zur Kritik der psychologistischen Konjunktur-Theorie (1935) *Das R√§tzel des vierten Evangeliums (1936) as The Enigma of the Fourth Gospel (1938) *Flavius Josephus Studien (1938) *The Royal Art of Astrology (London 1946) *Una Tavoletta di Biccherna Nuovamente Scoperta (1950) * Man Into Wolf: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism and Lycanthropy (1951) *Comparative Studies In Ancient Cosmology (never published)  Notes   External links  * Archive holdings and short bio, Warburg Institute Category:Austrian art historians Category:Austrian biblical scholars Category:Jewish biblical scholars Category:Jewish emigrants from Austria to the United Kingdom after the Anschluss Category:Writers from Vienna Category:Pseudohistorians Category:1882 births Category:1949 deaths Category:20th-century Jewish biblical scholars Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:Knights of the Order of Franz Joseph Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Austro-Hungarian Army officers Category:University of Paris faculty Category:Academics of the University of Oxford ","title":"Robert Eisler"},{"id":"8889911","text":"Andrew McDonald may refer to: Politics * Andrew McDonald (Australian politician) (born 1955), Australian doctor and politician * Andrew J.

It is the longest continuous walking pilgrimage in Britain and is walked by students, graduates and their families. The pilgrimage was founded in 1948 by a University of London student, Wilfred Mauncote-Carter, who led a group of students including many ex-servicemen, on a walk from London to Walsingham, taking it in turns to carry the Cross. The pilgrimage has grown over the years and currently consists of 11 different 'legs' that start from different areas of the country and at different stages of the week leading up to the celebration of the Easter Triduum. The Pilgrimage has been officially Ecumenical since 1972 although it still retains a Catholic flavour. Six of the legs walk for seven days over a distance of approximately 120 miles. One leg walks for three days over a distance of around sixty miles. Two are for families and are based in Letton Hall, near Shipdham and Wells-next-the-Sea. Easter Cross walks for Good Friday only and is generally for older student-crossers who have previously walked full legs. In 2012, another leg - Wensum Leg - was set up for secondary school-aged children and their parents, to cover the gap between family legs and the 'main' legs. All of the legs meet on the afternoon of Good Friday and celebrate the Easter liturgy together in Walsingham over the Easter weekend. __TOC__ Current Student Cross Legs * London (starts walking from Epping Forest) * Northern (starts walking from the village of Keyworth near Nottingham) * Midland (starts walking from the village of Keyham near Leicester) * Essex (starts walking from Colchester) * Oxford (starts walking from Oxford) * Kettering (starts walking from near the town of Desborough) * Ely (starts walking from Ely) * Peg (based at Letton Hall, Shipdham, Norfolk) * Wells (based at Wells-next-the-Sea Youth Hostel) * Easter Cross (starts walking from North Elmham on Good Friday) * Wensum (starts walking from Wymondham on Palm Sunday) External links * Student Cross * Northern Cross (a similar Easter pilgrimage, which walks to Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the coast of Northumberland; this was set up by veteran Student Cross walkers in 1976, who were seeking a different destination.) * Scottish Cross (Another natural development from Student and Northern Cross with cross carrying pilgrims walking to Iona on two routes - Fort William and Loch Lomond Legs - during Holy Week.)

To contribute source code to most large software projects, one must make modifications and then \\"commit\\" those changes to a central version control system, such as Git (or CVS). In open-source software development, the committer role may be used to distinguish commit access, a specific type of responsibility, from other forms of contribution, such as triaging issues or organizing events. Typically, an author submits a software patch containing changes and a committer integrates the patch into the main code base of the project. Commit bit To have a \\"commit bit\\" on one's user account means that the user is permitted to contribute source code changes. This dates to the use of a literal binary digit to represent yes-or-no privileges in access control systems of legacy version control and software systems, such as BSD. The commit bit represents the permission to contribute to the shared code of a software project. It can be resigned or may be removed due to inactivity in the project, as dormant committer accounts can represent security risks. Common responsibilities Project committers are usually the lead developers of a project and are the ones responsible for the majority of changes. They are seen as trusted, responsible and reliable members of the project's community. Relatedly, committers are usually responsible for the review of patches submitted by members of the community for inclusion into the software. After a successful review, usually consisting of conformance to coding standards and ensuring it does not introduce any new bugs, the committer will commit that specific patch on behalf of the patch submitter. Becoming a committer The process to becoming a committer can vary across projects, but in general, there are three common ways to do it. # Be one of the original developers # Be appointed by one of the original developers # Be successfully voted in by the community of committers Becoming a committer in an existing project often involves becoming active on both the mailing lists as well as with supplying patches. After enough involvement, the other committers can then vote you in as a new committer. This normally happens through an e-mail vote. The XML-SOAP project hosted at Apache.org is an example of this process.http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xml-soap- dev/200006.mbox/%3c852568F9.0079E946.00@d54mta04.raleigh.ibm.com%3e References Category:Free software culture and documents Category:Version control ","title":"Committer"},{"id":"8889982","text":"Wild Beasts were an English indie rock band, formed in 2002 in Kendal.

That is, we apply the totient function to a number n, apply it again to the resulting totient, and so on, until the number 1 is reached, and add together the resulting sequence of numbers; if the sum equals n, then n is a perfect totient number. For example, there are six positive integers less than 9 and relatively prime to it, so the totient of 9 is 6; there are two numbers less than 6 and relatively prime to it, so the totient of 6 is 2; and there is one number less than 2 and relatively prime to it, so the totient of 2 is 1; and , so 9 is a perfect totient number. The first few perfect totient numbers are :3, 9, 15, 27, 39, 81, 111, 183, 243, 255, 327, 363, 471, 729, 2187, 2199, 3063, 4359, 4375, ... . In symbols, one writes :\\\\varphi^i(n)=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\varphi(n)&\\\\mbox{ if } i=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi(\\\\varphi^{i-1}(n))&\\\\mbox{ otherwise}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. for the iterated totient function. Then if c is the integer such that :\\\\displaystyle\\\\varphi^c(n)=2, one has that n is a perfect totient number if :n = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{c + 1} \\\\varphi^i(n).  Multiples and powers of three  It can be observed that many perfect totient are multiples of 3; in fact, 4375 is the smallest perfect totient number that is not divisible by 3. All powers of 3 are perfect totient numbers, as may be seen by induction using the fact that :\\\\displaystyle\\\\varphi(3^k) = \\\\varphi(2\\\\times 3^k) = 2\\\\times 3^{k-1}. Venkataraman (1975) found another family of perfect totient numbers: if is prime, then 3p is a perfect totient number. The values of k leading to perfect totient numbers in this way are :0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 39, 201, 249, 1005, 1254, 1635, ... . More generally if p is a prime number greater than 3, and 3p is a perfect totient number, then p ‚â° 1 (mod 4) (Mohan and Suryanarayana 1982). Not all p of this form lead to perfect totient numbers; for instance, 51 is not a perfect totient number. Iannucci et al. (2003) showed that if 9p is a perfect totient number then p is a prime of one of three specific forms listed in their paper. It is not known whether there are any perfect totient numbers of the form 3kp where p is prime and k > 3.

For the rest of the Meiji period, he was a politician and diplomat, and was one of the last surviving Japanese daimy≈ç (Hayashi Tadataka and Wakebe Mitsunori outlived him). Biography Adopted by his uncle Asano Nagamichi, he served as assistant to his adoptive father through the 1860s, and attended many of the meetings and events surrounding the restoration of Imperial rule, and as such was one of many who advised the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return power to the Emperor of Japan. Unlike many from domains such as Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´, however, Asano was opposed to taking military action against the shogunate. His childhood name was Kiyotsuchi (Âñú‰ª£Êßå) later Tamegoro (ÁÇ∫‰∫îÈÉé). Nagakoto became the twelfth daimy≈ç of Hiroshima in 1869 upon Nagamichi's retirement. The domains (han) were abolished in 1871, but Asano was granted the title of Marquis (k≈çshaku) under the kazoku system of peerage which was instituted at that time. He became a member of the Genr≈çin (Chamber of Elders) in 1880, was appointed ambassador to Italy two years later, and served in the House of Peers for a time as well. Though living and serving in Tokyo, he worked to support industry and other enterprises in his home area, newly dubbed Hiroshima Prefecture.

Interpretation The poem pursues a contrast between poetic imagination and philosophical reasoning, the latter understood as abstract system-building associated with the rationalist tradition going back to Plato. Stevens implicitly contrasts the philosophers' Plato with 'the ultimate Plato'. Both seek the supreme good, but Plato and the other philosophers look for it in something abstract like Plato's 'Forms'‚Äîa gaunt fugitive phantom. The poet finds the highest good in the sensuous lived experience of an evening in Biscayne, where the good light of Venus, the Evening Star, reveals it to the poet as wanton, abundantly beautiful, eager, fecund.

It lies south of Union Street, between West Hoe in the east and Stonehouse in the west. The area is currently subject to a public-private regeneration creating new homes, business premises, marina, a 1000-pupil school and opening up the waterfront to greater public access. Early history Mill Bay was a natural inlet to the west of the Hoe. It was originally far more extensive than the current docks because it included the \\"Sourepool\\" which was a tidal salt-marsh that lay roughly along the line of today's Union Street. The Sourepool was separated from the bay by a narrow neck across which tidal mills were built, probably in the 12th century. These mills were operated by the Priors of Plympton who collected the income from grinding corn. By the mid 15th century, the mills were owned and let by the Corporation of Plymouth; the lease was sold to Francis Drake in 1573. In 1591‚Äì92 Drake built six new mills along Drake's Leat that had recently been completed. Around this time the old tidal mills closed and the Sourepool was drained (\\"made drie for a meadow\\") in 1592. Contemporary map of Plymouth during the Civil War, showing the extent of Millbay During the English Civil War, Plymouth declared for Parliament and was the subject of a prolonged Royalist siege between 1642 and 1646. At this time Millbay was the only harbour of Plymouth that was out of reach of the Royalist artillery so it became the sole source of resupply for the town. From the end of the Civil War Millbay reverted to a quiet anchorage with no jetties or port facilities, but in 1756 John Smeaton built a jetty and workyard in the south west corner of the harbour for unloading and working the stone for the third Eddystone Lighthouse. A ten-ton ship, named the Eddystone Boat, was based here and took the worked stones out to the reef. Smeaton's lighthouse was completed in 1759 and around this time the Long Room (an assembly room), bath house, bowling green and other amenities were built nearby. Of these, only the Long Room survives, built in red brick with Portland stone facings. To its north the Stonehouse Barracks were built, 1779‚Äì85. Until Victorian speculators constructed new docks and warehousing, this had a watergate into Millbay from which the navy's soldiers embarked for service at sea. 19th-century expansion A map from the late 1830s shows a small \\"Union Dock\\" at Millbay, about which not much is known, but in 1840 an Act of Parliament granted Thomas Gill the authority to build a pier and other works at the mouth of Millbay as well as deepening the creek. Gill had a quarry at the east side of the harbour, and the pier he built, now known as Millbay Pier, was long and was completed in 1844. The following year the SS Great Britain berthed here during her maiden voyage to New York and was visited by 15,000 sightseers. In 1846 another Act of Parliament established the Great Western Dock Company to provide full facilities for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company and became a director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill were involved in the South Devon Railway, so it is no surprise that the first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849. The next year a railway extension was built to the new docks, customs facilities were granted and the docks were recognised as a Government mail packet station. Brunel next built another pier, an iron floating pontoon long by wide (91 m √ó 12 m) for the Irish Steamship Company whose vessels were regularly using the harbour. Then he constructed the inner basin, with limestone and granite walls. It had dock gates and a drydock at the western side and was in size. It opened in 1857. Part of the earth dam that had been built across the harbour to facilitate the creation of the inner basin was retained for the later construction of Trinity Pier. From then on a few modifications were made, but no major changes took place until the construction of the ferry terminal in the 1970s. Millbay was a busy commercial dock because it could accommodate larger ships than Sutton Pool, off the Cattewater. A wide range of freight was handled, with grain always being an important import. It was also one of the major coaling stations in the English Channel. A significant amount of shipbuilding took place here: Willoughby Bros Ltd., for example, was in business from 1857 until 1969 and built vessels for the Royal Mail Steamship Company, Customs and Excise and others, as well as chain ferries for Torpoint, Saltash, Littlehampton and Felixstowe. Ocean liner traffic Unloading mail by hand from the Sir Francis Drake at Millbay Docks, March 1926 From the 1870s until the Second World War Millbay was a busy landing point for rich travellers from the USA who preferred to disembark the transatlantic liners in Plymouth Sound, come ashore in tenders and catch fast trains from Millbay station to London Paddington, thereby substantially reducing travel time by avoiding the sea passage to Southampton or Tilbury. It was known as \\"the route which cuts the corners off\\". An idea of the scale of this business can be seen from the fact that during the 20th century over six million passengers landed or were embarked from Millbay and as many as 800 passengers would come ashore from one liner. The peak year for liner traffic was 1930, when 788 liner calls were made to Plymouth. Millions of mailbags were handled too. The railway company quickly became aware of the benefits of this traffic and took the initiative in ordering the first of a series of steamers, the Sir Francis Drake (173 tons), delivered in 1873. It was quickly followed by the smaller Sir Walter Raleigh and in 1883 by the Palmerston and the Smeaton. Many others followed, culminating in the Sir John Hawkins which replaced the ageing Smeaton in 1929. The Sir John Hawkins was 939 tons and was capable of about . On Sunday, 28 April 1912 the majority of the surviving crew of the RMS Titanic disaster disembarked here in secrecy. They were then taken by train from Millbay station to Southampton. Today There are currently two large deepwater docks, one of which is part-owned by Brittany Ferries, which has its UK headquarters here. Since 1973 the company has operated ferry services from the dock to Roscoff on the north coast of Brittany, France, and also to Santander on the north coast of Spain. Ferry services depart and arrive daily from March to late October, and less regularly during the winter months. at Millbay in 2006. The (now demolished) grain silo is in the background. The dock was expanded in 2003 to accommodate Brittany Ferries' new 40,000 ton flagship Pont-Aven, and the terminal building was also renovated. The Pont-Aven shares the dock with the new Armorique, the replacement for the Pont L'Abbe. During the winter months, the Bretagne, usually assigned to Portsmouth, sometimes visits Millbay. During February 2008, the Brittany Ferries fastcraft Normandie Express visited Millbay, the first time that a high speed craft had been used out of Millbay. Millbay is the home of the Plymouth RNLI All-Weather and Inshore Lifeboats, as it has been since 1862. The landmark which most Plymothians remember as the easiest way of locating the entrance to this harbour, a huge boxlike grey concrete grain silo with a substantial tower was demolished in early 2008. Millbay is currently undergoing significant change after the area was targeted as a strategic priority for regeneration in Plymouth, being seen as ‚Äòa key opportunity within Plymouth‚Äôs overall regeneration, given its waterfront location, proximity to the city centre, and gateway status‚Äô (PCC, 2005). The area had suffered from high crime rates (not least for having been Plymouth's busiest and notorious red light district for more than a century) and lay within the St Peter‚Äôs Ward, ranked as Plymouth‚Äôs most deprived ward and within the top 10% of deprived wards in England. (From the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2004). Regeneration proposals were prepared over a number of years through a partnership between the local community, Plymouth City Council, South West Regional Development Agency, English Partnerships, along with the lead developer English Cities Fund (a joint venture public-private partnership between Muse Developments, Legal and General Property and Homes and Communities Agency). The Millbay and Stonehouse Area Action Plan 2006-2021 was adopted by Plymouth City Council in 2007. In the same year the first Millbay Masterplan received planning consent and this was updated in 2015. Millbay's first new development, Cargo, was completed in 2010. Following this considerable progress has been made in delivering the regeneration vision for Millbay. Major works to dredge Millbay‚Äôs inner basin and restore its historic listed quay walls enabled Millbay to host the Race Village for the America‚Äôs Cup World Series event in Plymouth in 2011 and facilitated the development of the new 171-berth King Point Marina, which opened in 2013.Plymouth Herald 27 September 2013 By mid-2016 regeneration in Millbay had resulted in more than 400 new homes, 19,000 sq ft of new business space, a new 1,000-pupil school (Plymouth School of Creative Arts) and King Point Marina. Public realm improvements of this regeneration include newly landscaped quaysides opened to the public and the first section of a new boulevard (Isambard Brunel Way) aimed at reconnecting city centre and waterfront, a long-held Plymouth planning policy aim.

Appearance I. oratoria is very pale when young but matures to grass green, and grows to about 6.5 cm long. The species may be distinguished from Mantis religiosa and other mantids with which it shares a range and general size and shape by the red-orange spot on the ventral side of the fourth (second to last) abdominal segment; also, its cerci are shorter than those of M. religiosa.Animal JunctionD. Oliveira, Mantid Genera Key The species is distinctive in having two large startling violet-brown eyespots on its hind wings which are revealed when its wings are unfolded. The adult is more slender than Tenodera sinensis, more like Mantis religiosa in shape. Females have wings shorter than the abdomen, very similar to some Stagmomantis species, but easily distinguished if the hindwings are visible. Reproduction Two novel I. oratoria survival strategies may have contributed to the expansion of this species beyond its original range, and its success in areas formerly occupied by other mantids such as Stagmomantis carolina. Firstly, this species is capable of parthenogenic reproduction when males are scarce. Secondly, additional I. oratoria nymphs may emerge from their oothecae in the second season after the egg case is produced, i.e., when their siblings are already grown and are producing their own offspring.\\"Range Expansion of an Introduced Mantid Iris oratoria and Niche Overlap with a Native Mantid Stagmomantis limbata (Mantodea: Mantidae)\\" by Michael R. Maxwell and Ofer Eitan, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, Volume 91, Number 4, July 1998.University of Southern California: The Mantis Project Stage 4 Is Observed Parthenogenesis Cryptic or Induced? =Hatching= At a field site in Davis, CA, S. limbata hatched earlier in the season than Iris oratoria, and Iris oratoria tended to persist longer into the year. Behaviour deimatic or threat pose The Mediterranean mantis is known for two distinctive behaviours, apart from the ambush hunting common to other mantids: cannibalism and deimatic or threat displays. The sexual cannibalism of mantids known in popular culture occurs in roughly one quarter of all intersexual encounters of I. oratoria.Crump, 2005. When the mantis is under attack, it sets in motion a complex series of actions which combine to form a startling deimatic display. The mantis turns to face the aggressor, rears up by arching its back, curls its abdomen upwards (dorsiflexion), raises and waves its forelimbs, raises its wings to displays the large brightly coloured eyespots on the hindwings, and stridulates by scraping the edge of its hindwings against its tegmina, the leathery front wings.Prete, 1999. p 185. =Diet= Compared to Stagmomantis limbata, Iris oratoria eats a lesser portion of Orthopteran insects and does not eat as much long bodied insects. S. limbata adults have longer pronota and forelegs than I. oratoria adults. This difference in body size might be an important cause of the dietary differences between the species. Furthermore, the earlier hatch date for S. limbata also might reduce the overlap in Iris oratoria and Stagmomantis limbata diets.

Part of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Catholic Central provides education for grades PreK-12 at three campuses. It was recently ranked as one of the Top 50 Catholic Schools in the Nation. The school's sports teams are known as the Fighting Irish. History Catholic Central High School opened in 1929, as a unified name given to all the local parish high schools in the Springfield area. These three schools merged in 1932, moving operations over to the high school located at St. Raphael's Church in downtown Springfield. However, as the site began to become too crowded, the need for a larger campus became evident, and the school eventually moved again to a new building built down the street from the St. Raphael campus. Operations would move to this site, located at 1200 E. High Street in the fall of 1958. Kindergarten through 8th grade classes were taught independently of Catholic Central at the local parish sites. These included St. Joseph, St. Raphael, St. Mary (Springfield), St. Mary (Urbana), St. Teresa, and St. Bernard. However, in 1980, the economy forced the merger of the St. Joseph, St. Raphael and St. Mary (Springfield) feeder elementary school sites into one school: Holy Trinity. All of the Parish Catholic Elementary Schools subsequently closed and in 2004 all of the parish schools were consolidated into Catholic Central Schools with grades 7-12 on the High Street Campus and grades K-6 housed at the Lagonda and Limestone campuses. As financial conditions continued to plague the Catholic education system in the community, the schools eventually decided to unite into one single school: Catholic Central. In 2004, grades 7 and 8 were moved to the high school's East High Street campus, thus renamed Catholic Central Jr./Sr. High School, while the elementary school sites at St. Bernard Church and St. Teresa Church continued to remain open under the name Catholic Central Elementary School - Lagonda or Limestone campus, respectively. This consolidation, made complete in 2005, marked the first whole unification of the Catholic schools in Springfield. In 2011, a restructuring of grade levels was enacted, and the Lagonda campus began to teach students in grades 4-6, while the Limestone campus taught students in grades PreK-3. The Catholic Central Board of Trustees moved to adopt the Principal-CEO model of governance in 2013. Under this model, Catholic Central consolidated its three campuses ‚Äì closing the Lagonda campus and building a new high school addition at the East High Street campus. With this consolidation, the Limestone campus now houses PreK ‚Äì 2. Grades 3 ‚Äì 12 are now all located at the East High Street campus. Academics For graduation from Catholic Central High School, students are required to have accumulated 4 credits in religion and language arts, 3 credits in math, science and social studies, and 1 credit in art and foreign languages. Students are taught basic courses in the fields. AP courses are available on-campus as an option for advanced students, as well as a dual- credit 100-level religion course from University of Dayton. Students also have the availability to take classes off-campus for dual-credit through PSEO at Clark State Community College and Wittenberg University. In addition, students can work to receive a diploma from Catholic Central, while learning a specific trade and taking classes at the local Springfield-Clark Career Technology Center. Various elective classes are also offered on-campus to the high school students throughout the year, including courses in the study of music, business, art, etc. Academics for grades pre-K through 8 are structured through requirements from the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. While teaching usual grade-school content, students also take a religion course each year and teachers are instructed to inject Christian morality and teachings into their everyday lessons. =Winter Term= During the month of January, Catholic Central breaks the month down into a whole, single semester called January Term, or, \\"J-Term.\\" Students participate in two classes during the semester, both meeting each weekday of the month for three hours, as opposed to the normal fifty minutes. The courses offered (including Comparative Anatomy and Physiology: Dissection and Service Ministry, etc.) are not available to be taken during the rest of the year. Freshman students are required to take physical education and health courses as a means to fulfill the graduation requirement. Sophomore students also take physical education, and may choose to take either an Ohio Graduation Test preparation course or an elective. Junior and senior students are able to complete any class they wish, assuming they have completed their gym and health credits. Upperclassmen students also have the opportunity to complete an independent study and seniors may go on a class trip to Ireland. Grades pre-K through 8 do not participate in \\"J-Term.\\" The term has been nationally recognized. In 2005, the semester term lead to Catholic Central being ranked as one of the \\"Top 50 Catholic Schools in the Nation\\". Campus The school is at 1200 E. High Street in Springfield, Ohio. Students from grades 3-12 attend classes at the Catholic Central School campus. Preschool through 2nd grade classes are taught at the Catholic Central Limestone campus also located in Springfield. =Consolidation= As of 2004, the seventh and eighth grade classes are taught at the main high school classes. The feeder school sites were renamed to Catholic Central Elementary in 2005. As the consolidation was considered successful by Catholic Central and the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, plans began to circulate about Catholic Central potentially finding one location to teach all grades Pre-K through 12. While a fund would have made the purchase of the former site of Springfield South High School available for Catholic Central, they eventually declined the offer. In 2012, however, school officials issued the public announcement of a capital campaign with a long-term vision of the complete consolidation onto the East High Street campus. The first phase of the project includes a $5 ‚Äì $6 million investment which would bring more students to the main campus while at the same time reducing the number of sites from three to two. Completed in August 2014, Phase 1 of the project included the construction of a new addition on the East High site, on the rear and side of the existing high school building. The high school students will take classes in the new addition, while grades 3 - 8 will attend school in the original high school portion of the building. Grades pre-K - 2 are housed at the St. Teresa parish school site/Catholic Central Limestone campus. Phase 2, the new multi-story chapel and elementary school offices addition on the front of the original building was completed in March 2015 with formal dedication by the Archbishop of Cincinnati in April of that year. Athletics Since 2001, Catholic Central High School's athletic teams have participated in the Ohio Heritage Conference (OHC). Students can participate in the following sports: *Fall: Cheerleading, Boys'/Girls' Cross Country, Football, Girls' Tennis, Boys'/ Girls' Golf, Boys'/Girls' Soccer, and Volleyball *Winter: Cheerleading, Boys'/Girls' Basketball, and Boys'/Girls' Swimming, Bowling, and Wrestling *Spring: Baseball, Softball, Boys' Tennis, and Track Elementary students can compete against other schools in a variety of sports through CYO (\\"Catholic Youth Organization\\"). Junior high students also have the ability to play many of the same sports as the high school against other local junior highs. =Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships= Catholic Central High School has won the state championship in the following sports: * Boys Basketball ‚Äì 1996 * Boys Soccer - 2001, 2007 Notable alumni *Jason Collier ‚Äì professional basketball player *Jim Paxson, Sr. ‚Äì professional basketball player =Hall of Honor= In 2008, Catholic Central inducted the first class into its \\"Hall of Honor,\\" which was established to recognize the school's distinguished alumni. There are two categories of inductees: the \\"Distinguished Hall of Honor\\" is for alumni who have made significant contributions to their professions and the school, while being active in their community; the \\"Athletic Hall of Honor\\" recognizes alumni who have made significant contributions to the school's athletic program.

The school and district are named in honor of Tecumseh, a chief of the Shawnee people who lived in the general area between approximately 1768 and 1813. Area served Tecumseh is the only high school in the Tecumseh Local Schools district (renamed from New Carlisle‚ÄìBethel Local Schools in 1989). The district encompasses all but the northeast corner of Bethel Township of Clark County, plus the southwestern corner of Pike Township of Clark County and part of the eastern side of Bethel Township of Miami County. The school thereby serves residents of the city of New Carlisle, the village of Donnelsville, the unincorporated communities of Medway, Park Layne, and Crystal Lakes, plus adjacent rural land. Mission statement According to the district web site, ‚ÄúThe mission of Tecumseh High School is to provide diverse educational opportunities for students from all backgrounds and with all levels of ability. Tecumseh High School, in partnership with the community, strives to provide a safe, challenging learning environment to help each student become a responsible, well-rounded lifelong learner in an ever-changing technological society.‚Ä≥ History Olive Branch High School In March 1952, Tecumseh High School's initial construction was completed. The high school replaced New Carlisle High School (in the city of New Carlisle proper since 1921), and Olive Branch High School. In 1969 an expansion was built and contained more classrooms, auditorium, and a second gymnasium. At the end of the 1980‚Äì1981 school year neighboring Oscar T. Hawke elementary school closed and the building became part of the Tecumseh High School campus at the beginning of the 1981‚Äì1982 school year. This was part of a major re-organization of the school district which included the closing of McAdams Elementary, and New Carlisle Elementary which had occupied the original New Carlisle High School. Also at that time ninth grade was moved from the junior high schools to the high school creating a four-year high school program. Additionally, sixth grade was moved from the elementary schools to the junior high buildings and the junior highs were changed to the middle school format of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. In late May 1989 a mild tornado flew over the school and did some roof damage to the Hawke building. This caused school to be closed for one day and finals for the classes housed in that building had to be moved to the main school building. In the mid-2000s, all Tecumseh district schools were completely rebuilt. In 2007, as part of this project, the high school's old buildings, with the exception of the field house and auditorium, were demolished and replaced with new facilities.

The following year, Mary, her sister Leila and her mother went to California via the Isthmus of Panama to join her father and settled in San Francisco. Her father was a professional engraver and taught both his daughters to draw and engrave. At age 18, Mary went to New York City and attended Cooper Union for two years. She returned to San Francisco and attended the School of Design. In 1869, she married Thomas Richardson who came to San Francisco from Canada and was in the lumber business. He died in 1913. Mary and her sister Leila established a wood engraving studio. Mary dabbled in painting, but friends encouraged her to seriously take up painting full-time. An impressionist, she painted landscapes but is probably best known for her portrait paintings with a mother-and-child theme. One of her highly praised paintings, \\"The Sleeping Child\\" was eventually acquired by the Legion of Honor. Another child subject, \\"The Young Mother\\" won a silver medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915).

Charles Alfred Worsley Pelham, 4th Earl of Yarborough (11 June 1859 - 12 July 1936), styled Lord Worsley until 1875, was a British peer and politician. Between 1890 and 1892, he served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, meaning as Chief Whip in the House of Lords, for the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury. Background and education Pelham was the eldest son of Charles Anderson-Pelham, 3rd Earl of Yarborough, and his wife, Lady Victoria Alexandrina Hare, daughter of William Hare, 2nd Earl of Listowel. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He originally used the surname Anderson-Pelham, but assumed by Royal licence the surname of Pelham only in 1905. Political career When Yarborough inherited his father's titles in 1875, he took up his seat in the Lords as a Liberal but later became a Conservative over Irish Home Rule. In 1890 he was admitted to the Privy Council and made Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at- Arms under Lord Salisbury, a post he held until 1892. During the Second Anglo- Boer War a new regiment was formed as the Lincolnshire Imperial Yeomanry, of which Yarborough was appointed Lieutenant-colonel in June 1901 After the war it became a permanent unit as the Lincolnshire Yeomanry.

Early life Daniel was a Texas state politician, born in Austin on June 8, 1941, into a political dynasty that dated back to his great-great-great grandparents Sam Houston and Margaret Lea Houston. At the time of his birth, his father Marion Price Daniel Sr. was a state representative who eventually rose to the office of Governor of Texas. Daniel Sr. also served as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, as United States Senator and Associate Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. His mother Jean Houston Baldwin, a member of both the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and the Daughters of the American Revolution, was a direct descendant of Sam and Margaret Lea Houston. Daniel Sr.'s brother William Partlow Daniel, also served in the Texas House of Representatives and had been appointed Governor of the U.S. Territory of Guam by President John F. Kennedy. He was raised in Austin and followed the political career of his father. By age twelve, he was making speeches on his father's behalf. He graduated from Austin High School in 1959, Baylor University in 1964, and Baylor Law School in 1966. While still enrolled in the university, Daniel started a mail-order book business Texas State Historical Association that specialized in rare books of Texas history. Political career After receiving his law degree, Daniel moved to Liberty, Texas, and began his legal practice there, where he was also elected Justice of the Peace for Liberty County. In 1968, at age 27, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from the same seat his father had held from 1939 to 1945. After the fallout from the Sharpstown scandal, with those connected being voted out of office, there was a 50% turnover in both houses of the Texas Legislature. On January 9, 1973, Price Jr. was unanimously elected Speaker of the House. Under Daniel's leadership, the reform-minded Sixty-third Texas Legislature passed new ethics, financial disclosure, and open-records laws. The Legislature also updated and strengthened open-meetings, and lobbying laws. He believed that it should be illegal for the speaker to offer favors or make threats in order to get votes. Because of the great power of the office, Daniel believed that no speaker should be elected for more than one term, and consequently he did not seek reelection in 1974. There had been talk of Price Jr. running for Governor in 1974, but he was apparently not interested. Price Jr. served as president of the 1974 Texas Constitutional Convention, the first since the Constitution was established in 1876.; He relented on a right-to-work compromise to appease the conservatives, and in doing so, lost his base of the liberal labor force. The 1974 convention to revise the state constitution was not a success. Further alienating his support base, Price Jr held a press conference blaming organized labor, and specifically what he saw as its manipulation of racial minority delegates, for the convention's failure. In 1978, Daniel unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Texas Attorney General, losing to eventual general election winner Mark White. Personal life and death Daniel was married twice. He married politically connected Diane Ford Wommack on April 4, 1966. Diane was a descendant of Texas Governor (1907‚Äì1911) Thomas Mitchell Campbell. Diane gave birth to his son Thomas Houston Campbell Daniel. Their divorce was final November 26, 1975. His second wife was Dairy Queen waitress Vickie Loretha Carroll Moore. Vickie and husband Larry Dale Moore were divorced on August 16, 1976. Price and Vickie were married November 1, 1976. Vickie gave birth to two sons by Price, Franklin Baldwin Daniel and Marion Price Daniel, IV. One month after Price declared his candidacy for Texas Attorney General, Vickie filed for divorce on October 22, 1977, but apparently withdrew the petition. In May 1980, Price re-wrote his will, cutting Vickie out. December 31 of that year, Vickie once again filed for divorce, even though she and Price continued to share a house with separate quarters. Price was served with divorce papers on January 15, 1981. On January 19, Price returned home where he was allegedly shot and killed by Vickie. After a 10-hour session involving 22 people, the Liberty County grand jury returned an indictment of murder against Mrs. Daniel. At the time of her indictment, she had not yet been questioned by authorities about the events leading up to her husband's death, nor had she testified before the grand jury. Vickie was represented by flamboyant legal legend Richard \\"Racehorse\\" Haynes and was acquitted on October 30, 1981. The shooting and Vickie Daniel's murder trial were the subject of a 1987 book, Deadly Blessings and a 1992 made-for-television film, Bed of Lies. =Houston family tree= Marion Price Daniel Jr. was a direct descendant of Sam Houston and his wife Margaret Lea Houston through his mother Jean Houston Baldwin Daniel, as noted by the family tree below.

For fifty-three years, he was editorial executive and owner of The Atlanta Constitution. Early years and education Clark Howell was born on September 21, 1863, in Erwinton, in Edgefield County, South Carolina, to Julia A. Erwin and Evan P. Howell. During the American Civil War his mother was in South Carolina while his father, Captain Evan Howell, served in the infantry and commanded a Confederate artillery battery. After the war, Howell's father moved the family to Atlanta where the senior Howell cut and sold timber from family land. Two years later, Evan Howell found employment as a reporter and city editor for the Atlanta Intelligencer. In 1876, Evan Howell bought a half interest in the Atlanta Constitution from Col. E.Y. Clarke. The other half interest was owned by William A. Hemphill, future mayor of Atlanta, who retained his half ownership interest and his position as the paper's business manager until 1901. Clark Howell attended the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society as well as an early member of the Gamma chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order, and graduated with an A.B. degree in 1883. =Career in journalism= Directly after graduating from college, Howell moved to New York City and began working as a reporter for The New York Times then worked as the night telegraph editor of the Philadelphia Press. In 1884 he returned to Atlanta and worked as a reporter and night editor at his father's newspaper, the Atlanta Constitution. His father was editor-in-chief. After managing editor Henry W. Grady died in 1889, the younger Howell took over that position. He eventually succeeded his father as editor-in-chief in 1897, upon the elder Howell's retirement. In 1901, Clark Howell purchased controlling shares in the Constitution, from Hemphill, to become its new owner. Howell remained owner and editor of the paper until his death in 1936. Political service and Pulitzer Prize Starting in 1886, Howell was elected to three terms in the Georgia House of Representatives, serving as Speaker for one term. In 1897, he was elected to the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and served for one year. In 1900, he was elected one of the original directors of the Associated Press, a position he maintained the rest of his life. Also in 1900 he was elected to the Georgia Senate where he served consecutive two-years terms and was the President of that body during the latter term. Following that he was defeated in the contentious 1906 Democratic Georgia gubernatorial race won by Hoke Smith, owner of the rival Atlanta Journal newspaper. Even though Howell was a lifelong Democrat, President Warren G. Harding placed him on a special mining commission in 1922 and ten years later President Hoover appointed him to a national transportation commission. He served as Georgia's state Democratic committeeman from 1896 to 1924 and again starting in June 1936 where he succeeded Governor Eugene Talmadge.Associated Press, November 14, 1936. The Constitution won the 1931 Pulitzer Prize for Howell's series exposing the Atlanta graft ring which led to six indictments and the downfall of Mayor I. N. Ragsdale's political career. In 1934, President Roosevelt named him to chair the Federal Aviation Commission in the wake of the Air Mail scandal and appointed him chairman of a commission to study aviation in foreign countries. The French government made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1935. Radio In late July 1923, Howell arranged for the donation to Georgia Tech of equipment previously used by the Atlanta Constitution's radio station, WGM, which was used to help launch WBBF (later WGST, now WGKA AM 920) in January 1924.\\"Tech Sends First Message To Radio Fans of America\\" by Parks Rusk, Atlanta Constitution, January 15, 1924, page 1. Operating as a commercial station with educational opportunities for students, the radio station was officially owned by the Board of Regents. After several lawsuits, the station was sold to a private corporation in 1974. (In 1968 the school established an educational FM station, WREK.) A freshman residence hall at Georgia Tech, Howell Hall, as well as an academic building at his alma mater, Clark Howell Hall, are named in his honor. Death When Clark Howell died, on November 14, 1936, in Atlanta, he was the president and editor of the Atlanta Constitution and a director of the Associated Press.

Co- founded by Alex Vasilevsky,http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high- tech/2010/08/virtual-computer-co-founder-cto-vasilevsky.html?page=all Virtual Iron figured among the first companies to offer virtualization software to fully support Intel VT-x and AMD-V hardware-assisted virtualization. Oracle Corporation agreed to acquire Virtual Iron Software, Inc., subject to customary closing conditions. Oracle now declines to offer any updates or patches for current customers, even updates and patches developed before the purchase. On June 19, 2009, The Register reported that Oracle had killed the Virtual Iron product.  The Virtual Iron platform  Virtual Iron software ran unmodified 32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems with near-native performance. A virtualization manager offered access to control, automate, modify and monitor virtual resources. Virtualization services were automatically deployed on supported hardware without additional software. The platform was based on the open source Xen hypervisor. Virtual Iron, like other virtualization software, provided server consolidation, business continuity and capacity management. The Virtual Iron platform consisted of a virtualization manager, virtualization servers and a hypervisor. The virtualization manager (VI-Center), a Java-based application, allowed for central management of the virtualized servers. A physical server could have many virtualized servers, which ran as unmodified guest operating systems. Virtual Iron could use both physical-storage or virtual-storage access models. However, the use of a virtual-storage access model leveraged SAN storage to create a fault-tolerant iSCSI or Fibre Channel based cluster of virtual nodes. The VI Center installed on both Windows and Linux. After installation, the administrator had to configure a \\"management network\\" for the purpose of communicating with nodes in the cluster. The VI Center used the management network to PXE boot any server that was connected and correctly configured (for PXE boot). The included LiveRecovery tool could configure high availability. Additionally, CPU or power-consumption load-balancing was configurable using the LiveCapacity or LivePower tools respectively. Additional features included disk and virtual machine cloning (snapshots), IPMI/ILO support, etc.  \\"Native virtualization\\"  Virtual Iron had implemented full virtualization (requiring hardware-assisted virtualization which it called native virtualization) over paravirtualization. Native virtualization allowed for unmodified guest operating systems and had the advantage of hardware advances for better performance. Virtual Iron, Inc claimed to have pioneered the implementation of native virtualization. Virtual Iron discussed paravirtualization and native virtualization in its blog: > Virtual Iron has decided against paravirtualization in favor of \\"native > virtualization.\\" With hardware advances coming out of Intel and AMD, we see > native virtualization capable of matching physical hardware performance > without any of the complexity and engineering efforts involved in > paravirtualizing an OS. From our discussions with a broad range of users, > they simply do not want to roll out modified OSs unless the trade-off is > heavily in their favor. This Faustian trade-off is no longer necessary.

It is on Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register due to erosion, structural problems and vandalism. It was built as a motte and bailey castle in the 12th century by Hugh de Hardreshull in 1125. Robert de Hartshill was killed alongside Simon de Montfort in the Battle of Evesham in 1265 and the castle fell into disuse. In 1330, it was rebuilt by John de Hardreshull. In Tudor times a timber-framed manor house was built into the corner. Now all that remains of the house is a chimney. The earthworks of the castle and remains of the house are still present. The site is privately owned. In Tudor times after the Battle of Bosworth, King Henry VII is believed to have stayed at the property. No other place in Warwickshire has such evidence of continuous habitation since earliest times as this Hartshill/Oldbury Ridge. Stone Age tribes lived here in 10,000 B.C. They were nomads, not travelling far, but wandering, always returning to this area for flints which they needed for tools and weapons. They found them in the boulder clay at the foot of Hartshill Ridge, near the River Anker. Remains of Stone Age flints and bones of Red Deer and Woolly rhinoceroses have been found in sand and gravel near to the river at Witherly. So over centuries Stone Age and Bronze Age people, Romans, Saxons, Danes and Normans all stamped a way of life on this area. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 Hartshill is known as Ardreshill. Thirteen families lived here at a time when tracks through the forest were deep and difficult to find. Hugh De Hardreshill was given the manor in 1125. It was he who built the first defensive system: a motte and bailey (a mound and enclosed yard) here on this castle site, overlooking Atherstone. The walls were made of wood and on top of the motte was a wooden tower which was home to the Lord of the Manor and his family, as well as being a look-out post. The first stone building at the castle was the chapel, built in the 13th century. Little of this remains above the ground. A hundred years later the wooden palisades of the bailey were replaced by stone walls 4 feet thick and 15 feet high, pierced with cross-loops in sandstone. A section of water-filled moat remains on the west side. The north door survives and there are traces of the west door, but no indication above ground of the main entrance which would have been on the south side. It is likely that there would have been a tower in the south-west corner. A later Tudor house was built into the north-east corner about 1560, but of this only the south-east chimney stack remains. The rest of the house, with its timber frame and wattle and daub walls, was demolished in the 1950s.

In addition, it permits borrowers to challenge unfair debtor-creditor relationships in court. Consumer Credit Act 1974 The 2006 Act brings two further types of agreement under the scope of the 1974 Act: *Consumer agreements above ¬£25,000, to reflect growing levels of consumer borrowing and debt; *In section 1, to include small, one-man businesses and partnerships of up to three people. Ombudsman scheme The 2006 Act gives consumers the option of using the Financial Ombudsman Service if they are unhappy with their lender's dispute resolution service, whether the lender consents or not. Complaints may also be raised against other types of credit related companies, such as debt-collection agencies. Office of Fair Trading The 2006 Act empowers the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate applicants for consumer credit licences, to impose conditions on licences, and to impose civil penalties of up to ¬£50,000 on companies, or ¬£5,000 on individuals, failing to comply with its conditions.

Mining career Gallagher was born in Seaham in the mining area of County Durham, and attended St Mary Magdalene Junior School and St Joseph's Secondary Modern School in the town. He himself became a miner on leaving school; he was employed in the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Education He was a member of the National Union of Mineworkers and was a Branch Official of the Union from 1967 to 1970. Through the auspices of the Union he went on a day release course at the University of Nottingham from 1967 to 1969. He then obtained a Trade Union Congress scholarship to the University of Wales from 1970 to 1972 and to the University of Nottingham (Workers Educational Association section) from 1972 to 1974. Politics Active in the Labour Party, in 1970 Gallagher was elected to Mansfield Borough Council, and in 1973 to Nottinghamshire County Council. He fought Rushcliffe at the February 1974 general election. As a supporter of British membership of the European Communities, Gallagher became interested in membership of the European Parliament at the first direct elections; he was sponsored by the NUM and in the 1979 elections he was elected as Labour MEP for Nottingham with a very small majority. European Parliament He used his position at the European Parliament to call for more development of the mining industry. However, the change of policy of the Labour Party in the early 1980s led to his increasing disillusionment with the state of politics. In December 1983 Gallagher resigned from the Labour Party, and on 5 January 1984 he joined the Social Democratic Party. He described the Labour group of MEPs at the time as \\"really two groups of people who don't see eye to eye on anything\\". The Nottingham constituency was subject to boundary changes at the 1984 elections, and Gallagher chose to abandon it and seek re- election as an SDP candidate in Lancashire Central. This was not a target seat for the SDP and Gallagher came third in the poll. Subsequent career Gallagher then went into business. He was a Director of Simple Solutions 4 U, a business management and website marketing company based in the East Midlands. He died in June 2015, aged 80.

The theory stipulates three necessary conditions for most crime; a likely offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian, coming together in time and space. The lack of any of the three elements is sufficient to prevent a crime which requires offender-victim contact. Routine activity theory is a sub-field of crime opportunity theory that focuses on situations of crimes. It was first proposed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence E. Cohen in their explanation of crime rate changes in the United States between 1947 and 1974. The theory has been extensively applied and has become one of the most cited theories in criminology. Unlike criminological theories of criminality, routine activity theory studies crime as an event, closely relates crime to its environment and emphasizes its ecological process, thereby diverting academic attention away from mere offenders. The premise of routine activity theory is that crime is relatively unaffected by social causes such as poverty, inequality, and unemployment. For instance, after World War II, the economy of Western countries started to boom and the Welfare states were expanding. Despite this, crime rose significantly during this time. According to Felson and Cohen, the reason for the increase is that the prosperity of contemporary society offers more opportunities for crime to occur. For example, the use of automobiles, on one hand, enables offenders to move more freely to conduct their violations and, on the other hand, provide more targets for theft. Other social changes such as college enrollment, female labor participation, urbanization, suburbanization, and lifestyles all contribute to the supply of opportunities and, subsequently, the occurrence of crime. Routine activity theory has its foundation in human ecology and rational choice theory. Over time, the theory has been extensively employed to study sexual crimes, robberies, cyber crimes, residential burglary and corresponding victimizations, among others. It is also worth noting that, in the study of criminal victimization, the routine activity theory is often regarded as \\"essentially similar\\" to lifestyle theory of criminology by . More recently, routine activity theory has been repeatedly used in multilevel frameworks with social disorganization theory in understanding various neighborhood crimes. Theoretical framework In routine activity theory, crime is likely to occur when three essential elements of crime converge in space and time: a motivated offender, an attractive target, and the absence of capable guardianship. The analytic focus of routine activity theory takes a macro-level view and emphasizes broad-scale shifts in the patterns of victim and offender behavior. It focuses on specific crime events and offender behavior/decisions. Routine activity theory is based on the assumption that crime can be committed by anyone who has the opportunity. The theory also states that victims are given choices on whether to be victims mainly by not placing themselves in situations where a crime can be committed against them. =Motivated offender= Motivated offenders are individuals who are not only capable of committing criminal activity, but are willing to do so. This element that has received the most criticism due to the lack of information regarding what it truly is. A motivated offender can be pointed out as any type of person who has true intent to commit a crime against an individual or property. However, the motivated offender has to be someone who is able to commit the crime, or, in other words, has everything he or she needs to commit a crime, physically, and mentally. =Suitable target= A suitable target is any type of individual or property that the motivated offender can damage or threaten in the easiest way possible. If a target is suitable, this means that there is a greater chance that the crime can be committed, rather than, a target that is hard to achieve. The acronym VIVA provides four different attributes of what makes a target actually suitable, in the judgement of the offender. The acronym goes as follows: : V: Value (The value of achieving the target, in a real or symbolic manner) : I: Inertia (The physical obstacles of the target: weight, height, strength, etc.) : V: Visibility (The attribute of exposure which solidifies the suitability of the target) : A: Access (The placement of the individual, or object, that increases, or lessens, the potential risk of the intended attack) Suitable targets can be a person or object that are seen by offenders as vulnerable or particularly attractive. The factors that render a particular target attractive are situational and crime specific. =Absence of a suitable guardian= Guardianship can be a person or an object that is effective in deterring offense to occur and sometimes crime is stopped by simple presence of guardianship in space and time. Empirical evidence Criminologist , using \\"domain-specific\\" models, demonstrates that occupation-related activities generally have a stronger impact on the risk of victimization at work than sociodemographic characteristics. The specific attributes of activities pursued at work exposure, guardianship, attractiveness‚Äîwere all related to victimization in ways predicted by activity theory. These findings identify specific attributes of occupations that could be modified to reduce the risk of criminal victimization at work. Victimization of workers at work will decline if mobility, public accessibility, and handling of money as part of the occupational role are reduced. In A Routine Activity Theory Explanation for Women's Stalking Victimizations, criminologists conducted a self- administered study in the third quarter of 1996 to 861 college or university female students from nine postsecondary institutes from eight states of the US. The study reveals that women's victimization risk of stalking can be explained by individual lifestyle behaviors, including employment, location of residence, substance use (drug and alcohol) and self-protection. establishes that those who live alone are more likely to be out alone and to have little help in guarding their property, they probably face higher rates of victimization for both personal and property crimes. The 30.6% increase in employed and married female‚Äôs participation rates not only subjects these women to greater risk of attack on their way to and from work, but also leaves their home and car less guarded from illegal entry. The 118% increase in the proportion of the population consisting of female college students places more women at risk of attack when carrying out daily activities as students, since they may be less effectively protected by family or friends. using a sample of 922 adults in Florida show that one's online routine activities, shaped by one's sociodemographic characteristics, strongly shape the person's risk of falling victim of Internet fraud. Their findings clearly shed light on the validity of routine activities theory on crimes that targeted Internet users. Using university computer attack data, reveal evidence supporting routine activity theory. They find that the risk of computer attacks increases during university official business hours and that foreign-origin attacks are substantially attributed to the number of foreign network users. Criticisms Routine activity theory is mainly a macro theory of crime and victimization. It requires motivated offenders, but does not explain how such offenders become motivated.

Kallada River Is Also Known As Punalurar This River is formed by three Rivers, viz., Kulathupuzha, Chendurni and Kalthuruthy which join near Parappar in Thenmala by the side of the Trivandrum-Shencottah road. It travels for 121 km, flowing through Punalur, Pathanapuram, Kunnathur,Kulakada Pavithreswaram (Puthoor)and Kallada before ending at Ashtamudi Lake. The Palaruvi Falls also feeds Kallada river. The Chalikkari Aar also joins Kallada a little downstream. These two rivers flows westward and falls into the Ashtamudi Lake. River Course For a good part of its initial course, the river flows in parallel with the Kollam - Shenkottai commercial highway. At Punalur, a Suspension Bridge was constructed across this by the Travancore Maharaja in British Style. This is still preserved as an archeological marvel. The end point of this river is the Ashtamudi Kayal. The river bed is usually rocky and it is difficult to swim and play in such as river. There are huge rocks, deep pits and other obstructions in the river. In modern times, the Thenmala dam is built on this river. This is an irrigation dam mainly aimed at providing water to the downstream regions throughout the year. Kallada Boat Race (The Kallada Jalotsavam) is one of the most famous boat races held in South Kerala, India. The boat race is an annual event which happens 28 days after Onam (28 aam Onam). Almost all the famous snake boats (Chundanvallam) take part in this event. This boat race is held on the Muthiraparambu-Karuvathrakadavu course of the Kallada River. This year it will be conducted on 23 September. Sasthamkottah lake is the largest fresh water lake in kerala and provides drinking water for most of the places in Kollam district. Except for an earthen embankment of 1.5 km length which separates the lake from the paddy fields on its southern side, bordering the alluvial plains of the Kallada River, all other sides of the lake are surrounded by hills which are steep and form narrow valleys. Sooranad, Chakkuvally, Kunnathur, Mynagappally, Poruvazhy, West Kallada, Karunagappally, East Kallada are the important places in and around Sasthamcotta. Kallada river has a place in history along with other major rivers. It is believed that Paleolithic people lived around this river in the Thenmala region. This was around 10,000 years ago. Later, the \\"Ay\\" kingdom also flourished in or around this region.kallada is a river whose serenity lies in its stillness,the pythonic pace with which it embraces the muddy riversides.Emanate from here are the rustic simplicity and emotionality of village populaces, west kallada and east kallada. Untouched by the onslaught of administrative modernization, there are many areas in both villages. Uppoodu (of east kallada), ullurup (of west kallada) are a few to name. The virtues of the word called \\"kinship\\",define itself here better than anywhere else.these words are attempted for nothing,but to eulogise the umblical relation between the river kallada and the unique life of rustic magnanimity,which it had given birth to Industries along the river There were many industries flourishing on the banks of Kallada river during the British Period. Punalur Paper Mills, established in 1875, is one of such major companies which operates near the banks of this river. The effluents discharged from the mills into Kallada river was found to alter the physiochemical factors and production of plankton in the mid-1900s. The mill was embroiled in a labour dispute, and was closed in 1987. After the resolution of legal issues, it was reopened in 2015.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/punalur-paper-mills- reopened/article7647502.ece Sand mining is a cause of concern along the banks of this river, because it makes the banks more vulnerable to erosion and floods. Kallada Irrigation Project Kallada irrigation and Tree crop Development project is the largest irrigation project in Kerala. The command area of this project is distributed over Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha district and covers Punalur, Pathanapuram, Kottarakkara, Kollam, Kunnathur, Karunagappally, Adoor, Mavelikkara and Karthikappally Taluks. The project was planned to irrigate net cultivable command area of 61630 Ha. During the course of execution few canals including Kayamkulam Branch canal were dropped and now this project is benefited for a net cultivable command area of 53514 Ha in 92 villages.

It is located between Narok and Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The northwestern part of Mount Suswa is in Narok County, while the eastern and southern part are in Kajiado County. The town with the same name, Suswa, is just northwest of the mountain and it is the main access point for visits to the mountain. Physical features Mount Suswa has a unique double crater with a moat-like inner crater surrounding a tilted block of rock. The mountain is also known for its lava tubes on the northeast side of the outer crater. Satellite image of Mount Suswa Flora and Fauna The inner crater is home to a variety of snakes species. Other wildlife of interest found on or near Mount Suswa includes zebras, giraffes, mongooses, turtles, hyenas and leopards. Mountaineering and Tourism It is possible to drive up the lesser-end of the mountain into the outer crater with a four-wheel-drive vehicle or motorbike; however, there are numerous barricades across the trail where local Masaai try to collect a fee for allowing you through. Arrangements can be made to pay a set fee and get a guide to take you past the barricades. It is also possible to climb the mountain, which has a 2,356-meter summit. There are no specified paths, but Mount Suswa is best accessed from the mountain from the north and northeast. The Suswa Primary school, located at the base of the mountain, is another practical starting point. Also, there are many Masaai homesteads surrounding the base of the mountain; it is recommended to introduce yourself to the head of the family if your route crosses such. With the exception of Rauch's Trail, there are no designated pathways to the summit. However, the Masaai do graze cattle on the mountain's grasslands, making for the occasional route. The peak can be reached on foot by following Rauch's Trail, which begins approximately one-and-a-half kilometers from the summit, from the northeast. Rauch's Trail is marked with a wooden sign, overlooking the crater. The network of lava caves on the east side of the mountain can also be visited and some of these caves are inhabited by baboons. The BBC documentary 'The Great Rift: Africa's Wild Heart', shows baboons entering one of these caves to seek shelter from leopard; this underground chamber in the rocks has been nicknamed 'baboon parliament'.

Based on the 1968 film Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell, it focuses on an Italian woman who has raised her teenaged daughter Gia to believe her father was an American who died heroically in World War II. Supposedly she spurns the constant advances of local caf√© owner Vittorio because her heart still belongs to the man she tragically lost. In reality, she had affairs with three different GIs and has no idea who fathered the girl. Trouble ensues when the three veterans decide to reunite in Carmelina's small hometown. After eleven previews, the Broadway production, directed by Jos√© Ferrer and choreographed by Peter Gennaro, opened on April 8, 1979 at the St. James Theatre, where it ran for only seventeen performances. The cast included Georgia Brown, Cesare Siepi, Grace Keagy, John Michael King, and Josie de Guzman. A nomination for Best Original Score was its sole recognition from the Tony Awards committee. A cast recording was released in 1980 on the Original Cast label, which specialises in preserving musicals that might not otherwise be recorded. Co-produced by Bruce and Doris Yeko, the LP was made with the participation of original Broadway cast members Georgia Brown, Josie de Guzman, Grace Keagy, Gordon Ramsey and Howard Ross.

Its history dates back to June 15, 1869, when Baron Gustave de Rothschild paid the Duchesse de Bauffremont 2,700,000 francs for two town houses, at 21 Avenue Marigny and 14 Rue du Cirque, with a total floorspace of approximately . In 1872, the Baron decided to combine the two buildings into a single property and to erect additional buildings on part of the site. On May 17, 1879, he acquired the town house at 13 Avenue Marigny. Extensive work was carried out on the site from 1873 onwards, lasting for nearly 10 years, under the direction of the Baron's architect, Alfred- Philibert Aldrophe. Today, the H√¥tel Marigny comprises a main building with one two-story wing at right angles, standing above a vast basement area for the domestic services.

He boycotted the Guantanamo Military Commissions, arguing that there was no legal basis for the military tribunals to judge him. He was convicted in November 2008 of performing media relations for the Saudi Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda, and sentenced to life imprisonment, after a jury of nine military officers deliberated for less than an hour.\\"Guantanamo Jury jails bin Laden media chief for life\\", The Guardian, 4 November 2008 The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned most of his convictions on January 25, 2013. In October 2016, a divided D.C. Circuit affirmed Bahlul's final remaining conviction, which was for criminal conspiracy. In October 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Bahlul's petition for a writ of certiorari. Background Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts describe Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al Bahlul as al Qaeda's public relations director. He is alleged to have created propaganda videos glorifying attacks against the United States. He set up a satellite receiver for Osama bin Laden, the leader of the terrorist organization, to listen to live radio coverage of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, which al Qaida caused. He faced charges before the first Guantanamo military commissions, before the United States Supreme Court ruled that they were unconstitutional under existing executive authority. In 2004, he was held in solitary confinement. Official status reviews Following the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in Rasul v. Bush the Department of Defense was instructed to set up a system where Guantanamo captives would be informed as to why they were being held. The DoD set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants (OARDEC). OARDEC conducted annual reviews from 2004 to 2008. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al Bahlul was listed as one of the captives who: * had faced charges before a military commission. * the military alleges were members of either al Qaeda or the Taliban and associated with the other group. * \\"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\\" * \\"The military alleges that the following detainees stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.\\" * \\"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\\" * \\"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\\" * \\"The military alleges ... served on Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs security detail.\\" * was a member of the \\"al Qaeda leadership cadre\\". * is \\"currently at Guant√°namo who have been charged before military commissions and are alleged Al Qaeda leaders.\\" * is one of \\"36 [captives who] openly admit either membership or significant association with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or some other group the government considers militarily hostile to the United States.\\" * is one of the captives who had admitted \\"being [an] Al Qaeda leader.\\" Charged before a military commission Attorney David Frakt. The original ten Presidentially authorized military commissions were convened in the former terminal building in the discontinued airfield on the Guantanamo Naval Base's Eastern Peninsula. Bahlul faced charges before a Guantanamo military commission prior to the United States Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006) that the Bush Presidency lacked the constitutional authority to create military commissions that, without adequate justification, substantially deviated from the rules of procedure and evidence applicable at U.S. courts-martial. He was indicted along with Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi. Lieutenant Commander Philip Sundel, his first military defense attorney, described the difficulty in getting a security clearance for a translator to talk to his client. Sundel told CBS News: \\"There's virtually no chance he can get a fair trial.\\" Bahlul asked Peter Brownback, the president of the commissions, if he could represent himself. Al Bahlul and the question of whether detainees should be able to represent themselves were featured in the October 2007 issue of the Yale Law Journal in an article by Matthew Bloom entitled: \\"'I Did Not Come Here To Defend Myself': Responding to War on Terror Detainees' Attempts To Dismiss Counsel and Boycott the Trial\\". His most recent military lawyer is Major Thomas Fleener.Guantanamo trials to start, Special Broadcasting Service, January 11, 2006 After the Supreme Court ruling, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, to authorize military commissions at Guantanamo to hear and judge detainee cases. On February 9, 2008, Bahlul and Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud Al Qosi were charged before military commissions. Carol Rosenberg of the Miami Herald, reported that Bahlul would be allowed to represent himself before the newly authorized military commissions, although he was not previously allowed to do so before the Presidentially authorized commissions. David McFadden of the Associated Press reported that only three reporters covered Bahlul's trial, associated with the Miami Herald, the Associated Press, and Reuters. The new law authorized detainees to represent themselves by choice. =Testimony of members of the \\"Buffalo Six\\"= In late October 2008, three of the men from the group known as the \\"Buffalo Six\\" testified at Bahlul's Guantanamo military commissions. They testified on having been shown a two-hour video that Bahlul produced. =Conviction= On November 3, 2008, Bahlul was convicted of conspiring with al-Qaeda, soliciting murder and providing material support for terrorism. At his sentencing, he admitted he was a member of al-Qaeda, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Through a translator, Bahlul said, \\"We will fight government that governs America, We are the only ones on Earth who stand against you.\\" =Isolation from the other captives= Rosenberg has reported that, following his conviction, Al Bahlul was separated from the other captives. She said that the Department of Defense (DOD) justified the isolation because the \\"Geneva Conventions ... forbids convicts from being held with war prisoners.\\" The government insists that it can detain Bahlul indefinitely, although without a conviction he may be moved out of isolation. =Appeal= Rosenberg in the Miami Herald reported that Bahlul's military defense attorneys filed a 50-page appeal of his sentence on grounds of free speech. The appeal was the second filed with the Court for Military Commission Review. Bahlul had boycotted his military commission, so no defense was mounted. He also refused to participate in the appeal. Rosenberg reported that the Obama Presidency has proposed a change to the process of appeals of the rulings and verdicts of military commissions. The proposed changes would have such appeals first heard by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which Rosenberg noted was a 58-year-old institution. In the current process, there is no appeal to rulings of the Court of Military Commission Review. Under the proposed changes, appeals could be taken up to the United States Supreme Court. Jane Sutton, reporting for Reuters, wrote that when Al Bahlul's conviction was overturned it implied the highest profile trials, those against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and four other conspirators, also seemed more likely to face similar challenges. Al Bahlul's was the second of the seven Guantanamo convictions to be overturned, so far. Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who had only been convicted of \\"providing material support for terrorism\\" had his conviction overturned in 2012. Three of the other five individuals to be convicted had also only been convicted of \\"providing material support for terrorism\\". In July 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc vacated Bahlul's material support and solicitation convictions as unconstitutional under the ex post facto clause.Recent Cases, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 2040, citing Al Bahlul v. United States, 767 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2014). A panel of the D.C. Circuit vacated Bahlul's remaining conspiracy conviction in June 2015. Judge Judith W. Rogers, joined by David S. Tatel, found that conspiracy is not a crime under the international law of war, with Judge Karen L. Henderson writing a forceful 85-page dissent. On September 25, 2015, the D.C. Circuit vacated its June judgment and granted the Government's petition for rehearing en banc. The Circuit specifically directed the rehearing would consider the standard of appellate review and as to if Congress's attempts to define and punish war crimes transgresses the Article III powers of courts. On October 20, 2016, the full D.C. Circuit voted 6-3 to affirm Bahlul's conspiracy conviction. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, wrote the four-judge plurality opinion for Judges Henderson, Janice Rogers Brown, and Thomas B. Griffith, finding that Congress can make crimes triable before military commissions even if those crimes are not internationally recognized war crimes. Judges Patricia Millett and Robert L. Wilkins, voted to affirm Bahlul's conviction but did not join the plurality's opinion, each writing that the case should be decided on more narrow grounds. Judge Rogers, joined by Judges Tatel and Nina Pillard dissented, writing that the plurality's broad reading was making ‚Äúroom for a new constitutional order.‚Äù One year later, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Bahlul's petition for a writ of certiorari without comment, with Justice Neil Gorsuch taking no part in considerations.

A major figure in thoroughbred horse racing, he was head of New York's Belmont Park and builder of Miami's Hialeah Park racetrack in Florida. Early life Widener was born in Philadelphia, the second son of the extremely wealthy transportation and real estate magnate Peter A. B. Widener (1834 - 1915) and Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836 - 1896). His older brother was George Dunton Widener. Joseph Widener attended Harvard University, and for a short time studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. Thoroughbred horse racing Joseph Widener used his great wealth to pursue his interest in Thoroughbred horse racing on a large scale. Not only did he become an owner of a large stable of racehorses, Widener acquired the Elmendorf Farm in Lexington, Kentucky and the Belmont Park racetrack in New York, plus he built Hialeah Park racetrack in Miami, Florida. In 1901, thirty- year-old Joseph Widener began purchasing Thoroughbred horses to compete in both flat racing and steeplechase events. He hired future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horse trainer, J. Howard Lewis. For the next four decades, they combined to race fourteen Champions, two in flat racing and twelve Steeplechase Champions. Widener's steeplechase horses won numerous important races including three editions of the American Grand National with Relluf (1914), Arc Light (1929), and Bushranger (1936). His steeplechasers Bushranger and Fairmount were both elected to the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. Following the death of August Belmont Jr., Joseph Widener and friends W. Averell Harriman and George Herbert Walker, purchased much of Belmont's Thoroughbred breeding stock. For his Elmendorf Farm breeding operation, Widener acquired Belmont's very important sire Fair Play and the broodmare Mahubah, the parents of Man o' War. He also purchased a son of Fair Play named Chance Shot who would go on to win the 1927 Belmont Stakes and following the 1929 death of Fair Play would become Elmendorf Farm's leading sire. Widener had a life-size statue of Fair Play erected by his grave at Elmendorf Farm. As part of the selloff of the August Belmont Jr. estate, in 1925 Joseph Widener also acquired majority control of Belmont Park in Elmont, New York and would serve as the race track's president until 1939 when failing health necessitated his stepping down. In 1930, he imported the stallion Sickle from Lord Derby in England who came to visit the U.S. that year and was Widener's guest at the 1930 Kentucky Derby. A son of the very important sire Phalaris, Sickle would produce 45 Graded stakes race winners and be the leading sire in North America in 1936 and 1938. Following Chance Shot's win in the 1927 Belmont Stakes, Widener's racing stable won the race two more times with Hurryoff in 1933 and with a son of Chance Shot in 1934 named Peace Chance. He also had five horses compete in the Kentucky Derby with his best finishes a second place earned by Osmand in 1927 and by Brevity in 1936. Joseph Widener's father had had business interests in France and like other wealthy elite Americans of that era, maintained a place in fashionable Paris. In addition to racing horses in the United States, Widener also kept a stable of Thoroughbreds in France. Competing in French grass racing, his horses won the 1923 and 1926 editions of the Prix La Rochette and the 1923, 1924, and 1937 runnings of the Prix d'Aumale. Widener also owned English Hackney horses who competed at various shows. Personal life He married Eleanor ‚Ä≥Ella‚Ä≥ Holmes Pancoast (1874‚Äì1929) with whom he had two children: *Peter Arrell Browne Widener II (b. 1895) *Josephine \\"Fifi\\" Pancoast Widener (b. 1902), who married Aksel Wichfeld.National Gallery of Art Joan Widener Leidy (1923‚Äì1988) was married from 1941 to 1950 to State Senator George Eustis Paine (1920‚Äì1991) Joseph Widener raised his family at Lynnewood Hall, his father's 110-room Georgian- style mansion in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. Designed by Horace Trumbauer and Jacques Greber, the mansion, along with its extensive and important art collection, was part of the huge fortune he inherited. In poor health for several years, Joseph Early Widener died at his Lynnewood Hall estate in 1943 and was interred in the Widener family mausoleum, Section K, Lot 338 at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. =Hialeah Park= In 1930, Joseph Widener built a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. where he would spend a good part of most winters. That same year, he purchased a controlling interest in the Miami Jockey Club and in 1931 renovated Hialeah Park. Hailed as one of the most beautiful Thoroughbred race tracks in the world, in 1979 Hialeah Park was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. Major races here were the Widener Handicap inaugurated in 1936, and the Flamingo Stakes, an important stepping stone to the Kentucky Derby for 3-year-old horses. Following Widener's death, ownership of the facility changed hands several times and after running into financial difficulties it closed in 2001. =Art collection= Joseph Widener added to the extensive and valuable art collection he had inherited from his father. His collection included a dozen or more works by Rembrandt as well as those by Johannes Vermeer, √âdouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. In 1939, Widener made a number of donations from his assorted collections including manuscripts of historical and artistic importance given to the Rare Book Department at the Free Library of Philadelphia. However, his most important philanthropic endeavor was as a founding benefactor of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. Widener's 1939 donation of a vast collection was announced by U. S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Gallery's opening ceremony. Known as the Widener Collection, the more than 2,000 sculptures, paintings, decorative art, and porcelains went on display in 1942.

One of Belize's major rivers, Monkey River has northern headwaters which originate in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the Swasey Branch drains the East Basin of that wildlife sanctuary. Further south, the Bladen Branch watercourse drains the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains including the ancient Mayan settlement areas of Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. These two watercourses join to form the Monkey River approximately 16 kilometres upstream from the mouth of the Monkey River. The Monkey River is readily navigated throughout the year using small boats, but navigation above the major confluence (of Bladen and Swasey Branches) becomes more difficult due to lack of depth when the dry season starts about February. Habitats in this watershed provide cover for such diverse species as the ocelot, jaguar, Guatemalan black howler, bare- throated tiger heron, Morelet's crocodile, fer-de-lance and manatee. Hydrology The Monkey River is one of six large watersheds in the 1 million acre (4,000 km2) Maya Mountain Marine Area Transect, which connects the Maya Mountains to the coastal waters of the Gulf of Honduras. According to The Nature Conservancy: \\"The Monkey River in southern Belize supports one of the most pristine coral reefs in Central America, which is part of the second largest barrier-reef system in the world.\\" Thus the water quality of the Monkey River supports not only freshwater species in the river's upper reaches and estuarine species in the lower reaches, but also the sensitive offshore Belize Barrier Reef. The Monkey River drains much of southern Belize through the Bladen (southern) Branch, which includes tributaries from a part of southern Guatemala and the southern slopes of the Maya Mountains in Belize, containing the ancient Mayan sites of Nim Li Punit and Lubaantun. The (northern) Swasey Branch of the Monkey River rises in the East Basin of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, a wilderness area set aside for jaguar preservation.Katherine M. Emmons et al., Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Producciones de la Hamaca, Belize and Orang-utan Press, Gays Mills, Wisconsin, USA (1996) During the rainy season, the Monkey River manifests considerable turbidity. Ecology Yellow bay cedar in Payne's Creek National Park, Belize The Monkey River has several important ecosystems including: (a) montane broadleaf primary forest; (b) upland coastal plain broadleaf secondary forest; (c) upper river freshwater riverine habitat; (d) lower reach estuarine and mangrove habitats; and (e) Caribbean Sea coral reef and turtle-grass marine habitat. This shallow marine environment is home to the endangered manatee. Each of these five discrete ecosystems contains important habitat for either terrestrial or aquatic species of southern Belize. The highest upland watershed area contains expansive forests, which are primary in the highest elevations and secondary in the lower foothills of the Maya Mountains. These montane areas provided an impenetrable protective backdrop for the ancient Mayan settlements here, preventing invasion from any tribes resident in Honduras or Guatemala. These forests have important lumber species such as mahogany and cedar trees and a broad panoply of other broadleaf tree species as well as numerous lianas. Fauna include the jaguar, margay, tapir and venomous pit viper Fer-de-lance, Bothrops asper. Along the middle and lower reaches, the forest is secondary, betraying the heritage of banana farms and slash-and-burn practises used historically in this area. Today much of this area is protected as the Payne's Creek National Park. Here, relatively dense jungle canopy has returned, resulting in a closed canopy of approximately 15 to 20 metres in height. Yellow bay cedar and other significant sized broadleaf species abound, along with numerous tropical vines and thorny undergrowth flora. A machete is essential for exploration even where there is an established trail. Black howler monkey troops are plentiful, each troop maintaining a home range of 40,000 to 70,000 square metres in this forest.Hydrology and ecology of the Monkey River watershed, southern Belize, Lumina Technologies Inc.

These small motorised boats typically stop at Monkey River Town for lunch and an exposure to the roadless native populace at that village. Most often the boat trips land at a location about ten kilometers upriver from the mouth to allow visitors a walk through the secondary growth forest.

On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42‚Äì45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a doctor blade and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby cr√™ping the paper. The crinkle (cr√™ping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.  Configuration  Whereas in other paper productions a series of drying cylinders is used, in tissue production only one cylinder (the yankee cylinder) dries the paper. This is due to the necessity of creping and made possible by the low grammage (gsm = gram per square meter) of the paper sheet for tissue products, which is in the range of 14-45 gsm. For the production of the higher gsm in this range, some machines are nevertheless provided with some (4-10) drying cylinders after the yankee. In this case one speaks of \\"wet creping\\", as the creping of the paper done on the yankee is not made on the fully dried paper and the completement of drying is accomplished after the yankee cylinder. Yankee cylinders are traditionally made of cast iron and have diameters up to 6 m, therefore much higher than conventional drying cylinders. The width is a bit larger than that of the paper: typical for tissue are paper machine widths 1,74m 2,32m and 2,70m and their multiples (usually nowadays the doubles of these values are typical). Therefore, yankees are very heavy (~100t) and difficult to cast. Since a couple of decades the production of yankees made of steel is gaining market and new machines are practically always nowadays equipped with a steel yankee, which is much lighter, easier to produce and to transport. Due to the abrasive effect of the creping blade the surface of the yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore, periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years) cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a metallisation, i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7‚Äì1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years. The thermal conductivity of the metallisation is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain, through thickness decrease, some conductivity which is then again lost with the metallisation. Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (ejector). In the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. \\"straw pipes\\" or \\"straws\\") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked by means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the condensate (separator). The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee. In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses motive steam (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee. Yankee safety is an important issue and TAPPI has a committee (Yankee Dryer Safety Committee) dedicated to it. The sharper problems are present with cast iron yankee, being this material much more brittle than steel, making the yankee very sensitive to temperature differences. For example, a yankee which is receiving steam while it is not rotating may be damaged by the temperature difference of the bulk to the bottom of the cylinder where the condensate is present. Particular attention shall be taken in case of fire, as direct jets of cold water on the surface of the hot yankee may damage it. Some cases of exploded yankees due to these and other reasons are unfortunately present in the history of tissue production. The usage of a chemical coating on the surface of the yankee is nowadays the rule. This is constituted by a mixture of usually 2 or more constituents: 1) a base polymer (adhesive) based on polyamides or epichlorhydrine resins which coats the surface of the yankee with a polymer layer in which the creping blade works, instead of scratching the iron surface. The base coating usually also has adhesive properties and keeps the paper attached to the yankee surface until creping 2) a release agent based on mineral or vegetable oil or waxes which lubricates and improved the detaching of the paper from the surface 3)various modifiers, which may make the coating more soft or hard or improve the protective effect on the yankee The coating is sprayed together with water in the space between the creping blade and the press through a spray bar with nozzles. Only the narrow space between this spray bar and the press is the one in which the water coming with the coating shall be evaporated and the polymer has to cure. For this reason for the base coating increasingly pre-cured polymers are used.

Dufour started playing guitar at the age of fifteen. He went on to study at the CEGEP in Joliette, where he listened to the music of Leo Kottke, Don Ross, and Michael Hedges at the behest of his teacher. Since then, he has gone on to place second at the 2005 Canadian Guitar Festival's Fingerstyle Guitar Championship and first place in the 2006 competition. He also placed third at the 2006 International Finger Style Guitar Championship in Winfield, Kansas (Doug Smith was the first-place winner while Don Alder took 2nd place). Dufour has released five solo albums to date: Naissance, Development, Existence, Convergences, and Sound Pictures. He has garnered a sizeable fanbase through YouTube with live performances of his songs cut in the same studio as fellow guitarist Andy McKee, amongst other CandyRat performers. His most popular video is a cover of \\"Jerry's Breakdown\\" performed with Tommy Gauthier, who is himself an expert fiddler, using a single guitar between the two. Dufour has also released a sixth album (Still Strings) with Tommy Gauthier. Dufour works on the side as a guitar instructor, offering lessons through Skype as well. Guitar style Dufour's pieces are characterized by a highly percussive playing style, using slap and natural harmonics frequently. Dufour shares many compositional traits with other fingerstyle guitarists such as Phil Keaggy, Kaki King, Don Alder, Andy McKee, Craig D'Andrea, and Don Ross, especially in terms of his music's technical complexity. Many pay special attention to the red bandana/scarf tied around the end of his guitar's neck above the nut, seen in most of Dufour's YouTube videos ‚Äì he has stated in interviews that this is used to mute the strings ringing above the nut as they would resonate after a hard strum followed by a mute of the strings. Currently, his primary instrument is a Mario Beauregard flat top \\"Orchestral model\\" cutaway. He uses medium Ernie Ball Aluminum Bronze strings, Dimarzio Pickups (Black Angel and Black Angel Piezo), Phil Jones amps, Radial Tonebone Pz-pre preamps, Eventide Space Reverb, Spider capos (previously Third Hand Capos) and an Ergoplay guitar support. On several of his pieces, he plays a Duane Noble Harp guitar. Dufour was previously endorsed by Stonebridge guitars; using his own signature Stonebridge model, in addition to a Stonebridge GS-23-CR. During the period of his first two albums, Dufour used an acoustic Jumbo Larivee in addition to his Stonebridge GS-23-CR. Dufour wears acrylic artificial fingernails on each finger of his right hand, aside from his thumb. The nails help to create a crisp, clean sound. Regarding these nails, he buys commonly available acrylic nails from a store, and then cuts them down to size. After gluing the nails on, he cuts and files the nails to his preferred length. These fake nails are not worn/glued over the entire fingernail, rather, they are worn on approximately half of the front tip of the nail. Commonly, he uses a Dunlop thumbpick which he files down so that the tip of the pick is shorter and at a more comfortable angle for his playing style. As is commonly seen, Dufour has two rings on his right index and ring finger. These are his wedding and engagement rings. The reason he wears them on his right hand is so that they do not hit the neck of the guitar while he plays. The rings serve no purpose in his playing.

The theatre has been serving to actively encourage and promote Palestinian artistic and cultural activities and collaborates with the Palestinian ministry of culture, several United Nations organisations, and a wide range of local and international NGOs.History, Palestinian National Theater In 1989, guest performance by the El-Hakawati Theatre at The Public Theater, New York, was cancelled by Joseph Papp, as he said that he was afraid that the play would \\"\\"offend\\" Jews who \\"constitute a high proportion of the theater audience in any city, but especially in New York.\\"\\"At Papp's Public Theater, a Show of Arrogance, July 15, 1989, by Alisa Solomon, The New York Times See also *Al-Kasaba Theatre History and general information The Palestinian National Theater (PNT) plays a vital role in the Palestinian community and until recently was the only center for culture and art in Jerusalem. Since its inception in 1984, the theatre has served to actively encourage and promote artistic and cultural activities. The PNT was founded by the Palestinian El-Hakawati Theatre Company. After one year, the management of the center was handed over to a Board of Directors composed of artists, writers, and notable persons in the Palestinian community. The PNT serves as a forum for cultural and artistic activities, and is working to upgrade and rekindle interest in the arts at the national level. Its mandate goes beyond preserving Palestinian culture, folklore and tradition and includes the active search for new ideas and innovative approaches to Palestinian self-expression. Mission and objectives The Palestinian National Theatre (PNT) is a Palestinian non profit cultural institution which strives to create and to develop a unique cultural life in Jerusalem, by way of producing and presenting artistic, educational and entertaining programs that reflect the aspirations of the Palestinian people. Main projects and activities The PNT shall work on the basis of a national cultural policy that stems its spiritual strength from the pluralistic history, culture and heritage of Palestine. Its aim is to raise the literary and intellectual awareness of Palestinians by expanding their horizons and developing their awareness in order to produce a community of people that have confidence and pride in themselves and respect for the differences of others. Because children and youth represent the majority of the Palestinian people, the PNT shall give priority to programs that address this vital component of Palestinian society Awards The Palestinian National Theater (Hakawati) received the Yasser Arafat Award for Excellence and Creativity in 2016. It is one of the most important cultural monuments in Palestine, but as a whole the institutions of Jerusalem suffer from financial distress, resource scarcity and harassment.

Location Namarunu is located in the Suguta Valley, a section of the Kenyan Rift Valley just south of Lake Turkana. It extends from the western side of the rift past the center. The mountain forms a broad shield. The large basal part is about deep, made up of outward-dipping trachytic lavas, breccias and tuffs. A few thousand years ago the Suguta was filled by a major lake, but now it is extremely dry and hot, with only the small Lake Logipi at the northern end. Some of the recent cones on the floor of the rift valley and on the eastern side of the rift below the Tirr Tirr Plateau contain hot springs. Evolution Namarunu was mainly formed during the upper Pliocene, but has some material from the Holocene. It is a trachytic shield volcano topped by more recent parasitic cones and lava flows. The basal trachyte dates to roughly 6.8 million years ago, while the uppermost basalts date to around 500,000 years ago. Large amounts of basalt were deposited in the Rift valley on the north, east and south of the volcano through effusion and explosions during the early Holocene. A breached scoria cone that forms the summit of the mountain also erupted fluid olivine basalts, with some eruptions later than the period around 3,000 years ago when Lake Suguta dried out. Eruptions may have occurred around the same time as historical eruptions of the Barrier Volcano to the north.

He served five terms as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, two terms in the Arizona State Senate, and one term as mayor of Prescott, Arizona. Steiger also made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate, served as a special assistant to Arizona Governor Evan Mecham, and hosted political talk shows on both radio and television. Despite these accomplishments, Steiger is best known for two incidents: The first, while he was a sitting Congressman, was the 1975 killing of two burros. The second was painting a crosswalk between Prescott's courthouse and nearby Whiskey Row. Early life Steiger was born March 10, 1929 in New York City to Lewis and Rebecca (Klein) Steiger. He was educated in local schools before attending college.Johnson pp. 95 His first trip to Arizona occurred at age 14 when he visited a dude ranch. Steiger attended Cornell University before graduating in 1950 with a Bachelor of Science from Colorado A&M.; Following college, Steiger was commissioned into the United States Army. Serving during the Korean War as a tank platoon leader, he was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for his actions. After leaving the army, Steiger settled in Prescott, Arizona. Steiger married his first wife, Cynthia Jean Gardner, in 1954. The couple had three children: twins Lewis and Gail in April 1956, followed by Delia Rebecca in May 1959. His first marriage would end in divorce, as would Steiger's marriage to his second wife, Lynda, in January 1979. Legislative career In 1959, Steiger entered politics on a wager. While working as a ranch hand in Springerville, he and several friends observed that Yavapai County had never elected a Republican representative. Steiger theorized that this was because the right Republican had not yet run for office. His friends challenged him to run for office and in 1960 Steiger was elected to the Arizona State Senate. While a freshman senator he wrote a column claiming that other members of the legislature had sold their votes for money and challenged senate leaders over perceived backroom deals. Steiger also likened himself to a tiger and used a black and orange motif on his campaign signs. After two terms in the statehouse, in 1964, Steiger ran against incumbent George F. Senner, Jr. for Arizona's 3rd district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was endorsed by all the newspapers within the district, with the Arizona Republic saying \\"Sam is independent, friendly, quick-witted, very out-spoken, crazy over horses, and wears an infectious smile\\". Despite these endorsements, Steiger lost a close election. He then served as a correspondent on the Vietnam War before making a second run for the congressional seat in 1966. Benefiting from a mid-decade reapportionment which pushed the district into a heavily Republican section of Maricopa County, near Phoenix, as well as Democratic voters defecting to other party candidates, Stieger defeated Senner on his second attempt. As a congressman, Steiger continued his outspoken ways. During his first term he delivered a speech from the floor of the House claiming it is \\"an irrefutable fact of life that the elected official is regarded by those who elect him as capable of the most flagrant dishonor,\\" and calling for a \\"code of ethics\\" which included \\"full disclosure of assets, liabilities, honorariums, etc., by members, their spouses, and staff members.\\" Steiger would later claim a number of his colleagues were frequently drunk and that \\"there are members of Congress you wouldn't hire to wheel a wheelbarrow.\\" As a result of these comments, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, previously an Arizona congressman, labeled Steiger as \\"a bomb thrower\\".Johnson pp. 96 Steiger's voting record in the House was staunchly conservative, earning him, in 1974, a zero rating Americans for Democratic Action and a 100% rating from Americans for Constitutional Action. Additionally, the congressman won a Distinguished Service Award from Americans for Constitutional Action for his \\"devotion to those fundamental principles of good government which serve to promote individual rights and responsibilities, a sound dollar, a growing economy, and a desire for victory over communist aggression.\\" His opposition to legislation favored by conservationists earned him membership to the League of Conservation Voters's \\"Dirty Dozen\\" list. These efforts included Steiger's opposition to controls on strip mining and support of coal companies. Steiger was very popular at home. He only faced one close reelection contest, in 1974. That year, he only held onto office by 3,073 votes. He only survived due to a 3,291-vote margin in the district's share of Maricopa County, which had as many people as the rest of the district combined.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31747 A number of Republicans were either defeated or faced tight races due to voter anger at the Watergate Scandal. =Burro shooting= A defining moment for Steiger came in 1975. A herd of about 150 burros had been running loose near Paulden, scaring children at bus stops and causing the Congressman to receive numerous complaints. On August 9, 1975, Steiger went to investigate the complaints and found a group of 14 burros that had been placed in an enclosure along a highway, until their owner could come to claim them. Entering the enclosure with a .30 caliber carbine, the Congressman went to check the animals' brands to determine who owned them. In a report to the local sheriff, Steiger later claimed the burros charged him and he shot the two lead animals in self- defense. The incident was forwarded to the county attorney's office for consideration before the burros' owner brought a pair of civil suits against Steiger. In addition to the official investigation of the incident, Steiger suffered other repercussions. Children picketed outside Phoenix's federal building, carrying signs reading \\"Steiger joins the murderers of innocent animals\\", and the once political tiger was re-branded \\"the jackass killer.\\" The Congressman later observed, \\"I could find a cure for cancer and they'd remember me as the guy who shot the burros.\\" =U.S. Senate run= In 1976, Steiger decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat opened up by Paul Fannin's retirement. His opponent during the Republican primary was fellow congressman John Bertrand Conlan. The campaign between the two congressmen became ugly with Conlan saying \\"We are both conservatives, but our style is different. He uses a meat ax and I use a scalpel\\" and asking voters if they desired \\"a Jew from New York telling Arizona what to do\\". Steiger countered with \\"John thinks of himself as a scalpel. I prefer to think of him as a Roto-Rooter,\\" and claiming \\"Godzilla would make a better Senator than John Conlan.\\" Steiger defeated Conlan in a tight race, but the effects of the primary left him severely wounded in the general election. Many of Conlan's supporters abandoned their party's candidate and instead supported Democratic Pima County Attorney Dennis DeConcini. In the November 2 election, Steiger lost to DeConcini, 43%-54%. Following his unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate, Steiger attempted to return to the Arizona State Senate in 1978. This was followed in 1982 with him running for governor as a member of the Libertarian Party. His goal during the campaign was to obtain five percent of the vote and establish ballot access for the Libertarian party. He succeeded with 5.1% of the vote, the fourth-best result for any Libertarian gubernatorial candidate. During this time, Steiger saw a steady erosion of his approval. As Prescott Councilman Ken Bennett explained, Steiger was popular in his hometown as a \\"brash young congressman out in Washington telling people what to do. But they liked him less when he came back here and started telling our people what to do. Sam was the kiss of death in Prescott for a while. His popularity was at an all-time low. But he was back to being a hero with that crosswalk.\\"Johnson pp. 97 Crosswalk caper In 1986, the Prescott city council decided to eliminate a crosswalk as part of a road resurfacing project. The crosswalk connected the local courthouse with an adjacent line of saloons known as Whiskey Row. Public resentment over the removal soon developed and Steiger decided to take matters into his own hands. According to local legend he used a paint brush to replace the crosswalk at night after visiting the nearby bars. In fact, he performed the action with a parking lot striping machine during the day. As a result of the May 2, 1986, incident, Steiger was arrested and charged with criminal damage and disorderly conduct, The disorderly conduct count was dropped but the criminal damage charge went to trial. Steiger defended himself, arguing \\"it wasn't criminal damage, it was historic preservation.\\" He was acquitted by the jury after they had deliberated for 25 minutes. Governor's assistant In 1987, Governor Evan Mecham appointed Steiger as a special assistant overseeing thirteen state agencies. One of these agencies was the Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles. While working as special assistant, Steiger ordered pardons board member Ron Johnson to vote against requiring the resignation of fellow board member Patricia Castillo. As part of his instructions, Steiger informed Johnson that his appointment as a justice of the peace would be revoked if he did not comply. Johnson did not vote as instructed and Steiger had Johnson's judicial appointment revoked. Johnson responded by contacting Attorney General Bob Corbin who instructed Johnson to record a follow-up conversation between Johnson and Steiger confirming what had occurred. As a result, Steiger was charged with extortion. Claiming he had been singled out for prosecution due to past differences with Attorney General Corbin, Steiger was found guilty of the charge on April 7, 1988, and sentenced to four years probation, a fine of US$5,500, and 700 hours of community service. Prior to the sentencing over 170 letters had been sent to the court in support of the defendant. On September 21, 1989, the conviction was overturned by the Arizona Court of Appeals. In a 3-0 ruling, the court found the law Steiger was convicted under to be \\"unconstitutionally vague both because it provided insufficient guidance to those who make demands on others and because it permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\\" Later life In 1990, Steiger changed his party affiliation back from Libertarian to Republican and made a second run for governor. The campaign was unsuccessful, with Steiger losing to Fife Symington III in the Republican primary. The same year he released his book, Kill the Lawyers!, in which he discussed his various legal problems in a humorous manner.Johnson pp. 99 Steiger then became a local talk show host, his show being broadcast on both radio and television. In addition he published a political newsletter, The Burro Chronicles. In 1999, Steiger ran for Mayor of Prescott, Arizona on a slow-growth platform. Following a single term in office, he left to return to the private sector. Steiger suffered a stroke on September 20, 2002 that led him to be placed in an assisted living facility. Steiger died in Prescott, Arizona on September 26, 2012. See also * List of Jewish members of the United States Congress References * External links * (48 KB) from The Morris K.

At the same time new buses were allocated to a number of Black Country routes, branded as Black Diamond. First Midland Red subsequently sold both it's Redditch and Kidderminster depots to Diamond Bus. Diamond Staffordshire The Diamond Staffordshire brand was introduced in late 2012 for the company's services around the Lichfield area. Following the purchase of Central Buses Diamond took on operations in Lichfield such as 35 to Walsall. This service was subsequently taken over by Arriva Midlands and operated from their Wednesfield depot acquired with the purchase of Liyell Limited (t/a Midland) until operations from there were sold to Diamond Bus which brought Diamond back on to the 35 route. The 35B service through Stonnall was scrapped in 2019 and replaced by 36 operated by Select Bus Services. Diamond West Midlands In late 2012 Blue Diamond, Black Diamond and Signature became Diamond West Midlands and operate services across the West Midlands. =Black Diamond= Plaxton Centro bodied Volvo B7RLE in Black Diamond livery in September 2010 Marshall Capital bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Blue Diamond livery in September 2010 In 2008, upon takeover by Rotala, Diamond started to \\"localise\\" their operations. In the Black Country, this meant that the brand became Black Diamond with 20 new Plaxton Centros (eight of which have since moved to Wessex Bus due to service cuts). These were new for routes 401, 402, 404, 404E and 404H. In 2009, Diamond launched eight more Plaxton Centro buses on route 9, these using Royale Black Diamond branding. Route 202 Halesowen - Bromsgrove and 4H Hayley Green - West Bromwich uses Royale Black Diamond buses. Most of the routes these buses were new for have since either had new buses (404E), withdrawn (404/H) or had older stock transferred to them (401/2) .

On 26 July 2010, the Signature brand took over route 82 from National Express Coventry but following a more direct route between Solihull and Coventry using Mercedes-Benz Citaros and service S4 (taken over from Grosvenor) using MCV Evolutions, again both feature leather seating and free on-board WiFi. In 2019, service 82 was lost to Johnson's of Henley-in-Arden who subsequently linked the service to their existing service X20 providing a direct service between Coventry, Solihull and Stratford-upon-Avon. On 27 March 2011, the Signature brand expanded again with the addition of route 30 Solihull-Acocks Green which was withdrawn by National Express West Midlands. When Central Connect was rebranded as 'Blue Diamond' in late 2011, the Solihull Signature brand was retained.

Diamond Worcestershire Wright Crusader bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Pershore in June 2010 Wright Crusader bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Birmingham in September 2010 In early 2013 Red Diamond was rebranded as Diamond Worcestershire. In a working partnership with Worcestershire County Council, a new fleet of Red Diamond bus services were introduced to operate in Redditch. These buses are mainly Diamond owned Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLEs but there have been several re-painted Dennis Darts in operation. From 22 January 2007, Diamond were forced to withdraw their evening services on routes 57 and 58 in Redditch, which were under contract to Worcestershire County Council, due to persistent vandalism and violence on the routes. The company told the council that they would no longer risk operating in the evenings. A month later on 25 February 2007, Diamond also withdrew the evening services on route 246 between Redditch and Evesham due to low passenger numbers. On 8 June 2008, the company introduced 57A and 58A journeys alongside their existing 57 and 58 routes, the new journeys would serve the Alexandra Hospital, after First Midland Red withdrew links to the hospital. The operations in Redditch were rebranded as Red Diamond in July 2008 to coincide with the launch of six new buses, with a livery designed to be similar to what was used on Midland Red buses. By September 2008 a further six new buses were in operation, along with 10 older buses in the new livery. From 31 August 2008, Diamond Bus stepped up their operation of commercial and non-commercial services in Redditch significantly, to the point where they operated more buses in Redditch than main rival First Midland Red. In February 2009, Red Diamond won Worcestershire County Council contracts to operate a number of services around Droitwich and Redditch starting in April 2009, these are routes 19 to Meadows Estate, 20 to Westlands, 20A to New Chawston, 137 to Dunhampstead, 140/141 to Bromsgrove and 157 to The Ridings. In addition to this, extra daytime journeys are to be provided on Redditch services 50, 64 and 70. The company will also once again operate evening services in Redditch on routes 55A, 56A, 57 and 58. Service 64 between Bromsgrove and Birmingham will also be renumbered to 144 and re-routed to follow the same numbered service operated by First. Droitwich residents were unhappy about the changes, showing concern about losing the known and respected drivers from the local routes, however, Diamond Bus entered into an agreement with the former operator of the routes, allowing them to continue operating with the same drivers, while Diamond Bus provide the buses and uniforms. In 2010, amid much criticism of the poor performance of the existing buses from Worcestershire County Council and passengers, Diamond brought nine MCV Evolutions for services 362, 363 and 382. In January 2013 Red Diamond purchased First Midlands's Kidderminster and Redditch depots and re-branded the operations as Diamond Worcestershire.First sells Worcestershire bus services Worcester News 25 January 2013 Acquisitions After Rotala purchased Diamond Bus in 2008, the Diamond Bus operation was expanded to include the operations of four companies operating in the same region which were already owned by Rotala.

The murder weapon, a bloodstained hammer, was found nearby. After a lengthy investigation, police were given a description of a man who purchased a hammer from a local shopkeeper, which was similar to the description that eyewitnesses provided of a man last seen in the company of Balchin on the night of her murder. Based on this information, police questioned Walter Graham Rowland, a man who had been convicted in 1934 of murdering his two-year-old child. His death sentence for that crime had been commuted after serving eight years, due to the onset of World War II and the need for able-bodied men. A forensic examination of Rowland's clothes showed bloodstains matching Balchin's blood type as well as dust particles and plant debris traced to the bomb site. Police arrested Rowland for her murder, and he was convicted and held at Strangeways Prison.Encyclopedia of murder p.471-2, By Patricia Pitman While Rowland was in prison awaiting execution, a prisoner at Walton Jail in Liverpool, David J. Ware, made unprompted three confessions to the crime - first in writing to the governor of the prison, then to police, and finally to Rowland's lawyer. The confession was quickly followed by a retraction wherein Ware admitted to confessing because he wanted to appear \\"swank,\\" and said that he had obtained details of the murder from newspapers he read in prison. There were also questions as to Ware's mental state, as he had been discharged from the British Army in 1943 after a diagnosis of manic depressive psychosis. Additionally, unlike Rowland, there was no forensic evidence found that tied Ware to the murder scene. Despite the retraction, Rowland's lawyer argued for his conviction to be overturned on appeal because of Ware's confession. The motion failed and Rowland was hanged on 27 February 1947.The Deseret News ‚Äì 27 Feb 1947 A Home Office inquiry determined that Ware had made a false confession, and therefore found no impropriety with regards to the conviction. In 1951, Ware attacked a woman with a hammer, and was found guilty of attempted murder. He was deemed not criminally responsible due to insanity and was committed to Broadmoor Hospital.Koestler, Arthur. Reflections on Hanging. New York: Macmillan, 1957. p.115-128.Hanged‚Äîand innocent? By Reginald Thomas Paget (Baron Paget), Samuel Sydney Silverman This attack, coupled with his prior confession to the Balchin murder, led some in Britain to believe that Rowland had been falsely convicted and was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The matter is still occasionally raised in debates about the death penalty and wrongful convictions in Britain.

History Probus Management commenced operating on 4 May 1993 trading as Pete's Travel with two Dodge minibuses on route 404 between Walsall and West Bromwich.People's Express / Pete's Travel Reddibus The operation of route 79, between Birmingham, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton, increased the size of the fleet to six by the end of the year. All the vehicles were painted in a white livery with a black skirt, and red fleet names. Pictured =Purchase of Lionspeed and gain of Centro contracts= In May 1994, Pete's acquired Lionspeed, who was a minibus operator based in Erdington, running a mix of commercial and Centro supported services in north Birmingham. The company successfully gained the right to run its own Centro contracts in October 1994, and by February 1995 it had 25 minibuses in operation, mostly second-hand Dodge minibuses. Pete's moved to a new depot in Church Lane Industrial Estate in May 1996, where 50 minibuses could be parked under cover. At the same time Lionspeed's yellow and green livery was adopted, and the company bought its first new buses in the shape of Mercedes-Benz minibuses, which were operated under a separate company called The Busy Bus Company.Companies House extract company no 3032053 Busy Bus Company Limited In October 1996, the company won more Centro contracts and additional vehicles were needed. Pete's wanted six Mercedes-Benz Varios but could not obtain enough in time, so other bus types were operated, including a Dennis Dart SLF. The popularity of these buses led to Pete's purchasing another three in June 1997. Pete's Travel took over further Centro contracts, with Dodge minibuses, in January 1997, after The Little Red Bus Company went into receivership. =Purchase of People's Express= In May 1997, the company acquired a 50% stake in People's Express, who at the time operated 13 buses, also in West Bromwich. The remainder of People's Express was purchased in June 1998, along with the company's Centro contracts. Following more contract wins at the end of 1998, the company expanded into Coventry, Telford and Bridgnorth. =Move to Hill Top and Redditch= A new depot was purchased in February of that year, at \\"Hill Top\\" in West Bromwich, allowing the use of double deckers for Centro school contracts. In October 2001, two new depots were established, one in Coventry for newly won Centro and Warwickshire County Council contracts, and another in Redditch for Centro and Worcestershire County Council contracts, and some commercial services following First Wyvern's staff shortage service cuts. =Rise and decline of the Telford operations= In February 2002, the Britannia Travel of Telford business was purchased, which was used to expand operations in Shropshire and to start a coach operation. The Telford depot was closed in late 2004 due to the extensive loss of Shropshire contracts. People's Express name revived On 28 March 2005, the company changed its trading name from Pete's Travel to People's Express. On 17 June 2005, People's Express closed the Redditch depot.

The S56 minibuses became the mainstay of operations, with considerable secondhand models emanating from South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, the latter with Northern Counties bodies. Further additions came from the collapse of Little Red Bus all repainted into the green/yellow livery. Unique purchases for the fleet came in high bodied D-NUH Dodge Commander buses from Islwyn Transport in South Wales. Following the acquisition of Lionspeed, the fleet saw additions of Freight Rover Sherpa/Carlyle body and the start of The Busy Bus Company brought the group's first new vehicles in Mercedes/Mellor body midibuses. As the group won more Centro tenders, then newer vehicles were required in the shape of Mercedes Varios from Cheshire Bus & Coach. CBC were unable to fulfil the full delivery of Varios so offered Pete's the first full sized single decker bus in the form of new low floor Dennis Dart with Wright Crusader body, much to the disgust of the region's largest operator and Pete's main rival, Travel West Midlands, who themselves were only recently taking delivery of low floor buses. Pete's added more darts to fleet with East Lancashire and, the ubiquitous, Plaxton Pointer bodies, all in various lengths from the Mini Pointer to the Super Pointer bodies. Pete's did acquire a small number of step-entrance Plaxton Pointer, Alexander and Wright Handybus split screen bodies to replace ageing Dodge S56s and a steady fleet upgrade continued well into the late 1990s. Notable purchases came from very early Duple Dartline and Carlyle bodied darts from London Buses with the sweeping curved windscreens, though one of the more unusual Dennis Dart purchases came from non-standard UVG bodied R810WJA. More contracts ensued with the requirement of high capacity double deckers for school work - Pete's acquired a number of MCW Metrobuses from London Buses operating units, some with both double door and single door conversions. Further London vehicles bolstered the fleet in Volvo Citybus/Northern Counties.

The traditional schools formally organized in 1867 when voters approved the first board of education and established Milford Union School. An eight-classroom school that included the high school was constructed. The newly organized high school graduated its first class in 1883. The Union School closed in 1913 when Milford Main, originally called the Main Street School, opened with a total student enrollment of 381.Milford High School Centennial, A History of Milford Schools, 1883-1983. Joyce Snell. Retrieved 29 April 2012.Bridge to The Past: The History of Milford. Milford Historical Society. Retrieved 29 April 2012. The location in the city housed all grades and was a state-of-the-art building when completed before World War I. In 1914, Milford High School issued its first yearbook: The Mirror is on file and available for viewing upon request at Promont along with every other yearbook ever issued. In 1919, the yearbook gained a new name, Droflim (Milford spelled backwards), which it continues to have to this day. The Milford Board declared its independence in 1917 when it passed a resolution that relieved the school of higher supervision. At that point, Milford Schools were born. At a time when most schools were strictly segregated throughout the country, Milford was open to all area Ohioans, including Jessie Clark, regardless of ancestry in 1917. Students posed in front of the school for class photos in 1917. Overcrowding has been a problem for Milford schooling since the 1920s. The schools temporarily solved the problem by housing students in temporary buildings or by reducing school to half-day sessions. In 1923, Milford High School started a newspaper called the Hi-Letter, and the name changed to The Reflector in 1933 and has stayed all of these years. =Expansion: 1950‚Äî1970= Milford education experienced growth following World War II. James H. Fley became Superintendent in 1952. Under Fley‚Äôs leadership, Milford expanded from one K-12 school to many different buildings. Milford also looked to neighboring school systems to find additional classroom space. In the late 1950s to early 1960s, Ohio initiated a consolidation of school \\"districts\\" across the state. Milford merged with Miami Rural Schools and then Miamiville, encompassing education over much of Miami Township. Before the consolidations, Milford schooling covered five square miles. In 1962, a new Milford High School, constructed on a bog, and Pleasant Hill Elementary, now called Charles Seipelt Elementary, joined Milford South Elementary to provide much needed space for the growing student body. Despite the new buildings, overcrowding continued to be a problem at the high school. The growth and transformation of the schools continued for the next twenty years under the direction of Boyd E. Smith, who served as Superintendent from 1965 to 1985. The new Milford Junior High (current high school) opened in 1966. Milford Schools moved the ninth grade class to join grades 7-8 at the junior high. The high school handled grades 10-12. =Centralization: 1970‚Äî2000= Student overcrowding continued into the 1970s as more families moved into the schools and Milford Schools struggled to find enough classroom space. In 1971, Milford Main became a middle school for sixth and seventh graders. Elementary grades were divided among the elementary schools while most kindergarten students attended classes in a variety of churches in the area. In 1978, another bond issue became necessary for the construction of more schools. The plan called for the construction of Boyd E. Smith Elementary and renovations or additions to Main, Miami Elementary on St. Rt. 28, as well as the high school and junior high. In 1980, renovation work began at the high school (current junior high). The high school enrolled grades 10‚Äì12, and the adjacent Milford Junior High School campus enrolled grades 8 and 9. The first major renovation at One Eagles Way occurred in 1986. By 1987, students needed more space at the high school level, so the decision was made to renovate the then junior high and convert it to the high school. The renovated high school on Eagles Way opened in 1989. After 1990, the concept of neighborhood schools was a recurring theme for renovations, socializing, and outlook for Milford‚Äôs schools. 2005 undercover drug operation On April Fools' Day 2005, the high school was the site of a raid by Miami Township police and an undercover agent. Three students were charged with drug trafficking felonies as juveniles, three were expelled, two were jailed, and one arrestee was placed on suicide watch. Notable alumni  *Michael A.

Presented in the articles as an example of Romney's ability to deal with trying circumstances, the incident received nationwide media attention when journalists and animal activists criticized Romney's strapping of the dog to the roof for a 12-hour summer trip. Romney said that the dog had a windshield and he \\"jumped right in\\" and loved the ride.

His advertisements, most of which focus primarily on Romney's conservative credentials, have aired mainly in Iowa and New Hampshire, which experts credit with helping his early lead in those and other early primary states. Romney's campaign advisors explained that their early advertisement push was to make up for Romney being relatively unknown compared to contenders Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Fred Thompson. On September 4, 2007, Romney was estimated to have spent $2 million in advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire. In mid-August 2007, Romney began broadcasting advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire that criticized what he called the sanctuary city policies of several cities. \\"Immigration laws don't work if they're ignored.

Political positions Religion Romney is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Though Romney did not win the nomination in 2008, Romney became the first Mormon on a major party's presidential ticket when he won the nomination in 2012. In pursuing the Republican Party presidential nomination, he was following in the footsteps of his father, George W. Romney, who ran for the White House in 1968 and lost; fellow Latter-day Saint Orrin Hatch of Utah, who ran in 2000 and lost; and Joseph Smith, who ran in 1844 but was killed by a mob.In 2008, Will It Be Mormon in America? In contrast to Hatch's 2000 attempt or Smith's 1844 attempt, Romney was felt to be a major contender and so the effect his religion would have on the election came under serious consideration by pundits. As of September 2007, 75% of the American electorate professed that Mormonism in a candidate would not affect their vote.Government/Politics Romney may have been challenged by voters with the concern that a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would take commandments from the president of the church who is regarded as a living prophet. In an interview aired on Fox News Romney said, \\"America has a political religion, which is to place the oath of office, an oath to abide by a nation of laws and the Constitution, above all others. And there's no question that I make that my primary responsibility.\\" Mike Otterson, an LDS spokesman, said, \\"The suggestion that a Mormon leader would dictate policy to a President Romney is absurd.

The speech, which was widely regarded as referencing that of then-Senator John F. Kennedy's September 1960 pledge not to allow Catholic doctrine to inform policy, discussed the role of religion in American society and politics; Romney said he would not allow any authorities from any religion, including his own, to influence presidential decisions. He avoided speaking about specific Latter-day Saint doctrines, as he stated that by forcing him to become the spokesperson for his faith, it would be enabling \\"the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution.\\" Instead, he addressed religion in general, saying \\"Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom.\\".MSNBC \\"On the ground at Romney speech\\" 6 December 2007 In December 2007, rival candidate, Mike Huckabee, when asked by the New York Times if he personally considered the LDS faith a cult or a religion, Huckabee said he believed it was a religion despite his lack of knowledge, but then followed up by asking, \\"Don't Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers?\\"\\"The Huckabee Factor\\", New York Times Magazine, December 12, 2007.

(There were some unusual questions, including a question on global warming posed by an animated snowman.) However, Romney soon changed his stance, and he did participate in the debate, held in Durham, New Hampshire, on September 5, 2007. This debate was cosponsored by Fox News rather than CNN and was somewhat more conventional than the earlier debate on CNN.

In the Stephanus pagination, it spans III. 357d‚Äì358b. The letter is ostensibly written to Archytas of Tarentum, whom Plato met during his first trip to Sicily in 387 BC. Archytas had sent a letter with Archippus and Philonides, two Pythagoreans who had gone on to mention to Plato that Archytas was unhappy about not being able to get free of his public responsibilities. The Ninth Letter is sympathetic, noting that nothing is more pleasant than to attend to one's own business, especially when that business is the one that Archytas would engage in (viz. philosophy). Yet everyone has responsibilities to one's fatherland (œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒØœÇ), parents, and friends, to say nothing of the need to provide for daily necessities. When the fatherland calls, it is improper not to answer, especially as a refusal will leave politics to the care of worthless men. The letter then declares that enough has been said of this subject, and concludes by noting that Plato will take care of Echecrates, who is still a youth (ŒΩŒµŒ±ŒΩŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ), for Archytas' sake and that of Echecrates' father, as well as for the boy himself. R. G. Bury describes the Ninth Letter as \\"a colourless and commonplace effusion which we would not willingly ascribe to Plato, and which no correspondent of his would be likely to preserve;\\" he also notes \\"certain peculiarities of diction which point to a later hand.\\"Bury, Epistle IX, 591. A character by the name of Echecrates also appears in the Phaedo, though Bury suggests that he, if the same person mentioned here, could hardly have been called a youth by the time Plato met Archytas. Despite the fact that Cicero attests to its having been written by Plato,Cicero, De Finibus, Bonorum et Malorum, ii. 14; De Officiis, i. 7. most scholars consider it a literary forgery.

The programme uses the majority of the familiar characters from the traditional Robin Hood legends. Though appearances by Friar Tuck and Prince John are not until series 3 (although the latter was frequently mentioned throughout entire series), portrayed by David Harewood and Toby Stephens respectively. Some characters have been given new back-stories or personality traits not evident in previous versions of the legend. The show has a contemporary edge which extends to its costumes and themes. Often alluding to the current political events of the 21st century. Its characters sometimes use contractions, not yet used in the 12th century; when the show is set. Main characters =Robin Hood= Sir Robin of Locksley (alias Robin Hood after outlawed), is the titular main protagonist of the 2006 TV series. He is portrayed by Jonas Armstrong, who is much younger than many of the previous actors to have played the character. Armstrong described his portrayal of Robin Hood as \\"A believable superhero... Like all leaders, he's an egoist and he's often quite arrogant. He's not an out-and-out hero...He has an undercurrent of darkness.\\" At the beginning of series one, Robin has just returned to England after five years fighting in the Third Crusade as part of the King's Guard, during which he was honoured by King Richard and almost mortally wounded. He was still the Earl of Huntingdon, and Lord of Locksley Manor and its estate. He becomes an outlaw after refusing to preside over the execution of Will Scarlett, his brother and Allan A Dale. In the earlier episodes, it becomes clear that his memories of the Crusades have affected him strongly, making him unwilling to kill, this being why he does not kill the Sheriff or Gisborne early on. Robin had previously been betrothed to Marian when they were teenagers, but this was undone by his departure. He still has strong feelings for her when he returns and is pleased that she is still unmarried. However, their relationship is strained and she is untrusting of him. Marian initially shuns Robin and rejects his attempts to charm her. They become closer over the course of the first series, Robin frequently visiting her home under cover of darkness, though their meetings usually are concerned with Robin's war against the Sheriff. He is devastated when she becomes engaged to Guy of Gisborne in order to protect herself and her father. Robin is witness to this and is visibly upset. He endeavours to find a way for Marian break her engagement to Guy, by proving he is a traitor to the King. A darker side of Robin's character is revealed in episode 8 of series 1. when he realises that it was a masked Gisborne he prevented from killing King Richard in the Holy Land. This sends Robin into a rage and he attempts to kill Gisborne, compromising his own teachings and beliefs. Though prevented from doing so, Robin strives to prove his guilt for the rest of the series. When Guy stabs Marian, unaware that it is her disguised as the Night Watchman, she appears to die. Robin and Marian begin to express their regret over their parting many years ago. Robin admitting that he believes they should be together and that he should not have gone to war, leaving her. To a supposedly dead Marian, Robin now utterly distraught, breaks down over her body and admits that he loves her. She survives; her \\"death\\" attributed to the shutting down of her body following the stab wound, and hemlock, applied by the treacherous physician Pitts. Despite her love for Robin, she decides to go ahead with the wedding to Guy, in order to protect her Father. A heart-broken Robin abandons his men. Robin viciously rebuffs Much's attempts to comfort him and prepares to leave Nottingham. He stops in his tracks when he hears Much interrupting Marian's wedding and reaches the ceremony in time to see Marian leave Guy at the altar. He gives her a ride to the castle after Gisborne reveals his true colours. They share their first kiss outside the castle gates, establishing their romantic relationship. Robin gets his fighting spirit back, saving Marian's father Edward from being killed by the Sheriff and redeeming himself to Much by preventing the Sheriff from slitting his throat. In series 2, Robin and Marian's relationship has developed, and after Marian's father dies, she joins Robin in the forest. The transition is not easy and takes a toll on Marians independence. They share a common goal of saving England from the clutches of Prince John, however their strategies differ. She is more logical, whilst Robin is prone to acting rashly, especially when overcome with emotion. They share many tender moments in the forest despite this. Robin remains somewhat jealous of her relationship with Guy, but she remains faithful. In episode 9, Lardner's Ring, Robin proposes to Marian again, which she accepts, but soon finds herself back in the castle with Guy. Marian chooses this as the only option to keep her alliance with Robin from Guy. In the final episode of series 2, Marian is caught in an attempt to assassinate the Sherrif. She is captured and taken to the Holy Land, where Robin and the gang are also. Sir Guy of Gisborne stabs Marian, mortally wounding her, in a rage caused by her admitting she is in love and engagement to Robin Hood. Robin and Marian are married as she lays dying. Robin assures Marian that he will keep fighting, although he expresses that he cannot without her. A montage sequence is shown of Robin's memories of their life as he carries Marian to her grave. Series 3 takes place months after Marian's death, as Robin and the remaining outlaws return to England. Robin, now bent on avenging his wife's murder, sends away his friends out of anger (and a personal desire to ensure they don't meet the same fate) and heads to Locksley to kill Gisborne. Their vicious fight ends with Robin being thrown over a cliff. He is rescued by Brother Tuck, but a tired and broken Robin refuses his help, claiming that he has nothing more to give and that he has lost all faith in himself. However, when Robin learns that the gang are to be executed, he and Tuck set out to rescue them. During the rescue, Robin manages to pin Gisborne to a wall. Initially intending to murder Gisborne, Robin relents when Guy actually begs for death, contenting himself with merely slashing Gisborne's cheek. He buries Marian's wedding ring shortly afterwards and expresses aloud that he will never stop loving her. In episode 4, the gang is joined by a girl from Locksley called Kate, who is forced to join Robin's gang when he rescues her from the Sheriff's new tax collector, Rufus. In episode 5 he meets the mysterious Isabella and seems attracted to her, but later learns that she is Gisborne's younger sister. He becomes closer to Isabella in episode 6, sharing a passionate kiss. He convinces her to help him steal Prince John's money, but her loyalty to Robin is questioned by the rest of the gang. In episode 7, he and Isabella become closer still after Gisborne finds out about their relationship. However, when Robin goes to Kate's aid at the castle, he tells Isabella he can never give up his life as an outlaw. Angry and hurt, Isabella betrays Robin in favour of allying with Prince John. When she becomes Sheriff, Robin continues to hope for an alliance, but the arrival of her husband Thornton ends any hopes of redemption, and after his murder, she reavows to kill Robin Hood. In episode 10, Bad Blood, Robin is captured along with Guy by a mysterious hooded character. The man reveals that Robin's father and Guy's mother had an illegitimate child whilst Guy's father Sir Roger was fighting in the Holy Land, but had to conceal it when he returned secretly carrying leprosy. After Sir Roger was exposed and cast out, Ghislaine gave birth to a boy named Archer. Guy also discovers that he did not kill his parents by starting a fire as he had previously believed, but his mother had been killed accidentally in a fight between Robin's father and Guy's father, and Sir Roger had stayed with her whilst she died. The stranger is then revealed to be Robin's father, whose face was disfigured in the fire, and he asks Guy and Robin to forgive each other in order to find Archer, who is now in York jail awaiting execution. In episode 11, The Enemy of my Enemy, Robin takes Gisborne to the camp, but not before having a fight about their parents and Marian. The gang intervene but are shocked when Robin prevents them from slaying him, and tells them that Gisborne is one of them. Robin and Gisborne then travel to York, where Gisborne gets himself arrested so that he can locate Archer in the dungeons. Robin, uses a disguise to convince the Sheriff of York to release Gisborne. However, as a guard takes Robin down to the dungeons, a messenger from Isabella informs York that the pair are murderous criminals. Robin and Gisborne find their brother Archer, who has been having an affair with York's wife and is a supposed master of alchemy, and make their escape with the other prisoners. The trio then get brought to the main hall where Archer betrays them, only to be caught again and put on execution. Before Gisborne is hanged, there is an explosion and Robin and Archer save Gisborne. In Something Worth Fighting For, Robin and the gang save several men of Locksley from being taken by Sheriff Isabella to help Prince John construct an army against the King. Knowing they are out of time, Robin decides to seize Nottingham Castle and await the return of King Richard from the Holy Land. Isabella attempts to sow discontent among the outlaws by pardoning Allan A Dale of his crimes; this causes him to leave, disgusted that they still have such little faith in him. Although Archer, who has allied with Isabella for easy money, springs an elaborate trap on the outlaws as they try to infiltrate the castle, he eventually betrays his employer and joins the cause of his half-brothers, and they succeed in taking over Nottingham Castle. Much then informs Robin that something has been left at the castle entrance: the dead body of Allan, slain by Vaisey. The gang's mourning for Allan is cut short, by the return of Sheriff Vaisey who has brought a large army. Robin and the gang then retreat into the castle and await Vaisey's inevitable attack. In the 2009 series finale, Isabella, while fighting Robin, slices his neck with a poisoned blade, though he survives long enough to kill her and the Sheriff and destroy his army. At the end of the episode, the dying Robin bids his gang a final farewell, speaking to each of them in turn, then staggers off to a glade in Sherwood Forest to die peacefully. As he lies dying, a vision of Marian appears before him and the two embrace and enter Heaven. The gang retrieve Robin's corpse for burial, and vow to continue fighting injustice in his name. =Sir Guy of Gisborne= Sir Guy of Gisborne, played by Richard Armitage, is a dark, brooding man always clad in black leather. He is the third main character in the first two series after Robin and Marian, and the second main character in the third series after Robin only. Guy is the Sheriff's second- in-command and manages the Locksley estate in Robin's absence. He is reluctant to relinquish control and takes a dark satisfaction in being named permanent lord after Robin is outlawed. His eagerness for land of his own comes from bitterness over having no actual Gisborne estate, and he contemplates renaming Locksley to Gisborne. It is revealed that Gisborne's mother was French, and that after his family lost their land they moved to France. Guy fathers a child, Seth, with a servant girl, Annie, and later abandons him in the forest, only for the baby to be rescued by Robin and his men. In the words of the Radio Times, Gisborne is \\"the chief dispenser of the Sheriff's rough justice... seen killing a man in front of his own son.\\" As in other tales of the Hood legends, he is a suitor of Marian, but she does not return his affections. In episode seven of series one, he practically forces her into an engagement with him. Robin later discovers that Guy is the masked assassin who wounded him in the Holy Land when he tried to prevent him from killing King Richard. Robin slashes his tattoo during the fray, and Robin realises that it was Guy when he sees his tattoo with an identical scar through it. Robin kidnaps and tortures Guy after he finds out, and attempts to reveal Guy's treachery to the public, but the Sheriff foils hopes of incrimination by burning the tattoo from Gisborne's skin with acid. Robin later locates Gisborne's physician, who under duress reveals that, when Gisborne was supposedly ill in Locksley, he had in fact left for the Holy Land. However, the physician is killed shortly afterwards, ending any chance of proving Gisborne's guilt. Just before their wedding is due to go ahead, Marian disguises herself as the Night Watchman and attempts to steal a chest of money from Guy, which she describes to her father as \\"a final fling to make me more comfortable in my marriage\\". Unaware that it is his fianc√©e, Guy stabs her in the stomach. After being cared for by Robin and Djaq, she recovers for the wedding, but decides not to marry Guy at the last minute; she punches him and runs from the altar. Gisborne is evidently not completely evil, as he lacks the Sheriff's sadistic glee and even seems at times to disapprove. When three young boys witness an incriminating event in Childhood, Gisborne attempts to spare their lives even though the Sheriff wants them dead. He risks his own life to help Marian when the Earl of Winchester demands her as part of a deal in For England!. He does show remorse for his villainous ways in the final episode of the first series and lets Marian leave after she goes to warn Robin of the Sheriff's plan. However, this rejection weighs heavily on him at the start of the second series, and he chooses to burn down the home of Marian's father when the Sheriff decides to place the family under watch in the castle. In Get Carter, Guy breaks down and confesses to Marian his desire for a home and her love. She resists him at first, saying that she needs time to grieve her father's recent death. But when Guy is turning to leave, she kisses him but only in order to protect a fleeing Robin from Guy's view. Marian leaves despite his pleas for her to stay and she returns to the forest. In the series two finale, A Good Day to Die, a panicked Marian offers Guy her hand if he assassinates the Sheriff before he can oversee the murder of King Richard (though she does think that Robin Hood is already dead by this time). Guy instead alerts the Sheriff of Marian's offer and decides to wed her regardless of her approval. During the final battle within an abandoned Saracen town between Robin's men and the Sheriff's assassins, King Richard is wounded and put at the mercy of an advancing Gisborne. Realising that Guy is consumed with power and greed, Marian stands between Guy and the King, informing him that she loves only Robin. An enraged Gisborne finally snaps and runs Marian through with a sword; shocked and horrified by his own actions, he flees the fort with the Sheriff on horseback. Marian dies in Robin's arms, after they exchange vows and love for one another. In series 3 he continues to attempt to kill Robin, while being tormented by guilt for killing Marian (in the episode Total Eclipse he pleads with Robin to kill him and end his hell, though Robin coldly refuses). His hatred for Robin seems to grow once he learns of Robin and Marian's marriage. He also grows increasingly antagonistic with the Sheriff, until a deal involving slaves to raise taxes for Prince John is foiled. The Sheriff sends Gisborne to be punished by Prince John. However, his time in the prince-regent's court proves fruitful, and he returns with members of the Prince's guard to kill Robin without interference. However, his younger sister Isabella arrives on the scene, and Gisborne is defeated again. It is revealed that Guy sold his sister into marriage at the age of 13 to finance his own career. Guy is shown initially to have a close relationship with Prince John, who seems to hold him in high esteem. He, therefore, is more than willing to demonstrate his loyalty by killing the Sheriff in Do You Love Me?. When installed as Sheriff, Guy learns that Isabella is league with the outlaws, and arranges an elaborate trap to kill her and Robin. When they survive, Prince John threatens to dismiss Guy, and he angrily tells him that he considers him \\"a fraud, a fake and \\"a pretender\\". The prince-regent attacks Guy only to fall into a pit, after telling Guy that his days as a free man are over. Isabella captures Guy in The King is Dead, Long Live the King... by poisoning his wound, throws him in the dungeons and sentences him to death. Squire Thornton, Isabella's estranged husband who briefly takes power as Sheriff, throws Isabella's feisty new companion, Meg, in a cell next to Guy's. At first Meg clearly states that she despises Guy, but after he helps her to quench her thirst and gives her some food she takes a liking to him. Guy also appears to show some of the decency he once showed Marian. After being released by Isabella, Meg feeds Guy before attempting to set him free by stealing the dungeon keys. However, Isabella catches Meg trying to free Gisborne, sentencing both to execution. The two then escape thanks to Robin, who agrees that Meg does not deserve death. However, Meg is stabbed during the escape. Guy flees with her, and after finding somewhere solitary he lays her down and the two kiss briefly. Meg then dies in Guy's arms. Some days later, Guy encounters Robin in Sherwood Forest and a fight nearly ensues, but he and Robin are rendered unconscious by two darts. When he awakes, a hooded figure speaks of he and Robin having a half-brother, Archer, who faces execution. They are spurred on to rescue him when the stranger reveals himself to be Robin's father. In the immediate aftermath, Guy and Robin agree to work together, but their relationship is immediately strained when an argument over their parents inevitably turns into a fight regarding Marian. Robin relents after Gisborne remarks he will never beg forgiveness as he cannot forgive himself. Robin spares Gisborne from the gang's wrath and together they head to York, where they are successful in escaping with Archer, but he is unwilling to form an alliance and decides to join up with his half-sister to get some money. In Something Worth Fighting For, Guy informs Robin that there is a secret entrance to Nottingham Castle constructed by the previous Sheriff, and that they can use it to seize the castle for a returning King Richard. He, Robin, and Much enter, but are submerged in limestone and left for dead. Archer then switches sides (after seeing Kate, Tuck, John, and several men from Lockley risk their lives for their freedom) and he and Kate free the trio to seize the castle. The gang then find the dead body of Allan at the castle gates. Their mourning is short-lived when Sheriff Vaisey returns to take back Nottingham. The gang, including Guy and Isabella, retreat into the castle. In the end, Gisborne refuses to abandon the outlaws and aids them in their final battle. Gisborne meets his end when the Sheriff and Isabella mortally wound him in a sword fight in a secret tunnel under Nottingham Castle. Gisborne tries to push Robin away from Isabella's blade, but only ends up placing himself in reach of the Sheriff and his sister, who both run him through without mercy. As he lies dying, Gisborne apologises to Robin for everything he has done to the outlaws, and the two old enemies make their peace with each other. In his final moments, Gisborne expresses regret that unlike Robin, he doesn't have someone waiting for him, musing on his unrequited love for Marian, and thanks Robin for allowing Gisborne to die with a sense of pride in himself, having lived a life of shame. His final words, \\"I am free\\", likely mean that, in death, he finally escaped the living hell his life had become. =Vaisey, Sheriff of Nottingham= The Sheriff of Nottingham is the main antagonist of the show. Keith Allen's portrayal was described by The Hollywood Reporter as \\"very camp in the Alan Rickman tradition of sardonic villains,\\" referring to Rickman's role as the Sheriff in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Cynical, sarcastic and with a dark sense of humour, he has many catch phrases, including \\"La di da di da!\\" and \\"A clue: no.\\" He also has an explosive temper, usually triggered by Robin's interference or the repeated failures of Gisborne and other minions. Vaisey becomes the Sheriff a few years before Robin's return to England, taking over from Marian's father Edward. He uses the position to become the leading figure in the Black Knights, a group conspiring to overthrow King Richard in favour of Prince John, and begins plotting the King's death in the second series. As a plot device to explain why Robin does not kill the Sheriff, John insures the latter's life by promising to destroy Nottingham should he be killed. Keith Allen lost one of his teeth while filming a fight sequence for the show. This was written into the script, with the Sheriff losing a tooth in the last episode of series 1. He takes teeth from skulls and places them in the gap as a recurring gag in the second series. In Sisterhood, the Sheriff's sister Davina is introduced, with whom he displays previously unseen affection. Davina dies in his arms after an altercation with Robin, for which the Sheriff vows revenge. Some time later, the Sheriff has the Black Knights sign the Great Pact of Nottingham, a document swearing the loyalty of the lords involved in the conspiracy to kill the King. Robin and the outlaws steal this document, and much of the second series sees the Sheriff foiled in his preparations to kill the King and retrieve the Pact, while Robin successfully sends word to the King regarding the Sheriff's plans. In the final episodes, the Sheriff and Gisborne decide to surprise and kill the King in the Holy Land, taking the captive Marian with them. Although the Sheriff sends mercenaries to kill Robin before leaving, the outlaws escape and pursue the Sheriff and Gisborne to the Holy Land, prompting them to send an agent to turn Richard against Robin, and then abandon Marian in the desert with him. The outlaws are freed by the King's personal bodyguard Carter, and save Richard from walking into the Sheriff's trap. The battle between the two sides enters a deserted village, where Vaisey shoots the King in the back and kills Carter. Although Gisborne kills Marian in cold blood, the arrival of the outlaws leaves the Sheriff badly outnumbered, and he is forced to retreat, with the attempt on King Richard's life a failure. In the third series, with the Black Knights having collapsed following their failure in the Holy Land, Prince John plays the Sheriff off against Gisborne until Do You Love Me?. Gisborne and the Sheriff fight to the death in a brutal confrontation, both goaded on by Prince John and their own motivations (Gisborne blaming Vaisey for Marian's death and Vaisey believing Gisborne to have failed him). Vaisey is quite surprised by their newfound mutual hatred, commenting that they once loved each other almost like father and son, implying there was more to them than two greedy and ambitious men out for power. The fight ends on the battlements where, as the Sheriff prepares to throw Gisborne to his death, Gisborne stabs him in the chest. The Sheriff seemingly dies, warning Gisborne not to trust Prince John. His death is blamed on Robin, but it is shown at the end of the episode that the Sheriff survived; as his apparently dead body is carted away, his hand clenches into a fist. The Sheriff returns in the series 3 finale: after killing Allan A Dale to prevent him warning the outlaws of his return, he arrives at Nottingham with a vast army in tow, just as Isabella has been ousted by the outlaws. It is assumed that Vaisey has been planning this for some time, as he has his second-in- command, a former minion of Isabella's called Blamire, weaken the city defences and pave the way for his return. Blamire flees the city before Isabella's downfall and informs his master that \\"the plan is in place\\". Satisfied, the Sheriff orders his army onto the attack. In the last episode of series 3, the Sheriff easily smashes aside Nottingham's defences and storms the city, and orders the entire population to be slaughtered. It is unknown whether this attack is being done on Prince John's orders, or for Vaisey's personal vengeance. His main goal, other than Nottingham's capture, is to ensure Robin's death and personally kill Gisborne, whose betrayal cuts him deeply. Though Vaisey succeeds in causing the deaths of Gisborne and Robin, Robin shoots a flaming arrow into Nottingham Castle, igniting the stored barrels of Byzantine fire inside. The Sheriff has just enough time to realise what is in the barrels before they explode, obliterating the castle, and killing him, Isabella and his entire army. =Marian= Lady Marian of Knighton, (known as Marian) portrayed by Lucy Griffiths, is the daughter of the former Sheriff of Nottingham. Marian is twenty-one years old, and in contrast to most Robin Hood legends, is not described as Maid Marian, but rather Lady Marian. \\"In those days [21] would be considered quite old to still be a maid,\\" actress Lucy Griffiths explained in the Radio Times preview.\\" She is engaged to Robin as a teenager, before he goes to fight in the crusades. She is visibly cold and aloof toward him on his return. Marian is initially disapproving of Robin's outlaw status because she believes that the best way to fight injustice is to work inside the system. However, she aids him in his fight against the Sheriff by frequently giving him inside information about the Sheriff's plots and deceives Gisbourne to do so. Marian also fights the Sheriff in her own right, disguising herself as the Night Watchman, giving the poor food and supplies. Marian is beautiful and carries some status with her, as the daughter of Edward, the old Sheriff. For those reasons, Guy of Gisbourne, a dispossessed lord and Vaisey's right-hand man, wants her as his wife. He is obsessive. She rebuffs his attentions, unable to look past his cruelty, but as time goes on, her status and beauty are not the only reasons why Guy wants her - he finds himself wondering if her pure heart and empathy could end his compulsive evil and bring about his redemption upon marriage. In the first series, she is coerced by Guy into agreeing to marry him when he suspects her of helping Robin. It is agreed the wedding will happen when King Richard returns to England. Though she does so to protect both herself and her father from his wrath. Marian is head-strong and no-nonsense, if often derisive of Robin's arrogance and cocky attitude towards her. But despite this, her ongoing love for him is evident as the series progresses, and they share many tender moments in secret. When King Richard appears to return to England (he is, in fact, an impostor), Marian must fulfill her promise, and Guy immediately prepares their wedding. In one final act of defiance against him, she dresses as the Night Watchman and attempts to steal from him, but he stabs her as she makes her escape, unaware that she is Marian. Djaq cares for her and manages to revive her. Robin and Marian express regret over the ending of their past involvement. Robin exclaiming that he should not have gone to war and left her. Before they can admit their love, they are interrupted by Djaq returning with medicine. Marian rests with Robin beside her. In the morning, Marian appears to have died, and the penultimate episode ends with Robin mourning over her body, repeating his love for her. The gang watch over. The Sheriff, accompanied by Sir Guy and his soldiers find the cave where Robin and the gang are hiding. Robin, overcome by grief, launches an attack on the soldiers. He is followed by the other members of the gang, resulting in the Sheriff and Guy retreating. It is revealed in the next episode that her body only briefly shut down as a result of a concoction that she had been given by the physician Pitts. Regaining her health shortly afterward, Marian questions Guy about his role in the Holy Land. His denial leaves Marian without a legal argument to break her engagement and arrives to marry Guy. Robin is heart- broken and decides to leave Nottingham. The wedding is interrupted by a frantic Much, who informs her that the King is an impostor, and that it is a ruse to weed out the Sheriff's enemies. In the hope of forgiveness, Guy admits that he knew of the plan, but Marian punches him and flees the wedding. Robin rides up on horseback to greet her and Much, and Marian rides off with him. When they arrive at the castle to expose the Sheriff's plot, she and Robin share a kiss. In the second series, Marian and her father are under house arrest in Nottingham Castle. Marian cannot travel out of the castle without an armed guard, although she has manages to on several occasions. Often avoiding an armed chaperon, Marian manages to successfully deliver information to Robin. In series 2, it is evident that Robin and Marian's relationship has grown stronger; however, Marian is still under the watchful eye of Guy, who is ignorant of her being the Night Watchman and Robin's informer. His feelings for her become deeper. However, she still remains faithful to Robin. She keeps a friendly relationship with Guy, which enables her to give information to Robin. When Allan A Dale is exposed as a traitor and becomes employed by Gisbourne openly, she threatens with death to persuade not to turn her over. When her father dies, she agrees to join Robin in Sherwood Forest. However, this is strenuous on their relationship. They reconcile and are able to acknowledge their mission is the foremost concern. In Lardner's Ring, episode 9, Robin proposes to Marian. She accepts. However, in order to preserve her alliance with Robin, Marian with a reluctant Robin's help, pretends she was captured by him. Guy believe the lie and she goes back to the castle. Marian hides the ring from Gisbourne, wearing it only in private. Towards the end of the series, Marian is exposed as the Nightwatchman, and prepared for execution. However, Guy decides to spare her if she agrees to never become the Night Watchman again. When she learns of the Sheriff's plan to kill King Richard in the Holy Land, she unsuccessfully tries to kill him, and is taken as a prisoner with Vaisey's party. In (We Are Robin Hood!), she tries to assassinate the Sheriff one last time, and is fated to join the outlaws to die in the desert. Having escaped this, Marian shields King Richard as Guy advances on the injured King. She admits her relationship with Robin and expresses that she would rather die than be with Guy, to which he responds by stabbing her with his sword. Only after this does Robin arrive, and Guy retreats with the Sheriff. Marian marries Robin while she lies mortally wounded. Pulling out the sword, knowing her fate. She dies in Robin's arms and is carried to her grave. They bury her alongside Carter (who also dies in the episode) in the Holy Land, beside an oasis and a palm tree. After her death, Robin Hood is distraught exclaiming to his men \\"There is no more Robin Hood! Robin Hood died with Marian in the Holy Land!\\". Robin sets out to avenge her death by killing Sir Guy. He is not successful but returns to lead his gang. In the series three finale, a poisoned Robin is visited by Marian as a vision. Robin expresses \\"I knew I would find you again\\" to which Marian replies \\"it's time - the greatest adventure is yet to come\\". They embrace and vanish to the afterlife. Robin finally at peace with his true love, is found by the other members of his gang and is given a ceremony and burial. =Little John= Little John, played by Gordon Kennedy, is a former resident of Locksley. John is outlawed many years before the show; his wife Alice and his son Little Little John believe that he is dead until Dead Man Walking. Prior to meeting Robin, John is the leader of an outlaw band in the forest consisting of Roysten White, Forrest, and Hanton. The band captures Robin, Much, and Allan at the end of the first episode, departing from the traditional meeting of John and Robin where they battle with quarterstaffs over who can cross a river first. \\"We had a different version for their meeting and we had something so horrible going on in the episode that a jolly fight was entirely inappropriate,\\" the programme's showrunner Dominic Minghella told the Radio Times. John dislikes Robin initially, but agrees to follow him when he realises that Robin can help the people of Locksley. He is unaware that Alice is still living in Locksley, or that she has had his son until Will Scarlett tells him. He is a bit cantankerous and bad-tempered, but loyal to the group, and reacts the most violently when he discovers the treachery of Roy and Allan A Dale. He also acts quite fatherly to some younger members, such as Will and Marian (both of whom lose their fathers in series 2), and Kate when she leaves her family in series 3. He is physically the strongest of the outlaws and generally fights with a quarterstaff. In the series three finale, Robin comes up with a plan to seize the castle for King Richards' return and he, Much, and Gisborne decide to enter the castle via a secret tunnel dug by the previous Sheriff. While the trio go down the tunnel, Tuck and John are tasked by Robin with entering the main gates of the castle, killing the guards, and seizing a goods train with the livestock and possessions of the Locksley villagers on board. Knowing that it may be some time before he and the gang can do another food drop, Robin tells John that the Lockley villagers must get their possessions back. However, realising that they are unwilling to fight to get them back, Tuck tells John that when the gates are opened they will sit in the road and block the way, forming a non-violent protest. John is shocked by Tuck's decision but reluctantly agrees. When Tuck is shot with an arrow by Isabella, John is ready to defend his friend, but Tuck stops John from attacking the guards. Kate then joins them and tells the guards that if they want to kill John, Tuck, and the men from Locksley then Isabella will have to kill her first. As the guards prepare to kill them, Archer saves them and a fight breaks out with Tuck, John, and the men from Locksley taking on the guards. They are successful and seize the castle for King Richard. While the gang celebrate capturing Isabella and the castle, Much finds a body and the gang discover it to be that of Allan A Dale, who the gang accused of being a traitor after Isabella pardoned him for helping her earlier in the episode. John, along with the rest of the gang, is then angry at himself for not believing Allan's claims of innocence, and he carries Allan's body into the castle as the gang retreat inside after Gisborne spots an army approaching on the horizon. At the end of the 2009 finale, Little John, along with the remaining outlaws, promises to continue fighting injustice in Robin Hood's name after Robin's death. =Much= Much, portrayed by Sam Troughton, is Robin's right-hand man and best friend. He was Robin's manservant before and during their service in the King's guard in the Holy Land. Much is known to be rather daft, forever hungry, and committed to both Robin and his cause. Much yearns for the quiet life: the warmth of the home fire and a little well- earned luxury. He often gets into scrapes (particularly in series 1), from which Robin has to rescue him. He is the voice of reason fear, undercutting Robin's idealism. Much likes orderly living in the outlaws' camp and is usually the chef, complaining that he has to catch and cook the food. Much makes it obvious that he does not want be in the forest, but if he weren't at his best friend's side, he would wither and die. He often complains that Robin continues to treat him like a servant and doesn't listen to his opinion, although the root of these complaints is that Robin refuses to discuss the horrors the pair witnessed in the Holy Land. Both characters experience PTSD. Over the three series, Much matures somewhat during his life as an outlaw, due to the horrible situations that he witnesses. He is still best friends with Robin, and Much proves that he will always support his leader, no matter how unsavoury the mission. In the first series, he is rewarded the estate of Bonchurch for his heroism in the Holy Land, and briefly takes up his role as lord of the manor there. He falls in love with his servant Eve, who is a spy for the Sheriff. After choosing to return to the outlaws, Much promises that he will find Eve once peace and justice are brought to England. In the third series he develops secret feelings for Kate, who does not feel the same way and only considers him to be a friend. In the 2009 series finale, Much is shown wanting revenge against the Sheriff of Nottingham for Allan's murder. He is shocked when he finds out that Robin has been poisoned and distraught when he makes his final goodbyes. He and everyone else in the gang vow to keep fighting in his name. =Allan A Dale= In contrast to the traditional depiction of Alan-a-Dale as a minstrel, Allan (played by Joe Armstrong) is an opportunist and pathological liar. In the first series' premiere, he is rescued by Robin after being caught poaching. He attempts to escape punishment by claiming he is a resident of Locksley to gain Robin's pardon, but only succeeds in joining the fate of hanging. He joins Robin as an outlaw after being saved from the noose. He claims to have come from Rochdale, hence his surname. His brother Tom, also a compulsive liar and thief, is hanged by the Sheriff in Brothers in Arms. Allan uses a sword in most fights in the first two series, but takes to fighting with two in the third. In the second series, Allan becomes a reluctant informer for Guy of Gisborne, agreeing to spy on Robin for money and release from Nottingham's dungeon. After his betrayal is unmasked by Robin, he enters Gisborne's service. He provides Gisborne with vital information about the outlaws, but protects some secrets such as Marian's identity as the Night Watchman and the location of the camp (partly out of a guilty conscience, but also due to Marian's threats to kill him if he reveals this information). In A Good Day to Die, he leaves Gisborne to rescue Robin and the others, rejoining them in time for their voyage to the Holy Land. At the start of series three, Allan and the rest of the gang have been travelling for months since they ventured off into the Holy Land, and an exhausted and heartbroken Robin (following Marian's murder) calls Allan a traitor to dismiss him and the rest of the gang. During series three, Allan is reminded on numerous occasions that he once betrayed their loyalty, and throughout the series he tries to prove that he is back on their side. Allan also appears to have feelings towards Locksley villager Kate, but backs down slightly when he hears that Much also has interest in her. In Something Worth Fighting For - Part One, Sheriff Isabella tries to break Robin's gang down by making false accusations about certain members. She informs Nottingham that Allan has been pardoned for all his previous crimes by helping her. Realising that they have nearly been foiled occasionally, the gang are unsure whether to believe Allan when he claims his innocence. Seeing they still have little faith in him, Allan tries to leave but is tied up. When the gang have gone to Nottingham to seize the castle, Allan breaks free and, tired with the gang's mistrust of him, leaves to make his own way. However, he sees an army approaching Nottingham and, recognising its leader, decides that he has to warn his friends. He is discovered by several guards and manages to fight his way free, only to be killed in a hail of arrows (one to the leg and three to the back) as he makes a run for it. Before dying, he has enough time to recognise his killer; he is shocked to see an old face has returned (Vaisey, The Old Sheriff). After being killed by Vaisey, his body is wrapped and left at the entrance to Nottingham Castle, where it is later found by Much. As they mourn their loss, the outlaws see the old Sheriff and his army approaching. They then retreat into the castle, with Little John carrying Allan's body. They cremate him shortly afterwards, all deeply hurt by his death and guilty over their mistrust. At the cremation, Allan is referred to as \\"our loyal friend\\". =Will Scarlett= The youngest member of the group at nineteen, Will (played by Harry Lloyd) is the son of Locksley's carpenter. Prior to the first episode, his mother dies from starvation and his father loses a hand in punishment for Will and his brother poaching food to survive. In the first series' premier, he is to be hanged for stealing flour, but is saved by Robin, whom he joins in the forest as an outlaw. In contrast with the traditionally hot-tempered Will Scarlet, this incarnation is generally slow to anger, quiet, shy, and often a voice of reason. He seems to get on best with Allan before he betrays them, perhaps because they share the same experience of nearly being hanged. He also seems to get on well with John, who seems to take the role of father to the younger outlaws. Because of his knowledge of carpentry, he often finds unique ways of helping the gang; he is the architect for the secret camp constructed prior to the second series, and disguises weapons as instruments when infiltrating a fair. He usually fights with an axe, using a smaller one for carpentry. He learns that Djaq is really a woman before the other outlaws, and soon realizes he is falling in love with her. In The Return of the King, Will and Allan consider leaving the outlaws to go to Scarborough and stay with Will's family. However, in A Clue: No, they decide against it, only to return to the news that Marian is dead. Will is the only one seen with tears at her body. In The Angel of Death, Will's father Dan is killed by the Sheriff. Mad with grief, Will sets out to poison the Sheriff, in spite of the destruction of Nottingham that would result. Only after he is led to believe Robin is dying after drinking the poison does he relent. In A Good Day to Die, he finds out that Djaq loved him from the very beginning and she thinks herself foolish for not admitting it. They kiss and then fight for each other's lives. At the end of We Are Robin Hood!, he decides to stay in the Holy Land with Djaq, and it is implied they are to be married. He bids Robin farewell by holding his tag, and declaring \\"We are Robin Hood!\\" for the last time. Will does not appear in the third series. =Djaq= Introduced in the episode Turk Flu, Djaq (played by Anjali Jay) is a Saracen who is being transported as a slave. Her true name is Saffiya, but she disguises herself as a boy by adopting her dead twin brother's name and appearance. Though Robin's outlaws are shocked when Will reveals that she is a woman, they permit her to stay. She maintains her disguise as a boy in Series 1 to protect herself in the event of her capture by the Sheriff, although Vaisey sees through the ruse after he takes her prisoner, and she adopts a more feminine attire in series 2. Djaq's father is a physician, and she herself has considerable knowledge of medicine and chemistry, which she uses to serve as the group's medic and to create black powder. She expresses fondness for the entire gang of outlaws, even Allan following his defection. In A Good Day to Die, she and Will express their mutual love for each other; they remain in the Holy Land at the end of the second series. It is implied that they are going to marry. Djaq is not one of the traditional characters in the Robin Hood legends, although she does follow in the latter-day tradition of a Saracen character being added to the band of outlaws. (See Nasir in Robin of Sherwood from the 1980s, Azeem (a Moor) from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in 1991, Achoo from Robin Hood: Men in Tights in 1993 and Kemal from The New Adventures of Robin Hood from the 1990s). She is, however, the first female Saracen character to feature in this role. Djaq does not appear in the third series. =Tuck= Played by David Harewood, he is a warrior monk. Tuck trains as a priest at Fountains Abbey, but he becomes more and more disillusioned with the corruption of church and state and is eventually kicked out for his outspoken views. He travels as a monk across Europe, and his experiences from his travels and his years in the Abbey make him realise that time is running out for England: something has to be done now to stop the corruption. An outspoken, passionate character who generally favours taking action, Tuck's left-field thinking can either be ingenious or make him a liability, particularly if goes against Robin's orders and if the plans go wrong. However, Robin can see the value in Tuck; he is strong and wise, an inspiring second in command. His passion for the cause is infectious and binds the outlaws strongly together. =Prince John= Prince John, portrayed by Toby Stephens, is the tyrannical ruler of England in Richard the Lionheart's absence. Depicted as effeminate, paranoid, and narcissistic, he is desperate for admiration and is constantly demanding that his subjects tell him how much they love him. John is also noted for being as ruthless and sadistic as the Sheriff, ordering Locksley's church, full of adoring villagers, to be burned down while a wedding takes place inside. John is obsessively determined to usurp his brother Richard the Lionheart's throne and become King of England, a position which he feels greatly entitled to, particularly since he feels it was their father Henry II's wish that he become king. He is shown to possess a high level of charisma and intelligence, but also a fiery temper with unpredictable mood swings. He reacts violently to criticism and is oblivious to why the people of England don't love him, despite his vicious treatment of them. In the second episode in which he appears, John appears to have succumbed to the fact that the English people have no affection for him, saying \\"If you won't love me, then by God, you'll fear me.\\" He is also manipulative, turning Sheriff Vaisey and Guy of Gisborne against each other for nothing other than his personal amusement by playing on their increasing mutual hatred. John appears somewhat emotionally immature and is easily bored, with his catchphrases being \\"Do you love me?\\", \\"Long live me.\\" and \\"Bored now.\\" In The King is Dead, Long Live the King, it is revealed that John is consumed with anger and hatred toward his brother Richard, whom he sees as having usurped their mother's affection and overshadowed him. Despite his envy of Richard, John still holds himself to be absolutely superior to his brother and believes that he is destined for the throne. John has a waxwork made of Richard to try to fool people into thinking Richard is dead, so that John can become king. However, Robin Hood and the gang discover this and stop the coronation. Prince John leaves Nottingham after installing Isabella as Sheriff. John is shown to be a capable swordsman, having engaged Robin and Guy (both highly skilled swordsmen) in combat, despite the historical King John I's supposed lack of military prowess, which earned him the epithet \\"Softsword\\". =Isabella= Lady Isabella of Gisborne (formerly Thornton), played by Lara Pulver, is the attractive but power hungry sister of Gisborne. When she appears in Series 3 she is on the verge of becoming Robin's new love interest and 'spy in the enemy camp' at Nottingham. She is very bitter towards Guy because he sold her to her husband, Squire Thornton, when she was thirteen to finance his own political career. Thorton was abusive and cruel to his wife to the point where she fled from her marital home. She is introduced in episode 5 of series 3, having recently escaped, and is saved by Robin in the forest. Her brother catches her in the company of the outlaws and she throws herself on his mercy. In episode 6 she begins a romantic relationship with Robin and begins to flirt with Prince John in order to compete for his favour with her brother. In episode 7 her relationship with Robin is discovered by Prince John and Guy. After escaping certain death, she tries to convince Robin to leave Sherwood, but he refuses to abandon his cause, having already suffered great pain after Marian's death. An angry Isabella turns on him and joins Prince John's side (after telling him how Gisborne planned to let her live) thus regaining the prince's respect. In episode 8, he appoints Isabella the new Sheriff of Nottingham after Gisborne is outlawed and imprisoned. She briefly appoints a fellow feminist like herself, Meg, as her deputy, but former husband Thornton arrives, wresting control over Nottingham from her and imprisoning Meg. Robin Hood saves Meg and Guy, but Meg later dies in the arms of Guy. After his cruel treatment becomes too much, she enlists Robin to get rid of him. Robin locks Thornton in an asylum with a threat to kill him if he returns, but he ignores the warning, determined to have his revenge. After Thornton corners her in chapel, Isabella deceives and kills him. Meanwhile, Meg grows attached to Guy while in the dungeons, so Isabella orders her to be beheaded alongside him. Robin rescues the pair, but Meg is injured in the escape and dies in Guy's arms. Feeling abandoned by on all sides, Isabella gives into her ambition and turns against the outlaws forever, becoming a tyrant as cruel as Vaisey. Isabella's half- brother, Archer, made her an enemy of the Sheriff of York after Robin and Gisborne freed him from the dungeons. In the episode Something Worth Fighting For, she makes an uneasy allegiance with Archer to kill Robin and Guy in a trap Archer has created within a secret tunnel. However, she treats him with nothing but contempt, disgusted that her beloved mother had a bastard child that could be so devious and conniving. Isabella also persuades Kate's mother to plant half a locket on Robin's person (the other belonging to Isabella) to fool Kate into thinking Robin still loves Isabella, also issuing a pardon to Allan A Dale. This plan fails as Kate's mother tells the truth, but Allan vows to leave Sherwood, only to die at the hands of Vaisey. Isabella is eventually captured by the outlaws and barricaded inside the castle when Vaisey arrives with an army. Isabella escapes her captivity in the series finale and joins Vaisey, giving her title as Sheriff up to him in exchange for her own life. She aids his attack through a secret tunnel into Nottingham and dispatches two of the most significant defenders: Robin and Gisborne, having simultaneously with the Sheriff fatally wounded her brother, and striking Robin with a poisoned dagger. As the outlaws retreat and the Sheriff marches through the tunnel, Isabella seems to give a remorseful last look at her brother's corpse, but stops when Vaisey remarks that there is no time for sentimentality. Ultimately, Isabella perishes when Robin detonates a store of explosive Byzantine fire and Nottingham Castle is destroyed with Isabella and the Sheriff inside. =Kate of Locksley= Kate is a local girl from Locksley village. Her brother is sold to Irish warriors with drastic results (her efforts to free him end with her capture and his death at the hands of Gisborne). She is hot-headed and, although well-meaning, her outspokenness can have dramatic consequences for others around her. She is played by Joanne Froggatt. Much develops feelings towards her, and in Lost in Translation, after unhelpful advice from Allan (who also flirts with her), Much makes his feelings plain and she rejects him harshly. Her character seems to replace Djaq and to an extent Marian as the only female outlaw. Kate is jealous of Robin's interest towards Isabella. She gives him a kiss on the cheek after he rescues her. In episode 9, Robin and Kate kiss and she shares her feelings for him very clearly. At the end of the same episode Robin tells her he does care for her, though it is heavily implied that he doesn't love her as he did Marian, and doesn't believe he ever will. When Robin is dying at the end of the series, Kate tries to give him a final kiss, but he deliberately turns away from her and settles for just hugging her before he leaves to die alone. Recurring characters =Royston White= One of the original forest outlaws, Royston White is introduced at the end of the first episode as part of Little John's band, portrayed by William Beck. Little John and Roy originally dislike the others, but, after persuasion, accept Robin's leadership. In the fourth episode, Parent Hood, Royston is captured, imprisoned, and tortured by Sir Guy. The Sheriff arrests his mother Mary White and in exchange for her life Roy is instructed to assassinate Robin. He tries, but fails. In the gang's attempt to rescue his mother from being hanged at Nottingham Castle, Royston sacrifices his own life and is slain by the Sheriff's henchmen, while shouting \\"My name is Royston White, I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard!\\" =Archer= Archer is the son of Lady Ghislaine, the mother of Isabella and Guy of Gisborne, and Robin Hood's father, Lord Locksley, making him half-brother to Robin, Guy, and Isabella. He gets his name from the distinctive arrow-shaped birthmark on his stomach. He is played by Clive Standen. Archer makes an enemy of the Sheriff of York and is sentenced to death after he claims he can turn useless metal into gold, along with being discovered having an affair with the Sheriff's wife. He is later rescued from York by Robin and Gisborne after the pair are informed by Robin's dying father that he is their half-brother. When Archer realises that both Robin and Guy gave up their money and land the minute they became outlaws, he is unimpressed and takes Robin hostage so he can escape, especially when he learns his half-sister is the exceedingly wealthy Sheriff of Nottingham. However, the plan fails, and Archer and the others have to rely on Robin's gang to save them from death. After escaping from York, he heads to Nottingham where he meets his half-sister Sheriff Isabella, with whom he makes a deal to trap and kill Robin and Guy when they enter a secret tunnel constructed by Vaisey to reach and seize the castle. He is successful in doing this and Robin and Guy are nearly killed after they are submerged in limestone. Archer is then paid and told by Isabella to leave Nottingham forever, as she has nothing but contempt for him, because she sees his existence as defiling the memory of her beloved mother. As he leaves, he sees Little John, Brother Tuck, and the men from Locksley village sitting outside the castle blocking anyone and anything from leaving until they get their crops, animals, and possessions back. Seeing that Tuck, John, and the men are willing to risk their lives to fight for themselves, King, and country, Archer kills several guards, helps Kate free Robin, and then helps the gang seize the castle moments before Vaisey returns with a vengeance. Archer is shocked and scared when Vaisey uses Byzantine fire to bomb Nottingham. He admits to being the one who sold Vaisey the ingredients in the first place, leading to an argument with Robin. When Robin is poisoned by Isabella, Archer finally sees what it is to be a true hero and becomes a member of Robin's gang. He and Tuck then create their own Byzantine fire. When Robin is about to die he helps him to reach Vaisey in time, Robin then kills Vaisey with his last bit of strength. Archer is amongst the mourners at Robin's funeral in Sherwood. Following the deaths of Guy of Gisborne and Robin Hood of Locksley, Archer vows to continue the fight against Prince John. =Edward= Edward, played by Michael Elwyn, is Marian's father, and the former Sheriff of Nottingham. He is replaced by Vaisey, but is able to attain status as the lord of Knighton Manor. Unbeknownst to Edward, his daughter is secretly the Night Watchman, a masked figure who delivers food, medicine, and supplies to the poor of Nottingham. Edward discovers this in Turk Flu. He is initially angry at Marian's deception, fearing for her and his own safety, but begrudgingly accepts who his daughter truly is. When Edward discovers that King Richard is returning in the penultimate episode of the first series, he organises an uprising of loyal nobles to give evidence against the Sheriff in order to prevent the King's assassination. Unbeknownst to the nobles, the King is in truth an impostor, hired to aid the Sheriff in flushing out his enemies. However, Edward is warned of the plot, and prevented from giving evidence to a disguised Sheriff by Robin. However, the Sheriff still does not trust Edward and Marian, and has Gisborne torch Knighton Hall and place the two of them under house arrest. When Marian forces the Sheriff to give up black diamonds, the Sheriff imprisons Edward in the dungeons as punishment. However, Edward is able to escape the dungeons, and aids Robin in stealing the Great Pact of Nottingham, a charter forcing members of the regicidally treacherous organisation, the Black Knights, to sign their loyalty. Edward is stabbed by Canon Birkley, and gives the Great Pact to Robin. His last words are a message for his daughter: \\"it's good to dream.\\" References External links *\\"Characters and Actors\\" page on the official Robin Hood website at bbc.co.uk Characters Robin Hood nl:Robin Hood (2006)#Cast ","title":"List of Robin Hood (2006 TV series) characters"},{"id":"8891056","text":"Carbona may refer to: * Carbona (moth), a genus of moth * Carbona, California, United States * Carbonne (Occitan: Carbona), France * Delta Carbona L.P., an American chemical company, maker of Carbona Cleaning Fluid ","title":"Carbona"},{"id":"8891069","text":"Wis≈Çok G√≥rny is a village in the Sanok County in the East Ma≈Çopolska in the Lesser Beskid mountains.

However, the BBC's News department stoutly maintained its independence from colleagues in Current Affairs, and the first 15 minutes of news was almost a separate programme, followed by 20 minutes from BBC regional news before the final 25 minutes of national current affairs. Accordingly the format was unwieldy, with neither the conciseness of a bulletin nor the softness of the show's predecessor, Nationwide. The editor, David Lloyd, poached Nick Ross from the highly popular Breakfast Time to front the show, along with Desmond Wilcox, Sarah Kennedy, and Sally Magnusson. Kennedy was unable to join the team at the programme's launch, but eventually began to present the show after Wilcox was dismissed early in the show's run. The news bulletins were usually read by Jan Leeming, Moira Stuart or Richard Whitmore. The opening titles were designed by Terry Hylton and produced by the Computer Film Company. As with its predecessor Nationwide, Sixty Minutes was also responsible for the evening regional news output for London and the South East. Whereas all the other BBC regions had their own dedicated news bulletins, Sixty Minutes presenters would read the latest news for London and the South East, simply titled \\"South East\\".http://www2.tv- ark.org.uk/bbc_se_and_ldn/bbc_se_early_news.htmlhttp://www.tv- ark.org.uk/mivana/mediaplayer.php?id=8ef8b25fa3fabb1713d924cd26264dfa&media;=bbc60minutessoutheast1984&type;=mp4 The programme was not well received, and although its ratings eventually began to improve it broadcast its final edition on Friday 27 July 1984. Throughout August, BBC1 reverted to placing the early evening news at 5.40pm followed by the regional news magazines, before launching a new schedule on 3 September 1984 with the Six O'clock News; that programme remained in place as of 2020. Arguably, another legacy of Sixty Minutes was the eventual integration of the BBC News and Current Affairs departments.

The crash led to the longest missing aircraft search in the state's history, lasting almost three years. Media attention eventually resulted in Congressional legislation mandating improved Emergency locator transmitters (ELT) be installed in U.S.-registered business jets.  Crash information  The aircraft involved, registration N388LS, was operated by the Aircraft Charter Group and flown by pilots Johan Schwartz and Patrick Hayes for a repositioning flight to Lebanon, New Hampshire. They left Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport, Connecticut at 09:19am and 25 minutes later were flying the approach into Lebanon Municipal Airport. After one attempt at the ILS approach, the crew reported that they were unable to receive the localizer, when they were actually several miles off course. They presumed ground equipment failure, and the pilot told the tower that he was executing a missed approach. The aircraft's last radar contact was as it proceeded outbound, seven nautical miles (13 km) northeast of the VOR, at .Detailed NTSB report of the crash As the business jet neared the inbound course to the VOR, the captain called out the outer marker. The first officer agreed, and the captain stated that they could descend to 2,300 feet. Shortly thereafter, the first officer stated that he was descending the aircraft to 2,300 feet. Three seconds later, the Learjet impacted trees, then terrain. The wreckage was located at an altitude of 2,300 feet, on rising mountainous terrain, 061 degrees magnetic, 12.5 nautical miles from the VOR. It was raining and foggy at the time. Searches were mounted, unsuccessfully. The wreckage was found near Smarts Mountain almost three years later, on November 13, 1999, about from the airport. Debris was spread over a area in dense forest. The aircraft had descended into the ground earlier than normal. The cause of the accident was listed as:  ELT implications  The crashed aircraft had no Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) on board, as that class of aircraft when used for FAR Part 135 charter operations, was exempt from the Federal requirements for this type of beacon.

It was formed in 1981 and called for major liberalising reforms such as democratic elections, a free press, and the separation of powers. During the 1980s, it pursued a campaign of armed opposition to the Gaddafi regime and made several coup attempts, the most notable being its 1984 armed assault on Gaddafi's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli. After the failure of this and several other coup attempts the group largely abandoned militancy, and instead used peaceful tactics to promote reform in Libya; in 2005, the NFSL joined with six other groups to form the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition. With the fall of the Gaddafi regime in the 2011 Libyan Civil War, the NFSL's main long- term goal was fulfilled. Consequently, after the war's end, the NFSL dissolved itself and was replaced by the National Front Party, which won 3 seats in the 2012 General National Congress election. The NFSL's founder and former leader, Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf was appointed Chairman of the General National Congress, effectively making him interim head of state.  History  Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, a former Libyan ambassador to India, founded the NFSL on 7 October 1981, at a press conference held in Khartoum, Sudan. The group was allowed to operate out of Sudan until 1985, when the country's leader, Gaafar Nimeiry was ousted in a coup d'√©tat. The NFSL launched a wide campaign to topple the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, establishing a short-wave radio station, a commando military training camp and also published a bi-monthly newsletter, Al Inqadh (Salvation). According to various sources, the group was supported by the government of Saudi Arabia, and the United States' Central Intelligence Agency. On 17 April 1984, the NFSL organised a demonstration of Libyan dissidents outside the Libyan embassy in London. During the demonstration, shots were fired from the embassy into the group of protestors, striking eleven people, including one of the police officers controlling the demonstration, Yvonne Fletcher, who died shortly afterward. Fletcher's murder quickly led to the severing of diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya. = Military action = Flag of the NFSL. Three weeks after the embassy protest, on 8 May 1984, NFSL commandos took part in an attack on Gaddafi's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli, in an attempt to assassinate the Libyan leader. The attack was thwarted when the group's leader, Ahmed Ibrahim Ihwas, was captured when trying to enter Libya at the Tunisian border. Although the coup attempt failed and Gaddafi escaped unscathed, dissident groups claimed that some eighty Libyans, Cubans, and East Germans had been killed in the operation. Some 2,000 people were arrested in Libya following the attack, and eight were hanged publicly. NFSL continued its efforts to topple Gaddafi and formed the Libyan National Army (LNA), after a group of soldiers, taken prisoner by Chad during the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, defected from the Libyan Army and joined the NFSL in 1987. The LNA was later evacuated from Chad after the President Hiss√®ne Habr√© was overthrown by one of his former officers, Idriss D√©by, who was backed by Gaddafi. = Political opposition = Having apparently given up the idea of a military takeover, the NFSL continued its opposition to Gaddafi by media campaigns and forming political alliances with other opposition groups. The NFSL was one of seven other Libyan opposition groups that formed the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO) which was founded in June 2005 at the first NCLO conference in London. The NFSL and three other organizations withdrew from this alliance in February 2008 citing differences of opinion. In a statement issued by the NFSL on 28 February 2008, the NFSL announced its withdrawal from the NCLO due to what it called \\"straying away from the 'National Accord of 2005'\\". The NFSL continued its media campaigns, primarily utilizing online mediums. Though relatively weaker than before, and without a clear method of carrying out its objective of toppling the Gaddafi regime, the NFSL continued to be recognized as the leading opposition movement to Col. Gaddafi's rule of Libya. After the 2011 Libyan Civil War, the group's leaders were allowed to return to Libya. However, with the fall of the Gaddafi regime the NFSL lost its raison d'√™tre, and thus it dissolved itself on 9 May 2012 and was replaced by the National Front Party, which won 3 seats in the General National Congress election, Libya's first free election in more than 40 years.National Front for Salvation of Libya forms political party, outlines plans. Organization The NFSL organizational structure was based on two primary bodies, the National Congress (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸä) and the Permanent Bureau (ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ™ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ¶ŸÖ). The National Congress was the highest authority in the NFSL. The Permanent Bureau was elected during National Congress sessions and represented the legislative authority when it was not in session. The Permanent Bureau was also responsible for overseeing the executive body of the NFSL. The Executive Committee (ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÜŸÅÿ∞Ÿäÿ©) was led by the Secretary-General, who was also elected during National Congress sessions. The Executive Committee was made up of several Commissioners who each oversaw different programs of the opposition organization, as well as the Deputy Secretary-General. At the time of the group's dissolution in 2012, the NFSL Executive Committee was led by Secretary-General Ibrahim Abdulaziz Sahad, who was re-elected for his second term during the 5th National Congress held in July 2007 in the United States. Sahad appointed Mohammed Ali Abdallah as his Deputy. The Permanent Bureau was led by Fawzi al-Tarabulsi, who had previously been elected Vice President of the National Congress and became President upon Dr. Suleiman Abdalla's resignation as President in 2008. The Bureau's leadership also included Vice- President Mohamed Saad and Rapporteur of the Bureau Mohamed Ali Binwasil.

He appeared as a regular on the ABC series San Pedro Beach Bums, General Hospital, Cagney and Lacey, CHiPs, The Rockford Files and Baretta. He also had lead or guest roles in 14 feature films. He was an on-camera reporter for the television shows Hard Copy and Inside Edition. Earlier, he worked as a police officer and as an investigator.  Life and work  DeRose was born in Brooklyn, New York and at age five he went into an orphanage in New Jersey. Jersey ultimately became his home after he got out of the orphanage. He is the founder and president of Last Chance for Animals (LCA) and the author of the book In Your Face: From Actor to Animal Activist, also translated in Italian, A Muso Duro. DeRose has been arrested 12 times and jailed four times for opposing animal cruelty, including his participation in a break-in at the UCLA Brain Research Institute in 1988. The coverage was aired worldwide by CNN and was responsible for shedding light on the question of Vivisection and what lies behind the locked doors of research facilities. DeRose was fired from General Hospital when he was sentenced to jail for the break-in. DeRose appeared in the 2006 HBO Documentary, Dealing Dogs, along with an undercover animal rights activist known as \\"Pete\\" and other investigators of Last Chance for Animals. Together, they uncovered mistreatment of animals on a large scale at Class B animal dealer, C.C. Baird at Martin Creek Kennels in Arkansas. They were successful in closing down the operation (which was the largest in the country), saving countless thousands of dogs each year. Subsequently, homes were found for the hundreds of abused dogs that were going to be sold to labs for experimentation. Dealing Dogs profiles LCA's undercover investigation that was designed to expose Martin Creek Kennel's inhumane treatment of dogs and violations of the Animal Welfare Act. DeRose said he hoped Dealing Dogs would speed the passage of the Pet Safety and Protection Act, which, when passed, will put Class B dealers out of business. DeRose arranged for two undercover Asian operatives to secretly videotape the butchering of a dog for food from Wisconsin Class B animal dealer Irving Stebane for the Hmong community. Felony charges were filed against the dealer, but in June 1993, Calumet County circuit judge Donald Poppy ruled the case constituted illegal entrapment and ordered the return of 143 dogs which had been seized. None of these dogs ever got back in the hands of Stebane. DeRose had arranged for all the dogs to be rescued and scattered throughout the state of Wisconsin with the help of dozens of rescue groups and individuals. He vowed two things: 1) \\"Not one of these dogs will ever go back in the hands of Stebane,\\" and 2) \\"I will put Stebane permanently out of business.\\" Which he did. \\"I made a painful decision,\\" DeRose admits, \\"and a dog died. No one knows that better than me. But remember, none of these dogs were going to Disneyland. They were either going to be butchered for food or suffer in a lab experiment. This dog experienced the lesser of the two evils but most importantly, it was all documented. This dog did not die in vain. This is what put Stebane out of business permanently.\\" At the time, Stebane was the largest Class B dealer responsible for at least 5000-6000 dogs a year being killed. Most of the dogs were people‚Äôs pets. DeRose went on to say that, \\"I don‚Äôt care what people think of my direct methods. I just want to do what is best for the animals and as efficiently as possible. Only two people of importance had doubts about the Stebane operation until they spoke with me and saw the big picture.\\" DeRose reminds us again the dog‚Äôs death was imminent, with or without the presence of a camera, and the camera brought a significant degree of meaning to its sacrifice. Indeed, the public outrage precipitated by the case galvanized not only the community, but drew the attention of U.S. Representative Toby Roth (D-WI), who introduced the Stebane Bill,\\"legislation designed to strengthen penalties for violations of the Animal Welfare Act.\\" Roth also wrote a letter to Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture, voicing his deep concerns with unlawful Class B dealer activities. His sentiments are echoed by U.S. Senator Fiengold (R-WI). DeRose received the 1997 Courage of Conscience International Peace Award for his commitment to saving animals and exposing animal abuse in entertainment, medical research and food production. In 2006, he became the Director of Animal Welfare (DAW) for West Hollywood, California. On March 4, 2008, DeRose posted a video response to YouTube calling out the American Marine, David Motari, who threw a puppy off a cliff in Iraq. DeRose called Motari a coward and stated he was disturbed by the video. (2008-03-04). Retrieved on 2008-03-07.

The group was named by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2002. Its name means \\"new walls\\", reflecting his hypothesis that it evolved from Bacteria, and one of the major changes was the replacement of peptidoglycan cell walls with other glycoproteins. , the neomuran hypothesis is not accepted by most workers; molecular phylogenies suggest that eukaryotes are most closely related to one group of archaeans and evolved from them, rather than forming a clade with all archaeans.  Morphology  Considered as a clade, the Neomura are a very diverse group, containing all of the multicellular species, as well as all of the most extremophilic species, but they all share certain molecular characteristics. All neomurans have histones to help with chromosome packaging, and most have introns. All use the molecule methionine as the initiator amino acid for protein synthesis (bacteria use formylmethionine). Finally, all neomurans use several kinds of RNA polymerase, whereas bacteria use only one.  Phylogeny  There are several hypotheses for the phylogenetic relationships between archaeans and eukaryotes. = Three domains view = When Carl Woese first published his three-domain system, it was believed that the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota were equally old and equally related on the tree of life. However certain evidence began to suggest that Eukaryota and Archaea were more closely related to each other than either was to Bacteria. This evidence included the common use of cholesterols and proteasomes, which are complex molecules not found in most bacteria, leading to the inference that the root of life lay between Bacteria on the one hand, and Archaea and Eukaryota combined on the other, i.e. that there were two primary branches of life subsequent to the LUCA ‚Äì Bacteria and Neomura (not then called by this name). The \\"three primary domains\\" (3D) scenario was one of the two hypotheses considered plausible in a 2010 review of the origin of eukaryotes. = Derived clade view = In a 2002 paper, and subsequent papers, Thomas Cavalier-Smith and coworkers have promulgated a hypothesis that Neomura was a clade deeply nested with Eubacteria with Actinobacteria as its sister group. He wrote, \\"Eukaryotes and archaebacteria form the clade neomura and are sisters, as shown decisively by genes fragmented only in archaebacteria and by many sequence trees. This sisterhood refutes all theories that eukaryotes originated by merging an archaebacterium and an Œ±-proteobacterium, which also fail to account for numerous features shared specifically by eukaryotes and actinobacteria.\\" These include the presence of cholesterols and proteasomes in Actinobacteria as well as in Neomura. Features of this complexity are unlikely to evolve more than once in separate branches, so either there was a horizontal transfer of those two pathways, or Neomura evolved from this particular branch of the bacterial tree. = Two domains view = As early as 2010, the major competitor to the three domains scenario for the origin of eukaryotes was the \\"two domains\\" (2D) scenario, in which eukaryotes emerged from within the archaea. The discovery of a major group within the Archaea, Lokiarchaeota, to which eukaryotes are more genetically similar than to other archaeans, is not consistent with the Neomura hypothesis. Instead, it supports the hypothesis that eukaryotes emerged from within one group of archaeans: A 2016 study using 16 universally- conserved ribosomal proteins supports the 2D view. Its \\"new view of the tree of life\\" shows eukaryotes as a small group nested within Archaea, in particular within the TACK superphylum. However, the origin of eukaryotes remains unresolved, and the two domain and three domain scenarios remain viable hypotheses.

Batavia High School is a public high school located in Batavia, Ohio. It is the only high school in the Batavia Local School District. It has about 625 students, and recently started open enrollment. The school mascot is the Bulldog. The school is located 20 miles east of Cincinnati within the village of Batavia, which is a village of about 1,700 people and is the county seat of Clermont County. The school district encompasses the village and surrounding areas serving a total population of approximately 14,300. Batavia High School is a participant with the Southern Buckeye Conference, or SBAAC, and the rival of the Batavia Bulldog sports teams are the Williamsburg Wildcats.  History of Batavia High School  The village of Batavia was founded in 1814. The first settler in the area was Ezekiel Dimmitt, of whom often paid itinerant teachers to come school not only his children, but children of other locals throughout the area. There had been several designated areas throughout the village for the teaching of children, including a public school established at a Presbyterian Church, which was a small frame building located on the east side of market street, with two teachers, and a wooden floor with a hold in it that was used for discipline. The other unofficial Establishment was a log malt house that was part of a deserted distillery at the head of Spring Street. The next building to house the youth of Batavia include the first building built as a school, which was an eight-room brick building on the upper end of Main Street that can still be seen today, existing as a private residence and church. It was here that the citizens of Clermont County took advantage of the Akron Law, which provided for the establishment of school boards, and allowed for an organized school to be produced. On June 1, 1850, Batavia became the first community in Clermont County to take advantage of the Akron Law, and created the School of District #1 of Batavia Township, possessing a Board of Education and creating Batavia Local Schools. The first president of the schools was Edward Scofield.  Student Body  At Batavia High School, of the total enrolled, about 9% are part of a minority group, with American Indian/Alaskan Native enrollment being 0.4%, Asian enrollment being 0.4%, African American enrollment being 2%, Hispanic enrollment being 2%, and two or more races being 4%. White enrollment takes up 91% of the student body. Gender is split 50%-50%, and the total percentage of economically disadvantaged students at Batavia High School is 38%. There is one non-human Batavian at Batavia High School, that being Gary the ball python, beloved resident class pet of Mrs. Beth Wolfer.

Overview Totternhoe is an ancient village in southern Bedfordshire, near Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard. Totternhoe Knolls has been a fort for many peoples including Romans and Normans. Totternhoe Castle, of motte-and-bailey design, was built during the Norman period, probably during the years of the Anarchy, only the mound survives. Behind the knoll is a large chalk quarry producing Totternhoe Stone and modern lime kilns. The parish church of Saint Giles dates from the 13th century. The village has about 300 homes housing about 1,000 people. There are several farms and a small lower school, Totternhoe Church of England Academy. The village has two public houses, The Old Farm Inn in Church End and The Cross Keys in Middle End. Another pub in Church End, The Bell, was converted into a private home in about 1992. Geography The village is long and thin and is separated into three parts: * Church End, closest to Dunstable, includes the school and a pub. This area of the village centres around the junction of three of the four main roads into the village: Church Road (leading to Eaton Bray), Dunstable Road and Castle Hill Road (leading to Leighton Buzzard). Dunstable Road becomes Castle Hill Road as one heads West. * Middle End has a recreation ground and a Scout Hut (where the First Totternhoe Scouts and Guides meet) next to where the old school used to be. One entrance to the Knolls is up past the Scout Hut. * Lower End, towards Leighton Buzzard, is where the quarry is. It is overlooked by the old fort on the Knoll. The civil parish includes the foot of Dunstable Downs, including the London Gliding Club. History Totternhoe Roman villa dates to the fourth century. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the village as Totene Hou, meaning \\"look out house\\" and \\"spur\\", presumably describing forts on the Knoll. The 1881 Census recorded Totternhoe's population as about 700, of whom 54% were female. Totternhoe's common lands were not enclosed until 1892. Sport and leisure Totternhoe has a Non-League football team Totternhoe F.C. who play at Church End recreation ground. Notable buildings and sites Travelling west from Dunstable one may find the following buildings.

History Gerichts-Bezirk Bukowsko bis 1918, Bukowsko Rural Commune Historically, the village was first mentioned in 1361. Subsequently, the part of Poland in which Pobiedno resided came under Austrian rule for almost 120 years. In that period, this entire region, including West and East Subcarpathian Voivodship, was known as Galicia. In 1785 the village had 6.3 km2 of land and 711 Catholics. Notable parts of the village history include the Exaltation of the Holy Cross Church, an Eastern Orthodoxy Church. After Priest Skobielski died in 1800, the village became a filial parish of Wolica and then Dudy≈Ñce and in 1918 Pielnia. In 1830, while the village was a filial parish, the church burned down and people changed to the Latin Rite. On January, 1946 the village was attacked by a strong unit of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Hereinafter \\"UPA\\") and some buildings were burnt. Only over a dozen years after the war did the village start to rebuild. Geography The municipality lies at an altitude of 482 metres and covers an area of 6.3 km¬≤.

While most are versatile over the course of a season, they are given specific assignments to focus on during the course of a meet. At a high level meet there might be, for example; an official to call the athletes and record their results, one or more officials to watch the circle or jumping line, one or more officials to mark the landing spot, one to operate a wind game and one to watch the time limit for the athlete. New electronic devices for timing, measurement or other technological operations might require additional specialists.

Marching Band  Agua Fria is home to the Band of Owls marching band under the direction of Jeremy Garcia. = AFHS Fight Song = The Owl fight song goes as follows, \\"Let's win this game; Go onward Owls, go! Never to yield A victory to the foe! On to the goal; A gain on every play! Fight Owls! Fight Owls! Win this game the same old way!\\" Athletics Agua Fria's athletic excellence is recognized state and nation wide. With the likes of Hall of Fame inductees Randall McDaniel to more recent stars like Everson Griffen. A football program that has boasted 5 state championships in Class 4A (1991, 1989, 1988, 1972, 1970). Along with countless NCAA Division 1 athletic scholarships. The track and field program is also worth recognizing. Under the direction of coach Ted Campbell, as well as Brian Bogen, the Owls morphed into perennial winners. Between 1997 and 2007, the boys' track team had a duel meet record of 112 wins and 13 losses, came home with countless invitational trophies, took first place in its region five years in a row (from 2004 to 2008), and won state titles back to back in 2006 and 2007. The men's basketball team has been prominent in tournaments and championships as well. Most recently, from 2007 to 2009, the varsity team made it to the 4A-I state finals, but fell short of winning the championship to Carrick Felix's Millennium High School (division rivals) and Sunnyslope High School. In 2016, they had again made it to the playoffs, but lost in the semi- final round to the team who ultimately won the state championship. Agua Fria's men's soccer team has also notched a 4A state championship (1999). Along with producing various playoff runs from 2006-2010. Agua Fria's cheerleading team has also been a frequent state and national contender in the past few years. During the 2015-2016 school year, head coach Torie Jones secured the team their first state bid in the school's history, and has secured a bid for them every year since. In her third year, she also took the varsity cheer team to finals at USA Nationals for the first time. Solar panels In the late spring of 2011, covered parking with solar panel installations was scheduled to be added to Agua Fria and Millennium high schools; the district had already added solar panels to the roofs at Desert Edge High School and Verrado High School in 2010.http://www.azcentral.com/community/swvalley/articles/2011/01/16/20110116agua- fria-solar-panels.html It was estimated that some 40 percent of the entire district's energy needs would come from solar panels at its high schools upon completion.

Dietz was born in Pittsburgh and graduated from New York University, but he lived much of his life in and near Rockport, Maine. In his youth, he was a foreign correspondent in Paris and a copywriter in New York. Perhaps his best known work (with Harry Goodridge) was A Seal Called Andre, based on the true story of an orphaned baby seal that learned to perform tricks and became a popular tourist attraction in Rockport. The 1975 book remains in print; the book was the source for the film Andre (1995).

I is the number of different components in the system. This equation shows that in thermodynamics intensive properties are not independent but related, making it a mathematical statement of the state postulate. When pressure and temperature are variable, only I-1 of I components have independent values for chemical potential and Gibbs' phase rule follows. The Gibbs‚àíDuhem equation cannot be used for small thermodynamic systems due to the influence of surface effects and other microscopic phenomena. The equation is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and Pierre Duhem. Derivation Deriving the Gibbs‚ÄìDuhem equation from the fundamental thermodynamic equation is straightforward.Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, 3rd Edition Michael J. Moran and Howard N. Shapiro, p. 538 The total differential of the extensive Gibbs free energy \\\\mathbf{G} in terms of its natural variables is :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{G} =\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{G}}{\\\\partial p}\\\\right _{T,N} \\\\mathrm{d}p +\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{G}}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right  _{p,N} \\\\mathrm{d}T +\\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{G}}{\\\\partial N_i}\\\\right _{p,T,N_{j eq i}} \\\\mathrm{d}N_i. Since the Gibbs free energy is the Legendre transformation of the internal energy, the derivatives can be replaced by its definitions transforming the above equation into: :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{G} =V \\\\mathrm{d}p-S \\\\mathrm{d}T +\\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i \\\\mathrm{d}N_i The chemical potential is simply another name for the partial molar Gibbs free energy (or the partial Gibbs free energy, depending on whether N is in units of moles or particles). Thus the Gibbs free energy of a system can be calculated by collecting moles together carefully at a specified T, P and at a constant molar ratio composition (so that the chemical potential doesn't change as the moles are added together), i.e. : \\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i N_i . The total differential of this expression is : \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i \\\\mathrm{d}N_i + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I N_i \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu_i Combining the two expressions for the total differential of the Gibbs free energy gives : \\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i \\\\mathrm{d}N_i + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I N_i \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu_i =V \\\\mathrm{d}p-S \\\\mathrm{d}T+\\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i \\\\mathrm{d}N_i which simplifies to the Gibbs‚ÄìDuhem relation: : \\\\sum_{i=1}^I N_i \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu_i = -S \\\\mathrm{d}T + V \\\\mathrm{d}p = Alternative derivation = Another way of deriving the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be found be taking the extensivity of energy into account. Extensivity implies that :U(\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\lambda U (\\\\mathbf{X}) where \\\\mathbf{X} denotes all extensive variables of the internal energy U. The internal energy is thus a first-order homogenous function. Applying Euler's homogeneous function theorem, one finds the following relation when taking only volume, number of particles, and entropy as extensive variables: :U = TS - pV + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i N_i Taking the total differential, one finds :\\\\mathrm{d}U = T\\\\mathrm{d}S + S\\\\mathrm{d}T - p\\\\mathrm{d}V - V \\\\mathrm{d}p + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I \\\\mu_i \\\\mathrm{d} N_i + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I N_i \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu_i Finally, one can equate this expression to the definition of \\\\mathrm{d}U to find the Gibbs-Duhem equation :0 =S\\\\mathrm{d}T - V \\\\mathrm{d}p + \\\\sum_{i=1}^I N_i \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu_i Applications By normalizing the above equation by the extent of a system, such as the total number of moles, the Gibbs‚ÄìDuhem equation provides a relationship between the intensive variables of the system. For a simple system with I different components, there will be I+1 independent parameters or \\"degrees of freedom\\". For example, if we know a gas cylinder filled with pure nitrogen is at room temperature (298 K) and 25 MPa, we can determine the fluid density (258 kg/m3), enthalpy (272 kJ/kg), entropy (5.07 kJ/kg‚ãÖK) or any other intensive thermodynamic variable.Calculated using REFPROP: NIST Standard Reference Database 23, Version 8.0 If instead the cylinder contains a nitrogen/oxygen mixture, we require an additional piece of information, usually the ratio of oxygen-to-nitrogen. If multiple phases of matter are present, the chemical potentials across a phase boundary are equal.Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, 3rd Edition Michael J. Moran and Howard N. Shapiro, p. 710 Combining expressions for the Gibbs‚ÄìDuhem equation in each phase and assuming systematic equilibrium (i.e. that the temperature and pressure is constant throughout the system), we recover the Gibbs' phase rule. One particularly useful expression arises when considering binary solutions.The Properties of Gases and Liquids, 5th Edition Poling, Prausnitz and O'Connell, p. 8.13, At constant P (isobaric) and T (isothermal) it becomes: :0= N_1 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu_1 + N_2 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu_2 or, normalizing by total number of moles in the system N_1 + N_2, substituting in the definition of activity coefficient \\\\gamma and using the identity x_1 + x_2 = 1 : :0= x_1 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ln(\\\\gamma_1) + x_2 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ln(\\\\gamma_2) Chemical Thermodynamics of Materials, 2004 Svein St√∏len, p. 79, This equation is instrumental in the calculation of thermodynamically consistent and thus more accurate expressions for the vapor pressure of a fluid mixture from limited experimental data.  Ternary and multicomponent solutions and mixtures Lawrence Stamper Darken has shown that the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be applied to the determination of chemical potentials of components from a multicomponent system from experimental data regarding the chemical potential \\\\bar {G_2} of only one component (here component 2) at all compositions. He has deduced the following relation :\\\\bar{G_2}= G + (1-x_2) \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} xi, amount (mole) fractions of components. Making some rearrangements and dividing by (1 ‚Äì x2)2 gives: :\\\\frac{G}{(1-x_2)^2} + \\\\frac{1}{1-x_2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1-x_2)^2} or : \\\\left(\\\\mathfrak{d} \\\\frac{G}{\\\\frac{1 - x_2}{\\\\mathfrak{d} x_2}}\\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} or :\\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{1-x_2}}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} as formatting variant The derivative with respect to one mole fraction x2 is taken at constant ratios of amounts (and therefore of mole fractions) of the other components of the solution representable in a diagram like ternary plot. The last equality can be integrated from x_2 = 1 to x_2 gives: :G - (1 - x_2) \\\\lim_{x_2\\\\to 1} \\\\frac{G}{1 - x_2} = (1 - x_2) \\\\int_{1}^{x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 Applying LHopital's rule gives: : \\\\lim_{x_2\\\\to 1} \\\\frac{G}{1 - x_2} = \\\\lim_{x_2\\\\to 1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} . This becomes further: : \\\\lim_{x_2\\\\to 1} \\\\frac{G}{1 - x_2} = -\\\\lim_{x_2\\\\to 1} \\\\frac {\\\\bar{G_2} - G}{1 - x_2}. Express the mole fractions of component 1 and 3 as functions of component 2 mole fraction and binary mole ratios: :x_1 = \\\\frac{1-x_2}{1+\\\\frac{x_3}{x_1}} :x_3 = \\\\frac{1-x_2}{1+\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} and the sum of partial molar quantities :G=\\\\sum _{i=1}^3 x_i \\\\bar{G_i}, gives :G= x_1 (\\\\bar {G_1})_{x_2 =1} + x_3 (\\\\bar {G_3})_{x_2 =1} + (1 - x_2) \\\\int_{1}^{x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 (\\\\bar{G_1})_{x_2 =1} and (\\\\bar{G_3})_{x_2 =1} are constants which can be determined from the binary systems 1_2 and 2_3. These constants can be obtained from the previous equality by putting the complementary mole fraction x3 = 0 for x1 and vice versa. Thus :(\\\\bar {G_1})_{x_2 =1} = - \\\\left(\\\\int_{1}^{0}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 \\\\right)_{x_3=0} and :(\\\\bar {G_3})_{x_2 =1} = - \\\\left(\\\\int_{1}^{0}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 \\\\right)_{x_1=0} The final expression is given by substitution of these constants into the previous equation: :G= (1 - x_2) \\\\left(\\\\int_{1}^{x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 \\\\right)_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_3}} - x_1 \\\\left(\\\\int_{1}^{0}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 \\\\right)_{x_3=0} - x_3 \\\\left(\\\\int_{1}^{0}\\\\frac{\\\\bar{G_2}}{(1 - x_2)^2} dx_2 \\\\right)_{x_1=0}  See also  * Margules activity model * Darken's equations * Gibbs-Helmholtz equation References  External links  *J.

Pizzonia allegedly participated in several high-profile murders. Early life and rise Born in the Ozone Park section of Queens, Pizzonia began working for the Gambino family as a crew member for then caporegime John Gotti. He was called \\"Skinny Dom\\" to distinguish himself from Gambino mobster Dominick \\"Fat Dom\\" Borghese. On December 16, 1985, Pizzonia participated in the assassinations of Gambino boss Paul Castellano and underboss Thomas Bilotti outside a Manhattan steakhouse. After Castellano's murder, Gotti took over as family boss. In June 1988, Pizzonia allegedly murdered mobster Frank Boccia at the family's request. The Gambinos ordered Boccia's murder because he had punched his mother-in-law, the wife of imprisoned mobster Anthony Ruggiano. Pizzonia and Gambino associate Alfred Congiglio lured Boccia to a social club, killed him, took his body on a boat, and dumped the body into the ocean off New York City. Boccia's body was never recovered. On December 24, 1988, as a reward for the Castellano and Boccia murders, the Gambinos allowed Pizzonia to become a made man, or full member, in the family. In 1992, Pizzonia participated in the murder of Thomas Uva and his wife Rosemarie. Previously that year, the Uvas had robbed several social clubs belonging to the Gambino, Bonanno, and Colombo crime families. Pizzonia was especially enraged by the Uvas because they twice robbed Gotti's Bergin Hunt and Fish Club in Ozone Park, which Pizzonia managed. On December 24, 1992, Pizzonia and mobster Ronnie Trucchio located the Uvas. The couple was sitting in their car at a traffic light in Ozone Park when Pizzonia and Trucchio shot and killed both of them. In 1995, Pizzonia became the head of a Gambino bookmaking operation and later replaced Peter Gotti as capo. Conviction On September 22, 2005, Pizzonia and Trucchio were indicted in the 1988 Boccia murder and the 1992 Uva murders. In May 2007, a federal jury convicted Pizzonia on a racketeering charge of conspiracy to commit the Uva murders. He was acquitted on all three murder counts. Because Pizzonia had already pleaded guilty to an illegal gambling charge before the trial, the one single act of conspiracy was enough to convict him on the entire count. On September 5, 2007, Pizzonia was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. In November 2016, Pizzonia was serving his sentence at the Butner Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Butner, North Carolina. He was assigned federal inmate number 60254-053. Pizzonia was 78 years old when he was released on 15 November 2019. His scheduled release date had been 28 February 2020.  Portrayal in popular media  Dominick Pizzonia (Skinny Dom) was portrayed by Joseph R. Gannascoli in the 2014 crime drama Rob the Mob.

Mader was employed by the East German military publishing house and apparently had access to some information on CIA officers that was not publicly available. The book purported to identify about 3,000 active agents of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It was modeled after other Who's Who guides.  Background  Biographical information was compiled with the cooperation of Mohamed Abdelnabi, Ambalal Bhatt, Fernando Gamarra and Shozo Ohashi. The book also includes fold-out organizational charts (late 1960s) of the following: American Intelligence Services, Office of Intelligence Research (OIR), Military Intelligence Headquarters of the US, National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), System of several cover organizations used by the CIA. Mader had neither a publisher's statement nor a license number. He listed himself as an editor with the address of Dr. Julius Mader, 1066 Berlin W 66, Mauerstr. 66 at. In the book, two detachable cards were involved. The reader could send him corrections and additions as well as more names of CIA agents and other intelligence officials. Many famous people are listed in this book, including Bill Moyers, Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, and others. More than once a 'new' CIA name has surfaced in Western media that had been sitting in Mader's book all along. Six agents from the CIA backed Chile coup of 1973 are also named in the book. A copy of this book without the dust cover has been on display at the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC. From Who's Who in CIA: > The rulers of the USA are, of course, extremely interested in keeping the > mantle of secrecy over their intelligence network. The invisible government > shall have neither names nor faces. For this reason the time appeared to > have come to demask a first representative selection of leading officials > and officers, collaborators and agents of the US intelligence services who > are operating on five continents. The result is this book whereby CIA is > used as an appropriate synonym for the whole of the US intelligence system.  Critical reception  The book was later reviewed by Art Kunkin of the Los Angeles Free Press in March 1969. The review included excerpts and one of the five organizational fold out charts and can be found here: Hood College, JFK Files According to Ladislav Bittman of the Czechoslovakian StB, Who's Who was only partly reliable, and was intended as disinformation: > About half of the names listed in that book are real CIA operatives.

In 1985, the seminary transferred the secondary school to a new secular not-for-profit organization, \\"le Coll√®ge Fran√ßois-de-Laval\\", which was given the right to use the \\"Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec\\" name. Another school, Le Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, campus de l'Outaouais was founded as a branch of the school in the Outaouais area of western Quebec. A separate organization with a similar name, the Petit s√©minaire dioc√©sain de Qu√©bec, is a residential school for boys considering the Roman Catholic priesthood, managed by the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec.  Background  Many French-Canadian clergy of the 18th and 19th century, as well as innumerable academics, went through the Petit S√©minaire before higher education became widely accessible. Of 867 students who lived at the Petit S√©minaire during the French period, 198 graduated. Of these, 118 became priests or brothers, and 80 chose other occupations, according to research by historian Mgr Am√©d√©e Gosselin.Gosselin, Am√©d√©e.

It was directed by Gene Saks, and adapted by Paul Zindel, and starred Lucille Ball in her final theatrical film performance. The cast also stars Beatrice Arthur, Bruce Davison, and Robert Preston. The story focuses on the madcap life of Mame Dennis (Ball), which is disrupted when she becomes the guardian of her deceased brother's son. She marries a wealthy Southern plantation owner (Preston), is widowed, yet through it all, with the help of her dearest friend, Vera Charles (Arthur), manages to keep things under control. Plot At the reading of the will of young Patrick Dennis's (Kirby Furlong) father, a trustee, Mr. Babcock (John McGiver), reveals that Patrick is to be left in the care of his aunt, Mame Dennis (Lucille Ball), as well as his nanny, Agnes Gooch (Jane Connell). Taking a train to New York City (\\"Main Title Including St. Bridget\\"), Agnes and the boy arrive at Mame's home, where they walk into a wild party that Mame is giving for a holiday she herself created (\\"It's Today\\"). Patrick asks if he may slide down her banister, then reveals his true identity. Mame introduces the boy to her friends, including a renowned stage actress (and famous lush), Vera Charles (Beatrice Arthur). Mame decides that she wants to fill the child's life with adventure (\\"Open a New Window\\"). She enrolls him in \\"the School of Life\\", a very non-traditional school. But when Vera inadvertently leads Babcock to the school, Patrick is taken from Mame's custody. Simultaneously, the stock market crash leaves Mame penniless. Vera offers her a small role as \\"The Man in the Moon\\" in her newest operetta about a lady astronomer. Mame flubs her one line and causes the play to be a disaster, which puts a major rift in their friendship. Patrick, who was in the audience, reassures Mame that he still loves her (\\"My Best Girl\\"). Mame works a string of jobs. One is in a department store, where she meets Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Robert Preston), to whom she attempts to sell a pair of roller skates. She cannot write up a cash order and is fired. Unable to remove the skates she has demonstrated, Mame roller skates home, dejected due to her inability to pay manservant Ito (George Chiang) or Agnes, who have loyally stayed with her. Mame decides to lift everyone's spirits by decorating the house for Christmas and giving everyone their Christmas gifts early (\\"We Need a Little Christmas\\"), which include Patrick's first pair of long pants. Agnes and Ito surprise her with the news that the butcher bill has been paid. Beau, who has been looking for Mame since she was fired, appears at her front door and invites everyone to dinner. Beau falls in love and brings Mame and Patrick to his family's plantation in Peckerwood, Georgia, where they're greeted coolly by Sally Cato (Joyce Van Patten). A number of Beau's relatives, especially Mother Burnside (Lucille Benson) and Cousin Fan (Ruth McDevitt), are unhappy about Beau marrying a \\"Yankee\\". Sally decides to invite Mame to a foxhunt. Despite not knowing a thing about riding a horse, Mame accepts. After a wild ride, Mame accidentally captures the fox. All of Beau's family and friends (except for Sally) now sing her praises (\\"Mame\\"). She and Beau go on an extended honeymoon, traveling all over the world (\\"Loving You\\"). While they're away, Patrick goes from a young child who pulls in a B+ average to a high school senior (Bruce Davison) flunking many classes (\\"The Letter\\"). When Beau dies in an avalanche in the Alps, Mame returns home to be reunited with a now-grown Patrick, who is dating a snobby, conservative girl named Gloria Upson (Doria Cook-Nelson). When Mame meets Vera for a drink, the two trade snippy comments, which they insist are not being made out of hatred, but simple honesty, as that's what \\"Bosom Buddies\\" do. The two come home and reminisce about men they've dated. Agnes, who is listening to the conversation, admits that she's never had a date. Mame and Vera decide to give the uptight, frumpy Agnes a makeover and send her out to live, because \\"Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death.\\"\\"Sons of bitches\\" in the musical was changed to \\"suckers\\" in the film version. Weaver, David E. \\"Mame‚Äôs Boys: Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee\\" , \\"Ohioana Quarterly\\", Fall 2006, Ohioana Library Association, accessed September 5, 2012 Six months later, Agnes returns home, visibly pregnant. Agnes then describes what she did while living it up (\\"Gooch's Song\\"). Mame visits the Upsons (Don Porter and Audrey Christie) at their home, Upson Downs in Connecticut. She learns for the first time that Patrick and Gloria are engaged. After spending several hours with the Upsons and finding them insufferable bores and bigots, Mame is asked to help pay for a piece of property next door to Upson Downs so that Patrick and Gloria could live there, as opposed to \\"the wrong kind of people\\". Afterward, she is candid with Patrick about her disdain for the family. He admits that he's ashamed of her and her \\"crazy\\" friends. A heartbroken Mame wonders what she did wrong with this boy she raised (\\"If He Walked Into My Life\\"). Mame and Patrick apologize to each other at her home. They are dressed for company: the Upsons. Mame promises to behave and Patrick meets Mame's new maid, Pegeen (Bobbi Jordan). Mr. and Mrs. Upson announce that the property they'd wanted has been bought by some \\"Jew lawyer\\". Vera and several men suddenly barge into Mame's house, singing \\"It's Today\\" (the reprise). Vera toasts the new couple, mistaking Pegeen for Gloria. At that moment, Agnes comes downstairs, and the Upsons discover she is going to be an unwed mother. A busload of other unwed pregnant women arrives, singing an \\"Open a New Window\\" reprise. Mame reveals to the Upsons that she bought the property next door so she could build the Beauregarde Burnside Memorial Home For Single Mothers. This is the final straw, and the Upsons leave, angry that Mame isn't \\"one of us.\\" Patrick, visibly upset, also leaves. Years later, following World War II, Patrick and Pegeen are married and have a child, Peter. Mame, who is going on a trip to Siberia, requests that Peter be allowed to go with her. Although Patrick and Pegeen resist at first, once Peter quotes Mame's \\"life is a banquet\\" line, they relent. The two get onto a plane, and Patrick states that Mame has not changed and that she's \\"the Pied Piper.\\" Mame and Peter wave goodbye and go into the plane. The plane takes off, followed by clips of Mame embracing Vera, Agnes, Beau, adult Patrick, and young Patrick (\\"Finale: Open a New Window/Mame\\").

Owing to the delay, original director George Cukor was forced to withdraw from the project. The assignment went to Gene Saks, who had helmed the Broadway production. Production began in January 1973. Bea Arthur reprised her Tony award winning role of Vera Charles. Ball, who had casting approval, was dissatisfied with Madeline Kahn's interpretation of Gooch and had her replaced by Jane Connell, another member of the original Broadway cast. Warner Bros. executives passed over Angela Lansbury for the title role, even though she had won the Tony for her performance of the role on Broadway. Reception Radio City Music Hall selected the film to be its Easter attraction. The film was a U.S. box-office failure and many reviews, especially those for Ball, were particularly brutal; the movie has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \\"a total bust, devoid of joy, wit, good music, or decent dancing\\", adding: Time wrote \\"The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time ... Miss Ball has been molded over the years into some sort of national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished.\\" Time Out London declared she \\"simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her,\\" and wrote of Saks: \\"When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [he] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim.\\" Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, \\"After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?\\" The New Republic's Stanley Kauffmann, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role \\"fifteen years earlier,\\" described her as \\"too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints.\\" Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed going so far as to suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer \\"Mame stayed up all night and drank champagne! What did you expect her to sound like? Julie Andrews?\\" In his Movie Guide, critic Leonard Maltin rated the film as \\"BOMB\\" and wrote: \\"Hopelessly out-of-date musical...will embarrass even those who love Lucy. Calling Fred and Ethel Mertz!\\" Not all the reviews were bad. Vincent Canby in The New York Times, for example, expressed \\"great reservations\\" about the film and Ball's close-ups, but noted that the film is \\"as determined to please in its way as Mame is in hers\\" and that the opening credits, \\"which look like a Cubist collage in motion, are so good they could be a separate subject.\\" Canby went on to praise Ball as well: \\"When the character of Lucy, an inspired slapstick performer, coincides with that of Auntie Mame, the Big-Town sophisticate, 'Mame' is marvelous. I think of Lucy's turning a Georgia fox hunt into a gigantic shambles, or of her bringing the curtain down on a New Haven first- night when, as a budding actress, she falls off a huge cardboard moon. I even treasure her prying loose the fingers of a sloshed Beatrice Arthur who won't give up her martini glass.\\" Variety reported in its February 27, 1974 review that Ball was \\"showcased, coiffed, made-up and ably guided from almost television-like slapstick to character sincerity with loving care.\\" Molly Haskell in The Village Voice was \\"pro-Ball but anti-'Mame'\\" and felt that Lucy made the character of Mame‚Äîsomeone \\"you'd walk a mile to avoid\\" in real life‚Äîpalatable. In the March 18, 1974 issue of New York magazine, Judith Crist similarly was displeased with the film but supportive of its star: \\"Lucille Ball is ‚Äì and no 'still' about it ‚Äì a first-rate entertainer, supplementing her superb comedic sense with a penetrating warmth and inner humor. She is without peer in making a hung-over stagger from bed to bathroom an exercise in regal poise, in using her slightly crooked smile to vitiate the soppiness of an overly sentimental sequence, in applying her Goldwyn Girl chorine know-how to a dash of song and dance.\\" Milton Krims, the film critic for The Saturday Evening Post, wrote (in the magazine's March 1974 issue) a breathless paean to Lucille Ball and the film, concluding that \\"Mame is Lucille Ball and Lucille Ball is Mame.\\" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded Ball a Golden Globe nomination (Arthur received one as well) but, disheartened by its reception, she swore she never would appear on the big screen again, and the film proved to be her last theatrical film (not counting Stone Pillow, her 1985 made-for-TV film). Beatrice Arthur later called her involvement with the film a \\"tremendous embarrassment\\", and expressed regret at having participated. Although she enjoyed working with Lucille Ball, she made no secret of her opinion that Lucy was \\"terribly miscast\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF7XyOMcfzE#! Home media Mame was released on pan-and-scan VHS and pan-and-scan and letterbox laserdisc editions in the 1980s and 1990s. While these official editions have long since been out-of-print, bootleg DVDs taken from the widescreen laserdisc or widescreen TV broadcasts on American Movie Classics and Turner Classic Movies have been known to exist. On June 19, 2007, Mame officially was released on DVD both separately and in a special DVD collection of Lucille Ball's films.Amazon.com - Lucille Ball Film Collection The DVD includes a remastered version of the film in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 1.0 mono sound, the original theatrical trailer, and the featurette Lucy Mame. Although Warner had intended to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, it was unable to do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line in order to get a more pitch- perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where one often hears a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.

History Mary Brown is the creator of the chain's proprietary chicken recipe for southern chicken. Brown's recipe was sold to the founders of the brand, Pat Tarrant and Cyril Fleming, who brought the recipe to Newfoundland to open business in 1969. The first restaurant opened in St. John's, Newfoundland & Labrador in 1969 as \\"Golden Skillet\\". It was renamed to its present name in 1970. By 1972, Mary Brown's had grown beyond the island of Newfoundland, opening locations in Oshawa and Mississauga, Ontario. From there, the chain expanded west to Alberta, back east to the Maritimes and to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. More recently, Mary Brown's has opened several locations in British Columbia, and a store in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The brand continues to grow coast-to-coast across Canada. Key executives The owner and CEO of Mary Brown's is Gregory Roberts of PI Enterprises Group, an entrepreneur and Chartered Accountant from Triton, Newfoundland & Labrador. Roberts acquired the brand in 2007 and since that time, has grown the chain from about 67 stores to its current count of approximately 160 stores. The President and COO of Mary Brown's is Hadi Chahin, a 20-year plus executive of the food services industry. Prior to joining Mary Brown's, Hadi was the Vice President of Operations for Chartwells, a division of Compass Group Canada. He also held leadership roles with Sodexo Canada, Prime Restaurants and White Lodging Services. Chahin has undertaken a national rebrand ‚Äì as well launching the brand in new channels and expanding in existing markets.  Marketing  Mary Brown's uses the slogans \\"Made Fresh from Scratch\\" and \\"100% Canadian\\" in their materials. \\"Crave Delicious\\" has become the brand's overriding tagline since mid-2019. \\"Made Fresh from Scratch\\" is a reflection of the brand's preparation methods, focusing on fresh rather than frozen chicken and farm fresh potatoes. Menu items are prepared and cooked by hand in each location, always in small batches to ensure peak flavour and juiciness. Mary Brown's frequently uses the word \\"handcrafted\\" to express how they prepare their food. \\"Truly Canadian\\" was adopted as a slogan in 2017 to reflect the brand's heritage as a Newfoundland-founded, Canadian-owned business. Company materials note that the company is family-owned and operated by Canadians, and sells Canada Grade A chicken raised by Canadian farmers. Mary Brown's cameo is frequently used in marketing. The cameo was launched in 2000 and has since become an integral part of the brand. Mary's ‚Äòvoice‚Äô is increasingly used in print and social materials, with Mary sharing ideas and comments. The tone and manner of Mary's messages and all Mary Brown's materials is homespun with a touch of irreverence and whimsy. Mary Brown's original logo was developed in the 1970s and drastically updated in 2000. In late 2017, the logo underwent a refresh as part of a more complete rebranding. In April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mary Brown's sponsored the temporary removal of all paywalls from Postmedia Network newspaper websites for the month.  Franchises and corporate stores  Mary Brown's has about 20 corporate stores. The balance of its stores, about 140, are franchised and located throughout Canada. Mary Brown's has been a member of the Canadian Franchise Association for over 35 years. They have been awarded the Canadian Franchisees‚Äô Choice Award 9 years consecutively. In 2019, Mary Brown's was named one of the Best Managed Companies in Canada by Deloitte Canada. Mary Brown's currently operates approximately 160 stores nationally. Based on past growth patterns and innovative new approaches, the chain has declared plans to reach 200 stores by 2020.

Originally produced for the Rolemaster role-playing game system, Shadow World is equally suited for the HARP Role-playing system, published since 2003. The setting blends traditional fantasy elements, such as elves, dwarves, and magic, with science fiction, including such elements as space and time travel, and, to a degree, futuristic technology. As Rolemaster and HARP, Shadow World is owned by Iron Crown Enterprises (often referred to as I.C.E.). It is currently maintained by the primary author of the setting, Terry K. Amthor of Eidolon Studio (who also holds the trademark for Shadow World, and copyrights for non-gaming fiction related to the world). Themes Shadow World is a fantasy and science fiction environment that deals with a number of topics, including the path of the hero, in a fantasy role-playing environment. Development history The Shadow World logo The first book to be set in Shadow World was The Iron Wind adventure setting, published in 1980 as a game setting for Iron Crown Enterprises's Rolemaster fantasy game system. Iron Crown also published Vog Mur and The Cloudlords of Tanara as standalone settings before the 1989 publication of the Shadow World World Atlas First Edition placed those settings in the context of a single overarching campaign. Iron Crown went on to publish several more supplements before the rights to the property reverted to author Terry Amthor . Many of the first edition Shadow World supplements, have been republished as second editions, updated and suitable for the Rolemaster Standard System (RMSS) from 1994 and the Rolemaster Classic game system from 2007. The world The focus of the Shadow World setting is the Kulthea's Western Hemisphere. A massive techno- magickal barrier effectively prevents crossing into the Eastern Hemisphere. The lands of Kulthea are ruled variously by different strains of humans, elves, Lugrok, Murlog, and other fantastic creatures and peoples. Kulthean cultures vary in their technological development from the early stone-age to Steampunk fantasy interpretations of the Italian Renaissance or the Edwardian Era. The presence of magic is a boon and a bane, permitting feats not accomplishable by comparable earth-age cultures, but retarding overall technological development that lack the understanding of melding science and technology held in Kulthea's ancient history. Trade is performed by water and air-going ships or on horse-drawn vehicles, all of which must be aided by a guild of Navigators who can show paths that circumvent magical, weather and other hazards left over from ancient wars and malfunctioning technology. The universe Shadow World dovetails into Iron Crown's Terran Imperium, a science fiction scenario based on Frank Herbert's Dune intended for their Spacemaster game. A handful of light years from Earth, Kulthea is the seventh planet (of 13) in its solar system, with a solar orbit of 350 days. Five moons orbit Kulthea. Orhan is the largest (it can be seen in full daylight) and circles Kulthea in 70 days. This moon is very important to peoples and cultures of Kulthea, and is home to the Lords of Orhan. Many calendrical systems are based on Orhan's movement through the sky. Varin is the second largest moon, and is orange in color. With its polar orbit and red color, Charon, the third moon and home to the Dark Gods, is greatly feared. The waxing of Charon, as well as the time when it reaches its zenith, are considered by many cultures to be a period of ill omen. Also, conjunctions of Charon and Orhan can disturb Ess√¶nce Flows on Kulthea (see below), causing havoc to the planet's weather and general climatic stability. Mikori is the final moon that orbits Kulthea while Tlilok, counted among the five Kulthean moons, is technically a satellite of Orhan. Geography Most of the published material for Kulthea's the planet's western Hemisphere. Dominated by water, the hemisphere consists of several large continents, including Jaiman, Emer, Agyra, Falias, Folenn, Thuul, and others. Two of the most heavily documented continents thus far are Emer and Jaiman. There are also several subterranean locations described. In addition to the continents are many archipelagos, the fractured geology intended to suggest the geologically unstable history of the planet. Various products detailing specific areas of Kulthea, ranging from high-levels of entire continents (Jaiman: Land of Twilight or Emer: The Great Continent), to collections of specific adventures (Tales of the Loremasters). Races Shadow World broadly categorizes races into the mortal (or \\"mannish,\\" though this category includes species such as dwarves and centaurs), immortal (or \\"Elven\\") species, and \\"Half-elven\\" species. The \\"half-elven\\" are not necessarily the direct offspring of a human and an elven parent, but rather long-lived the intermixed hybrid population resulting from widespread interbreeding of human and elven populations until speciation occurs, for example the Sulini or Ky'tari. Compared to mortals, either sort of half-elf has a long life, though for species it is measured in centuries while for individuals such as Elor Once Dark or T'vaar Dekdarion it is measurable in millennia. Human subspecies are categorizable as roughly descended from extinct species such as the Jinteni, a few varieties of \\"High Men\\" borrowing heavily from J. R. R. Tolkien's D√∫nedain (e.g. Zori or Laan) and many categories of \\"common men\\" (such as Jameri or Haid). Shadow World's \\"High Men\\" differ from the D√∫nedain both in higher racial diversity among the former (e.g. the Kinsai are dark-skinned), and there is no suggestion in the source material that High Men or their antecedents owe their longer lives to a very distant elven ancestor. There are also so-called \\"evil\\" or monstrous races such as the Murlogi (goblins) and Lugroki (Orcs), with speculated origins as the results of alien origin or sorcerous manipulation. Religion and gods Religions play an active role in the Shadow World, with various gods taking active roles in the unfolding of the storyline directly and indirectly. The deities of Kulthea are divided into several categories * The Lords of Orhan, considered unambiguously good by most human and elven societies. * The Unlife, identified in the authorial voice as unambiguously evil. * The Dark Gods of Charon, ranging from ethically complex to outright evil in how human and elven cultures view them. * Local Gods, animistic embodiments of places with immense power over that geographically limited region. (Though the spheres of influence for some local gods, such as Mynistra, can be quite large.) * Other Entitites, such as demons, spirits, dragons, etc., that can convince a population that they are worthy of worship. Religious organizations on Kulthea are dedicated to one or more of these gods, as understood through the filter of their priests and lay worshipers, giving rise to the potential for dispute between different groups worshiping the same god. Religious groups dedicated to the Dark Gods of Charon are usually, but not always, forced by social pressure to hide their places of worship. History The history of Kulthea is a convoluted and violent one characterized by the cyclical rising and destruction of countless races, kingdoms, and empires. Local wars are common as competing polities vie with one another for resources, people, tribute, or ideological reasons. Vast global conflicts have been fought between the powers of Light and Darkness, and each one has marked the transition from one Era to the next. These wars have nearly destroyed the planet, laying waste to entire continents and leading to millennia of cultural and political stagnation. Kulthea's history is divided into three eras. The \\"current date\\" of the campaign (i.e., the date to which recently published material refers) is 6054 of the Third Era. This date has changed, as early versions of the Master Atlas and supplementary materials dated to T.E. 6050. The more recent versions of the Atlas add material to the overall chronology up through T.E. 6054. =First Era= The First Era concerns the history of the Althan race, ruled by the rise of the K'ta'viiri. (Lords of Essaence ) Details regarding this age have been left deliberately vague, with allusions to a galaxy-spanning empire's rise, corruption, and catastrophic fall. During this time, the ancestors of most of the current inhabitants of Shadow World were brought to there by the Lords of Essaence. =Interregnum= In between the first and Second, there lies a 100,000-year-long period of recovery and regrowth, also known as the Long Night. Again, the authors have left details of this time period vague, noting only the rise and fall of several empires such as the \\"Jinteni\\" and \\"W√¥rim.\\" in southern Emer and Gaalt, respectively, who war constantly with the elven realms of the distant east. Both succumb to famine, disease, and natural disasters (as well as warfare) and disappear approximately 5,000 years before the beginning of the Second Era. =Second Era= The Second Age of Ire begins with the founding of the College of Loremasters on the secret isle of Karil√¥n by Kirin T'thaan, Ilmaris Terisonen, and Andraax, (See Signature Characters). The Loremasters gather knowledge and disseminate it to advance civilization. They create a reliable calendar based on the phases of the moon Orhan. using \\"Loremaster reckoning,\\" history is more accurately recorded than had been the case in the Long Night. The Age is characterized by the rise of many polities, attainment of golden ages, and subsequent corruption and destruction by the Unlife, culminating in a \\"War of Dominion\\" in which the forces of the Unlife gather all their strength and are defeated by the forces of \\"civilization,\\" though once again at catastrophic price. =Third Era= The Third Era of Ire, which includes the game's present time, begins with the recovery of civilizations from the depredations of the Unlife during the War of Dominion; followed by the stealthy workings of evil forces seeking to destroy them again through subtle means. Signature characters The setting is the home of several iconic characters: * Andraax, principal founder of the College of Loremasters * Rand√¶ Terisonen, a Loremaster with more of a heroic streak than is generally smiled upon by the Loremasters. * Elor Once Dark, a Loremaster who succumbed to the temptations of Unlife and subsequently redeemed himself. * Lorgalis the White, Warlord of Ulor bent on conquering the world.

He was a native of Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. Gerlach was a pioneer of histological staining and anatomical micrography. In 1858 Gerlach introduced carmine mixed with gelatin as a histological stain.Art and Medicine Die Photographie als H√ºlfsmittel mikroskopischer Forschung Along with Camillo Golgi, he was a major proponent of the reticular theory that the brain's nervous system consisted of processes of contiguous cells fused to create a massive meshed network. Gerlach summed up his theory by stating: > the finest divisions of the protoplasmic processes ultimately take part in > the formation of the fine nerve fibre network which I consider to be an > essential constituent of the gray matter of the spinal cord. The divisions > are none other than the beginnings of this nerve fibre net. The cells of the > gray matter are therefore doubly connected by means the nerve process which > becomes the axis fibre and through the finest branches of the protoplasmic > processes which become a part of the fine nerve fibre net of the gray > matter. The reticular theory predominated until the 1890s when Ramon y Cajal brought forth his neuron doctrine of synaptic junctions, which in essence replaced the reticular theory. Gerlach was one of the first physicians to use photomicrography for medical research. In 1863 he published a handbook titled Die Photographie als Hilfsmittel mikroskopischer Forschung (Engl. \\"Photography as a tool in microscopic science\\") in which he discusses the practical and technological aspects of microscopic photography. The eponymous \\"Gerlach's valve\\" (valvula processus vermiformis) is named after him.

Pi√±eyro, allegedly, knew next to nothing about the sport and had apparently never even seen a game of football before his term as Bar√ßa president. A close friend of General Jos√© Moscard√≥, he had been a serving officer on the side of the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and was appointed club president on the basis of his loyalty to Francoist Spain. However, despite this, he was won over to the Bar√ßa cause and became the club‚Äôs principal defender during the early Francoist era. He resigned as club president following the controversial 1943 Copa del General√≠simo semi- final against Real Madrid. During the Pi√±eyro presidency, the club had to change its name and shield. In 1941 a decree banned the use of non‚ÄìSpanish language names and the club had to change its name from the Anglised Football Club Barcelona to Club de F√∫tbol Barcelona. The Catalan flag was also banned, leading to its removal from the club shield. The club also formed a handball team, now known as FC Barcelona Handbol, as well as baseball, and cycling teams. Pi√±eyro made his inaugural speech to his fellow FC Barcelona board members on 13 March 1940 and outlined his intentions to depoliticise the club off the field, while at the same time aiming for sporting greatness on it. One of the first acts of the Pi√±eyro administration was to campaign against a six- year ban imposed by Francoist Spain on any exiled sportsmen returning to Spain. This allowed several former FC Barcelona players, including Dom√®nec Balmanya and Josep Escol√†, to return to the club. These reinforcements subsequently proved their worth during the 1941-42 season. Bar√ßa, with a team coached by Joan Josep Nogu√©s, had struggled in La Liga and narrowly avoided being relegated after winning a play-off against Real Murcia. Despite this, however, the club won the Copa del General√≠simo, beating Atl√©tico Bilbao 4‚Äì3 after extra time. A week after the play-off against Real Murcia, after two years and four months in post, Pi√±eyro resigned as club president on 13 August 1942. However one month later he returned for a second term. During the 1942‚Äì1943 season Bar√ßa finished third in La Liga and reached the Copa del General√≠simo semi-final where they played Real Madrid. After winning the first-leg 3‚Äì0 at Les Corts they were controversially beaten 11‚Äì1 at the Charmart√≠n. It has been alleged that the Bar√ßa players were pressured into losing the game by supporters of Francoist Spain and a hostile home crowd. Pi√±eyro subsequently lodged a complaint with the Royal Spanish Football Federation and resigned as club president permanently on 20 August 1943. Sources * Jimmy Burns (1998).

The book chronicles the adventures of the CHERUB agents investigating a small-time crook who suddenly makes it big. Muchamore named the book after the film The Killing. The novel was generally well received, but, unlike its predecessor, received no awards.  Plot  After coming back from a mission in a private school in Cambridgeshire with Shakeel, James is dumped by his girlfriend, Kerry Chang. As he leaves Kerry's room, he sees a red-shirt CHERUB called Andy Lagan and takes his temper out on him, beating him up. For this, James finds his friends ignoring him, and is punished with no holiday, suspension from missions, cleaning the mission preparation rooms every night for three months, and having anger management sessions with a counselor. Zara feels sorry for James, so she gets him a low-risk mission to get him out of the punishment and so he can spend some time away from his friends blanking him. For a second time, James is working with Dave, a 17-year-old black shirt. They are being sent to investigate Leon Tarasov who runs a garage. When they get to their flat in south London, Dave gets a job at the suspect's garage, and James gets a girlfriend called Hannah. During his first night in the area, James gets into an altercation with two goons and is arrested for it. As he is being placed in the police car, police officer Michael Patel assaults him. Hannah tells James how her cousin, Will, fell off the top of the building more than a year earlier. As James has no computer that she knows of, she gives him Will's old one. Back home, James finds that Will had a CD with information about a robbery at a casino almost a year earlier. The theft totaled ¬£90,000 but is too small for what they are looking for. Dave later realises that if the casino had an illegal floor with more gambling equipment that was also robbed, then there would be enough money to be what they are looking for. To help find more evidence to capture Michael Patel, Kerry and Lauren join the team. A few days later, Hannah reveals that after Will's death, Patel had deliberately run over to the body and touched it, supposedly to see if he was still alive. James and Dave figure out that that policeman had killed Will. They tell their mission controller, John Jones, who gets a special section of the police to investigate. They do, and find out that Alan Falco, the retired evidence keeper, had destroyed the statements of the witnesses which contained evidence which could have Michael Patel arrested. In return for immunity from prosecution, Falco returns the statements, and Michael and Leon are arrested for murder of Will Clarke and for robbery of the Golden Sun Casino. Michael is sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after eighteen years, and Leon receives a twelve-year sentence. James and Dave return to campus and James reconciles himself to his friends, including Kerry.

Fearon (born 1963) is the Theodore and Francis Geballe Professor of Political Science at Stanford University; he is known for his work on the theory of civil wars, international bargaining, war's inefficiency puzzle and audience costs. According to a 2011 survey of International Relations scholars, Fearon is among the most influential International Relations scholars of the last twenty years. Fearon's work on wars emphasizes the need to explain why rationally-led states end up fighting a war instead of bargaining, even though bargaining can make both sides better off a priori. He also elaborates on how democracies are better able to signal intent in war based on domestic audience costs. Fearon has also contributed to the study of deliberative democracy. Fearon has three basic assumptions about war. First, war is a more costly choice than peace. Second, war is predictably unpredictable. In other words, although neither side may be sure exactly who will win, they can agree on the relatively likelihood each will win. And third, there are no direct benefits from fighting; Fearon calls these pieces war's inefficiency puzzle. Fearon contends that anarchy by itself cannot explain why rational actors cannot bargain. He offers three explanations for why bargaining breakdowns, and war, occur. First, actors in an anarchic system may suffer from a credible commitment problem, in which there are incentives for either party to renege on their end of an agreement. Second, states may have private information and incentives to misrepresent said information during the bargaining stage. Third, bargaining may be rendered impossible because of what Fearon dubs \\"issue indivisibility,\\" in which a particular issue in question cannot be divided. Fearon was identified by constructivist scholar Marc Lynch as the \\"leading rationalist\\" in international relations theory and credited him with resolving (along with constructivist Alexander Wendt) much of the theoretical debate between the two camps. His 2003 study with David Laitin is considered the \\"most influential\\" in modern research on civil war. Fearon has a PhD from UC Berkeley and a BA from Harvard University.

It is one of a very few anatomically modern human skulls that have been discovered on the continent which have been dated to over 20,000 years old. Background The skull was found in the 1950s on the surface of an erosion gully, a dry channel bed of the Vlekpoort River, near Hofmeyr, a small town in Eastern Cape, South Africa. No other bones or archaeological artifacts were found in the vicinity at the time of the skull's discovery. The skull is one of only a few African specimens of early modern humans dated over 30,000 years in age. Others are much more recent, dated to around 20,000 years ago. In the 1990s, Alan Morris of the University of Cape Town noticed the skull in the Port Elizabeth Museum. He later showed it to Frederick E. Grine, an anthropologist and anatomist at State University of New York at Stony Brook. Grine then led a detailed study of the skull. Examination It was not possible to date the skull using traditional radiocarbon dating, as the carbon had leached out of the bone. Instead, a new method involving a combination of optically stimulated luminescence and uranium-series dating methods was used. The method was developed by Richard Bailey of Oxford University. The earth material from the skull \\"filling the endocranial cavity\\" (central portion of the endocranial cavity) was dated using a combination of optically stimulated luminescence and uranium-series dating methods, coupled through a radiation-field model. Based on the assumption that the earth in the skull is about the age of its inhumation and thus the same as the age of the skull,The length of time between death and incorporation of the sediment within the skull is expected to be short: Grine 2007 age was estimated to 36,200 ¬± 3,200 years old. The dating also assumed that the skull \\"had neither been uncovered long before nor transported any substantial distance before its discovery\\". The material in the skull can not have been washed out or replaced by water flowing down the gully because \\"the force required to scour the inner-most sediments would certainly have resulted in substantial damage\\" of the skull, and the skull did not appear to the dating team to have been damaged that much. The anterior part of the lower facial skeleton has been damaged. The angle of the mandible, the mastoid process of the right temporal, and much of the occipital are not present. The coronal suture is obliterated and the third molars are heavily worn, suggesting that the specimen reached adulthood. The skull's owner had been wounded over his left eye and the wound had partially healed before death. The most severe damage to the skull, however, was caused during its time in storage and \\"mishandling\\" after its 1950 discovery. A lost bone is documented on pictures from 1968 and 1998. Analysis The Hofmeyr Skull has been dated to around 36,000 years ago. Osteological analysis of the cranium by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology indicates that the specimen is morphologically distinct from recent groups in Subequatorial Africa, including the local Khoisan populations. The Hofmeyr fossil instead has a very close affinity with other Upper Paleolithic skulls from Europe. Some scientists have interpreted this relationship as being consistent with the Out-of-Africa theory, which hypothesizes that at least some Upper Paleolithic human groups in Africa and Eurasia should morphologically resemble each other.

He was succeeded by Metropolitan Irenaeus (Bekish). Leonid Ieronimovich Turkevich was ordained to the priesthood in 1905, and succeeded his father as parish priest of Kremenetz. He was transferred, along with his family, to the United States in October 1906 and became the rector of the newly established Orthodox seminary (St. Platon's) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Fr. Leonid represented the American diocese of the Russian Church at the All-Russian Church Council of 1917‚Äì1918 in Moscow, Russia. Fr. Leonid, whose wife had died in 1925, was consecrated Bishop of Chicago in 1933. He was given the name Leonty during his tonsure as a monastic. Archbishop Leonty was elected Metropolitan of the diocese nearly unanimously during the 8th All-American Sobor, held in December 1950. He succeeded Metropolitan Theophilus Pashkovsky, who died in June of that year. In July 1988, Metropolitan Leonty's granddaughter, Tamara Turkevich Skvir, donated 50 bound volumes of diaries and papers covering the period from 1906‚Äî1964 to the Library of Congress. The collection also included approximately 2,000 poems as well as other miscellaneous memoranda and historical documents. He had five children.

Belock and Bert Whyte in May 1958. It was devoted mainly to classical music. History The idea for starting a label was related by electronics inventor Harry Belock (who also worked on sound films in Hollywood in the 1930s) to Roland Gelatt in the February 1959 issue of High Fidelity: \\"The more of them I heard, the more I felt that nobody had a good stereo library. So I decided to get into the business myself.\\" The plan was to record repertory that was new to stereo. Belock was very ambitious, and told High Fidelity that \\"We're out to surpass Capitol. We're not shooting marbles.\\" Belock Instrument Corporation, a manufacturer of precision equipment (particularly missile electronics) was the parent of the Everest label 1958-1960 (operated as the Belock Recording Company). Everest would issue its recordings on monaural LP (LPBR 6000 series), stereo LP (SDBR 3000 series), and tape. Everest also developed a popular and jazz division that issued albums in the LPBR 5000 series (mono) and SDBR 1000 series that, for several years, had composer/conductor Raymond Scott, of fame for the television series Your Hit Parade, as head and chief A&R; man. It was natural for Scott and two of his Hit Parade regulars, Dorothy Collins (who was Scott's wife at the time) and Gisele MacKenzie, to wax discs for the label. MacKenzie was featured on a popular live recording done during her night club engagement at The Empire Room of The Waldorf-Astoria, while Collins was featured on an ambitious collection of holiday tunes with the Joe Lily Singers and Nathan VanCleve's orchestra (both alumnae from the Bing Crosby film classic White Christmas) titled \\"Won't You Spend Christmas with Me?\\" Scott released several instrumental albums for the label, and teamed with Dorothy Collins for a joint effort, \\"Singin' and Swingin'\\", which was never released, although initial promotional efforts were made via television appearances by Ms. Collins. Other pop and jazz artists on the label included Nelson Eddy, Randy Van Horne Singers, Gloria Lynne, Woody Herman, Charley Barnett, Ann Blythe, Russ Morgan, etc. The label also entered the singles market with some non-LP 45 rpm releases by their contracted pop and jazz performers. Gloria Lynne relates in her autobiography (I Wish You Love) how she met Raymond Scott and Harry Belock at the Brill Building in New York's Tin Pan Alley in 1957 where they were on the lookout for a vocalist. \\"Harry was the money man and Raymond was the creative guy. They were talking in such technical terms that I didn't understand all of the mechanics of what they were proposing, but they were going to pay me five hundred dollars, and I understood that.\\" Bert Whyte was the producer and engineer. Ruth, his wife, was the assistant engineer. Belock and Whyte decided to record music on 35 mm magnetic film, which they believed was an improvement over half-inch tape. Westrex built this equipment to their specifications, at a cost then of about $20,000 for each recorder. Neumann U 47 microphones were purchased to go with the film recorders. Everest‚Äôs recording philosophy was to make minimally-miked three-channel recordings using 35 mm film recorders in the specially designed Belock Recording Studio in Bayside, New York and in a portable version on location in the USA and Europe. In May 1959, Edward Wallerstein (formerly president of Columbia Records) was appointed as a vice president of the company. Whyte was determined to engage well-known performers in a market loaded with exclusive contract artists. Everest managed to engage the services of several major conductors, including Sir Adrian Boult, Josef Krips, Eugene Aynsley Goossens, Malcolm Sargent, William Steinberg, Walter Susskind and Leopold Stokowski. Stokowski signed a contract to record with Everest on September 26, 1958. Among the first Everest recordings were a group with Stokowski conducting the \\"Stadium Symphony Orchestra of New York\\" (a pseudonym for members of the New York Philharmonic) in Manhattan Center. (The New York Philharmonic formerly gave summer concerts in Lewisohn Stadium.) Stokowski made a total of eleven LPs with Everest during 1958-59. Six were recorded with the spurious Stadium Symphony and five with the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Stokowski believed that the recording philosophy of Everest was inimical to music making, and more in line with mathematics and engineering. None of the records he made with the company seemed to satisfy him. However, many are still considered exceptional as recordings. Stokowski discovered bootleg recordings of his Everest records being issued on the Tiara label. These included both his name and the name of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. He wrote Bernard Solomon at Everest to ask how this could be possible. In England, Everest recorded the London Philharmonic Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra at Walthamstow Assembly Hall. The world premiere recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 9 in E minor was made by Everest at Walthamstow on the morning of the composer's death, August 26, 1958. The composer planned to attend the Everest sessions just as he had attended the earlier Decca sessions for the first eight symphonies. As before, Adrian Boult conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, but this time he began by recording a tribute to the composer. Everest also recorded several composers conducting their own work, including Malcolm Arnold, Carlos Chavez, Aaron Copland, Morton Gould, Ferde Grof√©, and Heitor Villa-Lobos. In addition, one LP featured historic Melodiya recordings of Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian conducting their violin concertos, each with David Oistrakh as soloist. In 1967, Everest issued the first performance of Shostakovitch's suppressed Thirteenth Symphony, using a live recording smuggled out of the Soviet Union. In the Everest Archive of Piano Music, the company made stereo recordings on a 1929 Steinway piano of Percy Grainger playing his own music on the Aeolian Company's Duo-Art piano reproduction mechanism. Sadly, one composer/performer, Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi (Ernst von Dohnanyi), died in 1960 while recording piano compositions for Everest. Dohn√°nyi made few recordings, not caring much for the process. He was attempting to complete a huge recording assignment in January 1960 when he fell ill at a session. His condition deteriorated quickly and in a matter of hours he was seized with a heart attack. Believing rightly that this was his last opportunity to record, Dohn√°nyi continued the session, and two days later he died. Everest issued a memorial album to the composer, on SDBR 3061. Everest negotiated with Cetra Records in Italy to issue that label's extensive catalog of complete opera recordings in the United States. Several of these recordings were of little known or seldom heard operas, many of them issued on records for the first, or only time. Everest prospered for only a few years. It may have been hurt financially by Whyte's recording the complete Pablo Casals Festival in 1960. By this time, Harry Belock owned only 22% of the business and the board removed him from control. Belock (who died in 1999) left the record business and sold his interest in Everest to his accountant, Bernard Solomon, in 1962. The studio and all its recording equipment was sold in 1961 to engineer C. Robert Fine, who used the equipment for Mercury Records, Command Classics and other recordings. A Mercury CD release by Robert Fennell of Gershwin and Cole Porter (434 327-2/1993) contains the following information on the inside of the booklet: \\"The songs of Cole Porter were recorded in the Bayside Studio of Fine Recording, N.Y., on November 20 and 21, 1961, on 3-track 35mm film, 3-track half inch tape, and 2 track quarter-inch tape..on this CD the 3-track half inch master was used as the 35mm was unavailable.\\" This would indicate, if true, that Mercury Records had commenced 35mm recording using at least some of the Belock equipment in late 1961. The studio operated for a few more years as Fine Recording Bayside but was closed in the mid-1960s. The 35 mm equipment was absorbed into Fine Recording's main facility in Manhattan. One of the original machines was used by Wilma Cozart Fine to remaster Mercury 35 mm recordings for CD in the 1990s. When Everest was being sold off, the popular recordings were purchased by Liberty Records, who issued some of them on their budget Sunset label, titles by Gisele MacKenzie, Randy Van Horne Singers, Nelson Eddy and Raymond Scott. Much of the pop and jazz masters remained in the Liberty vault, until the label was purchased by EMI. It is assumed the masters now reside somewhere in the EMI vault. The classical catalogue comprising all the original 35mm film masters and half inch magnetic tapes are currently archived under controlled conditions in the Hamburg vaults of Countdown Media/BMG Music who purchased the copyright from Grammercy in the 1990s. Prior to that the copyright was owned, it is believed, by Omega/Vanguard Records who undertook the first modern digital remastering released by Vanguard Classics. King Records in Japan are currently in the process of releasing all titles on SACD discs. A previous all tube reissue and remastering by Classic Records in the 1990s of a small number of 35mm film masters to both high quality vinyl repressings and DVD-Audio did unfortunately suffer from some wow and flutter issues. The plan now is for one further digital remastering using modified Westrex record/playback machines with added laser guidance to eliminate these problems in the age of the masters. The 35mm film masters and magnetic tapes are reported to be in a very good condition due to only light use to date. {correspondence with Countdown Media/David Murphy } The rights to the Jazz and Popular catalogue are now also held in Japan, though reissues using excellent remastering from the original tapes continue to be released by Universal Music and Essential Media. A number of Everest recordings were also issued by the World Record Club, both on LP and on tape. These were mono at 3 ips. but very high quality. Collectors have determined that the only Everest LPs worth having are those that were recorded and pressed while Belock was at the company. Identifying these records is relatively easy: the first issues sport a silver/turquoise label (with the earliest of these having a wood dowel on the outside edge of the inner sleeve). The silver paper used on these covers usually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The second label is a purple mountain. The entire classical catalog of Belock Everests is relatively small, fewer than 100 LPs. Reissues The Everest masters were located in a California vault in 1993 by Seymour Solomon, president of Omega Records and founder of Vanguard Classics. In recent years, some of Everest's audiophile recordings of the Belock/Whyte era have been reissued on compact disc by Collectables Records, DCC Compact Classics, Omega, and Vanguard Classics and on CD, DVD-Audio and LP by Classic Records.

It is situated in the Bukowsko Upland mountains, located near the towns of Medzilaborce and Palota (in northeastern Slovakia). Etymology According to some sources its name comes from the east Slavic dialect word Kuman (–∫—É–º–∞–Ω–∏), meaning \\"village of Cumans\\". History The village was first mentioned in historical records in 1512 as Crziemyenna, and in 1524 as Komancza. In 1785, the village lands comprised , with a population of 450 Greek Catholics, 16 Roman Catholics, and 15 Jews.Lemko surnames cited by Krasovs'kyj (from 1787 Austrian Cadastral Records). After World War I, the village was the site of the ephemeral Komancza Republic (November 1918 ‚Äì January 1919). In 1936, the Greek Catholics (Uniates) population increased to 878. In 1945 the Ukrainian parish priest, Orest Venhrynovych, was murdered by the Poles, and in 1946 the village was burned down ]Patronage of the B. V. Mary when many local citizens were forcibly deported to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Others were removed from Komancza on 29 April 1947 as part of Operation Vistula and moved to the Silesian area of Poland. Culture and religion The wooden village church, \\"Patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\", is considered a pearl of Eastern Lemko architecture. It was built in 1802, and was on the Polish Register of Historic Buildings. The church was occupied by the Greek Catholics until 1963, when it was taken over by the Orthodox. Uniate (Greek Catholic) services were then held in a Roman Catholic Chapel, until a new Uniate church was built in 1987. The old wooden church was totally destroyed by fire on 13 September 2006, but the belfry is still standing. A number of liturgical books, dated from 1638 to 1793, were also severely damaged or destroyed in the fire. Filial churches are located in Czystohorb ( away) and Do≈Ç≈ºyca ().

It was a 13-element interferometer operating between 26 and 36 GHz (Ka band) in ten bands. The instrument is similar in design to the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and the Very Small Array (VSA). In 2001 The DASI team announced the most detailed measurements of the temperature, or power spectrum of the Cosmic microwave background (CMB). These results contained the first detection of the 2nd and 3rd acoustic peaks in the CMB, which were important evidence for inflation theory. This announcement was done in conjunction with the BOOMERanG and MAXIMA experiment. In 2002 the team reported the first detection of polarization anisotropies in the CMB. In 2005, the vacant DASI mount was used for the QUaD experiment, which was another CMB imager focussed on the E-mode spectrum. In 2010, the DASI mount was again repurposed for the Keck Array, which also measures CMB polarization anisotropy. Introduction The CMB was created when the universe was about 380,000 years old, when the opaque plasma fog which existed after the Big Bang began to recombine into hydrogen atoms and allowed photons to travel freely through space. This radiation has since been redshifted by the expansion of the universe and can be seen faintly in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. In 1992 it was observed that there are very slight anisotropies in the effective temperature of the CMB, and the DASI telescope was outfitted to precisely measure these temperature anisotropies and then to detect polarization; the first to look at the polarization of the CMB. The ŒõCDM (dark energy and cold dark matter) theory, regarded as the standard model of cosmology, predicted polarization of the CMB due to the scattering effects of the first atoms in the universe. Project leader John Carlstrom said that if polarization had not been found, astrophysicists would have to reject all their interpretations of recent data. Construction =Location= The DASI telescope was set up over the 1999-2000 austral summer, on the inner of the two towers of the Martin A.Pomerantz Observatory at the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station 0.7 km from the geographic south pole. The southern polar site is an exceptional location for this sort of telescope because of the extremely favourable atmospheric conditions. The high altitude and extreme dryness means the air is thinner and contains much less water vapour than other climates, which is important as water is a good absorber of microwave radiation and blocks a portion of the CMB signal. Also, the sun is only visible for six months of the year negating the need to shield the telescope from it during that time. Other telescopes which have been or are at the station include the Viper, Python, and the South Pole Telescope. See the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station article for a list of astrophysics experiments at the site. =Design= The DASI was a compact interferometer made up of 13 small telescope elements in a pattern with three lines of symmetry. Each of the 13 telescopes had a lensed corrugated horn, with a corrugated shroud to reduce crosstalk between the antennae. Each of the telescopes had a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier working at the frequencies 26‚Äì36 GHz (Ka band), cryogenically cooled to about 10K. The receiver noise temperatures ranged from 15K-26K at band centre, and 30K at the edges. The overall system temperature reached about 26K. For the polarization observations, the telescope was reconfigured during the 2000-2001 austral summer with achromatic polarizers, providing the telescope with sensitivity in all four Stokes parameters. The telescope mount was of an altitude-azimuth (altazimuth) design, with a counterbalanced gear and pinion elevation drive, that gave great stability when tracking and pointing. The mount had a heavy box steel construction, which was necessary to ensure stability of the mass of the telescope. The telescope was designed to provide the most reliable results possible by minimising any factor which could affect the images produced, for example the tower where the telescope was situated was mechanically isolated to prevent vibrations from the rest of the building affecting the equipment. The telescope was inside a large upside- down dome which served as a ground shield to minimise interfering thermal radiation from the earth. To avoid human exposure to the temperatures of the Antarctic winter, there was a canopy between the telescope and the ground shield which created a sealed cabin allowing access by ladder to the instruments without leaving the safety of the building. The design of the DASI was very similar to that of the VSA and the CBI. The electronic equipment behind the CBI and DASI were actually identical as were the 26‚Äì36 GHz frequencies operated at. However the CBI was designed for smaller angular scales, so it had a greater resolution over a smaller area of the sky, and so had 0.9m dishes instead of DASI's 20 cm horns. The VSA was also similar in concept and operated at the same frequency, but operated at smallerangular resolutions of 0.2-3¬∞. =Funding= The project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) office of polar programs, first through the Centre for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica and then directly through the office. It was additionally supported by the Centre for Cosmological Physics in Chicago. Results DASI made its first observations over 97 days during the 2000 austral winter, measuring temperature anisotropies of the CMB in 32 roughly adjacent circular areas of the sky, each 3.4¬∞ in diameter. These observations were highly sensitive, typically at an rms precision of 10ŒºK. After another set of measurements in 2001 the team reported the results the first measurements of the 2nd and 3rd acoustic peaks in the CMB's power spectrum, the 1st had been discovered by earlier experiments MAT/TOCO, BOOMERanG and MAXIMA. The cuts of DASI's data were done with a strict \\"jackknife\\" test which removed data which was gathered when certain parameters were exceeded, for example if the sun rose more than 5¬∞ over the horizon, or there was a large offset or excessive noise in the data suggesting a hardware glitch. This is a standard practise which sacrifices some accuracy for improved reliability. In December 2002, the DASI team reported the discovery of polarization anisotropies in the CMB. This followed 2 years and 271 days of observations of two of the previous 3.4¬∞ diameter FWHM areas. 22 days of data was cut. The experiment was continued through the austral winter of 2003, and the new data confirmed the conclusions of the previous two years. =Conclusions= The 2001 discovery of the 2nd and 3rd acoustic peaks in the CMB was an important piece of evidence for the inflation theory of the expansion of the universe. According to the theory, acoustic peaks are caused by the oscillations of matter during the Big Bang, which should be measurable as one main frequency or tone, with a series of overtones or harmonics. The 1st acoustic peak represents the main tone, and the 2nd and 3rd peaks discovered by DASI represent the 2nd and 3rd harmonics. These readings can also be used to measure the baryon density of the early universe, and these measurements provided evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. This has since become the ŒõCDM Standard Model of Cosmology. From the more recent polarization results scientists could have \\"high confidence\\" of the presence of E-modes in the CMB, which added to the evidence supporting the ŒõCDM Standard Model of Cosmology; the data is also helpful to understanding the mass distribution of the early universe. The temperature anisotropies revealed the existence of formations of matter in the early universe, and the polarization revealed how these formations were moving. The developments in interferometric technique achieved by this project were also thought to be helpful for future projects seeking to discover B-modes as evidence for gravitational waves. The DASI however, was not large enough to be useful in the search for B-modes, and having accomplished what it had been designed for, was decommissioned.

Nasr persuaded Michael to release him and allow him to construct a fortress at al-Maniqa from where he would defend the Byzantine domains. Michael agreed and even sent a 1,000-strong garrison there, but when the fortress was finished, Nasr refused to hand it over, and with assistance from the emir of Tripoli and the local Fatimid commander, killed the garrison.John Skylitzes, Synopsis of Histories, 379.59‚Äì69Yahya of Antioch, 502 In July 1029, Michael resolved to attack Aleppo, despite having no authorisation from Emperor Romanos III (r. 1028‚Äì34) and disregarding the pleas of the Mirdasid brothers Shibl al-Dawla Nasr and Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal to maintain the peace. In the event, he was caught in an ambush at Kaybar and his camp was raided by the Arabs, after which he retreated and concluded a treaty with the Mirdasids.Yahya of Antioch, 492 Following these failures, he was dismissed by Romanos III, who resolved to campaign in Syria in person, sending his brother-in-law Constantine Karantenos ahead with some troops to replace Michael Spondyles.John Skylitzes, Synopsis of Histories, 377.14‚Äì18, 379.75‚Äì77 In the event, however, the emperor's own campaign would result in a humiliating defeat.John Skylitzes, Synopsis of Histories, 279.81‚Äì381.18Yahya of Antioch, 492-500 Michael (called Sphrondeles by the Latin historians) re-appears in 1038, when he joined George Maniakes in his Sicilian expedition.Lupus Protospatharius, 58.6-7 He probably replaced Constantinos Opos as catepan before Nikephoros Doukeianos could take over the post the next year (1039).

The motorway is 65 km and has a mixture of 2x2 and 2x3 lanes that run through mountainous coastal terrain along the Mediterranean. As such, it has some relatively sharp turns and steep gradients by French motorway standards, and some sections have a reduced speed limit of 110 km/h. The first section between Marseille and Aubagne was opened in 1962 and was until 1963 part of the A52 autoroute until it was renumbered after the surrounding motorways were constructed. Most of the remainder between Aubagne and Toulon was completed by 1975.

It was one of the last films of the iconic Bengali actor Uttam Kumar, who died during production. A lookalike, Prabir Kumar, was brought in to stand in for Uttam Kumar during the final sections of the film. The body double was used in the song \\"O Daddy O Mummy\\" and younger brother Torun Kumar's voice was dubbed in. The movie was a hit at the box office and is often regarded as one of the major hits in the history of Bengali cinema. The music was composed by Bappi Lahiri. The movie is a Bengali reworking of the story of Pygmalion, heavily drawing upon the hit British musical My Fair Lady. Plot Gagan (Uttam Kumar) does not like to socialise, while his wife Chitra (Sumitra Mukherjee) loved attending parties. One day, Chitra's friend Lola invites her to a party. In the meanwhile, the Kolkata Book Fair takes off and Gagan wanted to go. Savitri (Moushumi Chatterjee) lived with her uncle from an early age. One day, her uncle sold her for some money, from where Savitri escaped and took shelter in Gagan's house. When Gagan's wife saw Savitri in Gagan's reading room, she went to her grandfather's house. Gagan and Abalakanta (Santosh Dutta) helped Savitri learn etiquette and the ways of genteel society. One day, Gagan thinks of an alliance between Savitri and Abalakanta. But Savitri did not agree to marry Abalakanta. In the meanwhile, Sandip (Ranjit Mallick) came and becomes confused on seeing Savitri. Gagan then realises about their love. So he arranges Sandip and Savitri's marriage in his house. But Chitra's servant told her that Gagan was to marry Savitri. So Chitra comes to the house with her grandfather. Finally, Chitra realises that the bridegroom was her brother Sandip. The film thus ends on a happy note.

It is a variant of the koto, which traditionally has thirteen strings. The instrument is also known as , \\"seventeen-stringed koto\\", or \\"bass koto\\" (although kotos with a greater number of strings also exist). The j≈´shichi-gen was invented in 1921 by Michio Miyagi, a musician who felt that the standard koto lacked the range he sought. His seventeen-stringed creation, sometimes described as a \\"bass koto\\", has a deeper sound and requires specialized plectra (picks worn attached to the player's fingers with which the strings are plucked). Though his original j≈´shichi-gen was considerably larger than a normal koto, seventeen-stringed koto of a normal koto size are more common today; these presumably do not have as deep a sound. Construction The bass koto is similarly made from the Paulownia tomentosa (kiri) wood but the thickness of the wood so taken is approximately twice than that of a single koto. The wood is dried and treated by the traditional method until it gets good for construction. The strings used are made up of silk threads which are yellow in colour. They give a deep sound. These strings are tied from one end up to another one and a platform is created made of ivory. Then, the strings are tied over small cylindrical holders with holes and tied very tightly to the downside. The bridges (jƒ´) are also even bold than the common bridges used in koto. The plectra used are made from special ivory so that plucking can be done easily. During playing there is a danger that the bridges can fall from their place, but the strings are tied so that the bridges cannot fall off but can be moved. Some of the players also used to colour some specific bridges so that while playing, they would not fall. Advanced techniques of playing Players also invented new techniques for playing a Bass-Koto. It uses more use of the left hand as it produces a deep sound which lasts for a longer time. This helps to create more pitches at one string. The strings are also plucked over the cylindrical holder to create a sudden shrill. The area of koto towards the left side is also plucked by left hand. This creates a very good and humbling tune.

The annual music festivals, include Comstock Rock (Classic Rock), Comstock Windmill Festival (Country), and Godstock (Christian). These are Nebraska's largest music festivals, with Comstock Rock ranking among the largest in the United States, attracting over 50,000 attendees through the 4 days in mid July. During the festivals, 2nd Wind Ranch is the host to music goers from all over the country. Background The first Comstock Windmill Festival in June 2000 featuring country star Brad Paisley was the first installment of an annual event that would bring in country acts from all over the country. Comstock Windmill Festival 2001 expanded into a four-day festival. In 2002 a variety of rock bands took part in a multi-day festival, dubbed Comstock Rock. The rock festival has featured many of the biggest names in classic rock which draws people from all over the nation. The first Godstock took place in August 2003 and featured some of Christian music's biggest names. In 2005, one death and several injuries, in addition to a large number of minors charged with possession of alcohol, brought negative attention to alcohol consumption at the Rock festival. The State of Nebraska halted the liquor licensing process before the 2006 season following allegations of underaged drinking, and the organizers were forced to modify the rules for vending of alcoholic beverages for the 2006 festival season. Vendors were forced to comply with the new rules in order for the festival to receive the required liquor licence. About 45 security and 20 local law enforcement officers were on site for the 2006 festival as well as EMTs. After the 2006 Comstock events, financial pressures caused a delay in booking and announcement of the 2007 line up. There was a question of whether the Comstock Windmill Festival would even continue. Those concerns were laid to rest with the announcement that Viaero Wireless, a cellular service provider, would sponsor and invest heavily to ensure its financial viability. In early 2007 Viaero Wireless became a sponsor of the Comstock Music Series and announced its first country headliners: Big and Rich and the return of Kenny Rogers. The Viaero Wireless Sponsorship ended after one year. In 2008 after questions of whether the festival would continue or not, the festival gained new ownership. Concerts were held in June and July under new management. These events are now being called Comstock Music Series which include both country and rock events.

Aifric has been shown on BBC Alba where it was dubbed in Scottish Gaelic.Aifric, Series 1 Aingil Chaitlin, BBC Alba, 28 October 2008 N√≠ Chios√°in has starred, or appeared in, a number of other Irish-language productions and hosted a radio show. Roles In Aifric, N√≠ Chios√°in starred as the 13- to 14-year-old title character. The series revolves around Aifric's family of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoir√≠) who have recently moved to a Gaeltacht area in the west of Ireland. Her family are quite eccentric and unorthodox. Aifric however is a sensible yet self- conscious character and who, in spite of her family, wishes to be normal. She is very conscious about doing anything that may be embarrassing. Given the nature of her family, avoiding embarrassment becomes an uphill struggle, with an entertaining outcome. The show also focuses on her first kiss and the associated difficulties. In 2008, N√≠ Chios√°in was nominated for an Irish Film and Television Academy award for her role in Aifric. Other minor TV roles include the show Sc√∫p, another TG4 production. This was shown on TG4 and BBC Northern Ireland. She was also interviewed on the RT√â2 show Two Tube. N√≠ Chios√°in and her sister hosted Speig Neanta, a radio show on Dublin's Irish- language station Raidio na Life, which runs every Saturday. A notable event from the show was a prank call made by RT√â 2fm's Cormac Battle purporting to be the famous Irish musician Hozier. During the interview \\"Hozier\\" uncharacteristically bragged about his achievements and attempted to ask N√≠ Chiosain out on a date. She eventually realised that it was a hoax but took it in good part. In theatre, N√≠ Chios√°in appeared in the play R√©ilt√≠n in the Abbey Theatre. This was another Irish language play and is a modern production. It focuses on a young girl's attempt to win fame as a singer entirely through Irish language rock songs in both Ireland and Britain. The production itself was subject to criticism, with an Irish Independent review commenting that the play had \\"No clear plot and little direction as Cliona N√≠ Chiosain spins about to a backing track of aped Britpop, keening over her failed love affairs with music and with her man. Occasionally falling over and singing from behind a mop of hair it's 50 minutes of extreme karaoke.\\" The review notes, however, that Cliona N√≠ Chiosain \\"tries admirably\\" with most criticism directed against the plot. This play premiered in America and was part of the Dublin Theatre Festival. N√≠ Chios√°n also starred in F√≠b√≠n's production of the Irish play An Triail, a well-known drama by M√°ir√©ad N√≠ Ghr√°da. N√≠ Chiosain played the character of M√°ire, the young mother who is abandoned by 1960s Irish society. This production received some acclaim, being described as a \\"creative and vibrant interpretation of M√°ir√©ad N√≠ Ghr√°da's play\\" by the Irish Theatre Magazine. Presenter N√≠ Chios√°n has presented shows for RT√â Two. T√≠r na N√≥g is a bi-lingual woodland-based nature program.

His friend Dennis Fritz was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Williamson was sentenced to death. Both were released 11 years later when DNA evidence proved their innocence. Their story became the subject of bestselling author John Grisham's first nonfiction book, The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, and the adapted Netflix docu-series of the same name. Early life Born and raised in Ada, Oklahoma, Williamson was the youngest of three children and the only son. He was a standout athlete even when very young and excelled in several sports, although his primary interest was baseball. He played baseball at Asher High School, because his parents moved there so that he could play under the school's legendary coach, Murl Bowen. After hitting .500 in the state championships his senior year, he was the 41st pick in baseball's 1971 amateur draft, a second-round selection by the Oakland Athletics. Forgoing a scholarship offer from the University of Oklahoma, Williamson signed and spent the 1972 season primarily with the Coos Bay-North Bend A's, hitting .265 in 52 games. In 1973, he hit .137 for the Key West Conchs with 13 runs produced in 59 games. A shoulder injury derailed his career for the next few years. Williamson's father, through a childhood friendship with former major league pitcher Harry Brecheen, got him a look with the New York Yankees, where he was converted to a pitcher in their minor league system for parts of 1976 and 1977, but recurring shoulder problems limited his appearances and effectiveness. In his last season, he pitched in 14 games, working 33 innings. At the age of 24 his once-promising baseball career was over. After returning to Oklahoma, Williamson held several other jobs. He became addicted to drugs and alcohol and suffered from increasingly severe mental illness, becoming depressed and living with his mother Juanita. Arrest and conviction On December 8, 1982, Debbie \\"Debbie Sue\\" Carter, after visiting the Coachlight, an Ada bar Williamson frequently visited, was found raped and murdered. Williamson and friend Dennis Fritz were arrested five years later on flimsy testimony. In separate trials, both Fritz and then Williamson were found guilty in 1988. Williamson received a death sentence, while Fritz was sentenced to life without parole. The evidence included expert testimony in hair analysis, which is now regarded as unreliable. The expert concluded that 13 of the 17 hairs found at the crime scene were \\"microscopically consistent\\" with those of Fritz and Williamson, and alleged that one of them was a \\"match.\\" The defense failed to point out that although the hair samples could have implicated the pair, they equally could have cleared them both. Despite his rapidly failing mental health, no motion was made to assess Williamson's competence. After their sentencing, a confession by a man named Ricky Jo Simmons came to light. Having learned of this while on death row, Williamson became increasingly convinced that Simmons had committed the murder and repeatedly demanded his arrest. Simmons was never charged. At one time on September 22, 1994, Williamson was only five days away from being executed when the execution was stayed by the court following a habeas corpus petition. At the time, Williamson screamed \\"I'm innocent! I'm innocent! I'm innocent!\\" from his cell to protest his impending execution.\\"The Innocent ManBook Review\\". Entertainment Weekly.

Exoneration After 11 years on death row, and following several appeals, Williamson and Fritz were cleared by DNA testing, and were finally freed on April 15, 1999 (Williamson was the 78th inmate exonerated from death row since 1973 as of November 29, 2010\\"Innocence: List of Those Freed from Death Row\\". Death Penalty Information Center. Retrieved on January 26, 2009.). In 2003, they sued the City of Ada and won a settlement of $500,000; the State of Oklahoma also settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Many of the residents of Ada continued to believe that Williamson and Fritz were guilty long after they were exonerated.Grisham, John. The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, Doubleday Books, 2006. Indeed, both men reportedly felt it necessary to be very wary after their release, such was their belief that the prosecutor, Bill Peterson, and other officials of the Ada police would try to bring them to trial again. Death Williamson died in a nursing home of cirrhosis five years later. Although he had a history of illicit drug and alcohol abuse, Thorazine and other potent psychotropic prescription drugs may have precipitated the cirrhosis. Best- selling novelist John Grisham read Williamson's obituary in The New York Times and made him and Fritz the subject of his first non-fiction book, The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, published in 2006. The book became a bestseller.http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/1109.php Real killer Glen D Gore (born 27 April 1960)https://okoffender.doc.ok.gov/, an Ada man who had testified against both Williamson and Fritz, was ultimately convicted of the murder of Debbie Carter. He was the last person seen with Carter, and also had been seen arguing with her on the night of her death. Although he was interviewed by the police he was not fingerprinted, nor did he give saliva and hair samples. While Williamson and Fritz were incarcerated, Gore was also imprisoned on another unrelated violent crime conviction. Once Williamson and Fritz had been cleared of murder, Gore eventually came to trial, based on the same DNA evidence that had cleared Fritz and Williamson. This evidence proved that it was Gore's DNA that was left at the scene. On June 24, 2003, Gore was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, but his death sentence was overturned in August 2005.2nd trial begins for man given death sentence, NewsOK.com.

During the spring of 1830, Grant visited the village of Assynt in the Scottish Highlands of Sutherlandshire to attend a wedding on March 19. However, after disappearing between Drumbeg and Nedd on March 11, his body was discovered four weeks later by a farm servant passing by the Loch-for-na- eigin, a remote mountain loch located almost a mile from Drumbeg. After dragging his body ashore, the servant observed the peddler's pockets had been emptied and turned inside out (Grant was known to be carrying a considerable amount of money) and his backpack missing as well as marks on his face showing signs of foul play. However, local authorities were unable to solve the crime and Grant's murder remained unsolved for some time. However, after the local postmaster casually mentioned to Sheriff Lumsden about changing a ¬£10 note with a suspicious looking man shortly after Grant's disappearance, Sheriff Lumsden questioned schoolteacher Hugh Macleod. After Macleod denied the postmaster's claim, the sheriff arrested Macleod and ordered a search of his house. None of the peddler's belongings were found however and, shortly before the sheriff was to release Macleod, a tailor named Kenneth Fraser came forward claiming he had experienced a dream in which he saw a vision of Macleod's cottage and in which he heard a voice speaking in Gaelic which told him \\"The merchant's pack is lying in a cairn of stones, in a hole near their house.\\" Leading authorities to Macleod's home, several articles belonging to Grant were found under a pile of stones. While there was some doubt to the tailor's story, the discovery of a pair of stockings later found in Macleod's possession later provided enough evidence to bring Macleod before a Court of Justice. Tried before Lord Moncreiff of the circuit court in Inverness on September 27, Fraser testified against Macleod, who was found guilty of his murder for which he later confessed before his execution.

It's in the Bukowsko Upland mountains, parish in loco, located near the towns of Medzilaborce and Palota (in northeastern Slovakia). During the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth it was in Lesser Poland prowincja. Characteristics Bukowsko is the administrative and cultural centre of the Gmina Bukowsko. It is crossed by the rail road connecting it with Slovakia. It is especially the private sector and service industries that are developing rapidly at this time. It is home to the Uniwersytet Ludowy, opened in 2005, which contains many artworks and effects of the folk handworks inspiration. Bukowsko is situated in the poorest region of Poland. History Settled in prehistoric times, the southern-eastern Poland region that is now Podkarpacie was overrun in pre-Roman times by various tribes, including the Celts, Goths and Vandals (Przeworsk culture). After the fall of the Roman Empire, of which most of south-eastern Poland was part (all parts below the San), the area was invaded by Hungarians and Slavs. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor), when Volodymyr the Great of Kievan Rus took the area over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, 1031 back to Rus, in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it. In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1361. During 966‚Äì1018, 1340‚Äì1772 (Ruthenian Voivodeship) and during 1918‚Äì39 Bukowsko was part of Poland. While during 1772‚Äì1918 it belonged to Austrian empire, later Austrian-Hungarian empire when double monarchy was introduced in Austria. This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodship) was known as Galicia. It was given the Magdeburg law in 1768. In 1785 the village lands comprised . There were 700 Catholics. In 1864 Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam was appointed as rabbi of the Jewish community of Bukowsko.

In the spring of 1942, 804 Jews of Bukowsko and over 300 of the surrounding villages were put into a ghetto. Out of that number over 100 were shot on the local (Jewish) cemetery. The rest were transported to the camp in Zwangsarbeitslager Zaslaw. None of the prayer houses survived the war. Only a few remained on the cemetery.Andrzej Potocki. Podkarpackie judaica.

The Jews, 60 on average, carried out road construction. An April 1946 New York Times article reported that on April 4, 1946, 389 of the 400 buildings in the village were burned down and 3,000 people were made homeless by a force of Ukrainian nationalists and German deserters operating in the area who had a few days earlier demanded, but not received, a payment of 1 million z≈Çoty.

The castle overlooks the Kiso River, which serves as the border between Aichi and Gifu Prefectures. Inuyama Castle is one of only 12 Japanese castles to remain unreconstructed from the end of the Edo period. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2018. Background Inuyama Castle is located on a hill overlooking the Kiso River in what is now the city of Inuyama. Due to its location next to a river, Inuyama castle is compared to Baidicheng, a castle located on the hill beside the Yangtze river in Chongqing, China. Inuyama Castle is often claimed without any historical justification as the \\"oldest castle in Japan\\"; however, Inuyama Castle is one of 12 castles to have retained its Edo period donjon (Tenshukaku) intact. This main tower is small but due to its complex form, it shows different silhouettes depend on the angle. Among the 12 remaining main towers, the donjon at Inuyama Castle is designated as a National Treasure of Japan, as are Matsumoto Castle, Hikone Castle and Himeji Castle. History The precise year Inuyama Castle was completed is uncertain. The castle guidebook claims it was completed in 1440. According to the Heian period Engishiki a Shinto shrine, the Haritsuna Shrine was moved to make way for the castle. The structure was rebuilt several times in the Muromachi period and the current configuration was largely the work of Oda Nobunagu, Oda Nobunaga's uncle in 1537. Although the antiquated architectural style of the watchtower atop the tenshu has in the past led many historians to believe this to be the oldest extant tenshu in Japan, that honor goes to Maruoka Castle, built in 1576. Construction on the current main tenshu (donjon) at Inuyama began in 1601, and continued through 1620.Young, David and Michiko. Introduction to Japanese Architecture. Hong Kong: Periplus Editions, 2004. p100. Inuyama Castle was the final obstacle against Oda Nobunaga's unification of Owari Province. After Nobunaga had defeated the Imagawa clan at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, his cousin, Oda Nobukiyo, seized Inuyama Castle with the support of Saito Yoshitatsu on Mino Province. Nobugana recaptured the castle in 1564. After Nobunaga's death, Toyotomi Hideyoshi appointed Ishikawa Sadakiyo as castellan of Inuyama. Ishikawa rebuilt the defenses of the castle in line with contemporary designs and the current shape of the donjon is a result of this reconstruction. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu expelled the Ishikawa clan and turned the castle over to Owari Domain. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle was governed by the Naruse clan, who ruled as daimy≈ç of Inuyama Domain as vassals of the Owari Tokugawa clan until the Meiji restoration. The new Meiji government seized Inuyama Castle in 1871 and destroyed all of its auxiliary buildings except for the donjon; however, after the castle was damaged in the Great N≈çbi earthquake, and it was returned to the Naruse family in 1895, on the condition that they repair and maintain it. The castle was thus unique in Japan in that it was privately owned. In 2004, ownership of the castle was turned over to a non- profit foundation set up by the Aichi Prefecture's Board of Education.http://www.inuyamajohb.org/ It was long believed that the donjon of Inuyama Castle was moved to the castle from Kanayama Castle in 1599, until such theory was disproved as a result of examination through a large scale restoration work, involving the dismantling of the donjon, carried out between 1961 and 1965.

Design and development A surviving Messenger in 1998, painted to represent Field Marshal Montgomery's aircraft The Messenger was designed to meet a British Army requirement for a robust, slow speed, low maintenance air observation post and liaison aircraft. The aircraft designed was a cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed tailwheel, powered by the de Havilland Gipsy Major 1D inline engine. Fitted with retractable auxiliary wing flaps enabling a wing loading of around 12.5 lb per square foot, the Messenger featured triple fins and rudders in order to maintain sufficient controllability down to the exceptionally low stalling speed of 25 mph.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%200710.html The prototype was converted from a Miles M.28 Mercury and first flew at Woodley on 12 September 1942, some three months after an approach by army officers. When informally test flown by an Aerial Observation Post Squadron it was declared a success, meeting all the army's requirements, however the Ministry of Aircraft Production, having not been consulted, reprimanded George Miles for failing to seek the ministry's permission before rebuilding the aircraft and no orders for the Miles M.38 were placed for the aerial observation post role, AOP units using light, fixed-wing aircraft, notably various marks of Auster. During the war George Miles continued to experiment with the prototype and suggested the aircraft (known as the M.38A) could be operated in the anti-submarine role using a small 60 foot (18.29 metre) deck aboard small merchant ships, landing using a simple arrester wire system. This was tried at Woodley using a simulated deck (with passengers simulating the weight of depth charges). No official interest was expressed in this scheme. However a year later a small order against Specification 17/43 was placed on behalf of the British Royal Air Force for the Messenger I to be employed in the VIP transport passenger transport role.Mondey Wartime users of the type included Marshal of the Royal Air Force 1st Baron Tedder and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery. (The Messenger shown at the beginning of this article - in the guise of this aircraft - attended the 60th D-Day commemorations at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 2004.) Production and operations Messenger 2A registered in the Netherlands at White Waltham Airfield in 1954 Messenger VH-BJM registered in Australia circa 1963 During the war years of the 21 Messengers produced seventeen Messenger 1s survived, and when retired from RAF duties most were converted for civilian use as the Messenger 4A.Jackson They were flown by private pilots and business owners. In 1944 the prototype was rebuilt as the M.48 Messenger 3 with fully retractable electrically-operated split trailing- edge flaps and a 155 h.p. Cirrus Major III engine. This model was not further developed as it did not provide any advantage over the other variants.Simpson Post-war production centred on the Messenger 2A for the civilian market, aircraft being built at Newtownards in Northern Ireland and flown to Woodley for final fitting out. After 71 aircraft were built, production ceased in 1948; a single example was assembled, from existing parts, in 1950. Several examples of the type were sold to Australia and others were exported to Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand, South Africa and Switzerland. The aircraft was a popular touring and racing aircraft during the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1954 Harold Wood in G-AKBO won the King's Cup Race air race at 133 mph. Several examples were still flying in the United Kingdom and New Zealand in early 2011 with private owners and flying groups.

In the past many guitars have been designed with all kinds of odd shapes as well as very practical and convenient solutions to improve the usability of the object. History George Beauchamp is occasionally credited with inventing the electric guitar by designing a lap steel guitar with a pickup, though a lap steel does not have functional frets or a standard guitar-type neck. The earliest \\"electrified\\" fretted guitars were hollow- bodied archtop acoustic guitars to which some form of electromagnetic transducer had been attached. The first commercial electrified guitar was the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts model produced from 1931 to 1936 by Rickenbacker, with one Beauchamp-designed pickup and an early \\"Vib-rola\\" hand vibrato created by Doc Kauffman. =Early years= Sketch of Rickenbacker \\"frying pan\\" lap steel guitar from 1934 patent application Audiovox built and may have offered an electric solid-body guitar as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc Bud Tutmarc's remarks concerning his father's role in developing the first magnetic pickup for a guitar and the first fretted electric bass guitar. who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Tutmarc, converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers (eventually developing his own amplifier circuits) so Tutmark's instruments could be sold matched up with amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the \\"Bud-Electro\\" brand until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils, and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum-cancelling dual-coil configuration. When Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher (later Rickenbacker), he may have passed along Tutmarc's magnetic pickup design, which strongly resembles the pickup on their cast aluminum lap steel guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, released in 1933. Another early solid-body electric guitar was built by musician and inventor Les Paul in the early 1940s, working after hours in the Epiphone Guitar factory. His log guitar (a wood post with a neck attached to it and two hollow body halves attached to the sides for appearance only) was patented, and is often considered to be the first of its kind, although it shares nothing of design or hardware in common with the solid-body \\"Les Paul\\" model later created by Gibson. =Fender= Sketch of Fender lap steel guitar from 1944 patent application. In 1950 and 1951, amplifier builder Leo Fender designed the first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar with a single magnetic pickup, which was initially named the \\"Esquire\\". The later two-pickup version of the Esquire was called the \\"Broadcaster\\". The bolt-on neck was consistent with Leo Fender's belief that the instrument design should be modular to allow cost-effective and consistent manufacture and assembly, as well as simplified repair or replacement. The Broadcaster name was changed to Telecaster because of a legal dispute over the name. In 1954, the Fender Electric Instrument Company introduced the Fender Stratocaster, or \\"Strat\\". It was positioned as a deluxe model and offered various product improvements and innovations over the Telecaster, often based upon responses from working musicians. These innovations included an ash or alder double-cutaway body design, with an integrated vibrato mechanism (called a synchronized tremolo by Fender, thus beginning a confusion of the terms that still continues), three single-coil pickups, and \\"comfort contours\\" where the body edges are significantly contoured. Leo Fender is also credited with developing the first commercially successful electric bass, the Fender Precision Bass, introduced in 1951. =Gibson= The more traditionally designed and styled Gibson solid- body instruments were a contrast to Leo Fender's modular designs and heavily contoured \\"slab\\" bodies, with the most notable differentiator being the method of neck attachment and the scale of the neck (Gibson-24.75\\", Fender-25.5\\"). Gibson, like many guitar manufacturers, had long offered semi-acoustic guitars with pickups, and previously rejected Les Paul and his \\"log\\" electric in the 1940s. In apparent response to the Telecaster, Gibson introduced the first Gibson Les Paul solid body guitar in 1952 (Les Paul was brought in only towards the end of the design process for details of the design and for marketing endorsement ). Features of the Les Paul include a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top (much like a violin and earlier Gibson archtop hollow body electric guitars) and contrasting edge binding, two single-coil \\"soapbar\\" pickups, a 24¬æ\\" scale mahogany neck with a more traditional glued-in \\"set\\" neck joint, binding on the edges of the fretboard, and a tilt-back headstock with three machine heads (tuners) to a side. The earliest version had a combination bridge and trapeze-tailpiece design as specified by Les Paul himself, but was largely disliked and discontinued after the first year. Gibson then developed the Tune-o-matic bridge and separate stop tailpiece, an adjustable non-vibrato design still in wide use. By 1957, Gibson had made the final major change to the Les Paul of today - the humbucking pickup, or humbucker. The pickup, invented by Seth Lover, was a dual-coil pickup which featured two windings connected out-of-phase and reverse-wound, in order to cancel the 60-cycle mains hum that plagued single-coil pickups; as a byproduct, the two-coil design also produces a distinctive, more \\"mellow\\" tone which appeals to many guitarists. =Vox= In 1962 Vox introduced the pentagonal Phantom guitar, originally made in England but soon after made by EKO of Italy. It was followed a year later by the teardrop-shaped Mark VI, the prototype of which was used by Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones. Vox guitars also experimented with onboard effects and electronics. The Teardrop won a prize for its design. In the mid 1960s, as the sound of electric 12 string guitar became popular, Vox introduced the Phantom XII and Mark XII electric 12 string guitars. Vox produced many more traditional 6 and 12 string electric guitars in both England and Italy. It may be noted that the Phantom guitar shape was quite similar to that of first fretted electric bass guitar, the Audiovox \\"Electric Bass Fiddle\\" of 1934. In 1966 Vox introduced the revolutionary but problematic GuitarOrgan, a Phantom VI guitar with internal organ electronics. The instrument's trigger mechanism required a specially- wired plectrum that completed circuit connections to each fret, resulting in a very wide and unwieldy neck. John Lennon was given one in a bid to secure an endorsement, though this never panned out. According to Up-Tight: the Velvet Underground Story, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also tried one; when asked by the Velvets if it \\"worked\\", his answer was negative. The instrument never became popular, but it was a precursor to the modern guitar synthesizer. =Multiscale/Fanned-Fret Guitars= In recent years, guitars and basses with multi-scale or fanned-fret fingerboards started to appear. These instruments are supposed to offer an advantage over the classical fixed-scale guitars and basses by providing more freedom in setting the tension of each string at the design and manufacturing phases. This may result in a more uniform tension of the strings, as well as possibly offer timbre and tonal characteristics somewhat different from the usual fixed-scale instruments. Variant designs Materials other than wood have been used. Travis Bean and Kramer built guitars with aluminium necks. The Gittler guitar was a \\"skeleton\\" design from the late 1970s, largely stainless steel. In 1979, for the Chicago NAMM trade show, Ibanez built a 76-pound solid-brass guitar, primarily as an attention-getting gimmick but also to demonstrate that while such extreme mass would provide very long note sustain (a characteristic sought by many guitarists), the tonal qualities suffered. Various plastics and composites have been employed. Some hollow-body Danelectro had Masonite body shells. The Ampeg guitars designed by Dan Armstrong pioneered acrylic as a body material. Fiberglass was used by Valco (called \\"Res-O-Glas\\") for some models of hollow-body \\"Airline\\" guitars sold through Montgomery Ward. Carbon fiber has been used for necks as well as bodies. 1991 saw the introduction of guitar designer Jol Dantzig's first truly workable acoustic-electric hybrid guitar design. The instrument, called the DuoTone, was conceived while Dantzig was at Hamer Guitars. (Dantzig was also the designer of the first 12 string bass.) Adapted by players like Ty Tabor, Stone Gossard, Elvis Costello and Jeff Tweedy, the DuoTone was a full \\"duplex\\" instrument that could switch between acoustic and electric tones. Recently there have been many entries in the hybrid category (capable of both acoustic and electric tones) including the T5 by Taylor, Michael Kelly's \\"Hybrid,\\" the Parker Fly and the Anderson Crowdster. In the 90s the band Neptune began building a weird metal guitar with 3rd bridge options incorporated. A predecessor of this type of guitars is the Pencilina. Linda Manzer designed the Pikasso guitar with multiple necks.

Begun in 1922 by Egbert Eggleston, what would eventually become a multimillion-dollar business started out in the back of a local grocery store.Wright Brand Foods History =The Eggleston Years= Wright Brand Foods, Inc. was a meat- packing company located in Vernon, Texas, that was eventually bought by the Tyson Foods corporation in 2001 after seeing rapid market growth beginning in the late 1980s. In 1922, Egbert Eggleston, his son Fay, and son-in-law Roy Wright, founded the Vernon Meat Company in the back of a local grocery store. The initial pork bellies used for making bacon were delivered via railroad cars, covered in salt for preservation, and eventually painted with liquid smoke at Roy Wright.Wright Brand Foods Four years later, Vernon Meat Company constructed a dedicated housing and shipping plant. The company continued reselling products from other companies, including cheese, tea, beans, vinegar, preserves, and syrup. Initial success led to a burgeoning contribution from other family members eager to help now-manager Roy Wright run Vernon Meat.Wright Brand Foods In light of continued growth, a slaughterhouse was built which allowed Vernon Meat to control their belly production from the ground up. Near disaster struck, however, in 1938 when a massive fire consumed most of the plant, including the slaughterhouse. The Eggleston family decided to erect another plant, this time having it federally inspected (inspection #577). The new facility also saw the advent of a new company name‚Äîthe Vernon Packing Company. =The beginning of the Wright Years= The World War II years saw the company change ownership, from Eggleston to Roy Wright, whereupon the Wrights constructed an entirely new plant and renamed the company the Wright Packing Company after their family name. Roy's two sons, Bill and Bob, joined their father in the business. As the years passed Wright Packing steadily grew and by the 1960s had 225 employees. =The Wright Brothers and the Move to Specialization= Roy Wright retired in 1978, bequeathing the family business he had helped build the last fifty-six years to his two sons. Realizing that being a generalized, jack-of- all-trades company that handled both the killing and processing aspects was limiting their ability to grow, Bob and Bill and the Wright Packing family (led by Bill's son, Dan Wright) decided to focus on processing, thus allowing Wright Packing to specialize its production of ham and bacon, meaning that they offer a wider selection of both, and leave the hassle of slaughtering to other companies. Contemporary favorites such as peppered bacon and hickory- smoked ham sprang from the decision to be dedicated to processing. As a result of the specialization in processing, Wright Packing became Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and saw unprecedented growth in sales, causing a need for newer, larger facilities to accommodate the increased volume of pork bellies which were made into ham and bacon. Beginning in 1982 with a new derind room, and ending in 2001 with the most recent addition to the plant including infrastructural enhancements to allow for further upgrades, Wright Brand Foods completely overhauled its processing facility and capability.

Early life Bill Sackter was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1913, the son of Sam and Mary Sackter, Russian Jewish immigrants who ran a grocery store. When Sackter was 7 years old, his father died from complications of the Spanish Flu. It was 1920, and Bill was having difficulty learning in school, and after taking a mandatory intelligence test, he was classified as \\"subnormal\\". The State of Minnesota determined that he would be a \\"burden on society\\" so he was placed in the Faribault State School for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic. Sackter never again saw his mother or two older sisters, Sarah and Alice, remaining there for the next 44 years. He was diagnosed as intellectually disabled, although diagnoses performed decades later would prove his intelligence was near normal. He was never taught to read or write or even how to use a telephone. Encounter with Barry Morrow In 1964, when new light was being shed on the treatment of the mentally ill and disabled, Sackter was moved to a halfway house and worked odd jobs to support himself. He eventually became a handyman at a country club, where Barry Morrow, a filmmaker, and his wife Bev, befriended him. Morrow began slowly to make life a bit more comfortable for Bill, getting him new dentures and becoming his friend. Morrow became his guardian, and when he took a post at the University of Iowa, Sackter followed him to Iowa City, and became the sole proprietor of Wild Bill's Coffee Shop on the campus, in which he excelled. Recognition Sackter was named Handicapped Iowan of the Year in 1976, attending a ceremony in Washington, D.C. President Jimmy Carter gave him special recognition in 1979. Movie depictions Sackter's story was told in two television movies. Bill was presented in December 1981, with Sackter portrayed by Mickey Rooney in a role that brought him an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe. The movie also won an Emmy as outstanding drama special. A sequel, Bill: On His Own, costarring Helen Hunt, was released in 1983. Also, the autistic savant character Raymond Babbitt in the movie Rain Man, cowritten by Barry Morrow, was based in part on Sackter.Barry Morrow's audio commentary for Rain Man from the DVD release. Biographical works Sackter's story is told in the 1999 book The Unlikely Celebrity: Bill Sackter's Triumph Over Disability by Thomas Walz. A Friend Indeed ‚Äì The Bill Sackter Story, a feature-length documentary, was completed in June 2008.Bill Sackter.com Created by filmmaker Lane Wyrick, the documentary explores the life of Bill Sackter using historic photographs, film and video footage, along with interviews with those closest to Bill. Much of the archival footage was taken by Barry Morrow as early as 1972. The documentary shows how Bill Sackter was allowed to develop as an individual with help from many others, and become an important member of the Iowa City community as proprietor of Wild Bill's Coffee Shop. It also follows his rise in becoming a national figure that helped change society's perception of people with disabilities. The documentary was voted the \\"#1 Audience Favorite\\" in five film festivals: The Kansas International Film Festival, Hardacre Film Festival, Omaha Film Festival, Cedar Rapids Independent Film Festival, and the New Strand Film Festival.

History The meaning of the title, \\"first spatharios\\", indicates its original role as leader of the order (taxis) of the spatharioi, the imperial bodyguards, was already attested in the 6th century. Probably under the Heraclians, the rank became an honorary dignity (Greek: Œ¥ŒπŒ± Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒØŒøœÖ ·ºÄŒæŒØŒ±, dia brabeiou axia), and was henceforth bestowed to high-ranking theme commanders, senior court officials, and allied rulers... The first concrete reference to a pr≈çtospatharios occurs in the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor, who records \\"Sergios, pr≈çtospatharios and stratƒìgos of Sicily\\" in 718. In the late 9th century, the pr≈çtospatharios is recorded as ranking below the patrikios and above the dishypatos.. The award of the dignity also meant the entry of its holder in the Byzantine Senate. Its prestige was consequently very high, as illustrated by a well-known story related by Emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos (r. 913‚Äì959) in his De Administrando Imperio: during the reign of his father, Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), an aged cleric of the Nea Ekklesia, Ktenas by name, paid 60 litras of gold (circa 19.4 kg),A litra (), more specifically the logarikƒì or chrysaphikƒì type, was equivalent to 324 grams. . i.e. sixty times the annual stipend of 72 nomismata to which pr≈çtospatharioi were entitled, to acquire the title. He did not live long to enjoy his new status, however, dying two years later.. Like other titles of the middle Byzantine period, its importance declined sharply in the 11th century. The last attested occurrence is in 1115, although the title is still recorded by pseudo-Kodinos in the mid-14th century in the 34th place of the court hierarchy, between the primmikerios of the court and the megas arch≈çn. According to the Klƒìtorologion of Philotheos, the holders of the dignity were distinguished between eunuchs (ektomiai) and non-eunuchs (barbatoi, \\"bearded ones\\"). In addition to the insigne of their rank, a gold necklet (maniakion) adorned with pearls, the former had a special dress, a white, gold-adorned tunic and a red doublet with gold facings. The non-eunuchs were distinguished only by their golden collar (kloios), decorated with precious stones.. Pictorial evidence of the dress of pr≈çtospatharioi in illuminated manuscripts, however, varies considerably over time. In the Book of Offices of pseudo-Kodinos, the garb of this rank is defined as a gold wire- embroidered skaranikon (a tubular headdress), with the image of the reigning emperor enthroned in front and riding a horse behind, a gold kabbadion (caftan) and a skiadion (brimmed hat) of the klap≈çton type,The klap≈çton type involves something being \\"decorated with small golden squares in the shape of a nailhead\\". . while bearing no distinctive dikanikion (staff of office). In the Empire of Trebizond, an equivalent title of Turkish origin, amytzantarios, was used. Functions Aside from being a court rank, there were several pr≈çtospatharioi who had specific duties: *The pr≈çtospatharios in charge of the Chrysotriklinos (), the main reception hall of the Great Palace.. *The pr≈çtospatharios in charge of the Lausiakos (), one of the main halls adjacent to the Chrysotriklinos, serving as a meeting hall. The personnel (oikeiakoi) of the Lausiakos most likely also had functions related to the preparation of imperial banquets.. *The pr≈çtospatharios, or katepan≈ç, of the basilikoi anthr≈çpoi (), a corps of low-level imperial servants, including foreigners. He is listed as one of the stratarchai, thereby denoting an unspecified military role. His subordinate staff included lower-ranking officials (those of spatharioi and kandidatoi rank), with a domestikos as chief aide.; . *The pr≈çtospatharios tƒìs Phialƒìs (), an official acting as judge for the oarsmen of the Byzantine navy stationed around the capital, Constantinople. Like the exact functions of the office, the term phialƒì (\\"water-basin\\") is obscure; it could possibly refer to a location in the harbour of the imperial palace of Boukoleon.

Training The son of a Canadian consulting engineer, Nicolson was born in London and educated at Haileybury but was forced to leave it when his father went blind and lost his income. Instead he won a scholarship to St Paul's School and went on from there to Imperial College London where he was elected a member of the Links Club. He was trained in engineering and was a Constructor Lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors during the Second World War (he served in the North Atlantic and during the invasion of Normandy, where he was mentioned in despatches for his work repairing damaged ships while under fire). Sir David Nicolson was a member of the Links Club of the City and Guilds College whilst at Imperial College. Early career In the early 1950s Nicolson worked as a Production Manager for Bucyrus-Erie Co. in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had employed his father. He was appointed as a Manager of Production-Engineering Ltd in 1953 and later became a Director of the firm; from 1963 to 1968 he was Chairman of the P-E Consulting Group, an associated company. In 1965 he was made Deputy Chairman of BTR Industries, and became company Chairman in 1969. British Airways He was appointed Chairman of the British Airways Board in 1971 after being recruited by John Davies, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the government of Edward Heath. Nicolson served for four years, during which he had the responsibility of uniting the two parts which had previously run as British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways. Nicolson had no previous experience of the airline industry and also felt that the Aerospace Minister Michael Heseltine interfered with his work. However, he succeeded in integrating the schedules and the newly merged airline launched publicly in 1974. A member of the Institute of Directors council from 1971 to 1976 and of the council of the Confederation of British Industry from 1972, Nicolson was made Chairman of Rothmans International plc in 1975 after leaving British Airways. He chaired the CBI's Environment Committee in the late 1970s. He received a Knighthood in 1975. Politics Nicolson strongly supported the development of the European Communities and was pleased to be selected as a Conservative Party candidate for the European Parliament. He was elected and served as Member of the European Parliament for London Central from the 1979 election. However, dealing directly with European Commission processes left him increasingly disillusioned by the bureaucracy involved and he did not seek re-election when the term ended in 1984. Approach to business Never a strong believer in politics, Nicolson regretted excessive involvement by politicians in the management of nationalised industries, and also pointed out that few managers of high technology companies in Britain had technical qualifications themselves. Unlike many company directors of the period, Nicolson was broadly supportive of trade unions. He sometimes told audiences during lectures that his hero was Napoleon. He was Chairman of the European Movement from 1985 to 1988 and Pro-Chancellor of the University of Surrey from 1987 to 1993. Retirement After further business posts, Nicolson largely retired in 1992 to Bale, near Fakenham in Norfolk. He led an appeal that year which led to the building of the Canadian War Memorial in Green Park, but he had few hobbies and did not enjoy the life of a retired businessman. In 1996 he died after suffering a stroke while attending the funeral of an old friend.

Prominent historians such as J. Wall consider it \\"the most perfect earthwork of this type in the county,\\" whilst R. Allen Brown has described it as \\"one of the most important\\" castle sites in East Anglia.Wall, p.598; Brown (1989), p.128. Details Haughley Castle was built in the late 11th century by Hugh de Montfort.Haughley Castle , National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. The castle had a motte and bailey design, with a very large motte, wide at the base and tall.Wall, p.598. D. J. Cathcart King in his summary of mottes in England and Wales questioned this measurement, and suggested that the motte was probably closer to in height.King, p.103. The bailey is rectangular, by across, with the entrance on the west side. Both the motte and the bailey were protected by a deep ditch, fed from a diverted stream from the west to produce a wet moat. Earlier investigations suggested that a stone shell keep had been built on the motte, but the foundations of this, if correct, can no longer be seen.Wall, p.599; Haughley Castle , National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. A further bailey may have originally surrounded the surviving earthworks, enclosing the local church as well.Brown (1989), p.128. The dimensions and scale of the castle has led J. Wall to describe Haughley as \\"the most perfect earthwork of this type in the county,\\" whilst historian R. Allen Brown considers it \\"one of the most important\\" castle sites in East Anglia. Plan of Haughley Castle The castle formed the caput, or main castle, at the centre of the Honour of Haughley. The honour was sometimes known as the \\"honour of the constable\\", because the owner was obligated to provide castle-guard soldiers and knights to the constable of Dover Castle.Brown (1989), p.129. Hugh de Montfort became a monk in 1088 and the castle passed through his family until the mid-11th century. Towards the end of King Stephen's reign the castle was given by the king to Henry of Essex, one of his supporters. By the late 12th century the Bigod family had come to dominate Suffolk, who held the title of the Earl of Norfolk and who were in competition with the Crown for control of the region.Pounds, p.55; Brown (1962), p.191. Henry II had taken the throne after the death of Stephen and Henry d'Essex lost favour after being accused and convicted of cowardice during the 1157 Welsh campaign - Haughley Castle was seized by Henry II in 1163, and by the mid-1170s, the castle was controlled on his behalf by Ralph de Broc and a garrison of 30 soldiers. Conflict broke out again in 1173, during the revolt of Henry's sons and the Bigod's ally Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, landed on the East Anglian coast and marched west, placing the castle under siege.Mackenzie, p.282. Ralph surrendered the castle, which was then burnt by Robert's forces, although the revolt subsequently failed. The castle was not fully rebuilt after its destruction in 1173 however a Manor House was built within the Inner Bailey and the Outer Bailey gradually filled. The remaining parts of the keep tower still standing were removed by Richard Ray in 1760. The circular foundations of over eight feet in thickness are visible today.Redstone, p.304. Today the castle is a scheduled monument. See also *Castles in Great Britain and Ireland *List of castles in England References Bibliography *Brown, R. Allen. (1962) English Castles.

The system is a collaborative effort of many health groups but is published and trademarked by the American College of Radiology (ACR). The system is designed to standardize reporting, and is used by medical professionals to communicate a patient's risk of developing breast cancer. The document focuses on patient reports used by medical professionals, not \\"lay reports\\" that are provided to patients.

These are standardized numerical codes typically assigned by a radiologist after interpreting a mammogram. This allows for concise and unambiguous understanding of patient records between multiple doctors and medical facilities. The assessment categories were developed for mammography and later adapted for use with MRI and Ultrasound findings.

The constitution provides for freedoms of speech and press, but there have been attempts by the government to impede the media‚Äôs freedom of expression and silence criticism of public officials. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Inter-American Press Association, the NGO Reporters Without Borders, and other groups criticized government efforts to censor the press. In January 2012 the president supported a bill introduced by his party in the National Assembly to penalize speech that criticized the president and his administration. The bill was withdrawn after debate. A 2012 poll conducted by the Forum of Journalists concluded that 82 percent of local journalists considered freedom of expression restricted by threats and pressure from President Martinelli‚Äôs administration. Legal actions brought by officials of the former government remained pending against many journalists. There were nine new judicial actions taken against journalists during 2012, seeking a total of 19.5 million balboas ($19.5 million). At the end of 2012 six cases were pending a decision from the tribunals, and one case was in the investigative stage. In February 2012 indigenous mining protests blocked the Pan American Highway near Vigui in the province of Veraguas and in San F√©lix District in the province of Chiriqu√≠. The Panamanian National Police (PNP), as well as demonstrators, threatened local and international journalists covering this major demonstration. The government cut off cell phone and Internet services in Veraguas and Chiriqui Provinces from 3‚Äì7 February during protests by the Ng√∂be‚ÄìBugl√© indigenous group that were repressed by the PNP and the Panamanian National Border Service (SENAFRONT) patrol units. According to the Public Utilities Authority, it received orders from the National Security Council of the Ministry of the Presidency to restrict communications. Users filed multiple lawsuits charging that the action threatened freedom of communication and information. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions. Nevertheless, there have been complaints that in some cases law-enforcement authorities failed to follow legal requirements and conducted unauthorized searches. The Public Ministry maintains representatives in each PNP division to approve searches, and numerous searches were approved during 2012. The law also sets forth requirements for conducting wiretap surveillance. It denies prosecutors authority to order wiretaps on their own and requires judicial oversight. During the year several citizens claimed to have been wiretapping targets after making statements critical of the government.

Its peak population in the early 20th century was about 1,000 people but today it is a ghost town. Immediately to the southsoutheast is the mouth of the Hayes River and the settlement of York Factory. Note that some books use 'Port Nelson' to mean the region around the mouths of the two rivers. History =Early history= Port Nelson was named by Thomas Button who wintered there in 1612. \\"August 15, 1612 Captain Thomas Button seeking for a harbour on the west coast of Hudson's Bay in which he might repair damages incurred during a severe storm, discovered the mouth of a large river which he designated Port Nelson, from the name of the master of his ship whom he buried there.\\" It was during the period from 1660-1870 - when many Assiniboine and Swampy Cree trappers and hunters became middlemen in the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company fur trade economy in Western Canada - that the Cree began to be referred to as \\"three distinct groups: the Woodland Cree, the Plains Cree, and the Swampy Cree (Ray 1998).\\" The Swampy Cree and the Assiniboine used the Nelson River, along with the Hayes River, as the main inland routes to the great inland lake, Lake Winnipeg. Although the Nelson is much larger, the Hayes was a better route into the interior. Therefore, most of the Hudson's Bay Company's trade was done from York Factory on the Hayes, which was built in 1684. In 1694-95 Father Marest recorded \\"The Assiniboine are thirty-five or forty days journey from the fort [Port Nelson].\\" \\"For more than two hundred years, from two to five sailing vessels, on an average, frequently with war ships conveying them, have sailed annually from Europe and America to Port Nelson, or other ports in Hudson's Bay and returned with cargoes the same season via the only available route, Hudson's Straits.\\" =20th century boom and decline= In the early 1900s, the Government of Canada felt that a major harbour on Hudson Bay was needed for shipping grain from central Canada. In 1912 Port Nelson was selected as the site over Churchill (at the mouth of the Churchill River) to become the terminus of the Hudson Bay Railway, the construction of which had already begun from The Pas in 1910. In the winter of 1912-13 the site was surveyed and construction of a wharf began in the spring, followed by buildings and other infrastructure built during the summer. The brand new Canadian research ship CSS Acadia was sent from Halifax to chart the harbour and approaches in the summer of 1913 and 1914. However the whole harbour project was fraught with problems from the start. Material shortages, labour disputes, storms, fires, and boating accidents led to major delays. Another setback was the necessity to completely redesign the harbour because the fast flowing Nelson River was building up silt on both sides of the wharf. Therefore, the harbour was changed to a small man-made island farther out in the river. The island was connected to the mainland with a seventeen-span truss bridge, built by Dominion Bridge Company of Montreal. A wrecked ship currently lies on the island. Port Nelson in 1915 When Canada entered the First World War, it resulted in further material and labour shortages, and more significantly, the loss of political and financial support. The project was able to continue a few more years until 1918 when all work stopped and the site was abandoned. The whole project was greatly criticized by several politicians, the media, which called it a \\"gigantic blunder\\", and even the project's chief engineer. The Hudson Bay Railway never reached Port Nelson and its tracks lay abandoned until 1927 when Churchill was chosen to become the northern shipping hub. Construction on the railway was restarted in 1927 and completed in 1929. In 1989 Parks Canada began the York Factory Oral History Project which included compiling stories by Swampy Cree Elders. Flora Beardy, a York Factory Cree woman conducted interviews with fourteen elders, some of whom lived in Port Nelson. References External links  Port Nelson, Northern Metropolis!

The SIT chip combines a square-law input character with a low impedance output to form the only solid-state gain device, which Pass claims, \\"behaves like a triode tube.\\" There is no output transformer on the SIT amps. The point of the SIT is that it behaves like a triode but at lower voltages and higher currents, so it doesn't need a matching transformer to deliver power to 8 Ohms. Like tubes, SITs have soft overload clipping. When brief bursts of musical energy occur, SITs react with rounded waveform tops instead of sharp and hard clipping of solid-state. SITs have a curve which looks a lot like a triode vacuum tube; low at first and climbs steadily. The distortion curve is similar, a steady rise instead of a valley with high distortion at both ends. DIY Pass has been supportive of the DIY audio community by way of published articles (notably in The Audio Amateur) as well as providing schematics for out-of-production models on the Pass Labs site, and more recently for the First Watt site.

Design characteristics Typically using MOSFETs as the gain devices, (often as current sources rather than voltage sources), most of his designs operate in Class A, with all the low distortion of small signal benefits generally associated with that. He is also known for his advocacy of \\"minimalist\\" designs, which reduce the circuit complexity and number of components through which the audio signal must travel, resulting in any residual distortion having a very simple distortion spectrum. His more powerful designs that go beyond what can practically be realized in Class A (such as the Threshold and Pass Labs products) operate in Class AB1 but retain a heavy bias so that they operate in Class A during quieter passages, and great emphasis has been given to avoiding or minimizing switching effects.

The Battle of Cabrita Point, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Marbella, was a naval battle that took place while a combined Spanish-French force besieged Gibraltar on 10 March 1705 (21 March 1705 in the New Calendar) during the War of Spanish Succession. The battle was an allied victory (English, Portuguese and Dutch) which effectively ended the Franco- Spanish siege of Gibraltar.  Prelude  The allies had conquered Gibraltar on behalf of the Archduke Charles of Habsburg on 1 August 1704. The Spanish besieged the city by land, and in that year, the French had made a first failed attempt to attack from the sea in the Battle of V√©lez-M√°laga. In January 1705 Philip V of Spain was determined to reconquer the city and had Villadarias replaced by Marshal de Tess√©. Tess√© realized that Gibraltar would never be retaken as long as the allies could access it from the sea. He therefore ordered Admiral Pointis to block up the place by sea with his squadron of 18 ships of the line. Some of these ships were Spanish under Jos√© Fern√°ndez de Santill√°n. Gibraltar was not a permanent harbour yet for the English fleet, which was anchored in Lisbon at the time. The commander of Gibraltar, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, despatched an express to Lisbon, desiring Sir John Leake to sail to his assistance. This admiral set sail immediately with five sail of the line and a body of troops. By the morning of 10 March, he had a squadron of 23 English, eight Portuguese ships of various sizes, and four Dutch.  The battle  Cabrita Point in 1843 Leake's fleet reached the Strait late on the 9th, and laid to during the night. The next morning at about 5.30 a.m., they were within two miles of Cabrita Point, when they saw five sail coming out of the Bay. These proved to be the French ships Magnanime (74), Lys (86), Ardent (66), Arrogant (60), and Marquis (66). They made at first towards the Barbary Coast, but, finding that they were being gained upon, stood for the Spanish coast. At 9 a.m. Sir Thomas Dilkes in , with the , and a Dutch man-of-war, got within gunshot of Arrogant, which, after a slight resistance, struck. Before 1 p.m. two Dutch ships took Ardent and Marquis; Magnanime and Lys were driven ashore to the westward of Marbella. Magnanime, in which De Pointis had his flag, ran ashore with so much force that all her masts went by the board. The French subsequently burned Magnanime and Lys. The rest of the French squadron had been blown from their anchorage by a gale and had taken shelter in the bay of M√°laga. They now slipped their cables and made their way to Toulon.  Aftermath  The Marshal de Tess√©, in consequence of this disaster, turned the siege of Gibraltar into a blockade, and withdrew the greater part of his forces on 31 March. Pointis retired from active service after this battle. Leake had not only scored a remarkable victory, but had saved Gibraltar from attack and had enhanced his already high reputation.

She was one of the biggest stars of the German silent cinema. Biography Lya Mara was born Aleksandra Gudowicz in a Polish family in Riga, Governorate of Livonia. As a young girl she wanted to become a chemist, as then famous Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie. Just before World War I, in 1913 Lya Mara moved with her family to Warsaw, as Poland and Latvia were part of the Russian Empire. There, she began her career as a dancer. In Warsaw, Lya Mara played her first small part in a short fiction silent film under a characteristically simplified title We want husband (1916, as Mia Mara) and soon after in another film Bestia (The Beast, premiere on 5 January 1917) directed by a Polish director of older generation Alexander Hertz. Another Polish actress, Pola Negri, who later made an extraordinary career in Germany and in America, was the star of this film. Soon after that film, Negri left for Berlin and Lya Mara followed her steps. This occurred during World War I and after Poland was occupied in 1915 by the Germans, it became a part of the German Empire. Lya Mara's first film in Germany was Halkas Gel√∂bnis (1918) directed by an Austrian director Alfred Halm, who also scripted her another film Jadwiga. Both films were produced by young and energetic director- producer Frederic Zelnik. Lya Mara married him in 1918. Zelnik promoted Mara to a major star in Germany as she played mainly in films he directed and produced. In 1920, Zelnik's film production company was named Zelnik-Mara-Film GmbH. Mara played important parts such as Charlotte Corday, Anna Karenina (1919) and Manon, attracting audiences with her charm and youthful appeal. Mara and Zelnik became real celebrities, receiving at their home many known artists. Her popularity was further cemented by hundreds of her photographs issued as postcards, chocolate and cigarettes trade cards. A serious car accident at the end of the 1920s interrupted her career. Mara could not adapt her acting to the new artistic conditions after the introduction of sound in cinema in 1929, while Zelnik became the first director in Germany who postsynchronized foreign films. Lya Mara's only film from the sound era is Everyone Asks for Erika (1931) directed by her husband. When Hitler took power in Germany (1933), Lya Mara left with Zelnik for London. Frederic Zelnik died in London on 29 November 1950. Mara spent the last years of her life in Switzerland and died there on 1 March 1960.

Chilseok is a period where the heat starts to dwindle and the Wet season begins, and the rain that falls during this period is called Chilseok water. As pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons start to flourish during this period, people traditionally offered fried pumpkins to the Big dipper.  The story of Chilseok According to a notable Korean folktale, a heavenly king had a daughter called Jiknyeo (Hangul: ÏßÅÎÖÄ, Hanja: ÁπîÂ•≥), who was a talented weaver. One day, when she looked out of the window while weaving, she saw a young man, a herder called Gyeonwu (Hangul: Í≤¨Ïö∞, Hanja: ÁâΩÁâõ), just across the Milky Way, and fell in love with him; the father allowed the two to marry. Afterwards, Jiknyeo refused to weave clothes, and Gyeonwu did not take good care of the cows and sheep. The king grew furious, and ordered the couple to live separately, allowing them to meet only once a year. On the seventh day of the seventh month of each year, they were excited to meet each other, but could not cross the Milky Way. However, crows and magpies worked together to form a bridge across the Milky Way for the couple. After a while, their sadness returned, for they were forced to wait another year before meeting again. It is believed crows and magpies have no feathers on their heads because of the couple stepping on their heads. If it rains on that night, it is believed to be the couple's tears. The story has similarities with the Mesopotamian Dumuzi and Inanna.  Chilseok customs  On Chilseok, Koreans traditionally take baths for good health. In addition, it is traditional to eat wheat flour noodles and grilled wheat cakes. Chilseok is known as the last chance to enjoy wheat-based foods, since the cold winds after Chilseok ruin the scent of wheat. People also used to eat wheat pancakes called miljeonbyeong (Î∞ÄÏ†ÑÎ≥ë), and sirutteok, a steamed rice cake covered with azuki beans.

Early life Wootton was born in Milford on Sea, Hampshire in 1911. His mother died while Frank was still of school-age, and he was raised by his father, a seaman in the Merchant Navy. He attended art school in 1928 at the age of seventeen, winning a travel scholarship and a gold medal from the Eastbourne School of Art and a prize of ¬£25, which he used to fund a three-month trip to Germany, painting murals. Early career and World War II In the 1930s, Wootton was commissioned by Edward Saunders to do art and book illustrations. In this time he wrote several books on art instruction, one of which, How to Draw Aircraft, went on to be a best-seller, In 1939, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force but instead was invited by the commander- in-chief of the Allied Air Forces to accept a special duty commission as official war artist to the R.A.F. and Royal Canadian Air Force. He painted RAF subjects from England to France and Belgium before travelling to Southeast Asia at the end of World War II. It is for this work advancing the field of aviation art, that Wootton is recognised as \\"probably the finest aviation artist of all time\\".

It is a unit of the Madras Seva Sadan, established in 1987. The school follows the Montessori philosophy. It is one of the top schools in Chennai preferred by the city's most famous personalities from the political, entertainment and sports world making it one of the best schools in the city. It boasts a multicultural mix of students and follows the motto, \\"Service with a Smile\\". Founders and history Sir. M. Venkatasubba Rao and Lady Andal Andalamma, was born in the year 1894. Since she came from a well-to-do family, she had the benefit of good education (something that many girls didn't have, in those days). She went to St. Thomas Convent, Mylapore and the Presidency High School, Egmore and learnt all the crafts and skills of a young lady of her time. Lady Andal At a very young age, Andalamma became a widow and thought she must now accept a life of seclusion- for widows in those in those days could not remarry or mingle in society. It was then that she met the person who would change her life the Hon'ble Justice M. Venkatasubba Rao, a brilliant and much respected judge who was determined to make Andalamma his wife ‚Äì abrave gesture in those times. Justice Venkatasubba Rao was a very special man - learned, courageous and upright in his beliefs. He deeply wished to transform the ills of society and in his young wife he found the ideal partner. Together, they set out to brighten the lives of hundreds of under-privileged people. thumb Both of them believed in living by example-never to preach, but to practice their ideals, to show others by lighting the way. In 1928, with their own money (a grand sum of Rs.10,000 which at that time was a generous figure indeed) they founded the Madras Seva Sadan - an institute to protect, teach and help children and people who been abandoned and mistreated by society. Here on the sprawling grounds of this noble institution, all the ideals and love in the mind and heart of Lady Andal began to take shape. At the Madras Seva Sadan, women who thought they had nothing to live for found new purpose and meaning in life. They were fed and clothed, given work, taught skills and learnt to become happy, independent members of society. The numbers grew from 8 to 3,000 in just 30 years. So, the Madras Seva Sadan and all the many other institutions under it, grew from strength to strength under Lady Andal's firm and careful guidance. She didn't just lead her people, she took a personal interest in each one. Her stately presence was beloved by all. Dressed in beautiful silk sarees she would weave flowers into the hair of little girls, feed them personally with rice balls, take them for evening drives to the beach. (She was one of the first ladies to drive her own car in those old-fashioned times). When the holidays came and some children had no home to go to, she took them to her own beautiful house where they spent memorable times together. In fact, she was truly a mother to many, taking care of them until they were old enough to marry, finding good husbands for the girls, and organizing the weddings, for which she herself would buy the sarees and jewellery. Lady Andal worked tirelessly to organize the many activities and functions of the Madras Seva Sadan. Breaking all barriers of caste, creed, religion and social stigma, the Madras Seva Sadan took in people from any and every background. In fact, once a Harijan girl joined the school, but the upper caste children did not want to eat with her. Lady Andal did not scold or lecture, but taught the children a lesson they would never forget. She invited all the children to eat with her. At the Meal, she seated the Harijan child on her right, with the other children all around them and then she began to eat. Once the others saw this, they realized how small and limited their thinking was. The problem never came up again. To commemorate the name of the Founder, Lady Andal school was established in 1987. Today the school is situated inside the campus of the Madras Seva Sadan and is established as the unit of the same. The school is run as a self-financed private institution managed by the Trust Committee of the Madras Seva Sadan. Administration The school was run by the late Mrs. C. Prema Kumar, who was its correspondent principal. The principal is Mrs. Tamara Coelho, who took the place of the principal from Mrs. Shalini Pillay by the end of the academic year 2012‚Äì2013. Campus A concert hall, the Sir Mutha Venkata Subba Rao Hall, was built by 2006. The students are unofficially referred to as Andalites. Many important events like The Hindu International Music Festival, Show Stoppers Inc., U.S. Consulate General - Chicago Children's Choir, Littleshows award, The Wonder Years -An Arabian Nights.

She is best known for her duet recordings in the 1960s with country music star George Jones and later Charlie Louvin. Her brother is the famous country music songwriter, Earl \\"Peanutt\\" Montgomery. In the 1970s, Montgomery was a successful solo artist in her own right. Her best-known solo hit is the number-one hit, \\"No Charge\\". Childhood Montgomery was born into a musical family in Iron City, Tennessee, and raised in Florence, Alabama. She gained her first exposure to music through her father, a fiddler and guitarist who taught vocal lessons at the town's Methodist church. She started playing guitar at the age of 10. Music became a very important part of Montgomery's life and she soon had serious dreams about achieving success in the country music industry. =Rise to fame= At age 20, Montgomery and her brother won an amateur talent contest held at Nashville radio station WSM's Studio C, which at that time housed the Grand Ole Opry. Montgomery gained a recording contract with United Artists Records in 1962 with the help of singer/promoter Roy Acuff. Country music career =1963 - 1972: Duet artist career= Montgomery went solo in 1962. She wrote \\"We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds\\", which she sang with George Jones.

The single's success brought a successful duet album with Jones (What's in Our Hearts), which released two other Top 20 hit singles, \\"Let's Invite Them Over\\" and \\"What's in Our Hearts\\". After finding success as a duet artist, Montgomery found the time to release a solo album. In 1964, Montgomery's first solo debut, America's No. 1 Country and Western Girl Singer.

Subsequent singles also released from the album, \\"Searchin' (For Someone Like You)\\" and \\"Your Pretty Roses Come too Late\\" did not bring much success.

He and Joe Arnold were partners in a local haberdashery during the 1960s.Hood's Who - TIME As an associate of North Side caporegime Vincent Solano, DiVarco later oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Rush Street crew. During the 1970s and 1980s, these activities included illegal gambling, loan sharking, extortion, protection, \\"street tax\\" collections, and the operation of several adult bookstore operations. DiVarco, along with James Alegretti watched over all the Outfit-owned night clubs, gambling halls, and brothels in the area. He was basically under the rule of Ross Prio.According to Ross Prio's Wikipedia page, he died in 1972. DiVarco was said to have performed many hits for Outfit boss Sam Giancana. After Giancana was murdered, DiVarco's power waned. In 1983, Solano ordered DiVarco to murder mobster Ken Eto. Eto had recently been convicted on gambling charges and Solano was worried about him testifying for the authorities. Two hitmen, Jasper Campise and John Gattuso, a Cook County, Illinois sheriff's deputy, ambushed Eto in his car and shot him three times in the head. However, the two men had improperly packed their own ammunition and the shots did not penetrate Eto's skull. Eto survived and became a government witness. In retribution for the botched hit, DiVarco was stripped of his power and the two hitmen were murdered. Federal authorities learned of DiVarco's role in the Chicago Outfit through undercover surveillance, government informants, and cooperation with other state and federal agencies. In 1985, DiVarco was convicted of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations and running a sports betting operation. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. On January 5, 1986, DiVarco died in Washington, D.C. while in federal custody.

Earlier life Gordon was the son of John Gordon, an Aberdeen merchant, and his wife Christian Henderson. During the 1680s, he was a factor at Campvere, the staple port for Scotland in Friesland. In 1682, he was made a burgess of Elgin. He continued to do business in Rotterdam until at least 1702. He married his first cousin Janet Gordon, whose father Alexander Gordon represented Aberdeen in the Parliament of Scotland. Political career At the outbreak of the Glorious Revolution at the end of 1688, Gordon's uncle Alexander was elected Lord Provost of Aberdeen and was a staunch supporter of the new king, serving as provost until 1690. Gordon was likewise a devout Presbyterian, and had his share in the political life of Aberdeen: he was a councillor of the burgh from 1705 to 1709, and served himself as provost from 1706 to 1708. He was the first to sign a loyal address from the council to Queen Anne upon the repulse of the Jacobite attempt at landing in the Firth of Forth. At the 1708 British general election Gordon was returned in a contest as Member of Parliament for the new constituency of Aberdeen Burghs and received instruction from his council on matters of local interest, and was urged to protect the interests of the Kirk and to support any act for imposing a subsidy to defray the cost of conducting the war against the French. He took little part in affairs of state, and served on a few Parliamentary committees of local importance. It is not clear if he aligned with any party, but as a Scottish Presbyterian, he supported the Whig administration in voting for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. Gordon was dropped from Aberdeen Council in 1710 and, in view of his disappointing performance in Parliament, was discouraged from standing for re-election to Parliament. He stood down at the 1710 general election. Another humiliation occurred in the following year, when the Presbytery of Aberdeen called his son, Rev. John, to the living of Old Deer. The former minister, an Episcopalian, refused to quit the church and was supported by his parishioners; the Gordons and the supporters of the Presbytery were driven off by a mob, an incident known as the \\"rabbling of Deer\\". The younger Gordon was ultimately confirmed in the ministry, which he occupied until his death in 1718, but the riot stimulated the passage of the Scottish Episcopalians Act 1711 and the Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711, which strengthened the position of the Episcopalians. Later life and legacy Gordon was readmitted to the council from 1714 to 1715, when the Jacobites took over the council during the rising of 1715, and served again from April 1716 to 1719. From 1717 to 1718, he was once more Lord Provost, and took part in efforts to purge episcopalian and Jacobite elements from the University of Aberdeen. He was made an honorary burgess of Old Aberdeen upon his retirement from the council. Gordon died on 24 August 1730, aged 75, and was buried in St. Nicholas‚Äô church, Aberdeen. He left a daughter and one son, three other sons having predeceased him.

At this time the castle was owned by Gerald Widdrington and, although the Widdringtons still owned it in the early 14th century, the Swinburns were living there. By the 16th century, the castle fell into ruin and disrepair, and it was attacked by Border reivers. A survey of 1541 reported the roof and floors to be \\"decayed and gone\\".Haughton Castle, Humshaugh The property was acquired by the Smith family in about 1640, but in 1715 a further survey stated the building to be ruinous. Significant alterations were carried out for the Smiths between 1816 and 1845, latterly by architect John Dobson to convert the ruin into a substantial mansion. The Crawshaw family came into possession in 1862, and a west wing was added for them by Anthony Salvin in 1876. Part of the castle served as a hospital during the Second World War. It is now an oblong tower house and one of the best-preserved hall houses in the north of England. In 1888 it was acquired by the Cruddas family, and it is currently owned by the Braithwaite family.

Currently, 31 four-year colleges and universities are located in New Jersey. In addition, there are nineteen county colleges offering two-year programs, serving the 21 counties in the state. History =Colonial colleges= Among the original thirteen American colonies, New Jersey is unique in that it was the only colony in which two colleges were established before the Declaration of Independence was promulgated in 1776. Of the nine colonial colleges, New Jersey possessed College of New Jersey, now called Princeton University, founded in 1746 and Queen's College, now known as Rutgers University (or officially as Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey), founded in 1766. Princeton was established by the New Light Presbyterians. Rutgers was established by clergy affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. State scholarship programs To provide post-secondary education to a greater number of New Jersey students and keep high achieving high school students in the Garden State for college, New Jersey established several scholarships. The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (NJHESAA) manages these programs. They include memorial scholarships, such as the Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Scholarship (for children of New Jersey law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty), and World Trade Center Scholarship Fund (for children of September 11th attack victims). The NJHESAA also coordinates the Edward J. Bloustein Distinguished Scholar program, the NJ STARS award program, and the NJCLASS student loan program. =Edward J. Bloustein Distinguished Scholar= Every year NJHESAA coordinates the Edward J. Bloustein Distinguished Scholar program. This award is granted to any New Jersey high school student who ranks in the top 10% of their graduating class at the end of their junior year. This top 10% must also graduate as the first, second, or third ranking student in the class or achieve at least a 1260 combined critical reading and math score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Each student receives $1,000 a year for the duration of their college career so long as they attend a college in New Jersey. Students can receive the scholarship for no more than five semesters at a two- year institution and no more than eight semesters at a four-year institution. The award is paid by NJHESAA directly to the institution in which the student is enrolled. The award was established in the 1989‚Äì1990 academic year and posthumously honors Edward J. Bloustein, the seventeenth President of Rutgers University. The award was granted to more than 5,000 students in the 2006-2007 collegiate academic year. =NJ STARS= In 2004, then Governor Jim McGreevey created the New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward Scholarship program (NJ STARS) to assist New Jersey high school students who go on to one of New Jersey's county colleges after graduation. Under this program, students who graduated in the top twenty percent of their high school class are provided with free tuition and fees at any New Jersey community college. The program covers up to five semesters of tuition as long as the student takes at least 12 credits each semester. Recipients must maintain a 3.0 grade point average through the first year to get the scholarship renewed for the second year. The program was later expanded to include the NJ STARS II program. Any student who receives scholarship aid in the NJ STARS program at a county college can receive aid at a New Jersey 4-year college after graduation from the county college. The NJ STARS II program provides full tuition for the student at participating New Jersey colleges. The state provides $4,000 for tuition for the student and the college covers the rest of the balance. A student must also apply for federal aid to reduce what the colleges must provide.

It is noted for being one of two known species of sea snakes that are known to be found almost-exclusively in freshwater. The other freshwater sea snake species is Laticauda crockeri. Etymology The specific name, semperi, is in honor of German zoologist Carl Gottfried Semper.Beolens, Bo; Michael Watkins; Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Hydrophis semperi, p. 240). Taxonomy H. semperi is classified with the rest of the \\"true\\" sea snakes in the subfamily Hydrophiinae of the family Elapidae. Description Like all \\"true\\" sea snakes, H. semperi is a rather heavyset snake, elongated with a small head. It possesses the characteristic flattened, paddle-like tail found in the members of its subfamily. This particular species is considered short in comparison to the rest of the family; adult specimens of H. semperi that have been caught have a total length (including tail) of . The snake is colored much like a typical sea snake, having a dark blue or black body with narrow yellow (sometimes white) crossbands. Like its close relatives, its nostrils are located almost dorsally, with valves that prevent water from entering its nasal (and oral) cavities when the snake is submerged.Uetz,Peter. EMBL Reptile Database: Subfamily Hydrophiinae (Sea Snakes). Family Elapidae (cobras, coral snakes, and seasnakes etc.). European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Heidelberg 2006-04-04 Habitat and evolution H. semperi is known to be found only in the waters of Lake Taal (formerly known as Lake Bombon) in the province of Batangas in the Philippines. The only freshwater sea snake in the country, it lives the entirety of its life within the confines of the lake, feeding and breeding in its slightly acidic waters. The lake itself is a volcanic crater lake, which was formerly saltwater but gradually lost its salinity after the lake was closed off from the sea by an eruption in the 16th century. It is this unique aspect of the lake's formation and history that led to the evolution of several once-saltwater species, including H. semperi. Thus, this species is relatively young, having been accustomed to freshwater for less than a millennium. Diet As with \\"true\\" sea snakes, H. semperi is piscivorous, feeding primarily on the numerous fish species that are known to dwell in Taal Lake's murky waters. Biology Very little is known about the life history of H. semperi, including its ecology and breeding cycles. Conservation status Since so little is known about the reproductive habits of the species H. semperi, there have been virtually no estimates of the snake's population. Like many other species endemic to the lake, it is vulnerable as a species to any anthropogenic effects on the lake's ecosystem, both direct and indirect. Pollution is always a major issue when it comes to enclosed bodies of water with numerous surrounding human settlements. The numerous commercial establishments, towns and plantations dumping chemicals and sewage into the lake, combined with the dense population of fish farms in the lake's waters may yet have an adverse effect on the health of the species as a whole. In addition, while the snake itself has no commercial value and is not harvested, it suffers from the typical human stigma that is often attributed to snakes. Fishermen that frequently encounter the docile snakes have been known to kill them simply because of what they are. Etymology H. semperi was named after Carl Semper, a German ecologist who discovered the species in the mid-19th century. Locally, the snake is known as duhol matapang.

Military career Middleton obtained a commission in the Army in the reign of King William III, and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1706. He served in Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession, and also on board the fleet, where his company was employed as marines. He was many years an officer in the 25th Regiment of Foot, in which corps he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and he was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1711. He commanded the 25th Regiment in Scotland under the Duke of Argyll during the rebellion of the Earl of Mar, and in 1721 he was rewarded with the colonelcy of that corps.

The top of this path may be approached from Porthcurno (approximately 3/4 mi to the west) or Treen (approximately 5/8 mi to the north). The final stage of the descent from the coastal path requires some climbing down steep rocks at the western end of the beach. It is sometimes possible to walk from Porthcurno beach along the shore, during low water of a spring tide. In common with some of the other secluded coves on the Penwith peninsula, this beach is an unofficial naturist beach. Signs on the cliff above the beach warn that swimming off the far side of the sand bar is dangerous due to strong currents. In 1880 a wooden hut was built above the beach to house a submarine communications cable from Brest, France. It connected with a land line running via the Trereen valley, and by Burnewhall to Sheffield and on to Newlyn and Penzance.

It analyzes the relation between these projects and trends such as social exclusion, the emergence of new urban elites, and the consolidation of less democratic forms of urban governance. Summary The book offers in-depth analyses of linkages between urban restructuring and social exclusion against the backdrop of trends in urban governance across the European Union, examining neo-liberal and New Urban policies that increasingly favour private investment and deregulation of labour markets. The aim is to clarify the relationship between new urban spaces and the emergence of new forms of polity, economy, and urban life which may not necessarily promote social harmony within the metropolitan areas. Case studies The nine case studies in the book identify a number of large- scale urban development projects and look into the respective variation of governance systems at different scales. They also indicate how these local projects reflect global trends, institutional forms and strategic practices. The nine megaprojects include: * The Europeanization of Brussels * The Guggenheim museum in Bilbao * The financial district in Dublin * The science- university-technology complex 'Adlershof' in Berlin * The 1998 World Expo in Lisbon * The Olympic Games bid by Athens * The Donau City in Vienna * The Oresund project in Copenhagen * The new business district in Naples These case studies are thoughtful examinations of the argument that mega-projects and events are vital for urban development.

On May 23, 1963, Wapiti Ranger Station was designated as a National Historic Landmark, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Description and history The Wapiti Ranger Station is west of Cody, Wyoming on the north side of U.S. Route 14/16/20, between Cody and the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park. The original 1903 building now stands amid a cluster of more modern Forest Service buildings, from which it is set off by a rail fence. It is a single-story log structure, with a low-pitch gabled roof. Modern extensions to the rear give the building a U shape, and its interior has been modernized, as it continues to serve an active role in forest management. Shoshone National Forest was the first national forest to be created in the United States, in 1891. The forest was enlarged over the following decade, to the point where it administratively required division. The Wapiti Ranger Stateion was built in 1903 by W. H. Pierce, the first administrator of the forest's Shoshone division. The station was the first forest service ranger station built with federal funding. Constructed with native forest timber, the structure is maintained regularly, with some recent improvements ‚Äì such as replacing some rotting timber ‚Äì implemented in 2005. A location called Wapiti Station is featured in the 2016 game Firewatch, which is set in the Shoshone National Forest.

Its territory close to the villages Kosti and Balgari. Silkosia is the oldest reserve in the country, declared on 23 July 1931 in order to protect the evergreen bushes unique for Europe. It encompasses part of the Veleka river catchment area with a territory of 389.6 ha or 3.896 km2. The terrain is various, in the lower parts there are predominantly swamp areas with typical Central European flora. The reserve encompasses territory between 100 and 250 m altitude and is thus among the lowest-lying nature reserves in the country.  Flora  The variety of plant species is high and includes 260 vascular plant species on a territory of less than 4 km2. Of them, 3 are endemic and 16 are relict species. There are specimen from different geographical latitudes which makes it interesting for the scientists. Plant inversion can be observed in the reserve. Usually, the beech trees are located in the higher and cooler areas, while the oak trees occupy the lower parts. In Silkosia it is the other way round: the oak forests are located higher in the mountain. Forests cover 97.9% of the total area of the reserve. The average age of the trees is 120‚Äì130 years, at places ‚Äì over 200 years. In the wet valley rare species such as the strandzhan periwinkle, laurel, caucausian blueberry, common yew can be observed. It is also the only place in Europe, where the wild medlar tree can be found. The most common flowers are the caucausian cowslip and the spring cyclamen which blossom in February and March.  Fauna  Strandzhan periwinkle in Silkosia. The Silkosia reserve has rich wildlife. The most common amphibian species include the European green toad, European tree frog and the agile frog. Typical reptilians in the reserve are the spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, slowworm and scheltopusik. There are also many species of snakes - Caspian whipsnake, Aesculapian snake, Blotched snake, and Montpellier snake among the others. There are various bird species. The golden oriole, nightingale, Sardinian warbler, whitethroat, common blackbird, Eurasian jay, common chaffinch nest in the reserve, as well as different species of falcons, woodpeckers and many others. Mammals include the wild cat, beech marten, European pine marten, gray wolf, wild boar and others.

He served as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1962 until 1969. In 1971-22, he chaired the Pearce Commission, which was charged with testing the acceptability of a proposed constitutional settlement in Rhodesia.  Early life and career  Pearce was born in Sidcup in Kent, the elder son of John William Ernest Pearce, a headmaster, and Irene Pearce, n√©e Chaplin. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, taking a First in classical honour moderations and a Third in literae humaniores. He was elected an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi in 1950. Called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn and the Middle Temple in 1925, he practiced in the King's Bench and Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Divisions of the High Court, and was appointed King's Counsel in 1945. He became deputy chairman of the East Sussex Quarter Sessions in 1947, was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1948 and served as its Treasurer in 1966. Early in his career, Pearce was forced to leave legal practice because of tuberculosis. He spent some time in Switzerland, where he acquired an interest in oil painting, before returning to the Bar. He later exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, sometimes exhibiting together with his wife, a watercolourist. He became a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1940.  Judicial career  In 1948, Pearce was appointed a High Court judge, receiving the customary knighthood. He was initially assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, before being transferred to the Queen's Bench Division in 1954. He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1957, and sworn of the Privy Council. On 19 April 1962, Pearce was made Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer with the title Baron Pearce, of Sweethaws in the County of Sussex. He retired as Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1969, and became chairman of the Press Council until 1974. From 1969 until 1976, he was chairman of the Appeals Committee of the Takeover Panel. In 1971-22, he chaired a commission (known as the Pearce Commission) tasked with testing the acceptability of a proposed constitutional settlement in Rhodesia negotiated between Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Ian Smith. (In 1968, Pearce had been the lone dissenter in the Privy Council in the case of Madzimbamuto v Lardner-Burke). The four-person commission reported in May 1972: it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. As a result the proposals were shelved, though not immediately abandoned. In his later years Lord Pearce suffered from hip problems. Shortly before his death, he auctioned a sculpture, which he had acquired for ¬£7 in 1951, at Sotheby's. The work, identified as a sculpture by Adriaen de Vries, was sold for ¬£6.82 million.  Family  In 1927, he married Erica Priestman (d. 1985), daughter of Bertram Priestman. They had two sons, James and Bruce, both of whom became QCs.

It is related to the concept of an animal's territory which is the area that is actively defended. The concept of a home range was introduced by W. H. Burt in 1943. He drew maps showing where the animal had been observed at different times. An associated concept is the utilization distribution which examines where the animal is likely to be at any given time. Data for mapping a home range used to be gathered by careful observation, but nowadays, the animal is fitted with a transmission collar or similar GPS device. The simplest way of measuring the home range is to construct the smallest possible convex polygon around the data but this tends to overestimate the range. The best known methods for constructing utilization distributions are the so- called bivariate Gaussian or normal distribution kernel density methods. More recently, nonparametric methods such as the Burgman and Fox's alpha-hull and Getz and Wilmers local convex hull have been used. Software is available for using both parametric and nonparametric kernel methods. History The concept of the home range can be traced back to a publication in 1943 by W. H. Burt, who constructed maps delineating the spatial extent or outside boundary of an animal's movement during the course of its everyday activities. Associated with the concept of a home range is the concept of a utilization distribution, which takes the form of a two dimensional probability density function that represents the probability of finding an animal in a defined area within its home range. The home range of an individual animal is typically constructed from a set of location points that have been collected over a period of time identifying the position in space of an individual at many points in time. Such data are now collected automatically using collars placed on individuals that transmit through satellites or using mobile cellphone technology and global positioning systems (GPS) technology, at regular intervals. Methods of calculation The simplest way to draw the boundaries of a home range from a set of location data is to construct the smallest possible convex polygon around the data. This approach is referred to as the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method which is still widely employed, but has many drawbacks including often overestimating the size of home ranges. The best known methods for constructing utilization distributions are the so- called bivariate Gaussian or normal distribution kernel density methods. This group of methods is part of a more general group of parametric kernel methods that employ distributions other than the normal distribution as the kernel elements associated with each point in the set of location data. Recently, the kernel approach to constructing utilization distributions was extended to include a number of nonparametric methods such as the Burgman and Fox's alpha- hull method and Getz and Wilmers local convex hull (LoCoH) method. This latter method has now been extended from a purely fixed-point LoCoH method to fixed radius and adaptive point/radius LoCoH methods. Although, currently, more software is available to implement parametric than nonparametric methods (because the latter approach is newer), the cited papers by Getz et al. demonstrate that LoCoH methods generally provide more accurate estimates of home range sizes and have better convergence properties as sample size increases than parametric kernel methods. Home range estimation methods that have been developed since 2005 include: * LoCoH * Brownian Bridge * Line-based Kernel * GeoEllipse * Line-Buffer (See also: OpenJUMP HoRAE - Home Range Analysis and Estimation Toolbox) Computer packages for using parametric and nonparametric kernel methods are available online.LoCoH: Powerful algorithms for finding home ranges AniMove - Animal movement methodsOpenJUMP HoRAE - Home Range Analysis and Estimation Toolbox (open source; methods: Point-Kernel, Line-Kernel, Brownian-Bridge, LoCoH, MCP, Line-Buffer)adehabitat for R (open source; methods: Point-Kernel, Line-Kernel, Brownian-Bridge, LoCoH, MCP, GeoEllipse) In the appendix of a 2017 JMIR article, the home ranges for over 150 different bird species in Manitoba are reported.

The painting represents a tale from Greco-Roman mythology. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, watches the club-footed blacksmith god, Vulcan, punish the bold and cunning Titan Prometheus for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals. Prometheus's punishment is to be bound to a rock and to have his liver consumed daily by an eagle. The painting mysteriously has two signatures: the first is a clear signature below the right-hand shoulder of Prometheus. During a restoration of the painting, a second signature was discovered at the lower left by his hand. Prometheus is associated with the Greek creation myth in that, in some versions, he creates humans from clay and the stolen fire is to bring them to life. A painting, Adam and Eve, also by Baburen, was sold at auction in 1707 together with the Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan, and one might conjecture that the two works formed a pair, both being illustrations of creation.

In the 12th to 15th centuries the counts of Vianden were the mightiest lords of the area between the rivers Rhine, Mosel and Maas. Their territory was in modern Vianden canton, Luxemburg and Bitburg-Pr√ºm, Germany. One recognition of their importance was that Henry I of Vianden (c. 1200-1252) in 1216 married Margaret, Marchioness of Namur (c. 1194 - 1270) of the Capetian House of Courtenay, and daughter of Peter II of Courtenay (1167-1217), emperor of Constantinople. It was the peak of its power, but in 1264 Vianden became a vassal to the counts of Luxembourg. Godefroid I participated in the Battle of Worringen in 1288 as a vassal to the Duchy of Brabant.

He was a pioneer in the development of independent record companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Birmingham, England, Joseph is best known as the founder of Transatlantic Records, an independent British record company that flourished between 1961 and 1977. Joseph started his label by importing American folk and blues recordings that were hard to obtain in the UK in the early 1960s. These were licensed for the UK from American record companies such as Folkways Records. He also released a few offbeat spoken word recordings (including a series of audio sex instruction manuals). By 1963 Joseph had started to sign and record British artists - primarily in the folk and blues spheres. The label was initially modelled on the Folkways label - and then broadened out in musical scope. Artists signed by Joseph to Transatlantic included Billy Connolly (who after beginning his career as folk singer with the Humblebums released his first comedy recordings for Transatlantic in the early 1970s), Ralph McTell, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Sheila Hancock and The Dubliners. He also released the first recordings by the Portsmouth Sinfonia the avant garde orchestra that included Brian Eno and Michael Nyman in its membership. In the late 1970s, Joseph sold Transatlantic Records to the Granada Group and left the music business. He started a second career as a theatrical producer and talent agent, forming the production company, Freeshooter. Productions by Freeshooter included Sir Peter Hall's production of The Petition starring Sir John Mills, The March of the Falsettos and a revival of Godspell. As part of his work in the theatre world, he became chair of the Theatre Design Trust in Britain, which worked on theatre restoration projects.

On April 28, 2016 Sally Shapiro announced the end of its 10-year career alongside the release of the final single \\"If You Ever Wanna Change Your Mind\\". They returned in January 2018 from retirement for a one-off collaboration with Italo Disco legend Ryan Paris called \\"Love On Ice\\". History Shapiro grew up listening to Swedish pop and disco and the band was influenced by Eurobeat and Italo disco. Agebj√∂rn shed some light on the choice of the fictional stage name in an October 2007 interview with Exclaim!' magazine: Sally Shapiro's debut album, 2007's Disco Romance, was produced by Agebj√∂rn. The album received strong reviews, and Shapiro was championed by many prominent music blogs including Pitchfork Media. The album was released in North America on 16 October 2007 by Canadian-based indie label Paper Bag Records; it is a ten- track album featuring artwork by Canadian designer Geoff Wilson. Shapiro is notable for shunning publicity and has never revealed her real name. However, in an interview with Swedish webzine Judy in September 2007, she talked for the first time about considering performing live: In spring 2008, Sally Shapiro went on a short DJ tour, but on a February 2009 post on Sally Shapiro's Myspace blog, Agebj√∂rn stated that Sally would not perform again: On 15 April 2008, Sally Shapiro's remix album Remix Romance Vol. 1 was released worldwide by Paper Bag Records. Some of the names on this remix album are Junior Boys, Jon Brooks, Lindstr√∏m, Holy Fuck and Juan Maclean. Quickly following Vol. 1, Remix Romance Vol. 2 was released on 17 June 2008. It contains remixes by Dntel, The Russian Futurists, Solvent and Alexander Robotnick. This volume is only available as a download. Sally Shapiro's single \\"Miracle\\" was released on 16 June 2009. It is similar in style to previous Shapiro singles. Their second studio album, My Guilty Pleasure, was released in August 2009. Like the previous work, it was recorded alone. Later 2011 the duo revealed that they had been working on new material to be released in the near future. Later 2012 they announced officially the release of their third album in Paper Bag Records, called \\"Somewhere Else\\", which was one more time masterminded by Agebj√∂rn's production, featuring Cloetta Paris' Roger Gunnarsson and Le Prix as massive collaborators for this new project. The album #3 had as leading single \\"What Can I Do\\", being released in December 2012. \\"What Can I Do\\" showed that the duo have been experimenting new instruments such sax and flutes, with an audible influence of indie pop / folk scenario, without missing their Italo disco identity. On 26 February 2013 the album Somewhere Else was released worldwide physically and digitally.

It is often also referred to as the HDP or the HCDP. The maximum temperature at which such condensation takes place is called the cricondentherm.Hydrocarbon Dew Point The hydrocarbon dew point is a function of the gas composition as well as the pressure. The hydrocarbon dew point is universally used in the natural gas industry as an important quality parameter, stipulated in contractual specifications and enforced throughout the natural gas supply chain, from producers through processing, transmission and distribution companies to final end users. The hydrocarbon dew point of a gas is a different concept from the water dew point, the latter being the temperature (at a given pressure) at which water vapor present in a gas mixture will condense out of the gas. Relation to the term GPM In the United States, the hydrocarbon dew point of processed, pipelined natural gas is related to and characterized by the term GPM which is the gallons of liquefiable hydrocarbons contained in of natural gas at a stated temperature and pressure. When the liquefiable hydrocarbons are characterized as being hexane or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C6+).White Paper on Liquid Hydrocarbon Drop Out in Natural Gas Infrastructure (NGC+ Liquid Hydrocarbon Dropout Task Group, October 15, 2004)White Paper on Liquid Hydrocarbon Drop Out in Natural Gas Infrastructure (NGC+ Liquid Hydrocarbon Dropout Task Group, September 28, 2005) However, the quality of raw produced natural gas is also often characterized by the term GPM meaning the gallons of liquefiable hydrocarbons contained in of the raw natural gas. In such cases, when the liquefiable hydrocarbons in the raw natural gas are characterized as being ethane or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C2+). Similarly, when characterized as being propane or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C3+). (See page 110) Care must be taken not to confuse the two different definitions of the term GPM. Although GPM is an additional parameter of some value, most pipeline operators and others who process, transport, distribute or use natural gas are primarily interested in the actual HCDP, rather than GPM. Furthermore, GPM and HCDP are not interchangeable and one should be careful not to confuse what each one exactly means. Methods of HCDP determination There are primarily two categories of HCDP determination. One category involves \\"theoretical\\" methods, and the other involves \\"experimental\\" methods. =Theoretical methods= The theoretical methods use the component analysis of the gas mixture (usually via gas chromatography, GC) and then use an equation of state (EOS) to calculate what the dew point of the mixture should be at a given pressure. The Peng‚ÄìRobinson and Kwong‚ÄìRedlich‚ÄìSoave equations of state are the most commonly used for determining the HCDP in the natural gas industry. The theoretical methods using GC analysis suffer from four sources of error: * The first source of error is the sampling error. Pipelines operate at high pressure. To do an analysis using a field GC, the pressure has to be regulated down to close to atmospheric pressure. In the process of reducing pressure, some of the heavier components may drop out, particularly if the pressure reduction is done in the retrograde region. Therefore, the gas reaching the GC is fundamentally different (usually leaner in the heavy components) than the actual gas in the pipeline. Alternatively, if a sample bottle is collected for delivery to a laboratory for analysis, significant care must be taken not to introduce any contaminants to the sample, to make sure that the sample bottle represents the actual gas in the pipeline, and to extract the complete sample correctly in to the laboratory GC. * The second source is the error on the analysis of the gas mix components. A typical field GC will have at best (under ideal conditions and frequent calibration) ~2% (of range) error in the quantity of each gas analyzed. Since the range for most field-GCs for C6 components is 0-1 mol%, there will be about 0.02 mol% uncertainty in the quantity of C6+ components. While this error does not change the heating value by much, it will introduce a significant error in the HCDP determination. Furthermore, since the exact distribution of C6+ components is an unknown (the amount of C6, C7, C8, ...), this further introduces additional errors in any HCDP calculations. When using a C6+ GC these errors can be as high as 100 ¬∞F or more, depending on the gas mixture and the assumptions made regarding the composition of the C6+ fraction. For \\"pipeline quality\\" natural gas, a C9+ GC analysis may reduce the uncertainty, because it eliminates the C6-C8 distribution error. However, independent studies have shown that the cumulative error can still be very significant, in some cases in excess of 30 C. A laboratory C12+ GC analysis using an Flame Ionization Detector (FID) can reduce the error further. However, using a C12 laboratory system can introduce additional errors, namely sampling error. If the gas has to be collected in a sample bottle and shipped to a laboratory for C12 analysis, sampling errors can be significant. Obviously there is also a lag time error between the time the sample was collected and the time it was analyzed.Andrew Brown et al (May 2007). \\"Comparison of Methods for the Measurement of Hydrocarbon Dew Point of natural gas\\", UK National Physical Laboratory Report AS 3, ISSN 1754-2928. * The third source of errors is calibration errors. All GCs have to be calibrated routinely with a calibration gas representative of the gas under analysis. If the calibration gas is not representative, or calibrations are not routinely performed, there will be errors introduced. * The fourth source of error relates to the errors embedded in the equation of state model used to calculate the dew point. Different models are prone to varying amounts error at different pressure regimes and gas mixes. There is sometimes a significant divergence of calculated dew point based solely on the choice of equation of state used. The significant advantage of using the theoretical models is that the HCDP at several pressures (as well as the cricondentherm) can be determined from a single analysis. This provides for operational uses such as determining the phase of the stream flowing through the flow-meter, determining if the sample has been affected by ambient temperature in the sample system, and avoiding amine foaming from liquid hydrocarbons in the amine contactor. However, recent developments in combining experimental methods and software enhancements have eliminated this shortcoming (see combined experimental and theoretical approach below). GC vendors with a product targeting the HCDP analysis include Emerson,http://www2.emersonprocess.com/en- US/brands/Danalyzer/GC/Model-700XA/Pages/index.aspx ABB, Thermo-fisher, as well as other companies. =Experimental methods= In the \\"experimental\\" methods, one actually cools a surface on which gas condenses and then measures the temperature at which the condensation takes place. The experimental methods can be divided into manual and automated systems. Manual systems, such as the Bureau of Mines dewpoint tester, depend on an operator to manually cool the chilled mirror slowly and to visually detect the onset of condensation. The automated methods use automatic mirror chilling controls and sensors to detect the amount of light reflected by the mirror and detect when condensation occurs through changes in the reflected light. The chilled mirror technique is a first principle measurement. Depending on the specific method used to establish the dew point temperature, some correction calculations may be necessary. As condensation must necessarily have already occurred for it to be detected, the reported temperature is lower than when using theoretical methods. Similar to GC analysis, the experimental method is subject to potential sources of error. The first error is in the detection of condensation. A key component in chilled mirror dew point measurements is the subtlety with which condensate can be detected ‚Äî in other words, the thinner the film is when detected, the better. A manual chilled mirror device relies on the operator to determine when a mist has formed on the mirror, and, depending on the device, can be highly subjective. It is also not always clear what is condensing: water or hydrocarbons. Because of the low resolution that has traditionally been available, the operator has been prone to under report the dew point, in other words, to report the dew point temperature as being below what it actually is. This is due to the fact that by the time condensation had accumulated enough to be visible, the dew point had already been reached and passed. The most modern manual devices make possible greatly improved reporting accuracy. There are two manufacturers of manual devices, and each of their devices meet the requirements for dew point measurement apparatus as defined in the ASTM Manual for Hydrocarbon Analysis. However, there are significant differences between the devices ‚Äì including the optical resolution of the mirror and the method of mirror cooling ‚Äì depending on the manufacturer. Automated chilled mirror devices provide significantly more repeatable results, but these measurements can be affected by contaminants that may compromise the mirror's surface. In many instances it is important to incorporate an effective filtration system that prepares the gas for analysis. On the other hand, filtration may alter the gas composition slightly and filter elements are subject to clogging and saturation. Advances in technology have led to analyzers that are less affected by contaminants and certain devices can also measure the dew point of water that may be present in the gas. One recent innovation is the use of spectroscopy to determine the nature of the condensate at dewpoint. Another device user laser interferometry to register extremely tenuous amounts of condensation. It is asserted that these technologies are less affected by interference from contaminants. Another source of error is the speed of the cooling of the mirror and the measurement of the temperature of the mirror when the condensation is detected. This error can be minimized by controlling the cooling speed, or having a fast condensation detection system. Experimental methods only provide a HCDP at the pressure at which the measurement is taken, and cannot provide the cricondentherm or the HCDP at other pressures. As the cricondentherm of natural gas is typically around 27 bar, there are gas preparation systems currently available which adjust input pressure to this value. Although, as pipeline operators often wish to know the HCDP at their current line pressure, the input pressure of many experimental systems can be adjusted by a regulator. There are instruments that can be operated in either manual or automatic mode from the VympelVympel Instruments (Hygrovision BL Hydrocarbon Dew Point Analyzer) company. Companies who offer an automated chilled mirror system include: Vympel,Vympel Instruments (Hygrovision BL Hydrocarbon Dew Point Analyzer) Ametek, Michell Instruments, ZEGAZ Instruments ZEGAZ Instruments (HCD5000(TM) Hydrocarbon Dewpoint Analyzer) and Bartec Benke (Model: Hygrophil HCDT). =Combined experimental and theoretical approach= A recent innovation is to combine the experimental method with theoretical. If the composition of the gas is analyzed by a C6+ GC, AND a dewpoint is experimentally measured at any pressure, then the experimental dewpoint can be used in combination with the GC analysis to provide a more exact phase diagram. This approach overcome the main shortcoming of the experimental method which is not knowing the whole phase diagram. An example of this software is provided by Starling Associates.

It is also called snap- off diode or charge-storage diode or (much less frequently) memory varactor, and has a variety of uses in microwave electronics as pulse generator or parametric amplifier. When diodes switch from forward conduction to reverse cut-off, a reverse current flows briefly as stored charge is removed. It is the abruptness with which this reverse current ceases which characterises the step recovery diode.  Historical note  The first published paper on the SRD is : the authors start the brief survey stating that \\"the recovery characteristics of certain types of pn-junction diodes exhibit a discontinuity which may be used to advantage for the generation of harmonics or for the production of millimicrosecond pulses\\". They also refer that they first observed this phenomenon in February, 1959  Operating the SRD  = Physical principles = The main phenomenon used in SRDs is the storage of electric charge during forward conduction, which is present in all semiconductor junction diodes and is due to finite lifetime of minority carriers in semiconductors. Assume that the SRD is forward biased and in steady state i.e. the anode bias current does not change with time: since charge transport in a junction diode is mainly due to diffusion, i.e. to a non constant spatial charge carrier density caused by bias voltage, a charge Qs is stored in the device. This stored charge depends on #Intensity of the forward anode current IA flowing in the device during its steady state. #Minority carrier lifetime œÑ, i.e. the mean time a free charge carrier moves inside a semiconductor region before recombining. Quantitatively, if the steady state of forward conduction lasts for a time much greater than œÑ, the stored charge has the following approximate expression :Q_S\\\\cong I_A\\\\cdot\\\\tau Now suppose that the voltage bias abruptly changes, switching from its stationary positive value to a higher magnitude constant negative value: then, since a certain amount of charge has been stored during forward conduction, diode resistance is still low (i.e. the anode-to-cathode voltage VAK has nearly the same forward conduction value). Anode current does not cease but reverses its polarity (i.e. the direction of its flow) and stored charge Qs starts to flow out of the device at an almost constant rate IR. All the stored charge is thus removed in a certain amount of time: this time is the storage time tS and its approximate expression is :t_S\\\\cong\\\\frac{Q_S}{I_R} When all stored charge has been removed, diode resistance suddenly changes, rising to its cut-off value at reverse bias within a time tTr, the transition time: this behavior can be used to produce pulses with rise time equal to this time.  Operation of the Drift Step Recovery Diode (DSRD)  The Drift Step Recovery Diode (DSRD) was discovered by Russian scientists in 1981 (Grekhov et al., 1981). The principle of the DSRD operation is similar to the SRD, with one essential difference - the forward pumping current should be pulsed, not continuous, because drift diodes function with slow carriers. The principle of DSRD operation can be explained as follows: A short pulse of current is applied in the forward direction of the DSRD effectively \\"pumping\\" the P-N junction, or in other words, ‚Äúcharging‚Äù the P-N junction capacitively. When the current direction reverses, the accumulated charges are removed from the base region. As soon as the accumulated charge decreases to zero, the diode opens rapidly. A high voltage spike can appear due to the self-induction of the diode circuit. The larger the commutation current and the shorter the transition from forward to reverse conduction, the higher the pulse amplitude and efficiency of the pulse generator (Kardo-Sysoev et al., 1997).

The show began airing on February 2, 1991 on Telemundo of Puerto Rico, and lasted until 1993. It remained on the top spots during its run. Some of the characters gained so much popularity that they would reprise their roles on other shows. Show history Comedian Melwin Cede√±o started playing his character Chevy in the late 80s. The character was so popular among teens that producers Hector Marcano, Jackie Torres, Jose Vallenilla and Rafael Quijano, presented a new sitcom to Telemundo of Puerto Rico. The show was added to Telemundo's programming in February 1991. The show was quickly received and cherished by Puerto Rican audiences and occupied the top places in ratings. It remained very popular until its cancellation in 1993. Cede√±o has continued to perform as Chevy on other programs and activities, and some of the actors involved have reprised their roles in other shows (see El Gran Bejuco). Show synopsis Chevy was a Nuyorican teenager that upon returning to Puerto Rico started working at restaurants. He was hired by \\"Don Vale\\" (Pucho Fern√°ndez, son of the international star Tres Patines) at the restaurant \\"El Gandongo Express\\" as a waiter. \\"Don Vale\\" had a beautiful daughter named \\"Beba\\" (Felicidad Morales) who instantly fell in love with \\"Chevy\\" (Melwin Cede√±o). The restaurant was located in an alley corner, and Chevy would always arrive in his flamboyant Volkswagen Beetle listening to loud music. After getting down, he would perform some dance stunt, and then go to work. The restaurant and the street in front became a meeting place for Chevy and his friends. Anything could happen on that street: parties, fights, and even a pool party. The restaurant would also draw some bullies that would try to pick fights with Chevy. The leader of this gang was \\"Chol√≥n\\" (slang for a big head), performed by Wilfred Morales, and \\"Bejuco\\" (slang for skinny), performed by Miguel Morales. Most of the time, Chevy would beat them up and kick them out of the restaurant. All of these characters would also create sub-stories with their relatives, friends, or love interests. After some time, Fern√°ndez left the show and Georgina Borri replaced him as \\"Margot\\", Chevy's mother who had bought the restaurant. She was the last manager of the restaurant on the last season of the show. Since the first episode, the show had four open credits sequences, six wrestling/boxing episodes and a mini-serial named \\"Chevy, ¬øculpable o inocente?\\" that lasted 10 episodes. Aside of its obvious slapstick humor, the show sometimes tried to address common social situations present in Puerto Rico. Cast =Lead characters= * Melwin Cede√±o as Chevy, a Nuyorican that works as a waiter at \\"El Gandongo Express\\" restaurant. He drives a brightly colored Volkswagen Beetle and enjoys rap music. He is in love with a girl named Beba. He is smart but tends to have a short temper and is always getting in fights with bullies and even clients. * Pucho Fern√°ndez as Don Vale, the first manager of \\"El Gandongo Express\\", and the father of Chevy's on-and-off girlfriend \\"Beba\\". * Ra√∫l Carbonell as Israel, the owner of the newsstand next to \\"El Gandongo Express\\" and one of Chevy's friends. * Felicidad Morales as Beba, the daughter of \\"Don Vale\\" and Chevy's on-and-off girlfriend. She usually corresponds him, but their relationship is usually portrayed in a childish way. She is nice but has a tough attitude to people that doesn't treat her right. * Yamaris Latorre as Sissi, one of Beba's best friends. She enjoys rock music and usually dresses in jeans and loose, wild hair. On the first years of the show, she was portrayed as being an airhead or dimwitted, but on later years, her character took more importance. She happened to fall in love with Chevy, but was never able to tell him. * Ildia Santiago as Deborah, Beba's other best friend. She enjoys exercising and usually wears sportswear. * Wilfred Morales as Chol√≥n, the leader of the bully gang. He is a fat, bald man with a scarred face. He is very strong, but not very clever, and Chevy always takes advantage of this. * Miguel Morales as Bejuco, one of Cholon's friend. As opposed to him, he is thin and weak. He is always wearing a shirt with the Puerto Rican flag and a baseball cap put on backwards. He tends to be one of the most obnoxious members of the gang. He would go inside the restaurant and ask Chevy to tell him everything in the menu only to end up asking for a glass of water. Chevy would then beat him up, and kick him out. Bejuco went on to have his own show (see El Gran Bejuco). * Georgina Borri as Margot, Chevy's mother. She became the owner of \\"El Gandongo Express\\" during the last season. =Supporting characters= * Raquel Montero as La Tia Paca, Don Vale's sister and briefly the manager of \\"El Gandongo Express\\" (when Pucho Fernandez left the show). Then, her character stayed as the next door neighbor and romantic interest of a security guard named \\"Polo\\". * William Gracia as Polo, Beba's uncle (her mother's brother). He came to help her with the management of \\"El Gandongo Express\\" just before Paca's arrival. He was like a handyman taking care of several jobs (shoemaker, cooker) finally becoming a security guard. He was the object of Paca's affection, but his heart belonged to Margot (Chevy's mother). * V√≠ctor Santiago as Mostro, another member of Cholon's gang. He sports a flat top haircut with colored stripes and would always go on asking everybody for two dollars. His famous line was: \\"El hombre brega\\". Like Chol√≥n, he is not very clever. * Cuco Sandoval as Cuco, the last member of Cholon's gang. He was added when the production team needed a greater gang for a wrestling match episode and his character stayed. He is the dumbest of the gang, almost never talked, and is usually spaced out and sleeping. =Recurring characters= Several characters made cameo or special appearances on the show. * \\"Volcan\\" (Angel Javier) He was the son of the original Gandongo Express owner who rent it to \\"Don Vale\\". At first he was like a \\"troublemaker\\" but then the character changed to be like a Daddy's Boy (always saying: \\"Papi dice\\" {\\"Daddy says\\"}) and great friend of Chevy and the gang. * \\"Ren√©\\" (Ren√© L√≥pez) an orphan kid who play along the streets. He was very smart and always get the way to earn money the easy way. * \\"Don Goyo\\" (Joaquin Jarque) an old man with bad temper. He only appeared on several episodes. * \\"Mimi\\" (Alba Raquel Barros) a mature woman with a silly laugh. She was Don Vale's love interest. * \\"Tito\\" (Wilfred Morales) he was a kid who lived with his mom across the street. He made silly statements and always was accusing everyone with his mom. His famous line was: \\"¬°Se lo voy a decir a mami!\\" (\\"I'm going tell mom\\"). * \\"Marta\\" (Jackie Torres) she appeared in a two-part episode and became Israel's only known girlfriend. Then, later on the show, she re-appeared and tries to make him believe she is pregnant with his son. * \\"Gregory\\" (Edwin Francisco), Volcan's cousin. He was cocky and a total bully. He was attracted to Beba. * \\"Pupe\\" (Ra√∫l Carbonell), a bum, he always carried a rum bottle. He once was a famous trumpeter and used his talent on several episodes. * \\"Sessi\\" (Yamaris Latorre) Sissi's twin sister. She only appeared in several episodes trying to win Chevy's love just to annoy Beba. * \\"Chola\\" (Vanessa Rosario) Cholon's younger sister, quite overweight, and in love with Chevy.

The first post-Panamax vessel in the Celebrity fleet, she features innovative interior design and onboard amenities, including an ocean- going live grass lawn, a glassblowing studio, and a 12 deck-high atrium. Celebrity Cruises announced the suspension of all North American itineraries until 30 June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and extended to 1 August 2020. Design and description Externally, Celebrity Solstice looks very different from previous Celebrity Cruises ships. Martin Francis of Francis Design was hired to design her exterior profile. In original exterior renderings, the hull was shown as all-white with powder blue funnels and blue glass upper decks. In a more recent update, the light blue color had been changed to Celebrity's normal dark blue color and the hull was shown having a resemblance to the current fleet's livery, with the promenade deck painted dark blue. Similarly, the large dark blue funnel with a white X that had been the trademark of Celebrity thus far has been replaced by two thin funnels, and it was planned to have the X logo of the company visible in the glass balcony railings on the ship's \\"hump\\" (The area of superstructure which extends outward farther than the rest of the balconies). Throughout her fitting out, sea trials, and launch, it was noted that the glass X, unless seen from certain angles, was not visible. Shortly after, the X was refinished to be darker, but still can be hard to see. An afterthought during the sea trials saw the addition of a white X onto the forward funnel, thus bringing Celebrity Solstice more closely related to her fleetmates. =Facilities= Her facilities include a theater with a 1,400+ seating capacity and a live grass lawn between the ship's funnels on the upper deck and even a workout room, sauna, indoor pool, and more than four hot tubs.

The first 4102 prototype was rolled off the production line in 1987 with two more following in 1989 and the final one in late 1990/early 1991. It reportedly had a choice of 3 different power plants (a healthy 4.5L V6, 6.0L V8, and a 7.0L V8 diesel option).  Background  The 4102 (development name –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω or ocean) was intended to bring a domestic luxury sports saloon and touring coupe on to the market to compete with the imported Mercedes-Benz W126, Mercedes-Benz W123 (both saloon and coupe) and Audi 100 as well as to produce an executive car for the foreign market (despite the fact that ZIL was mainly building custom limos and saloons for the Soviet Government and its dignitaries). Description The 4102 was the first Russian executive car that did not utilized body-on-frame construction, instead it utilized unitized construction. It was also half a meter longer than the Gaz Volga and weighed half a ton less than the ZIL-41041. The roof panels and floor, trunk lid, hood and bumpers were made of fiberglass.http://cars.staroe.ru/zil4102.php Performance With its automatic transmission and the 315 hp 7.7 liter V-8 petrol engine, the same as used in other Zil limousines, the 4102 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 10.5 seconds. Fuel consumption was at and at .http://cars.staroe.ru/zil4102.php Models and trim levels There were three different models planned: a four-door family saloon, a four-door touring saloon and a two-door touring coupe; all three had very similar standard options (except for the standard engines and transmissions for both the touring coupe and touring saloons). There were two trim levels for all three models. Base interior trim on the family saloons was composed of an AM/FM radio/tape player, suede seats and head liner, two-way power bench (only the family saloons had benches seats), adjustable rear bench, power windows, power locks, heater and vent fan, power steering, 4.5L V6 engine, and front disc brakes and rear drums (again family saloon only). The second trim level on the family saloon contained most of the features on the base trim but replaced some of them as well leather seats, air conditioning (not a very popular option in Russia but it was offered) and the 6.0L V8. The touring saloon and coupe's base trim was almost identical to the family saloons except that they offered leather seats, 4-way front bucket seats, 6,000 rpm tachometer, 6.0L V-8, 5-speed manual transmission (standard on the coupe only), and front and rear disc brakes. The second trim level focused mainly on the drive train offering a tuned 6.0L V8 with about 15 more horse power and 24 more ft¬∑lbf of torque and tighter shift ratios for the manual.

It was first flown in 1915 and remained in service until after the armistice in 1918. A Short 184 was the first aircraft to sink a ship using a torpedo, and another was the only British aircraft to take part in the Battle of Jutland. Design and development Torpedo- dropping trials had been undertaken using a Gnome powered Short Admiralty Type 166 but this had proved insufficiently powerful, and so in September 1914 a new specification was formulated for an aircraft to be powered by the Sunbeam Mohawk engine currently being developed. Design proposals were invited from Sopwith, J. Samuel White and Short Brothers. Horace Short's response when the requirements were explained him by Murray Sueter, the director of the naval air department, was to say \\"Well, if you particularly want this done, I will produce a seaplane that will satisfy you\\", and on the strength of this assurance two prototypes were ordered, for which serial nos. 184 and 185 were reserved, the resultant type so becoming the Type 184.Barnes 1967 p. 110 Cockpit section of fuselage. Similar in basic design to earlier Short floatplanes built for the Navy, the Type 184 was an equal-span three-bay tractor configuration biplane. The fuselage was a conventional wire-braced wooden box-girder, with spruce longerons spindled out to reduce weight and fittings of manganese steel. The top surface of the fuselage was faired to a semi-circular section. The engine was mounted on bearers fixed to pressed steel transverse frames mounted between the longerons and the large rectangular radiator was mounted above and behind the engine, directly in front of the upper wing. The lower wings were parallel-chord, while the upper wings increased in chord from the centre section to the wingtips. The two prototype aircraft had ailerons on the upper wing only. These were single- acting, relying on the airflow to maintain them in a neutral position unless pulled downwards by using the flight controls. The interplane struts were steel tubing with wood fairings to produce a streamline section. The wings could be swung out from the pilot's position, by means of a hand-winch in the cockpit, locking being accomplished by means of a splined and threaded spigot in the forward spar, locked and unlocked by a quarter-turn in a similar manner to the breech of a field-gun. In the folded position the wings were supported by a transverse shaft mounted in front of the tailplane: this was rotated by a lever in the cockpit so that its upturned ends engaged with slots on the interplane struts in order to lock the wings in the folded position. The twin unstepped main floats were carried by a two struts attached to the front cross-tube and two pairs of struts attached to the rear cross-tube, both cross-tubes being arched in the middle to accommodate the torpedo crutches. The wooden tail float incorporated a small water-rudder actuated by torque tubes connected to the main rudder, and cylindrical air-bags were fitted beneath the lower wing-tips. The aircraft was fitted with a radio transmitter and receiver, which was powered by a wind-driven generator mounted on a hinged arm so that it could be folded back when not being used,Bruce 1966, p. 13 and other equipment carried included a basket of carrier pigeons, intended to be used as a back-up for the radio in the event of forced landings. Initial trials revealed a lack of longitudinal control, and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototypes were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the upper aileron surface to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the bungee cord to return the ailerons was rigged between the top of the rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons. Operational history Remains of a Short Type 184 at the Fleet Air Arm Museum. While Frederick Rutland's aeroplane survived the First World War intact, it was damaged by bombing during the Second World War. The first aircraft flew in early 1915. An order for ten more aircraft had already been placed, and 936 aircraft were built by ten different British aircraft companies, making it the most successful of Shorts' pre-World War II aircraft. The two prototype aircraft were embarked upon HMS Ben-my Chree, which sailed for the Aegean on 21 March 1915 to take part in the Gallipoli campaign.Barnes 1967 p. 113 On 12 August 1915 one of these, piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds, was the first aircraft in the world to attack an enemy ship with an air-launched torpedo. However, the ship had already been crippled by a torpedo fired by the British submarine E14. However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there was no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander Edmonds torpedoed a Turkish transport ship a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flt Lt G B Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo, sinking the tug. Without the weight of the torpedo Dacre was able to take off and return to the Ben-My-Chree.Bruce Flight 28 December 1956, p. 1000. The performance of the Type 184 in the climatic conditions of the Mediterranean was marginal, it being necessary to fly without an observer and carry a limited amount of fuel, and the 184 was therefore used either as a bomber, carrying two 112 lb bombs, or for reconnaissance and gunnery observation.Barnes 1967, p. 113 A Short 184, aircraft number 8359,Short 184 (8359) FAA Museum was the only British aircraft to take part in the Battle of Jutland. Flown by Flt Lt Frederick Rutland (who became known afterwards as \\"Rutland of Jutland\\") with Assistant Paymaster G. S. Trewin as observer, the aircraft was launched from HMS Engadine at about 3.08 p.m.: flying at about due to low visibility, they spotted four cruisers of the German fleet, reporting their presence back to the Engadine at about 3.30.\\"Aircraft In The Naval Battle\\"Flight 13 July 1916 The aircraft was presented to the Imperial War Museum in 1917, where it was damaged in a German air raid during the Blitz. The unrestored forward section of the fuselage is now an exhibit in the Fleet Air Arm Museum. The aircraft served in most theatres of the war. Five were used in Mesopotamia, where they were flown from the River Tigris at Ora, and in April 1916 they were used to drop supplies to the besieged garrison at Kut al Amara.Thetford 1982, p2.80 The principal use of the 184 was its use in anti-submarine patrol work. Although a substantial number of submarines were spotted and attacked, no confirmed sinkings were made. The type was used for a number of experiments by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot. On 9 May 1916, a Short 184 seaplane, using a bombsight developed by Bourdillon and Tizard, hit a target with a 500-pound bomb from a height of 4,000 feet. The 184 was also used for trials of the Davis gun in April 1916 The Type 184 was still in production at the end of the war, and in December 1918 315 remained in service.Bruce 1966, p. 14 After the end of the war they were mainly used for spotting mines, and remained in service at least until the end of 1920. Following the Geddes Report all were struck off charge by the end of 1922.Barnes 1967, p. 120 Post-war, five aircraft were adapted to seat four passengers and used for pleasure flights: two being used by the Eastbourne Aviation Co., two by the Seaplane and Pleasure Trip Co., and one by Manchester Airways. In 2010, the Estonian Maritime Museum announced it had ordered a non-flying reproduction of the plane to be built for fitting into one of their historic seaplane hangars. The main designer was killed in a glider crash on 11 July of the same year. However, a group of enthusiasts took over the build and the reproduction project was completed in spring 2012. The replica is now displayed in collection of the museum and can be seen at the Seaplane Harbour in Tallinn.http://www.lennusadam.eu/en/. A single example of the Short Type 184 was acquired by the Imperial Japanese Navy and re-designated Yokosuka Navy Short Reconnaissance Seaplane, being used as an engine test-bed.Mikesh, Robert and Shorzoe Abe. Japanese Aircraft 1910‚Äì1941. London: Putnam, 1990. Variants The Short 184 was later fitted with a variety of different engines, including the Sunbeam Gurkha, the Sunbeam Maori and the Renault. *One example, known as the Short Cut was modified by Commander C.R. Samson. The span of the lower wing was reduced, the wingtip floats were replaced with deflecting boards, and the fin area was reduced. Samson claimed an extra six knots airspeed and a significant increase in rate of climb. This aircraft may have been the inspiration behind the Mann Egerton Type B.Barnes 1967 p. 115 *Type D A conversion into a single-seat bomber, with the pilot's position moved to the rear cockpit, the space previously used for the front cockpit being used to stow nine 65 lb bombs.Barnes 1967 p. 114 *Dover Type 184 Used by the Dover Patrol seaplane stations at Newhaven and Cherbourg, equipped with larger main floats and modified wing-tip floats to cope with rough sea conditions.Barnes 1967, p. 119 *A landplane development of the Short 184, the Short Bomber, was also used by the RFC and the RNAS.

It is the long term project to connect Marseille to Grenoble via Aix-en-Provence, the Durance valley and the Department Hautes- Alpes. Route It passes the towns of Aix-en-Provence, Pertuis, Manosque, Sisteron and then Digne and Tallard. In the Department de Is√®re, it passes Monestier-de-Clermont, Vif and Varces-Alli√®res-et-Risset. The motorway provides access to the south-western Alps for the residents of the south of France. Its main section connects Marseille to Aix-en-Provence and Durance valley to the north of Sisteron (Saulce). Only 18 km is toll free between Marseilles and Aix-en-Provence, the remaining 128 km is a toll road operated by Escota between Aix-en-Provence and Saulce. At Aix-en-Provence, the autoroute becomes briefly the N296 dual-carriageway between the exits Jas-de- Boufan and Aix-les-Platanes. This section where it meets the N7 was originally proposed to be an autoroute but building has subsequently compromised the route. There is a speed limit of 50 km/h on part of the N296. A section at the Grenoble end, Varces to Coynelle (17 km), was opened in July 1999. This was extended in March 2007 when the next section, connecting Coynelle to the Col du Fau (10.5 km), was opened in March 2007. This includes 4.5 km which is a single carriageway through the Tunnel of Sinard and over the Viaduct de Monestier. This northern section is also a toll road but it is operated by AREA.

History  The first section was built in 1953, it connected the Autoroute de nord (open in 1951) to Cabri√®s. It was only extended to Aix-en-Provence and the A8 in 1970. The construction of the section from Grenoble to Sisteron was subject to protests because of its environmental impact. In 1995 for example, demonstrators blocked work by chaining themselves to construction equipment. Future Following many ministerial and policy changes, and tensions between local residents. As a result, the completion of the motorway has been on the agenda for 20 years. Were all the sections are completed the road journey from Grenoble-Marseille would be 2h40 (instead of the current 3h30). However, there are several problems: *The design of the road *The class of roads (toll/free autoroute, expressway or upgrade of the current roads (N75 and N85) *The cost of the project. *Strong environmental impact of the route. The motorway must pass through the middle of the South-Dauphin√© (Tri√®ves) Alps. There were two options for the route between the Col de Fau (Monestier-de-Clermont) and the end of the southern section near Gap: # The \\"High Route\\" was the most direct route over several high passes to Sisteron (The budget at the time was envisaged at 1.8 billion euros) # \\"Gap East\\" (via the Drac valley, the Col de Bayard and the Avance valley) to Saulce the current end of the motorway from Marseille (the budget was envisaged to be approximately 2.2 billion euros). Following a public inquiry organized between 2005‚Äì2006, the Minister Mr Perben announced in 2006 that A51 would be built on the Gap East route. However the 2011 edition of the National Scheme of Transport Infrastructure (SNIT) did not include the completion of this section. Completion before 2025 is unlikely.

Jeffrey made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League, scoring over 100 goals. Career Born in Rawmarsh, Jeffrey made his senior debut for Doncaster Rovers in 1954, at the age of just 15. Jeffrey was considered one of the most promising players in the country, and played for England U23 when still a teenager. He had an agreement with Manchester United that he would move there at the end of 56-57 season, Jeffrey but sustained a badly broken leg playing for England U23 v France in October 1956, and it was immediately apparent that he might never play again. Ironically, had he transferred to Manchester United, he might well have been on the plane for the devastating Munich air crash. He officially retired due to that injury in January 1959. He received compensation from the FA because his injury was sustained whilst on International duty. However, he then met the former Sweden International Manager George Raynor (who became manager of the non-League side Skegness Town F.C.) and who assisted Jeffrey in being able to play again, despite his former injuries. Unfortunately, an attempted come back with Skegness in August 1959, ended when he broke his leg again on his debut. Jeffrey then moved to Australia, and began his long road back to professional football with Sydney Prague in 1961 and Auburn in 1962. Later that same year, he returned to England to play non-league football with Skegness Town F.C. before finally returning to professional football with Doncaster Rovers in December 1963, where he made in his debut in a reserve team game in front of almost 4,000 supporters. Jimmy Murphy, the ex Manchester United Assistant Manager, called Jeffrey the \\"English Pele\\". Despite the fact that his athletic ability never returned to its previous heights, he had a successful career with Doncaster who were now in the lower divisions of the football league. In 1964-65 he led the entire league with 36 goals in the 4th division. In the twilight of his career, he also played in the Football League with Lincoln City, before playing non-league football with Worksop Town in 1970. Legacy The road around the Doncaster Rovers stadium opened in 2006 was named Alick Jeffrey Way, whilst five apartment blocks built on the site of the former Doncaster Rovers ground at Belle Vue were named after five of the Rovers' greatest ever players - Alick Jeffrey, Walter Langton, Tom Keetley, Syd Bycroft and James Coppinger.

He is known for his robotic performance art under the name Robochrist Industries, his animatronics work in film and television, and his large-scale interactive sculptures. Life and career From 1993 to 1997, Ristow volunteered for the seminal robotic performance art collective Survival Research Laboratories in San Francisco, California. During these years Ristow was involved in several SRL performances, contributing not only props but also, particularly in the years 1996 and 1997, robots that he had constructed. During this period Ristow also participated in several collaborative performances with another San Francisco based performance group, The Seemen, including the often cited Hellco performance at the 1996 Burning Man festival. In 1997 Ristow relocated to Los Angeles to work in the field of animatronics for film and television. Los Angeles also provided fresh audiences uninitiated to the world of robot performance art, which was already becoming well known in northern California. Shortly thereafter the name \\"Robochrist Industries\\" was first used and a small group of volunteers coalesced to form a working performance group. The gradual inclusion of artistic and technical professionals from disciplines such as film special effects and the aerospace industry helped fuel larger and more frequent shows over the ensuing years. Starting in 1999 Ristow and cohorts began performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. These shows represented the apex of the group's activities, both in terms of fully realized spectacle and audience exposure. The 2006 film \\"Coachella\\" features footage culled from Robochrist performances from several different years as well as a brief interview with Ristow. In early 2006 Ristow again relocated, this time leaving Los Angeles for Taos, New Mexico, effectively killing Robochrist Industries. The relocation to New Mexico marked a significant turn in Ristow's artistic output, away from robot-based ensemble performances, and in the direction of large-scale interactive sculpture. The list of notable large-scale sculptures built since that time includes Hand of Man (2008), Fledgling (2011), Face Forward (2011), Becoming Human (2014), and With Open Arms We Welcomed That Which Would Destroy Us (2018). These pieces have been shown at Burning Man, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Big Day Out (Australia), The Voodoo Experience (New Orleans, Louisiana), Maker Faire, and The Glastonbury Festival (England).

The road links the A8 autoroute with the A50 autoroute and runs from a junction 1km east of the P√©age de La Barque on the A8 to near the town of Aubagne where it meets the A50. It is a toll road except for the very southern stretch south of the P√©age du Pont d'Etoile and is operated by ESCOTA. Traffic information for the road is covered by Radio Vinci Autoroutes (FM107.7). It is a mixture of 2x2 and 2x3 lane road, with recent construction work to widen some of the 2x2 lane sections (2018). The A52 effectively provides a bypass of the city of Marseille, enabling those travelling between Toulon/Hyeres and Aix-en-Provence and Lyon to avoid travelling through the city. When travelling southbound from Aix-en-Provence to Toulon, one must take the exit slip after the P√©age du Pont d'Etoile in order to remain on the A52. This anomaly is a result of the construction history of the motorway. History of the A52 In 1962, an autoroute named the A52 was constructed between Marseille and Auriol in order to offer a fast link part of the way between Marseille and Nice. The southern section of the current road, then known as the East Motorway, was constructed and designated A52 in 1963, the original section subsequently to be known as the western end of the A50 autoroute and the A501. The A50 section between Marseille and what is now the A501 was extended eastwards to link up with the new A52 and onward in stages to Toulon by 1975. The northern section of the A52 was subsequently constructed, joining up with the A8 autoroute creating both a link between Marseille and Nice on the one hand and between Aix-en-Provence and Toulon on the other. On the A8 at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, a ramp was constructed with a view to continuing what is now the A520 from Auriol to the A8 and linking Marseille to the A8 in the direction of Nice more directly by motorway. This idea was eventually abandoned in favour of a series of developments of the D560 and in view of the construction of the A57 autoroute which provides a similar link, albeit via Toulon. The original A52 was finally renumbered in 1982 with four different designations, only the section between the north of Aubagne and Roquevaire having kept its original number: A50 between Marseille and Aubagne, A501 north-west of Aubagne and A520 (designated first A53 then A521) to Auriol at the exit on the D560.

She lives in Saint Petersburg. Biography Marusya Klimova is one of the most prominent representatives of counter‚àículture in modern Russian literature. In Marusya Klimova's oeuvre there's a surprising combination of postmodernist irony, immoralism, misanthropy and an adherence to a cult of pure beauty and genius in the spirit of decadence of the Age of Art Nouveau. Early in life she was connected to the underground culture of Leningrad. In early 90s she lived in Paris. In her autobiographical novels (¬´Blue Blood¬ª (1991), ¬´The Little House at Bois-Colombes¬ª (1998), ¬´The Blonde Beasts¬ª (2001)) there's a wide panorama of European life around 80s-90s described.

Once thought to have been the copyist of a handful of important music manuscripts, his musical activities are the subject of dispute.  Biography  Francis Tregian was the son of Francis Tregian the Elder and Mary Stourton. He is thought to have been born in 1574. (The birth year is derived from a household list drawn up in 1594 at the death of his teacher William Allen which referred to Tregian as being 20 years old: \\"molto nobile, di 20 anni, se colare di ingennio delicessimo dotto in filosofia, in musica et nella lingua latina.\\" Not only is this the only document suggesting his age but it is also the only document associating him with music.) In 1577 his father was arrested for being a Roman Catholic and sheltering priests. He was imprisoned and dispossessed, and the Tregian family had to leave their manor house in Probus, Cornwall. Tregian's mother and her children travelled 200 miles to London. She hoped that her brother John Stourton, 9th Baron Stourton, could intercede for her husband. She lodged in Clerkenwell with her mother, who had remarried after her father's death (her father had been executed). She eventually moved to her husband's prison. The younger Tregian was sent to France sometime between 1582 and 1586. Despite a statute enacted in 1585 by Queen Elizabeth I which levied a penalty on religious dissidents who sent their children to school overseas, on 29 September 1586, he entered the English College in Douai, a stronghold of Roman Catholicism. As fees had to be paid in advance, Persons surmises that the elder Tregian arranged payment of fees in advance with the college's agent based in London. At the English College he probably undertook the typical course of study required of all beginning students which included Latin and Greek literature and grammar. Persons notes there was no evidence of Tregian's possible musical training at the English College. The younger Tregian apparently did well; he was chosen to give the congratulatory address to the Bishop of Piacenza on the latter's visit in 1591. He obtained a position as chamberlain to Cardinal William Allen, and left for Rome on 11 July 1592 (It was once thought that Tregian encountered the composer Peter Philips who was serving William Allen in Rome. But Philips's stay in Rome was from 1582 to 1585, well before Tregian graduated the English College at Douai.) On Allen's death in 1594 Tregian appears to have gone to Brussels. A document from 1603 acknowledges Tregian as \\"being with the Archduke\\" there (the archduke being Archduke Albert).Persons cites: Public Record Office, London, \\"State Papers Domestic, James I\\" III, 77 as quoted by Pearl A. Boyan, Francis Tregian, London: Sheed and Ward, 1955. In an attempt to find a musical association, Persons notes that composer Peter Philips was the court organist to Archduke Albert from 1597 until after 1610 and that during the time Tregian was also associated with the Archduke, the two might have come into contact. The situation of the Tregian family improved somewhat when James I came to the throne. The elder Tregian was released from prison and went into exile. It is known the younger Tregian was still in Brussels in 1606 when his father visited. Also in 1606 the younger Tregian returned to England to reclaim his father's estates. Existing documents show that he purchased an interest in his family estate, the manor house \\"Golden\\" together with surrounding lands, from Elizabeth Spencer for ¬£6500 in 1607. The earliest record of his being convicted of recusancy is dated 7 July 1607 where the proceeds of his conviction are given to George Bland. The elder Tregian died in 1608. By September the Crown had seized two-thirds of the Tregian property as a fine for recusancy. By 1608‚Äì1609 he was imprisoned in Fleet Prison in London. Documents as to the actual cause of his incarceration are lacking, but Persons, citing Boyan, appears to believe it was because he was unable to repay the large sums of money borrowed to repurchase the family estate. That, combined with his recusancy, were sufficient reasons for incarceration. In 1614, the people from whom he had borrowed money petitioned the House of Lords to sell the Tregian lands to repay their loans. Persons, citing Boyan, mentioned a document that reads: \\"A warrant was issued by the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall to inquire about the division of lands of the late Francis Tregian, Recusant, in May 28, 1619\\" indicating that he died prior to that date.Persons 1969 p.27 quoting Boyan, p.120. Ironically, living at Fleet Prison allowed Tregian a modicum of style and he maintained a library of \\"many hundred books\\" according to Alexander Harris, the prison warden. Probably due to unpaid debts, the library was dispersed and nothing is known about its eventual disposition. After Tregian's death his mother accused him of defrauding her by furtive financial transactions, and another \\"kynsman,\\" John Arundell, accused him of financial impropriety. Thompson concludes that Tregian's imprisonment was probably much more about improper handling of finances than it was about recusancy.  How Tregian's name became associated with music  =Historiography= There are four manuscript collections that have been associated with Tregian: * The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the best-known of the anthologies.edited in 1899 by Fuller-Maitland and Barclay Squire, who suggested that the manuscript was compiled by the younger Francis Tregian; see Jonathan Wainwright, Musical Patronage in Seventeenth-century England: Christopher, first Baron Hatton , 1997:190. * Egerton 3665, a manuscript in the British LibraryThe manuscript has been published in fascimile: The Tregian Manuscript, with introduction by Frank A. D'Accone ('Renaissance Music in Facsimile', viia), New York & London, 1988. * Drexel 4302, The Sambrook Book in the Drexel Collection, in the New York Public Library. * Music MSS 510-14A in Christ Church, Oxford Intrigued by the supposed connection between these four manuscripts, Ruby Reid Thompson, archivist at the University of Cambridge, undertook a thorough examination of all four manuscripts, physically examining every one of their over 2,200 pages, including a detailed look at three of the manuscripts' watermarks (the custodians of the Fitzwilliam Museum did not permit watermark tracings of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book). In two articles (which are a preparation for her doctoral dissertation), Thompson provided an extensively researched historiography of how Tregian's name became so closely associated with music and why it persists despite lack of evidence and presentation of new information. The origins of the association appear to have begun with William Chappell. Writing about the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in 1855, he mentioned the name Tregian based on six ambiguous abbreviations and only one instance of the name actually spelled out (no. 315, the \\"Pavana chromatica\\" has a marginal note to \\"Mrs Katherin Tregians Pauern\\" [i.e. Pavane]. Based on this casual association, Chappell does not mention Tregian being a composer or copyist, merely that he was associated with the manuscript. Musicologist William Barclay Squire elaborated on Chappell's random notes. In 1889 for the article on \\"Virginal music\\" written for the first edition of George Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Squire provided biographies of both elder and younger Tregians and introduced the idea that the younger Tregian might have copied the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. In 1893,J. A. Fuller Maitland and A. H. Mann, editors, Catalogue of Music in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (Cambridge, 1893), p. 104-19. Squire elaborated upon his 1889 biography of the younger Tregian, adding that he had studied \\"philosophy, music and Latin.\\" Thompson quotes Squire: > If it were not for the dates of the younger Tregian's death and of the > composition of Dr. Bull's 'Jewel' [1621], it might be conjectured that the > MS was transcribed by the younger Tregian while a prisoner in the Fleet. If > this is impossible, there can be but little doubt that it was written by > some of his associates, possibly by one of his sisters, who were in England > with him. Thompson then adds her own astute observation: > Squire had apparently become locked into these lines of reasoning as the > only explanation for the origin of the manuscript, and he did not consider > any other. He was adamant in assigning the compilation of [the Fitzwilliam > Virginal Book] to a member of the Tregian family, in spite of the lack of > archival corroboration. Squire continued to elaborate upon his supposed Tregian connection for the 1899 publication of music from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Recognizing that the John Bull piece was not the 1621 work removed the obstacle to hypothesizing that Tregian was the copyist. In the introduction to the edition, Squire wrote \\"...it may be conjectured with much plausibility that [the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book] was written by the younger Tregian to while away his time in prison.\\"The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, ed. W. Barclay Squire & J. A. Fuller Maitland (Leipzig: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1894‚Äì1899), p. v‚Äìix. The editors added some scepticism, noting that handwriting samples would be needed to verify Tregian's handwriting. Because of the wide distribution of this 1899 edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book due to reprints,such as the inexpensive and easily available Dover edition: The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, New York: Dover, 1963. Squire's strongest endorsement of Tregian has gained near-acceptance as fact. In the second (1910) and third (1928) editions of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Squire mitigated his view of Tregian's responsibility, retreating from the claim that he had copied the work, but believing that it was still associated with him. Thompson then examined the seven references mentioned by Chappell, noting that the one unambiguous reference to Mrs. Katherin Tregian could have been either to the younger Tregian's grandmother or aunt. Noting that the reference itself could be a dedication, Thompson noted that a number of works in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book are dedicated to various people, none known to be connected with the Tregian family. The presence of two instances of the marking \\"Treg\\" in titles as well as ambiguous abbreviations‚Äîand noting that all these annotations are missing in other manuscript versions of these works‚Äîleads Thompson to find a slim basis for Squire's declaration of Tregian being the copyist in 1899, and no surprise that he later retreated from the claim. In 1951, Bertram Schofield and Thurston Dart's article on the then newly purchased manuscript Egerton 3665 declared that manuscript to be in the same hand as the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: \\"The two hands are identical, even down to minute details of erasure, pagination, correction of mistakes and numbering of the content of the books.\\" Noting that two of its pieces had composer attributions abbreviated as \\"F.\\" and \\"F.T.\\", and then adding Drexel 4302 making a group of four manuscripts, Schofield and Dart paradoxically announced their idea of Tregian as copyist was \\"more probable than ever\\" while admitting there was \\"no final proof.\\" Elizabeth Cole claimed to have found this proof in 1952. Thinking that the attempts to buy back the Tregian family home must be documented, Cole found \\"no less than twenty-eight signatures\\" in the \\"Truro Museum\\" (the Royal Cornwall Museum). She was particularly taken by two legal documents and showed photographs of them to Schofield who\\"perhaps little cautiously\\" in Thompson's characterisation\\"saw no reason to doubt but that Tregian was indeed the scribe of Egerton 3665 and, therefore, the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.\\" Thompson was able to not only track down the document that had convinced Cole and which she reproduced, but found one that could have been even more convincing. Despite Cole's assertion of similarity of hands, Thompson reproduces fragments of writing from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, Egerton 3665 and Christ Church MS. 510‚Äì14, and concludes that while the writing shows similarities of style, none of the works can be shown to be in the same hand. She even notes that Dart was not totally convinced as he later stated that Egerton 3665 was \\"almost certainly in [Tregian's] hand.\\" In reviewing the biography of Francis Tregian the elder, Thompson notes that his well-documented biography includes only a single link to a musician, the brother of composer William Byrd (this information having been supplied by Benjamin Beard, one of the elder Tregian's informers). Beyond this one link, she is unable to find much more evidence of Tregian's musical engagement, certainly not enough to promote him as \\"English musician\\" as did the fifth and sixth editions of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Even if the sources for the pieces in the manuscript labelled \\"F.\\" and \\"F.T.\\" proved to be that of Tregian, Thompson felt that information would not overturn the question of responsibility for all the manuscripts. At the end of her review of Schofield's and Dart's and Cole's ideas, she concludes: \\"It seems likely that Cole and Schofield allowed their judgement to be swayed by their own hopes or expectations.\\" = Physical evidence = Physical examination of the four manuscripts brought Thompson to a new train of thought based on her conclusions. *Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: Thompson found that the entire manuscript was written on high-quality Swiss paper made by the D√ºring family of Basle. She concluded that \\"The manuscript appears to have been planned professionally as a unified project for which enough paper of uniform quality was obtained beforehand.\\" *The Christ Church manuscript was also made of the same high-quality D√ºring paper. Thompson concluded: \\"The regularity of the partbooks indicates that they were planned as a unit and professionally put together, and that they have been carefully handled or stored since compilation.\\" *Egerton 3665: In this manuscript Thompson finds the same high- quality D√ºring paper used for 154 folios and 364 folios made by Wendelin Riehl mills in Strasbourg. She notes that the lack of uniformity in the size of the gatherings is evidence that the manuscript was not planned as a whole from the outset. She observes that the gatherings were subject to independent use, and may not have been copied in the order in which they are currently bound. *Drexel 4302: Of its 257 folios, only five are of the high-quality D√ºring paper, the remainder being the Wendelin Riehl paper. Showing varied signs of wear like Egerton 3665, Thompson declared Drexel 4302 to be an aggregate volume (composed of smaller gatherings) which had been used independently and brought together when bound. Paper. Thompson notes that both paper types are rare in England; no other music manuscripts were identified using these paper types. For the paper from the Wendelin Riehl mills, Thompson identified a circa 1598 copy of The Visitation of Lancashire edited by William Smith, Rouge Dragon‚Äîa copy directly connected to the royal court. Thompson consulted the Basle paper museum, known as the Basel Paper Mill. According to the Mill, the paper used for the score manuscripts was created during the first quarter of the 17th century. Paper similar to the Wendelin Riehl but with a different watermark was used by architect Inigo Jones for three drawings made between 1619 and 1624, all of them directly related to the royal court. A search of over 30 English archives failed to reveal any more of the D√ºring paper. With only a few examples of the Wendelin Riehl paper, Thompson concludes that \\"All the manuscripts containing such papers are found in documents relating to the cultural activities or the official business of the royal courts. Thus a corresponding connection may exist between the four music manuscripts and musical activities of the English court.\\" Thompson then begins a discussion of physical attributes of the graphic style used in the four manuscripts. She warns against superficial examination by noting that similarity of layout can be deceptive and that one must thoroughly analyze various characteristics such as margins, rulings, scripts, corrections, and annotations. In her 2001 article she focused on ruling and music script. She notes how each of the manuscripts have a relative small ruled area ranging from 55.6% (for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book) to 58.8% for Egerton 3665), observing that conservation of paper was not an issue and that these scores must have been intended for presentation. She based her observations on the principle that similarly ruled paper would have been created at the same time. She notes this is consistent for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Christ Church MSS 510‚Äì14. It is not true for both Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302, leading her to conclude that these two manuscripts were not planned as single units (which would have had identical ruling) but portions made at different times. Ruling. Thompson acknowledges the four manuscript share an orderly layout and similar graphic style, creating the appearance of uniformity. Yet she warns that each manuscript page is a \\"complex object built up from different layers of scribal features applied in a given sequence. Each item (e.g. margins, rulings, scripts, corrections, annotations) when detached from the written web, provides evidence about the genesis of the manuscripts, and throws light on the chronology of scribal activity.\\" She warns against studying only one of these characteristics and drawing conclusions based on information in isolation. Clearly having done the work as part of her dissertation, she chose to focus on staff ruling and music script. Allowing for reduction of page size due to trimming and binding, Thompson reveals that the average amount of page used in the manuscripts was rather small (55.6% in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, 54% in Christ Church manuscript 510‚Äì14, 58.8% in Egerton 3665 and 56.6% in Drexel 4302), indicating that saving paper was clearly not a major consideration, whereas attractive presentation was apparently important. She remarks on the \\"elegant proportions\\" of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and the Christ Church manuscripts 510‚Äì514 nothing that they were probably intended as fair or presentation copies. Noting the complexity of analysing staff ruling, Thompson restricts her comments to general ones. She notes that measurements on each page of all four manuscripts indicate that ruling was done in gatherings, rather than on individual pages. For the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and the Christ Church manuscripts 510‚Äì514, Thompson notes the high degree of consistency in the rulings of both manuscripts \\"confirms\\" that they were ruled for a specific project. This is unlike Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302 which show considerable variations in ruling not only between gatherings but even within them. This leads to Thompson's conclusion that these latter two manuscripts were not planned as unified works where the staves needed to have similar rulings. Some of their gatherings were possibly used individually and trimmed at different times which accounts for the variety in the dimensions of the margins. Script. Thompson notes that many features of the music script can give the impression of uniformity, suggesting that standards of copying the music text were in place before copying began. But her close inspection of the four manuscripts show distinct scripts. She makes a distinction between \\"music hand\\" (\\"the product of an individual's pen\\") and \\"music script\\" (\\"the form of notation, apart of who may have written it\\") and warns that excessive initial focus on the music hand can allow too many subjective decisions for a proper analysis. Thompson identifies two features which can reveal music script variations between different hands: the shape of white notes (that is, half notes) with stems below their noteheads, and the angle and the point of attachment of stems. There is considerable diversity in the way half notes are made in the four manuscripts. At times they are made by a single unbroken stroke (the notehead followed by the stem) and other times the notehead is drawn first followed by the stem. The downward stems are usually drawn from the right side of the notehead, but occasionally from the center. Their orientation can be straight, bowed or bent at an angle. One would expect consistency in a single scribe, therefore Thompson notes that a mixture of forms indicates at least two scripts. With plates showing the widely different scribal forms in the four manuscripts Thompson notes that they each have different scribal structures. Mus. 510‚Äì514 has a uniform script; the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book has mostly a uniform script that gradually switches to a smaller contrasting script several times. Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302 on the other hand show great scribal diversity. Counting sixty changes of scribal hand for Egerton 3665 and thirty for Drexel 4302, she identifies seventeen specific hands, of which nine are shared by both manuscripts. In summarising her discussion of scribal issues, Thompson acknowledges the difficulties of making determinations of a variety of music scripts, but concludes that there is no question of reducing the multiple hands to a single person. Conclusion. Thompson's conclusion is direct: > The attribution of these manuscripts to Francis Tregian's hand is thus > little more than an attractive legend. Never based on very solid > biographical evidence, it is contradicted by the physical characteristics of > the manuscripts themselves. Their paper strongly suggests that the > manuscripts were prepared by a group of professional scribes working for > patrons at court or connected to court circles. But a scriptorium capable of > executing these commissions could scarcely have been brought into being > expressly for that purpose. It is likely to have dealt with other, not > necessarily musical, tasks, although no further manuscripts prepared by the > same group have yet been identified. David J. Smith's response to Thompson's 2001 article clearly takes the traditional view of Tregian's role by repeatedly referring to the group of four manuscripts as \\"The Tregian manuscripts.\\" He reproduces two documents with Francis Tregian's name (one of them being HC 2/27, the same one that Thompson and Cole had reproduced) from the Royal Cornwall Museum. Smith states that cultivated gentlemen developed more than one script. Recognizing the differences between signature and the body of the document as well as scribal inconsistencies within the same document, he states \\"...there is no reason to discard the hypothesis on ground of handwriting alone\\" and several lines later: \\"These differences, found within a document written by the same scribe at the same time, point to the pitfalls lying in the way of those who try to prove (or disprove) hypotheses by means of handwriting alone.\\" (This is a false premise since Thompson used handwriting as only one of many elements to her analysis.) Where Thompson argued that the change in music script suggests more than one scribe, Smith uses exactly the same argument to argue in favour of a single scribe, since an individual's handwriting changes over time. He states \\"The Tregian manuscripts were probably compiled over many years, so inconsistencies in their notation are only to be expected\\", deliberately ignoring Thompson's findings concerning the paper particularly of the uniformity of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus. 510-514A. Smith notes that both the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Drexel 4302 have empty ruled staves at their ends which he sees as evidence of a \\"work in progress.\\" Referring to Thompson's conclusion, Smith states \\"It seems hardly credible that a scriptorium of professional scribes would have presented incomplete manuscripts to whomever commissioned them\\", ignoring Thompson's later comment \\"...the chequered history of [these manuscripts'] compilation may result from changes in the patron's requirements or even a change of patron.\\" Regarding the paper gatherings from which Thompson was able to determine different origins for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus. 510-514A as compared to Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302, Smith states \\"The way in which individual gatherings have been combined to form a larger work suggests that, initially, the genesis of these sources was a far more haphazard affair: they seem more the work of a committed individual pursuing a passion, collecting together materials from sources which came his way, than the product of a grand design.\\" When later he does mention the paper types revealed by Thompson he again resorts to scribal issues. Smith goes on at length to discuss particular points of the music content, an aspect that Thompson deliberately did not discuss, since she recognised that physical analysis must precede content analysis Without supplying corroborative physical evidence aside from scribal issues that do not directly address or refute Thompson's discoveries, Smith feels that \\"there is no reason to discard the hypothesis that Tregian was the scribe.\\" Whether there is still a controversy concerning Tregian, in his European Music: 1520‚Äî1640 (first published in 2006), James Haar considers the hypothesis to be \\"demolished\\" by Thompson's findings.

The Fontana della Barcaccia (; \\"Fountain of the Boat\\") is a Baroque-style fountain found at the foot of the Spanish Steps in Rome's Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Square). Pope Urban VIII commissioned Pietro Bernini in 1623 to build the fountain as part of a prior Papal project to erect a fountain in every major piazza in Rome. The fountain was completed between 1627 and 1629 by Pietro possibly along with the help of his son Gian Lorenzo Bernini, especially after his father's death on August 29, 1629. The sculptural fountain is made into the shape of a half-sunken ship with water overflowing its sides into a small basin. The source of the water comes from the Acqua Vergine, an aqueduct from 19 BCE. Bernini built this fountain to be slightly below street level due to the low water pressure from the aqueduct. Water flows from seven points of fountain: the center baluster; two inside the boat from sun-shaped human faces; and four outside the boat. According to legend, as the River Tiber flooded in 1598, water carried a small boat into the Piazza di Spagna. When the water receded, a boat was deposited in the center of the square, and it was this event that inspired Bernini's creation. The fountain is decorated with the papal coat of arms of the Barberini family as a reminder of Pope Urban VIII's ancestry. Damage and restoration On May 15, 2007 four drunken immigrants damaged the monumental fountain with a large screwdriver inflicting a deep scratch, with the consequent detachment of a significant part of the papal coat of arms. The carabinieri rushed to the place were attacked by the four vandals, but still managed to get them under arrest and prevent further damage. Restoration on the fountain has been carried out several times, the last being in 2014, through a private donation of 209,960 Euro. A few weeks after the unveiling, the fountain was damaged on 19 February 2015 by a group of Dutch football hooligans, who were in Rome to support Rotterdam-based club Feyenoord in a Europa League match against A.S. Roma. The group, allegedly under the influence of alcohol and drugs,Ansa.it stepped into the fountain and threw bottles and rubbish in it before clashing with the police. In popular culture The English poet John Keats could hear the sound of the fountain's water flowing soothingly from his deathbed. He said it reminded him of lines from the 17th-century play Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding (1611) and was the source for his epitaph: \\"Here lies one whose name was writ in water.\\" Jess Walter uses the fountain as a plot device in Beautiful Ruins.

Works =Books= His first book, Ogopogo, My Journey with the Loch Ness Monster, was published in 1983. He also wrote The Last... series of books; this included The Last Polar Bears, which was adapted into a 30-minute cartoon for CITV and a touring theatre production for the National Theatre of Scotland, and The Last Castaways, which won the Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize. =Political cartoons= From 1987 to 1992 Horne was a political cartoonist for Scotland on Sunday and The Scotsman; he also drew until his death in 2007 for the Sunday Herald newspapers. His illustrations also appeared regularly in The Observer and The Independent newspapers. =Computer game= In 1993 he created, designed, and wrote a point-and-click adventure game for Time Warner called Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages. The game was based on a forged manuscript he had written a decade earlier, purporting to have been written by 19th-century poet Richard Henry Horne, who shares Horse's name. =Illustrations= His illustrations appeared in books as diverse as The Good Golf Guide to Scotland, a centenary edition of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, two books by Martin C.

Death On 10 January 2007, Horne's body was discovered holding his wife Mandy, who had been terminally ill with multiple sclerosis, in their bungalow in Papil, West Burra. The Sunday Times reported on 13 July 2008 that rather than the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" scene described in many articles relating to their deaths, Horse had stabbed her thirty times before killing their pets and stabbing himself until he too bled to death. Actor Tam Dean Burn, who had in the week of Horse's death made a radio tribute to him, said in 2009 after speaking with Horse's female relatives that the 2008 report was \\"a cruel distortion\\".

Vocalizations of wild turkeys include \\"gubles\\", \\"clucks\\", \\"putts\\", \\"purrs\\", \\"yelps\\", \\"cutts\\", \\"cackles\\", \\"kee-kees\\" and the coveted French call \\"Blululqu\\". To reproduce these different vocalizations there are various types of turkey calls available today and a good hunter learns to use several because it is unpredictable which type of sound a wild turkey will respond to on any given time. The hunter will learn turkey call techniques to attract a turkey to their location. Turkey box calls Box calls create turkey sounds with the friction created by sliding the lid across the surface of the box. Box calls are convenient and are capable of producing more volume than any other call in the world. Turkey pot calls Pot calls may be the most common turkey calls because they are easy to use and create lifelike turkey sounds. Friction calls feature a round (usually) surface, and the user creates sound by drawing a peg, or \\"striker\\", across the surface. Pot call surfaces can be slate, aluminum, glass or a variety of other materials. Push-pull turkey calls Push-pull turkey calls are the simplest of all turkey calls to use, and create realistic turkey sounds. A push-pull call functions by pushing and/or pulling a button on the end of the call, forcing a surface across a peg. Tube turkey calls The tube call is a popular caller for many of the nation's top turkey hunters. With it, a hunter can make virtually any sound in a turkey's vocabulary from yelps to purrs to gobbles. Tube calls consist of a small hollow barrel with latex fixed across half of the top with an elastic band. Wingbone turkey calls Wingbone calls originally were made from the wingbones of a turkey, and some still are. They are a suction-type call. Sounds are made with quick, forceful sucking motions, much like kissing the end of the call. Good wingbone calls make a hollow sounding yelp. Diaphragm turkey calls Diaphragm calls are inserted entirely in the user's mouth and require practice to learn to use correctly. Turkey locator calls Locators are calls used to force a tom turkey to gobble, thus giving away his location. Mature male turkeys will \\"shock gobble\\" at loud noises such as an owl's hoot, a crow's caw, a hawk's scream, a peahen's call, a rock bouncing off a stop sign, - even thunder or a train's whistle.

It was founded in 1996 by wetsuit innovator Jack O'Neill and provides students with hands-on lessons on marine habitat and the relationship between the oceans and the environment. The program provides a free education course at the Santa Cruz Harbor to fourth to sixth-grade students, who typically come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The program's first Executive Director Dan Haifley has argued O'Neill Sea Odyssey's position that ocean concepts should be adopted in formal education standards and made more widely available to youth from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Haifley retired in March, 2019 and Rachel Kippen took over the Executive Director position. https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2019/02/24/oneill-sea-odyssey-rachel-kippen- ready-to-take-nonprofits-helm/ The core program takes place over a three-hour period on board a catamaran owned by Team O'Neill, and covers three areas; marine biology, ecology and navigation. Three quarters of teachers who enroll their classes in the program utilize the program's web-based classroom curriculum and educational materials both before and after the course. Over 100,000 students have passed through the program.https://register- pajaronian.com/article/oneill-sea-odyssey-taps-new-executive-director In December 2004, the program received the California Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award in Children's Environmental Education and in May 2005, US Senator Barbara Boxer presented the organization with her statewide Environmental Champion award https://www.webcitation.org/5McGWJ3FH. On August 22, 2009, the program's Adam Webster Memorial Fund received the Special Parents Information Network's Community Spinner Award for its work with special needs youth (www.spinsc.org). November 5, 2013, O'Neill Sea Odyssey was awarded the Impact Award from the Silicon Valley Business Journal.

Core Curriculum  OSO's comprehensive curriculum can be found at: http://oneillseaodyssey.org/wp- content/themes/oneil/images/pdf/curriculum_english.pdf . It utilizes everyday principles and ocean concepts to emphasize federal and state education content standards: mathematics is demonstrated using navigational concepts such as triangulation, for example. The curriculum is taught during the field trip after dividing the class into three groups using three learning stations both on the boat and in OSO's education center, summarized below. = Marine Biology = Discussion includes the life cycles of plankton, their role in the food web and the unique chemical and physical balance that helps maintain life in the sea. Students participate in a hands-on plankton tow and the specimen is taken back to the classroom for further examination. A water sample is also taken back to test its salinity using a refractometer. When the students return to the lab, the samples from the plankton tow gathered on the boat are viewed through a microscope that is connected to a large-screen monitor. Students participate in plankton identification and discuss the different types of phytoplankton and zooplankton collected. = Ecology = Students learn information about the Monterey Bay Sanctuary's characteristics and marine life and habitats. Discussion includes the kelp forest, marine mammals, human influence on our marine habitat and related ecosystems, threats to the bay, and ideas for conservation and preservation. Visual aids are used to emphasize these concepts. A water sample is taken to learn about pH. Crab pods are pulled up each class so kids can view live creatures that might have settled in them, such as crabs and the occasional octopus. On the way back to the harbor, students count the number of otters in Black's Beach kelp forest and record this information on their data sheet. After the students return to the lab, an overview of the water cycle and watersheds is given. The water sample is tested for pH and the effect of pH on the ecosystem is discussed. Students discuss storm drains and how they relate to ocean pollution. Using a watershed model, examples of point source and non-point source pollution are demonstrated. Students are encouraged to conceptualize solutions to current environmental problems including landfill diversion, organic farming, reducing, reusing, recycling and alternate forms of transportation and energy. = Navigation = Students learn about electronic technology for navigation, triangulation, line-of-sight, use of magnetic hand-held compasses, and other elements of navigation. Hand-held compasses are used by the students to take 3 bearings on local landmarks. This information is recorded on a datasheet along with readings of wind speed, weather and depth as it relates to oceanic charts. Once back in the lab, the bearings taken on the boat are then plotted onto a chart of the Monterrey Bay. Students learn how to read and decipher the signs, symbols and measurements on navigational charts. The class includes an introduction to navigational tools such as parallel rulers, globes and the compass rose. The instructor discusses latitude, longitude, basic geometry as it relates to triangulation and other elements of navigation.  Past Programs  The O'Neill Sea Odyssey has conducted a number of additional programs outside the \\"core program\\" including: *San Jose Community Oceanography A week- long program focused on watershed to the sea education for low-income youth. *Ocean Scholars O'Neill Sea Odyssey sponsors ocean science mentorships for youth served by Familia Center serving low-income Latino families in Santa Cruz County. *Project Discovery An in depth overnight program with OSO aimed at low-income Oakland youth partnered with Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park .  Community Service Project  The community service portion encourages and rewards students to give back to their community. Each class that participates in the O'Neill Sea Odyssey program, is educated in common ways to start up community service projects (CSP)in school or in their respective communities. At OSO, there is an emphasis not only in educating the individual, but also giving the tools to the student as they participate in sharing their new community awareness outside the core program. Past examples include: *School recycling programs *Lunch waste composting programs *Beach/Creek clean ups *Native plant restoration *Pollution awareness programs *Letter writing campaigns for environmental causes *Gardens for the homeless *Storm drain stenciling *School campus beautification *Community environmental awareness projects *Creative original project of your own design  In-Class Curriculum  OSO has provided activities and curricula to participating classrooms since 2002. Data collected during the field trip for each class is transferred to a database at the same website and each class accesses that data for follow-up lessons. Participating teachers and schools have used OSO curricula to design and implement comprehensive ocean science units into their classroom lesson plans. Since OSO's curriculum is aligned with national education standards teachers are able to reach the standards of the marine science curriculum. Examples: *Laura Moore, a 4th grade teacher has implemented a 6-week ocean unit into all fourth grade classes at Bay View Elementary in Santa Cruz. Utilizing the OSO teacher's packet of pre and post trip activities, Ms. Moore has created an ocean unit that includes a scientific writing narrative requirement that is completed by all students. Participating students must choose from tide pool, kelp forest and deep ocean habitats to research an in depth report. Ms. Moore times her ocean unit to allow for preparatory and follow up time before and after the OSO field trip. Part of the preparation phase is her class‚Äô participation in Coastal Clean up Day each year to fulfill OSO's community service requirement. The OSO teacher's packet includes plankton identification information, food web charts and activities, marine science vocabulary lists in English and Spanish, and other activities that facilitate integration of marine science into the classroom. *5th grade teachers Mara Licina, Erin Tuttle, and Becky Gordillo, have integrated a two- week ocean unit into the 5th grade classroom science curriculum at Santa Teresa Elementary in San Jose. Utilizing the teacher packet and follow-up activities entitled ‚ÄúExpand your knowledge of the Monterey Bay. A resource of terms, facts and Q & A‚Äù gives these teachers the ability to reach educational science standards while understanding marine science concepts. *Theresa Coyle, a teacher from Soquel Elementary in Santa Cruz has designed a month-long ocean science unit for her students based upon activities and curriculum from O‚ÄôNeill Sea Odyssey. Ms. Coyle's students participate in a beach clean up to fulfill a community service project for OSO, including discussion of decomposers and decomposition rates as the students separate different types of waste. Students also participate in a school composting program to promote landfill diversion. Ms. Coyle uses the OSO teacher's packet and curriculum to teach ocean science vocabulary, plankton and kelp ecology, marine mammal facts and watershed ecology.  Adam Webster Memorial Fund  Adam Webster Memorial Fund enables individuals with special needs to participate in O'Neill Sea Odyssey's ocean-based, hands-on education program. The fund was started by Adam's parents Tom and Judy Webster, after his death in June 1999. The vision of the Adam Webster Fund of the O'Neill Sea Odyssey is to provide a successful but not purely intellectual or academic learning experience for individuals with special needs in the context of the ocean environment. Special needs individuals may benefit from learning about navigation but perhaps just as much from feeling the rolling motion of the ocean as the wave movement stimulates the body and a sensory system that has been immobile and using a wheelchair for years. The Special Parents Information Network (SPIN) has announced that on August 22, 2009 the Adam Webster Memorial Fund received the \\"Community Spinners\\" award at a ceremony in Watsonville for its work with special needs youth.  Evaluations  Applied Survey Research (ASR) partnered with The United Way of Santa Cruz County have celebrated the 15th year of the Community Assessment Project, (CAP) along with its evaluation of the O‚ÄôNeill Sea Odyssey program for the 2008-2009 school year The report found that the free, ocean-going science and ecology program for area schools has a high impact especially among low-income youth. Among the ASR report's findings: *The Student Survey showed that the OSO program was effective in promoting substantial increases in students‚Äô environmental awareness. An average of 76% of students agreed with the survey questions regarding environmental knowledge and responsible behavior before participating in the program, compared to 97% after attending the program. *When students were divided into ‚Äúlower income‚Äù and ‚Äúhigher income‚Äù groups, survey results indicated that although both groups of students substantially increased their environmental knowledge after attending the program, the ‚Äúlower income‚Äù students showed a greater amount of change and caught up with the ‚Äúhigher income‚Äù students by the end, with virtually all of the students agreeing with the survey questions (96% and 98%, respectively).http://www.oneillseaodyssey.org/PDF/OSO_2008-09_ASRFINALforWeb.pdf A study of the long-term impact of the program was conducted by San Jose State Master's candidate Lauren Hanneman, and was finished in Fall 2010. The report will be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences and was summarized by the author: *75.1% of students who participated in the OSO fell into a certain mental model, indicating a long- term retention of knowledge and environmental education taught in the Ecology curriculum at OSO. It is also indicative that students‚Äô believe that ocean pollution is largely land- based (attitude). *Although the students do not indicate whether or not they litter, the students in Mental Model 4 indicate that they make the connection between litter and ocean pollution and studies have shown that increased knowledge and attitudes are the best indicators of intention to act (behavior). *The only socio-demographic variables affecting students‚Äô mental models were the community setting (distance from the ocean) and the number of other experiential environmental education fieldtrips the students attended. Income, gender, grade level, and language did not have a significant effect on students‚Äô mental models.  The Historic O'Neill Sea Odyssey Building  The OSO Education Center is located upstairs in what is known as the O'Neill Building at the Santa Cruz Harbor. The historic building is where legendary suspense Film director Alfred Hitchcock sailed from, where Jack O‚ÄôNeill's hot air balloons were prepared for flight and brought back for repairs. Wetsuits, sailing catamarans and dive equipment were also sold here while legendary parties and promotions were going on for the O‚ÄôNeill brand. ‚ÄúHarry Hind and I are old time surfers from Kelly's Cove and Ocean Beach, San Francisco. We surfed there in the 1950s, and became good friends,\\" Jack O‚ÄôNeill said while describing the building's genesis. \\"I had the idea to open a surf shop at the Santa Cruz Harbor, and I asked Harry if he could back me on the deal. He said he would. Then Harry brought in a CPA and an attorney, and soon our surf shack became an 8,500 square foot building. We got approval from the Harbor and built in 1965. In 2000, Harry and I donated this building to the Sea Odyssey, to have this wonderful facility and revenue from rental space. Harry and I had a lifelong interest in the ocean, and his generosity has helped to make this program possible.‚Äù In 2004 O‚ÄôNeill Sea Odyssey (OSO) and the Santa Cruz Harbor renovated the building, with OSO taking the upstairs and the Harbor taking the downstairs. OSO got an education center to serve thousands of kids per year with the award-winning program, and comfortable private tenant spaces with sweeping views of the Santa Cruz Harbor Channel and the Monterey Bay. As the building was renovated, OSO continued its classes in a temporary facility on US Coast Guard land on the Harbor's west side. Donors supporting OSO's building renovation included the California Wildlife Conservation Board, Jack O‚ÄôNeill, Harry Hind, the California Coastal Conservancy, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Balance Vector Inc., Robert Stephens and Julie Packard, Charles and Ann Walton, Jim and Debbie Thoits, Coast Commercial Bank, Tim and Bridget O‚ÄôNeill, West Marine, Merrill and Lee Newman, Russ Rolfe Sr., Westcliff Foundation, Dan and Rebecca Haifley, Michael and Ann McCabe, Rob and Nancy Bremner, Nick Petredis, Jack McLaughlin, Shannon Brady and Donna Blitzer.  Green Business Certified  The O'Neill Sea Odyssey has been Green Business Certified and is listed on Monterrey Bay Green Business's web site. Because of OSO's dedication to reduce water consumption, use of alternate green energy sources, recycling, and reducing pollution it has qualified as a Green Business.http://www.montereybaygreenbusiness.org/GBListingsSC.html  Solar Program  The goals of the OSO solar project are to: * Reduce the carbon footprint * Create clean recycled energy for O‚ÄôNeill Sea Odyssey's education center and the Surfrider Foundation's Santa Cruz Chapter office and water testing laboratory * Save money for both organizations In addition to the Solar Program on land, the catamaran features solar panels and a wind turbine to create more clean energy while at sea, furthering the education of the students in the OSO core program. ‚ÄúBy reducing our carbon footprint and saving money, we will go green and save green,‚Äù said OSO Executive Director Dan Haifley. ‚ÄúClimate change impacts the ocean which in turn plays a role in moderating earth‚Äôs climate, so this will be a small contribution to keeping that balance healthy.‚Äù The solar electric system generates about 3,700 kilowatt hours per year. It is estimated to pay for itself in 15 years. The grid-tied system includes 14 Sanyo HIP 195BA19 solar panels, among the most efficient solar panels available, and a 3000 watt AC output inverter. The solar electric system was designed by Solar Mike and installed by Ron Goad of Solar Construction. A $19,500 grant from the Ludwick Family Foundation of Glendora Los Angeles County paid for the majority of the solar electric system, along with cash rebate from California for about 25% of the system cost.http://www.solarmike.net/Featured_Systems/oneill.html OSO looks to be a leader in sustainable building while impacting youth awareness in future green technologies.  Cruzio and OSO  After 20 years of service, Santa Cruz Internet provider, Cruzio, is donating its services by upgrading the O'Neill Sea Odyssey website from the old Microsoft ASP to a Drupal framework, providing a curriculum with high-quality resources for teachers in their own classrooms. \\"The Bay, Ocean and Elkhorn Slough are not only central to what makes Santa Cruz County special to visitors and residents, they are central to the environmental health of the region,\\" stated Chris Neklason, co-owner and founder of Cruzio.\\" The OSO education program raises awareness and enthusiasm in the next generation of Earth stewards. It is vital, important work, and Cruzio is pleased to be able to assist OSO as we do other local non-profit groups and businesses.\\" Santa Cruz City Councilmember Ryan Coonerty, gave a request for a couple of volunteers from the members of Next Space to streamline the online learning center. Next Space is a shared working environment based in Santa Cruz that catalyzes innovation by bringing together capital, talent, and ideas. Now with Cruzio's high-speed DSL, ecommerce, wireless, Web Site hosting, computer care and hands-on classes the OSO program has become enriched with the opportunity to save precious donor funds used for directly serving local youth. Anyone can access more information and the latest local news, weather and traffic on the award-winning cruzio.com Web site. \\"Cruzio's high-value gift and involvement will enable us to continue integrating our education program into area schools, including a class database using information gathered by each class on the boat,\\" said the OSO Executive Director Dan Haifley, while stating \\"we deeply appreciate their support.\\" In 2010, this upgrade to a Drupal framework unfortunately did not work, and OSO reverted to the old website. As of September 22, 2012 though, Cruzio has since successfully been able to revamp the OSO website. Weather Station The O'Neill Sea Odyssey building is equipped with the most accurate weather report system, updating temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity and rain-fall. > New computer hardware and software feed the real-time data gathered by the > instruments to the Internet. http://www.oneillseaodyssey.com/PDF/Weatherstation.pdf References External links * O'Neill Sea Odyssey official website.

History The Edmonds Unitarian Fellowship was formed in 1957 as the Sno-King Unitarian Fellowship (Sno-King is a reference to Snohomish and King Counties). Until 1959, the group met alternate Sunday evenings, but in 1959 they rented Edmonds Masonic Temple to allow space for Sunday school. 1962‚Äì1966 the Sno-King Unitarian Fellowship started renting Edmonds High School. In 1966, Deciding it was time for a real minister and church building, the Fellowship purchased the land and building that is still in use today (in a much-expanded version) and was renamed the Edmonds Unitarian Church. The Reverend Robert Fulghum agreed to stay for a year to \\"help the church get its feet on the ground\\" and served for 18 years. During the ministry of Rev. Jaco ten Hove the congregation changed the name of the church to the Edmonds Unitarian Universalist Church. In 2009 the congregation purchased the first of two contiguous properties it now owns. The congregation adopted the mission: \\"Gathering Together, Nurturing the Spirit, and Living Our Vision of a Just and Sustainable World\\" in 2009. Very active in the move to pass Washington Referendum 74, the congregation developed its first Social Justice Stand, LGBTQI Justice and Equity in 2012. Its social justice work continued in the development of Snohomish County's first car camp for houseless women and families in need of a safe place to park in 2016. Ministerial History The congregation was lay led until Rev. Robert Fulghum began part-time ministry in 1967. Stuart and Maybelle Chapman, the founding \\"father and mother\\" of the church, were ordained as lay ministers in 1969. All three ministers worked together until Stuart died in 1978, and then as a twosome until Fulghum's departure in 1985. Robert Fulghum left after 18 years of part-time ministry. Rev. Aron Gilmartin acted as Interim Minister for one year, from 1985 to 1986. The first full-time minister was Reverend Davis Joyce (1986‚Äì1987) who departed suddenly after a very short tenure. In the spring of 1988, the congregation called Rev. Jaco B. ten Hove who remained in ministry until 1999 when he left the congregation to join in co-ministry with his spouse, Rev. Barbara Wells. Reverend Elizabeth Kerman was interim minister for one year. The congregation called Rev. Edward Brock as full-time minister in 1999 and he served the congregation until 2007. Rev. Cecilia Kingman acted as interim minister for 2 years following his departure, from Oct 2007 to June 2009. Rev. Charlotte Cowtan followed as another interim minister for one year. In Spring 2010 the congregation called Rev. Eric Kaminetzky to be full-time Minister. In May 2017 the congregation called a second minister, Rev. Cecilia Kingman, to be Minister for Faith and Justice with Rev. Eric Kaminetzky becoming Senior Minister. Significance The Edmonds Unitarian Universalist Church is a part of the history of writer Robert Fulghum, who was the first minister at the EUUC. The Reverend Robert Fulghum remains the minister emeritus.

The format has come under criticism, especially from the fansub community, because compared to the format it aimed to replace, Advanced Substation Alpha (which is based on comma-separated values), it is more verbose and far harder for software to read, write and manipulate. Also, it is not easily human readable and much harder to edit \\"by hand\\" in text editors such as Notepad. For these reasons, as well as the lack of a generic cross-platform parsing/rasterizing library and mature editing programs that natively support it, the format has not gained wide acceptance. No known media player software implements more than basic support for this format.

The jet was a modified Boeing 757 that contained altered lighting, staging and space for the band. Jamiroquai's unofficial logo, the Buffalo Man, was painted on the exterior. The Gig in the Sky commenced on 27 February 2007, when the flight took off at 4:00 am; it was scheduled to fly from Munich to Athens. Midway through the flight, at an altitude of 35,000 feet, the concert commenced, with Jamiroquai playing five songs, including two new songs from their compilation album High Times: Singles 1992-2006, released in November the previous year. After touchdown, passengers were invited to attend an after-party held at a nearby hotel in Athens before returning home. Records As part of the concert's promotion by Sony Ericsson, Jamiroquai additionally aimed to qualify for several unique Guinness World Records. During the concert, an adjudicator from Guinness World Records was present on the plane in order to present the records to Jay Kay of Jamiroquai at the end of the performance. The band broke six records, including the highest and fastest concert, recording and gig in a plane. These were not the first records received by the band - Jamiroquai also held the record for the greatest-selling funk album of all time, Travelling Without Moving. Since then, The Black Eyed Peas took the world record for highest concert in an aircraft, at 41,000 ft on 9 September 2009, in conjunction with the world's highest recorded track. The event was named \\"Mile High Karaoke\\" and was awarded the Guinness World Record certificate.

Built by slave trader and wealthy merchant Nathaniel Russell in 1808, it is recognized as one of America's most important Neoclassical houses. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Mansion and grounds =Architecture= South Bay of house Russell commissioned an unknown architect to build a large townhome in the then popular Federal-style. Sited on a large city lot in downtown Charleston, the rectangular house has a symmetrical fa√ßade, with a projecting four-sided bay that rises the full three-stories of the central block of the house. Constructed of Carolina gray brick, the three bay entrance front emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third- stories. The house is with of living area. The first-story entrance front is dominated by the residence's grand entrance door. The eight-panel door is faux-grained and is encased by fluted pilasters, and topped by an elliptical fanlight detailed with looped tracery set within a molded nichelike arch. The entrance is flanked by single unadorned windows. The three windows on the second-floor are emphasized by their floor length, ornamented with white marble lintels and are set in recessed red-brick arches with white keystones, tied together with a narrow white string course that runs around the entire perimeter of the house. Also featured is a light wrought-iron balcony that breaks out in a semicircle before each of the second-story windows, and displays Nathaniel Russell's initials in the center. A balcony also surrounds the projecting bay on the south side of the house, but does not interconnect with the one on the entrance front. Above the second-story brick arches is found a subtle red, double-brick string course that is topped with three additional windows on the third floor with prominent marble lintels. The architectural details that are found on the entrance front is carried over to the south facing fa√ßade, and can be viewed from the garden. A paneled balustrade runs fully about the central block and the south bay rendering the low hipped roof imperceptible. =Interior= First floor Elliptical spiral staircase, which ascends three floors The interior of the Nathaniel Russell house is greatly influenced by the Adam style, popular at the first of the 19th-century, that introduced curved walls, elaborate plasterwork decorations and striking mixed color schemes. The house features three main rooms per floor each of different geometric designs: a front rectangular room, a center oval room, and a square room in the rear. The rectangular entrance hall with a black and white diamond patterned floorcloth edged with a leaf motif, and the adjacent office was where Russell would conduct business. Separating the public rooms at the front of the house from the more private rooms used by the family, wide faux-grained double doors with glazed rosette patterned insets and an elliptical fan shaped transom, gives access to the golden walled stair hall that showcases the most important architectural feature of the house, the cantilevered spiral staircase, that ascends to the third floor. The asymmetrical hall is illuminated by a Palladian window, and further ornamented with trompe-l'≈ìil painting resembling a plaster cornice and an elliptical medallion that were painted by Charleston artisan Samuel O'Hara. Off the central stair hall is the oval dining room, with turquoise walls that appear painted, but are small squares of unpatterned wallpaper bordered with interlocking rings, in red and gold, above cypress wainscoting painted white. The heart-pine floors and the wood interior shutters are original. At the rear of the house is a square parlor, that was enlarged at a later date to connect the house with the kitchen, and was used by the family for everyday dining. Second floor The second-floor oval drawing room is the most highly decorated room in the house and is where the women of the house retired to after dinner. Papered in apricot, it features elaborate plaster moldings covered with 24-karat gold leaf and plinth blocks at the base painted to resemble lapis lazuli. The Adamesque ornamentation of the fireplaces' mantles and cornices are among the most detailed in the city. The curved entry doors are faux-grained to resemble flame-grained mahogany on the exterior and tortoise shell on the interior. Curved mullioned mirrors on one side of the room balance the windows to provide symmetry and reflect light in the room. The large rectangular withdrawing room found at the front of the house has soft gray walls and white wainscoting that offsets the multilayered gilded cornice molding. The windows are surrounded with tall slender pilasters and overhanging entablatures, that add dimension to the walls. With windows on three sides, the room was utilized primarily during the day to take advantage of the daylight and breezes. At the rear of the house is the square shaped master bedroom, and additional bedchambers are found on the third floor. Though most of the art and furniture displayed in the house are not original to the Nathaniel Russell House, they are of the correct time period for when the Russell family inhabited the house, and many are of Charleston origin. Nathaniel Russell House Slave Quarters =Grounds= The house and grounds are separated from the street by a brick and wrought iron fence with the entrance gate flanked by tall brick columns capped with stone ball finials. To the south of the house is the garden that was originally laid out in a geometric arrangement with patterned beds of flowers, ornamental shrubs and large orange and grapefruit trees. Today a formal English garden can be found with gravel paths, boxwood hedges and plants favored in the 19th century. In the rear of the house is the two-story slave quarters that housed many of the estimated 18 slaves that were at the Nathaniel Russell House. History Nathaniel Russell (1738-1820) originally from Rhode Island, settled in Charleston in 1765, becoming a prosperous shipping merchant and slave trader. In 1788, Russell married Sarah Hopton (1752-1832), a member of one of Charleston's wealthiest families at the age of 50, and two daughters were born soon after, Alicia in 1789 and Sarah in 1792. As one of the wealthiest citizens in Charleston, Nathaniel Russell sought to build a more prestigious home to display his prominence in the city. Construction began on the house in 1803, and the Federal style house was completed five years later, when 70-year-old Nathaniel, his family and 16 enslaved moved into the house. The house remained in the Russell family until 1857 when it was purchased by Robert Allston (1801-1864), a successful rice planter who lived in the mansion while he was governor of South Carolina. In 1870, his executors sold it to the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy where it served as a boarding school from 1870 through 1905, upon which the mansion was converted back to a private residence by the Mullally and Pelzer families. In 1955, when it became apparent that the garden may be subdivided after the house had languished on the market for two years, the Historic Charleston Foundation was created to preserve the property. Within 30 days, the Foundation was able to raise the $65,000 needed to purchase the property, and opened the house for public tours soon after. In 1995, the Historic Charleston Foundation embarked on a multi-year study and restoration of the mansion to return the interior finishes and architectural details to how it looked when first built. Grants and donations have enabled the acquisition of a significant collection of objects with Charleston provenance, to allow the Foundation to interpret Charleston's merchant elite in the early 19th century. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973, and is today a popular attraction in Charleston.

Some instances of this misspelling are huaru (varu), hustr/huastr (austr or vestr), hut (ut) and Huikiar (the personal name Vig√¶ir). The loss of the initial h phoneme before vowels and its use in the beginning of words where it usually does not appear is a dialect trait still typical of Roslagen (eastern Uppland),The article Uppland, subsection dialekter, in Nationalencyklopedin (1996). where √ñpir was active. However, recent research presents him as a consistent and careful speller with very few language errors, and based on this reinterpretation of his language skills, the different ways he spelled his own name have led to a hypothesis that there were two runemasters named √ñpir. Signed inscriptions With the question regarding whether there was more than one runemaster named √ñpir, one scholar accepted the following 46 signed inscriptions as being made by √ñpir: S√∂ 308 in Vid J√§rnav√§gen, U 23 in Hillesh√∂gs, U 36 in Svartsj√∂ Djurg√•rd, U 104 in Eds, U 118 in √Ñlvsunda, the now-lost U 122 in J√§rva Krog, U 142 in F√§llbro, the now-lost U 168 in Bj√∂rkeby, U 179 in Riala, U 181 in √ñsseby-Garn, U 210 in √Östa, U 229 in G√§llsta, the now-lost U 262 in Fresta, U 279 in Sk√§lby, U 287 and U 288 in Vik, U 307 in Ekeby, the now-lost U 315 in Harg, U 462 in Pr√§stg√•rden, U 485 in Marma, U 489 in Morby, U 541 and U 544 in Husby- Lyhundra, the now-lost U 565 in Ekeby Skog, U 566 in V√§llings√∂, U 687 in Sjusta, U 880 in Skogstibble, U 893 in H√∂gby, U 898 in Norby, U 922 and now- lost U 926 in Uppsala Cathedral, U 961 in Vaksala, U 970 in Bolsta, U 973 in Gr√§nby, the now-lost U 984 in Ekeby, U 993 in Brunnby, U 1034 in Tensta, U 1063 in K√§llsl√§tt, U 1072 in B√§linge, U 1100 in Sundbro, U 1106 in √Ñskelunda, U 1159 in Skensta, U 1177 in H√§sselby, U Fv1948;168 in Alsike, U Fv1976;107 at Uppsalla Cathedral, and the now-lost Gs 4 in Hedesunda. p. 31. Rundata lists three additional inscriptions: U 896 in H√•ga and U 940 in Uppsala, both of which have text stating that √ñpir \\"arranged the runes,\\" and U 1022 in Storvreta. It has been suggested that these three inscriptions represent works from the beginning of √ñpir's career. Another inscription that listed by Rundata, S√∂ 11 in Gryts, is indicated as being signed by a second person named √ñpir. Possible identification with Russian priest A record of –£–ø–∏—Ä—å (Upir‚Ä≤) appears in a document dated 1047 AD. It is a colophon in a manuscript of the Book of Psalms written by a priest who transcribed the book from Glagolitic into Cyrillic for the Novgorodian Prince Vladimir Yaroslavovich.http://www.stsl.ru/manuscripts/book.php?col=1&manuscript;=089 The original manuscript, –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∏ 16 –ü—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤ —Ç–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤—ã—è The priest writes that his name is \\"Upir‚Ä≤ Likhyi \\" (–£–ø–∏—Ä—å –õ–∏—Ö—ã–π), which would mean something like \\"Wicked Vampire\\" or \\"Foul Vampire.\\" This apparently strange name has been cited as an example of surviving paganism and/or of the use of nicknames as personal names. However, in 1982, Swedish Slavicist Anders Sj√∂berg suggested that \\"Upir‚Ä≤ likhyi\\" was in fact an Old Russian transcription and/or translation of the name of Ofeigr √ñpir.Pop Upir' Lichoj and the Swedish rune-carver Ofeigr Upir. Scando-Slavica, Volume 28, Issue 1 1982, pp. 109-124. Sj√∂berg argued that √ñpir could possibly have lived in Novgorod before moving to Sweden, considering the connection between Eastern Scandinavia and Kievan Rus' at the time. This theory is still controversial, although at least one Swedish historian, Henrik Janson, has expressed support for it.

The website provides comprehensive reviews of digital cameras, lenses and accessories, buying guides, user reviews, and forums for individual cameras, as well as general photography forums. The website also has a database with information about individual digital cameras, lenses, printers and imaging applications. Originally based in London, Digital Photography Review and most of its team relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 2010. It is currently owned by Amazon. DPReview is one of the top 1,500 most visited websites on the Internet, according to Alexa Internet.  Main features  DPReview has regularly published thorough, technically orientated camera reviews since the website launched in 1998. The content and scope of the reviews have changed over time, but the basic formula (extensive descriptions of controls and menus, consistent, repeatable studio tests, side-by-side pixel-level comparisons) has remained unchanged since the earliest days. In 2004, a shorter \\"concise\\" review format was introduced for compact cameras, and group tests were added in 2008. The website's camera reviews have always offered side-by-side comparison images and test results from competing cameras. In 2010, an interactive comparison widget was introduced that allowed visitors to compare studio results from any camera in the site's database. Later widgets added the ability to compare other test results (such as noise and dynamic range) between cameras. Extensive real-world sample galleries are available for all reviewed (and some unreviewed) cameras and lenses. Until February 2010, DPReview did not score cameras numerically, but used an often controversial six-level rating system (from best to worst: Highly Recommended, Recommended, Above Average, Average, Below Average, Poor). The site now scores all cameras and lenses using up to 11 categories (which in turn are based on \\"nearly 60 aspects of camera performance and specification\\"). Two new discretionary awards ('Gold' and 'Silver') were introduced at the same time as the scoring system. DPReview introduced lens reviews in 2008. Although the vast majority of its published reviews are of digital cameras, DPReview also publishes occasional reviews of printers, software, photography books, accessories and mobile imaging devices. DPReview has a database of digital cameras, lenses, printers and desktop imaging software packages. Camera product pages contain full specifications, product and sample images, user reviews and links to other internal and external resources. The product database offers browse, search and compare features. DPReview has discussion forums and also commenting (on some, but not all content types), user-created articles and product reviews, photographic challenges and free personal galleries. A simple personal messaging system is available to registered users. DPReview publishes occasional non-review articles, covering imaging science and technology, photographic techniques, interviews with photographers and industry figures, and buying guides. In 2012, DPReview added a Link Directory that allows registered users to view and subscribe to RSS and Twitter updates from external resources without leaving the site.  Ownership history  Digital Photography Review was founded in December 1998 in the United Kingdom by Philip and Joanna Askey. On May 14, 2007, it was acquired by Amazon. DPReview employs a dedicated editorial team of in-house and freelance writers, and is editorially independent of Amazon.https://www.dpreview.com/about The original founder, Phil Askey, is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the site.

The range lies just south of a westerly excursion of the Continental Divide of the Americas; it lies on the eastern perimeter of the extensive, narrow, and north-south Playas Valley, and is the center range of three mostly arid, low to moderate-elevation ranges that lie on the valley's east perimeter. The mountain range lies in the extreme northwest of the Chihuahuan Desert. Description The range is 18 mi long and only about 8 mi wide. It trends northwest by southeast as does the Alamo Hueco Mountains to the south; the Little Hatchet Mountains bordering the range northwest, trend similarly, but have a more true north traverse. =Geology, ecology, and access= Geologically this range is part of the Basin and Range Province which spans much of the southwestern U.S. and parts of northern Mexico. It is a fault-block range made up of Paleozoic limestone and Cretaceous shale and sandstones.Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, Ecologically, the Big Hatchet Mountains lie near the Chihuahuan Desert and the Sonoran Desert, but their large relief provides many ecological niches more in keeping with the mountains to the north. Notable inhabitants include bats, raptors, bighorn sheep, and javelina. The Big Hatchet Mountains are far from population centers, and have no paved road access or developed recreation sites; they therefore see little recreational activity other than long-distance hikers who are either starting or completing the Continental Divide Trail. However, the standard route on the peak, along the South Ridge from Thompson Canyon, is straightforward. =Highpoints= The highest peak in the range, Big Hatchet Peak, ,New Mexico, DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 52-53. is at the northwest terminus of the range; the peak is located at . Another peak anchors the southeast terminus of the range, New Well Peak, at . Continental Divide National Scenic Trail The Continental Divide lies north of the Big Hatchet Mountains and traverses the northern Playas Valley on its water divide. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT) is routed through the Big Hatchet's on two alternative trails, one at the center and the other in the north; also subtrails lead off in a southeasterly direction. The main traverse of the CDT exits from the southwest quarter of the range, to meet the northwest end of the Alamo Hueco Mountains.

The ship was bound for Chicago with a cargo of Christmas trees when it foundered off Two Rivers, Wisconsin, killing all on board. The legacy of the schooner lives on in the area, with frequent ghost sightings and tourist attractions whereby its final route is traced.Jacobson-Tews, Lori. Pier Wisconsin. \\"The Story of the Rouse Simmons\\". Accessed 12 January 2007.Boaters Dream, 25 November 2002. \\"'Christmas Ship,' sunk in gale, has historical ties to Muskegon\\". Accessed 12 January 2007. It was known as The Christmas Tree Ship and was one of many schooners to transport Christmas trees across the lake. However, with railroads, highways, and tree farms proving much more economical, the tree-shipping industry was on a steep decline and they had stopped sailing by 1920. History The Rouse Simmons was built in Milwaukee in 1868 by Allan, McClelland, & Company, and named after a Kenosha businessman Rouse Simmons. The schooner was soon purchased by wealthy lumber magnate Charles H. Hackley of Muskegon, Michigan and joined his sizeable fleet. Hackley's ships served across most of Lake Michigan's coastline, and the Rouse Simmons became a workhorse, shipping lumber from company mills to several ports around the lake for around 20 years. At its peak the schooner was making almost weekly runs between Grand Haven and Chicago.Longacre, Glenn V., Prologue Winter 2006. \\"The Christmas Tree Ship: Captain Herman E. Schuenemann and the Schooner Rouse Simmons\\". Accessed 12 January 2007. After its service for Hackley the ship exchanged hands several times. Many similar schooners were also frequently sold and they became known as \\"tramp ships\\". In 1910 Herman Schuenemann bought an interest in the ship, expanding that to an eighth in 1912. The other shares were owned by Captain Charles Nelson of Chicago, who owned one eighth and would sail alongside Schuenemann on the fatal journey, and three fourths (the commanding share) were owned by Mannes J. Bonner, a businessman from St. James, Michigan. =The \\"Christmas Tree Ship\\"= Recovered Christmas tree from the shipwreck The Schuenemann brothers, Herman and August, had been trading Christmas trees in Chicago since around the start of the 20th century. August died in November 1898 aboard the S. Thal - a 52-ton, two-masted schooner - when it sank in a storm near Glencoe, Illinois. His younger brother continued the family business. While many rival traders had sold to wholesalers and local grocers, Schuenemann sold directly to Chicago residents at dockside by Clark Street Bridge. By cutting out the middleman in this way the trees could be sold cheaply while still making a profit. The venture used the slogan \\"Christmas Tree Ship: My Prices are the Lowest\\", with electric Christmas lights and a tree atop the main mast. The trees were sold for between 50 cents and $1, but Herman Schuenemann, affectionately known as \\"Captain Santa\\", also gave away some of the trees to needy families. =Final journey= Schuenemann loaded the schooner with 5,500 trees from Thompson Harbor near Manistique, Michigan and planned to make the week-long journey to Chicago. The difficult weather had discouraged his competitors from making their own journeys, and snow had covered the tree farms in Michigan and Wisconsin.United States Environmental Protection Agency, 9 March 2006. \\"The Fate of the Christmas Tree Ship\\". Accessed 12 January 2007. He hoped that the resultant shortage of Christmas trees would lead to a huge profit and solve his financial problems. Already by 1912, November had a reputation for especially violent storms on the Great Lakes. November 1912, however, had been relatively quiet, with only one significant storm so far, which affected especially southeastern Michigan and northwestern Ohio. (The reports that say another storm had already taken many lives and ships that month are erroneous, confusing 1912 with the Big Blow of 1913.) Still, a second storm was brewing. The conditions of the day were very poor, with many ships anchoring in port for shelter to avoid being battered by the 60 mph winds that could be anticipated in a November gale. Local legends say that some sailors refused to board the ship and that the vessel was unseaworthy. Two years previous the schooner had been towed to port by The Grand Haven Tribune after it was found riding low in the water. Despite this the journey began at noon, with trees crammed into every possible corner of the ship. The weight of the trees was far above recommendations, especially in the bad winter weather, and was certainly going to contribute to the tragedy. During the night, with storms hitting the Simmons hard, two sailors were sent to check the lashings on deck. Both seamen were swept overboard by a giant wave that collected them, many bundled trees, and a small boat. Now that the schooner was slightly lighter and more maneuverable, Captain Schuenemann directed it towards Bailey's Harbor. Suddenly, and tragically, the storms worsened; ice formed on the sodden trees and winds battered the hull. When the Kewaunee Life Saving Station spotted the Rouse Simmons on 23 November 1912 it was low in the water with tattered sails, flying its flag at half mast to signal that it was in distress. Logs from the station show that a surfman spotted the Simmons at 2:50pm and alerted station keeper Nelson Craite. Craite found that the station's gas tugboat had left earlier in the day and, at 3:10pm, Craite telephoned the nearest other Station. George E. Sogge of Two Rivers, located just south of Kewaunee, sent out the power boat Tuscarora on a rescue mission, but the Simmons was not seen again. The Simmons was not the only ship to go down during the storm, with the South Shore, the Three Sisters, and the Two Brothers suffering similar fates. =Wreck and debris= Michigan State Historic Site marker in Thompson Township, Michigan where the Rouse Simmons departed on its final voyage A message in a bottle from the Rouse Simmons washed onto the shore at Sheboygan. It had been corked using a small piece of cut pine tree and, other than the occasional trees caught in fishing nets, was the only remains of the vessel discovered for many years. The message read: In December 1912 Christmas Trees and wreckage were reported ashore at Pentwater, MichiganWilmar Tribune December 11, 1912 page 10 In 1924 a fishing net trawled up a wallet belonging to Captain Schuenemann. The wallet, well preserved because it was wrapped in oilskin, contained business cards, a newspaper clipping and an expense memorandum.Jacobson-Tews, Lori. Pier Wisconsin. \\"The Story of the Rouse Simmons (page 5)\\". Accessed 12 January 2007. In 1971 the wreck itself was discovered by scuba diver Gordon Kent Bellrichard from Milwaukee. Bellrichard was searching for the Vernon, a 177-foot, 700-ton steamer that had sunk in a storm in October 1887, and had been told about an area in which local fishermen had frequently snagged their nets. When his sonar appeared to have located something he dived down to a shipwreck on the bed of the lake 172 feet below. Despite his light failing, Bellrichard managed to survey the wreckage with his hands and concluded that he had instead found the Simmons. A forensic study of the wreck suggested that the ship had steerage and was sailing for shelter when it sank. The mizzen mast snapped off above the deck and the upper portion was not located. The main mast was found forward and to the port side of the wreck with the base missing. The foremast is intact and lies nearly parallel but on top of the main mast suggesting at least one of these masts fell out of the mast step as the ship went down. Many of the trees are still in the ship's hold, though two were extracted and shown as exhibits. Several items recovered from the Rouse Simmons are now housed in Rogers Street Fishing Village Museum in Two Rivers, including the ship's wheel. The ship's anchor was retrieved and now stands at the entrance to the Milwaukee Yacht Club. The remains of the wreck are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Legacy= The Christmas Tree Ship lived on through Schuenemann's wife, Barbara, and their two daughters. However, in the latter years they chose to transport the trees by train and merely used a boat as a platform for sale. The practice of transporting trees by schooner ceased in 1920, and the increasing popularity of railways, highways and tree farms soon made it easier and more affordable for everyone to buy a tree.Jacobson-Tews, Lori.

It is the fourth and final film in the Thief in the Night series, based on an evangelical interpretation of Bible prophecy and the rise of the Antichrist. Unlike the other films in the series that were filmed in Iowa, this one was filmed in New Mexico. Plot During the final years of the Antichrist's reign, a nuclear war has devastated the earth. The Antichrist and his world government find their grip on power slowly slipping away as Jesus Christ's return draws near. One of the lead characters from the previous film, David Michaels (played by William Wellman Jr.), is now part of a growing underground movement of Christian believers trying to stay out of the government's hands and thus escape execution. The government is using underground agents to infiltrate this movement. David's mission is to take an RV across a nuclear-devastated landscape to Albuquerque, where he will meet with other underground believers to await Jesus Christ's final return. The earth by this time is populated by doomsday people, mutants as a result of the nuclear exchanges. After rescuing one of them, Jimmy, David leads him to Jesus Christ. Jimmy later bravely dies to save the others from Jerry, and leaves Jerry their temporary captive. Connie Wright (played by Terri Lynn Hall) is a government agent pretending to be a Christian. She rescues David from his internment at UNITE, then tries to get David to reveal the believers' secret hideout. Along the way, they rescue Linda and her daughter, Jody. Linda is a scientific researcher, brilliant, but terrified. Jody is a spoiled brat who, after being told off by Jimmy, begins to change. She even starts to slowly accept David's preaching. The same cannot be said of Linda, who is too rational a scientist to accept David's faith. But Linda is actually evidence of divine providence, because her scientific specialty is radiation. So as they travel through the war-ravaged nation, Linda's knowledge keeps them alive and provides crucial guidance. She feels guilty, though, because she was part of the team that helped create the mutant doomsday people. David suspects Linda of being a spy, since it seems that government agents always know where they are. But Linda is the only trustworthy one: Jody is discovered to have been transmitting their position inadvertently, and Connie did so deliberately. Connie is later picked up by a senior UNITE officer (dubbed \\"General Goon\\" by David in Image of the Beast). They are soon killed as their van goes out of control and runs into a train. At the end of the movie, Jody accepts Jesus Christ as her Savior, while Linda still thinks about the matter, or at least she does not yet openly receive Jesus Christ on camera. Meanwhile, a badly wounded and sobbing Jerry is shown in the ruins of the UNITE military base, which is then destroyed by explosions, but not before he rips off his UNITE armband in disgust.

The film premiered on TNT on January 10, 1999. It focuses on a gang of outlaws who find their way to a hidden valley and a peaceful town where residents shun swearing, alcohol, guns and any kind of violence but resemble dead Western heroes. The outcome is marked by its exploration of the interface between legend-making and humanitarian values. Plot A murderous outlaw band led by Blackjack Britton and Cavin Guthrie robs a bank. During the subsequent gunfight, a prostitute named Dolly Sloan is shot and dies in the arms of Cavin's nephew, Sonny. The gang flees, pursued by a posse, and manages to escape through a dust storm, following a tunnel into a green valley. The town of Refuge welcomes them, but they are puzzled by the residents, who do not carry guns or swear, and who flock to the church whenever the bell tolls. The youngest gang member, Sonny, thinks he recognizes some of them. He befriends a woman named Rose who deflects his questions and asks some pointed ones of her own, beginning with ‚ÄúHow many men have you killed?‚Äù The rest of the outlaws occupy the saloon and begin causing trouble. One of the gang members is struck by lightning when he prepares to throw his knife at the church. His body is carried away by a Native American, who guards the gates to a mist-filled property outside of town. As Sonny investigates further, he realizes that the town appears to be occupied by former notorious gunfighters. These include Wild Bill Hickok, the town's Sheriff, Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday, although they deny their identities to Sonny. Later he talks to a gardener named Lamb whom he prompts to admit who he really is. Before Sonny can ask more questions, some of Blackjack's men tear up Lamb's garden. Enraged, he beats one to death with his shovel and is led away by the mysterious Gatekeeper. While talking to Doc, Sonny lets slip the true nature of their gang and the Sheriff asks them to saddle up and leave town. Blackjack orders all his men to assemble in the saloon except Sonny, who is ejected (but sneaks in anyway) and overhears the gang members planning to rob the town on their way out, while Cavin plans to rape Rose. Sonny joins the others in church, where he begs them to defend themselves. The townspeople finally admit to Sonny that Refuge is a form of Purgatory. If they can go ten years while resisting the temptations of their former lives they are admitted to Heaven. They don't want to face off against Blackjack's gang because they fear it will cost them their souls. A frustrated Sonny leaves the church and is jumped by Blackjack and Cavin, who beat him unconscious. The next morning, a battered Sonny straps on his guns and prepares to face Blackjack's gang alone. The townspeople are summoned by the church bells, but while most of them comply, Hickok, Holliday, James, and Billy all join Sonny, inspired by his willingness to die to protect Rose. A shootout erupts, during which Blackjack's gang are all slaughtered, but Cavin manages to shoot Sonny before being killed by him in return. Sonny, despite being fatally wounded, does not feel pain and does not die. Hickok welcomes him to Refuge, realizing that Sonny has earned his second chance. When Blackjack arrives and challenges Hickok, he loses. \\"I guess I'm one of you now,\\" Blackjack jokes, realizing the truth of the situation. \\"I wouldn't count on it,\\" Hickok replies before finally dispatching Blackjack. The Gatekeeper carries the bodies of Cavin and Blackjack to the edge of a fiery pit, into which they are thrown screaming. Hickok and the others grimly follow, but the stagecoach arrives and the driver tells them that by their willingness to sacrifice their souls to protect the others, they have secured a place in Heaven. \\"The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind,\\" he says. Sonny asks to stay behind with Rose, and Hickok hands him the Sheriff's badge. The coach then leaves, riding upwards into the light.

S.

Kramer, ‚ÄúTNT Rides Again‚Äù, Chicago Tribune Chicago Tribune, 10 January 1999 It was Edel's involvement in directing which convinced Sam Shepard to agree to star, feeling that as a European Edel would bring different ideas to the film. Shepard described the filming as difficult because of the short shooting schedule available. Brad Fiedel had worked with Uli Edel previously and the two agreed that the film's music should \\"support the classic western elements of the project and not overplay the otherworldly elements so that the audience could enjoy discovering the strangeness of what was really going on in this seemingly normal town without the score telegraphing it too much\\".Classic Western Meets the Twilight Zone, Brad Fiedel site Reception Purgatory was first aired by TNT Network on January 10, 1999. The movie was advertised and marketed as \\"Not your ordinary damn western\\".Poster at Philadelphia Inquirer, 10 Jan 1999, Page 501 Variety gave the film a positive review, praising the story and Sam Shepard's performance in particular.Ray Richmond, Variety, January 7, 1999 The New York Times Anita Gates was also enthusiastic about this ‚Äúfascinating, deceptively dark western with more than a touch of The Twilight Zone, observing that ‚ÄúGordon Dawson's script makes the process satisfying despite the fact that any viewer who has noticed the title of the film knows the answer from the beginning‚Äù. When it was shown in Britain, Radio Times described the film as ‚Äúa barmy but richly enjoyable western fable‚Äù. Hugh H. Davis later provided a chapter examining Purgatory's surreal and religious themes in the compilation Undead in the West. This is a wry meditation on the changes rung on legend in the film, where the heroes portrayed had already been immortalized by reputation while still alive; now they are ‚Äòdead‚Äô they must earn their immortal redemption by giving up everything that had earned them their reputation in the first place. Parallels are also drawn between the dime novels that contributed to the making of the Western legends, of which Sonny Dillard is an avid reader, and the celluloid embroidering of the same legends. High Noon in particular, the prototype of the climactic final shootout, had gone through many variations in later films, and references to several of these exist in Purgatory. But informing everything else there is Dante's Purgatorio, the theology of which permeates Uli Edel's film, according to Davis.Scarecrow Press, 2012, \\"Moving West and Beyond: Life in the Midst of Death in Purgatory\\", chapter 14, pp.220-36 References External links * Category:1999 television films Category:1999 films Category:1990s Western (genre) films Category:Weird West Category:American films Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid Category:Cultural depictions of Jesse James Category:Cultural depictions of Doc Holliday Category:Cultural depictions of Wild Bill Hickok Category:English-language films Category:1990s fantasy films Category:Films directed by Uli Edel Category:Films set in ghost towns Category:TNT Network original films Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel Category:Purgatory in fiction ","title":"Purgatory (1999 film)"},{"id":"8893831","text":"Bourne College was a Primitive Methodist college at Quinton, near Birmingham, England. Establishment Like its elder sister, Elmfield College in York, Bourne College was established as a school for the sons of Primitive Methodists, beginning its life in 1876 in the redundant Roman Catholic St Chad‚Äôs Grammar School in Summer Hill, Birmingham, but soon outgrowing that accommodation and moving to at Quinton. =Location= This location was chosen, according to the inaugural speech of Rev George Middleton, FGS, the first governor of Bourne College (a post in which he combined the duties of chaplain, bursar, caretaker and general handyman) for one prime reason - students would have plenty of fresh and pure water, and would be removed from the temptations of town life, which would form one of the greatest encouragements to their parents, who were naturally anxious that their sons should be preserved from corrupting associations.Birmingham Faces & Places; Vol. 4 No. 7, 01.11.1891. =Formation= A company was formed, with a capital of ¬£25,000 in 5,000 shares of ¬£5, its object to establish a college or school chiefly for the education under sound Protestant religious influences of young gentlemen. Messrs D. Smith & Sons of Birmingham were appointed architects, E. Walton of Smethwick was awarded the building contract and on 6 June 1881 the foundation stones for the Queen Anne style building, its principal entrance in a 60-foot clocktower, were laid. Bourne College, which opened in Quinton in 1882, took its name from Hugh Bourne (1772‚Äì1852) one of the founders of Primitive Methodism, who had visited the village on a number of occasions in the mid-nineteenth century. The buildings themselves were extensive. A school room, dining room, class room, piano rooms, a large chemical laboratory, lavatory and cloak room are on the ground floor; the first floor being devoted to three large dormitories, bath rooms and lavatories. The servants' department consists of a large kitchen with serving room and scullery attached, servants‚Äô hall, various store rooms, pantries and dairy on the ground floor, and bedrooms occupying the first floor. Adjoining the College is the Governor‚Äôs house. Apartments are arranged for the sick and for the repairing of clothes. A spacious kitchen court contains the laundry, wash- house and engine house, and a large drying-ground and covered playground are provided. Water is obtained from a well and pumped into a tank in the roof over the bath room and the College is warmed by hot water apparatus. =First Headmaster= R.G. Heys was appointed Bourne College‚Äôs first headmaster during its Summer Hill incarnation, and was replaced in 1883 by Thomas James Stewart Hooson, who had been an assistant master since 1878 and became headmaster of Bourne College when he was not quite twenty-one. After the retirement of Rev. George Middleton, he combined the roles of headmaster and governor until his retirement coincided with the closure of the college in 1928. Both George Middleton and Stewart Hooson are buried in Quinton churchyard and Hooson is commemorated in the mis-spelt Hoosen Close on the Bourne College site. Impact The impact of Bourne College upon the insular community of Quinton‚Äôs farm labourers, shop keepers and small-time metal workers was enormous. As its arrival brought new talent and new blood into the village, there was a very real sense in which it also brought the world to Quinton. During the forty-seven years of its existence in Quinton, some 39 Quinton boys attended the College, in company with 1,159 boys not from Quinton. They came from Welshpool to Warrington; from Berwick-on-Tweed to Redruth and from parts of the world as diverse as France, British Guinea, Fernando Po, from where Rev Napoleon Barleycorn sent his sons to Quinton to be educated. Academics At Bourne College boys studied everything from book-keeping to botany, from chemistry to carpentry and from elocution to electricity. Here they exercised. Much interest is attached to games, with the conviction that proper physical culture is not only a source of pleasure and an auxiliary to health, but is a stimulus to the intellect.Bourne College Prospectus Care is taken to provide a good substantial diet. Boys may be supplied with ham or other meat for breakfast at a charge of 25/- per term and day pupils may have dinners at 9d each and slept in a light, lofty and well-ventilated dormitory. A thorough system of baths and lavatories is also provided and all, in the early days, for only twenty four guineas per term. Closing of School In the years immediately following the First World War, numbers at Bourne College went into a sharp decline, as the increasing provision of state secondary education reduced the need for minor public schools. The College went into voluntary liquidation, the contents of the building were auctioned in March 1929, by Edward Stevens & Champion, scholarships transferred to Elmfield and the buildings acquired by the Board of the Birmingham Guardians of the Poor, being subsequently refurbished as Quinton Hall, a home for aged men.

LCSW entered the London Regional Transport market, winning several contracts using second-hand Leyland Atlanteans from Greater Glasgow, GM Buses and Busways, where deregulation was making the major fleets dispose of large numbers of surplus vehicles.London routes farmed out Commercial Motor 30 March 1989 page 19 LCSW then purchased new buses, with a batch of Dennis Dominators purchased for route 131,New orders in for Dominators Commercial Motor 30 June 1988 page 21 later followed by thirteen 88-seater East Lancs bodied Volvo Citybuses, entered service at Addlestone garage in September 1989, displacing Leyland Atlanteans. In 1989, the airport coach operations at Crawley and Staines had been split off as Speedlink Airport Services. Additionally the private hire fleet was consolidated into Guildford and re-branded Countryliner. A new garage was opened in Newington Butts, near Elephant & Castle for the operation of London Regional Transport tendered route 78 and part of route 176, this was later moved to the more suitable ex London Transport Walworth garage. Following LCSW successfully tendering to operate route 320 from Westerham to Bromley, buses were outstationed at Kentish Bus' Dunton Green garage from 1 September 1990. Garages at the time were Crawley, Dorking, Guildford, Leatherhead, Staines, Reigate, Addlestone, Chelsham and Godstone, as well as an outstation of Crawley at Broadbridge Heath. In 1990, to cater for an increase in tendered London Regional Transport services, a new Beddington Road garage was built, with Chelsham and Godstone closing. Acquisitions of London & Country during 1989-1995 were: *Horsham Buses and their garage at Warnham. *Gem Fairtax, mainly based at Crawley. *The former Alder Valley operations and garages at Cranleigh, Guildford and Woking which were rebranded West Surrey Buses and later Guildford & West Surrey.History - South East Arriva *Blue Saloon ABC Taxis of Slyfield, Guildford was acquired and merged with the Countryliner fleet. *AML Coaches, a small operator based in Hounslow and their garage and some buses were retained for a time. *As well as Scarlett Coaches of Minehead (1992-94), Stanbridge & Crichel/Oakfield Tarvel of Dorset (1992-93), Southend Transport, Colchester Borough Transport and District Bus of Essex and a small coach operator in North London.

Rationale The rationale for public participation in patent- application reviews is that knowledgeable persons in fields that are relevant to a particular patent application will provide useful information to patent examiners if the proper forum is provided. One model for such a forum is a wiki model where the public may submit the prior art and commentary that are relevant to a given patent application, and patent examiners can consult that forum. The intended effect is that patent examination will be more efficient and thorough so that the patents that are issued will be of a higher quality than is currently possible.Schecter, Manny, Open Collaboration Is Medicine for Our Ailing Patent System , BNA's Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal, Vol. 72, No. 1789, pp. 682-685, Oct. 20, 2006. History In the 17th and 18th centuries, patent examination in France for novelty and utility was performed by the private French Academy under commission from the French government. The Academy sought the input of outside experts in the specific fields of the inventions. Galileo, for example, was consulted when a patent was applied for regarding a new method of determining longitude according to the position of the moon. Galileo's conclusion is that the method would work in principle, but the measuring techniques are not accurate enough to provide meaningful results; therefore, the patent was denied. Legal constraints =United States= In the United States, the third parties may not provide commentary or opinions directly to a patent examiner during the prosecution of a patent unless the patent applicant gives the examiner written permission to do so. Rule 99, which previously allowed a member of the public to submit prior art to an examiner within two months of an application publication, has been repealed by the AIA. Rules 290 (37 CFR 1.290) and 35 USC 122(e) control the submission of prior-art references by third parties after the publication of an application and before the issuance of the patent. The cited prior-art references must be dated at least six months from the date of the publication, the first rejection of any claim, or the notice of allowance. History =Observations by third parties= The European Patent Convention (EPC) provides for that any person may submit observations concerning the patentability of an invention described in a European patent application. This is a form of public participation to patent examination. Filing observations by third parties at the European Patent Office (EPO) is free of charge, but the observations must include a statement of grounds. The statement of grounds must be in English, French or German.: \\"Observations by third parties\\". The person filing the observations does not become party to the proceedings. In the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), third parties may submit prior art relevant to a published patent application within two months of said publication or before a notice of allowance is given, whichever comes first. In contrast to European practice, however, third parties are not allowed to provide any additional explanation of the relevance of the prior art. The USPTO requires a fee. Some countries such as Australia can only accept but not grant patents after examination. The accepted patent is then advertised and public comment is sought. After the lapsing of a certain period (90 days in Australia) with no comment the patent is granted. Australia Patents Act 1990. Accessed October 6, 2012. In July 2012, a third party observation system was also introduced for Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. The observations have to relate to novelty and inventive step, and they may be submitted anonymously. The observations can be made at any time from the publication of the PCT application until the expiration of 28 months from the priority date. No fee is due for filing the observations.Practical Advice, Making third party observations, PCT Newsletter, July‚ÄìAugust 2012, No. 07-08/2012, pp. 17-19. = Wiki review = The review of patent and patent applications through wiki projects was proposed in 2005 by patent attorney J. Matthew Buchanan on his blog. A subsequent proposal was made in Fortune magazine in 2006.Nicholas Varchaver, Patent review goes Wiki, Fortune, VOL. 154, NO. 4 - August 21, 2006 The claimed purpose is the improvement of the quality of the patent examination, as well as any re-examinations, through the involvement of the public, to help identify any relevant prior art. The USPTO has endorsed some of these projects. According to Dave Kappos, former vice president for intellectual- property law at IBM, and later head of the USPTO, \\"it's a very powerful concept because it leverages the enormous capabilities of the entire world of technical talent.\\" Wikipedia itself has been used by the U.S. patent examiners as a reference to get a \\"quick outline of an unfamiliar topic\\". Citations of Wikipedia as prior art, however, are not allowed in the U.S. due to the fluid and open nature of its editing. Nonetheless, in the related area of trademark examination, entries from Wikipedia have been cited in precedential opinions by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO. Blackboard patent Wikipedia has also been used to collect early references related to controversial patents. History of virtual learning environments, for example, is an article that was created primarily to list prior art that would potentially invalidate , \\"Internet-based education support system and methods\\". This patent issued to Blackboard Inc. in June 2000. The Moodle wiki has a similar page. Once the patent was issued, Blackboard Inc. sued its competitor Desire2Learn to stop them from infringing the patent. In July 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that all of the claims of the Blackboard patent were invalid either for being too vague or for being already in practice before Blackboard filed their application. Blackboard, however, has four continuation applications pending where it can correct the deficiencies in its claims and get new patents to issue. While the lawsuit was moving forward, the Software Freedom Law Center filed for a reexamination citing that new prior art had been discovered that raised a substantial new question of validity. The USPTO agreed and the patent is currently undergoing reexamination. USPTO community patent review (Peer to Patent) On June 15, 2007, the United States Patent and Trademark Office began a two-year pilot community patent review called Peer to patent or Community Patent Review. The program organizers anticipate having 250 pending software patent applications reviewed by members of the interested public. They can submit prior art along with commentary and vote on the most relevant prior art. Four months after a patent application is posted the most relevant prior art is provided to the patent examiner. In the first five months of the program, over 20 applications have been opened to the public and 8 have completed reviews. Over 28,000 site visits have been recorded. 1,600 reviewers from more than 100 different countries have registered. Over one hundred thirty potential prior art references have been submitted. General Electric, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle Corporation each have volunteered some of their pending patent applications for review. Patent examiners will have access to the commentary and will consider it in their examination. Applications that are part of the pilot program will get accelerated examination. Of the first 19 office actions received by Peer-to-Patent applications, 5 cited the prior art submitted by reviewers. A new pilot started on October 25, 2010, and will continue until September 30, 2011. IP.Com PatentDebate IP.com PatentDebate is a blog-type Website were the public can comment on all pending published U.S. patent applications. User registration is required. Unlike Peer to Patent, however, there is no formal relationship between the USPTO and PatentDebate. The site is sponsored at least in part by advertising. Post issuance review =Article One Partners= Article One Partners provides a community review format for enlisting members of the public to search for prior art for already issued patents. These patents are generally the subject of ongoing litigation. Anyone who signs up can earn cash rewards if they submit the most relevant prior art.

His oldest maternal uncle, traditionally the most important mentor to a boy child, was Greenwood LeFlore, the chief of the Choctaw. Harkins learned from both his cultures but identified as Choctaw first and foremost. Harkins was educated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. He earned a law degree from Cumberland University. Marriage and family Harkins married Salina Gardner and Lily Folsom, Daughter of Chief David Folsom and Rhoda Nail.

All belonged to their mother's clans and gained status in the tribe through them.\\"Descendants of John Harkins\\", Family TreeMaker, Genealogy.com Career In October 1830, the national council deposed Greenwood LeFlore as chief after he signed the treaty for removal. It elected Harkins, who belonged to the same clan and was a nephew of LeFlore through his mother. In the Choctaw matrilineal system, the mother's clan was the one that was most important to a person's status. To proceed with Indian Removal, President Andrew Jackson refused to recognize Harkins's authority with the tribe.The Choctaw of Oklahoma (Durant, OK: Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, 2003) After Indian Removal, Harkins rose in influence in the tribe. In 1834, he was elected judge of the Red River District in Indian Territory. The council of chiefs of the Indian District elected him as principal chief of the District (one of three in the Choctaw Nation), where he served from 1850 to 1857. The districts represented the longstanding geographic and political divisions that had existed in the tribe in the Southeast. Gradually, in Indian Territory, they became less important.

Moral entrepreneurs are those who take the lead in labeling a particular behaviour and spreading or popularizing this label throughout society. This can include attributing negative labels to behaviour as well as the removal of negative labels, positively labeling, or removing positive labels. The moral entrepreneur may press for the creation or enforcement of a norm for any number of reasons, altruistic or selfish. Such individuals or groups also hold the power to generate moral panic; similarly multiple moral entrepreneurs may have conflicting goals and work to counteract each other. Some examples of moral entrepreneurs are: MADD (mothers against drunk driving), the anti-tobacco lobby, the gun control lobby, anti-pornography groups, LGBT social movements, and the pro-life and pro-choice movements (an example of two moral entrepreneurs working against each other on a single issue).  Rule creator and rule enforcer The term \\"moral entrepreneur\\" was coined by sociologist Howard S. Becker. In his view, moral entrepreneurs fall into roughly two categories: rule creators, and rule enforcers. Rule creators generally express the conviction that some kind of threatening social evil exists that must be combated. They can be seen as moral crusaders, who are concerned chiefly with the successful persuasion of others, but are not concerned with the means by which this persuasion is achieved. Successful moral crusades are generally dominated by those in the upper social strata of society (Becker, 1963). They often include religious groups, lawmaking bodies, and stakeholders in a given field. There is political competition in which these moral crusaders originate crusades aimed at generating reform, based on what they think is moral, therefore defining deviance. Moral crusaders must have power, public support, generate public awareness of the issue, and be able to propose a clear and acceptable solution to the problem (Becker, 1963). The degree of a moral entrepreneur's power is highly dependent upon the social and cultural context (Reinarman, 1994). Social position determines one's ability to define and construct reality; therefore, the higher one's social position, the greater his or her moral value. After a time, crusaders become dependent upon experts or professionals, who serve to legitimize a moral creed on technical or scientific grounds. Rule enforcers, such as policemen, are compelled by two drives: the need to justify their own role, and the need to win respect in interactions. They are in a bind; if they show too much effectiveness one might say they are not needed, and if they show too little effectiveness one might say they are failing. Rule enforcers just feel the need to enforce the rule because that is their job; they are not really concerned with the content of the rule. As rules are changed, something that was once acceptable may now be punished and vice versa. Such officials tend to take a pessimistic view of human nature because of constant exposure to willful deviance. The sociology of social control seeks to predict and explain the behavior of both rule creators and rule enforcers. The creation and application of explicit rules are seen as characteristics of moralism, or the tendency to treat people as enemies. Among the social conditions that are identified as sources of moralism are status superiority and social remoteness between the agents of social control and the people whose behavior they regulate. Thus, the most likely targets of both rule creators and rule enforcers are those who are socially inferior, culturally different, and personally unknown.Black, Donald. \\"Making Enemies.\\" Pp. 144-57 in The Social Structure of Right and Wrong. San Diego, CA: Academic Press. 1993. It is their behavior that is most likely to seem objectionable and to call forth the strenuous efforts of moral entrepreneurs. Once moral entrepreneurs or claimsmakers define the behaviors of these individuals or groups as deviant or a moral threat, then the entire group may be seen by society as a deviant subculture. Similarly, they or their behavior may be seen as the roots of the next moral panic. This is often the goal of the moral entrepreneurs; to rally the support of society behind their specific aims through the redefining of behaviors and groups as deviant or problematic. Alternately, those individuals with social power, wealth, high status, or large public support bases are the most likely to assert this power and to act as a moral entrepreneur.Tuggle, Justin and Holmes, Malcolm. \\"Blowing Smoke: Status Politics and the Smoking Ban\\". 1997  Social problems  Social problems are born largely from socially constructed campaigns by moral entrepreneurs. In the symbolic interactionist approach to social problems (including labeling theory), social policy is not seen as the implementation of a shared consensus about what is best. Rather the society is viewed as consisting of a plurality of understandings of what is best. In order for social policy to arise, some individual or group has to initiate a social movement whose task is to articulate a definition of a social problem such that a desired social policy is consistent with this definition of the problem. These individuals or groups are referred to as moral entrepreneurs. Moral entrepreneurs are critical for moral emergence because they call attention to issues or even 'create' issues by using language that names, interprets, and dramatizes them.Finnemore and Sikkink. International Norm Dynamics and Political Change. in \\"International Organization.\\" 52 (autumn): Pp. 887-917. 1998. Typifying is a prominent rhetorical tool employed by moral entrepreneurs when attempting to define social problems. Typification is when claimsmakers characterize a problem's nature which is most commonly done by suggesting that a problem is best understood from a particular perspective (i.e. medical, moral, criminal, political, etc.)Best, Joel. \\"typification and Social Problems Construction.\\" Pp. 3-10 in Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems. 1989. Therefore, moral entrepreneurs often engage in typification by claiming that certain behaviors or groups are acting in morally dangerous ways. Moral entrepreneurs are more successful at defining deviance when they can identify an entire group with a particular behavior and create fear that the behavior represents a danger not only to the group but also to the rest of society. Through typification and the creation of a dangerous class, moral entrepreneurs aim to place the activities of a particular group on the public's agenda and label certain actions as social problems.Schneider, Anne L., and Helen M. Ingram. Deserving and Entitled: Social Constructions and Public Policy. Albany: State University of New York, 2005. Claimsmakers in areas such as the problem of drinking and driving, child abuse, or date rape play an important role in the creation of the rhetoric that creates and determines what is deviant and what is a considered a problem in society.Glazer, Nathan. \\"How Social Problems are Born\\". 1994 Through creating and popularizing definitions for terms relevant to the issue (such as \\"rape\\", \\"abuse\\" and \\"drunk\\"), claimsmakers and moral entrepreneurs can not only further their interests, but also sway the social movement and understanding of the issues themselves.  Lawmaking  Moral entrepreneurs are also central in the construction of social deviance, including the development of drug scares. The role of moral entrepreneurs in this instance, for example, is to assign responsibility to drugs for an array of preexisting public problems. (The Social Construction of Drug Scares, Reinarman). Over the course of the past century, drug laws have been passed with the intent of reducing drug problems; even if they have not done this, they have certainly expanded the power of the social control held by moral entrepreneurs.Reinarman, Craig. \\"The Social Construction of Drug Scares\\". 1994 Examples of laws created by moral entrepreneurs are: Prohibition in the United States 1919, San Francisco's anti-opium den ordinance of 1875, and the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914.

He studied guitar, cello, and composition at the Royal College of Music in London between 1981 and 1986. Since his debut at the Purcell Room, London in July 1986. Richard Durrant has gained an international reputation as one of the great guitarists of his generation. He has pursued both performance and composition in an unconventional career that has avoided categorisation and he has built a faithful, ever expanding audience who warm to his unpretentious manner and natural skills of communication. He is one of the only classical guitar virtuosi who performs standing up. Work Durrant‚Äôs compositions include ‚ÄòThe Girl at the Airport‚Äô (for guitar and strings released 2016, recorded with the City of Prague Philharmonic Strings July 2015), ‚ÄòCycling Music‚Äô (for guitar, sequencers and bicycle percussion, released 2014), ‚ÄòThe Polar Bear‚Äô (for solo guitar with narrator, released 2013 and featuring the voice of Barry Cryer), ‚ÄôWilbury Summer‚Äô (released 1997), ‚ÄòThe Rucenitsa Guitar Quartet' (flute, guitar, viola and cello) and 'Superluminal' (voice, guitar, string- quartet & electronics). There is also a very early Clarinet Sonata (1982) and other instrumental works including numerous guitar solos (‚ÄòLa Isla del Paraguay‚Äô, ‚ÄòApreton de Manos‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Early Learning Sonata‚Äô), children‚Äôs songs and folk tunes as well as music for the BBC, including the BBC1 skating penguins logo & music for the CBBC cartoon series ‚ÄòMetalheads' (Telemagination). Richard Durrant has written, and sung, numerous songs for BBC Schools TV programmes Numbertime and Watch. He has also produced recordings for other artists including The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain (‚ÄòThe Secret of Life‚Äô 2004) and Don Partridge (‚ÄòThe Highwayman‚Äô 2002). In the early 1990s Durrant toured as lead guitarist with the band Sky. This was their last UK tour. Venues included the Barbican and The Royal Festival Hall, London. He went on to perform regularly with Herbie Flowers.[2] One of his more challenging performances is a reinterpretation of Steve Reich's Electric Counterpoint for soloist and 20 pre-recorded guitars. His concerts are difficult to categorise as he covers many styles and often includes improvisations and electronic treatments ‚Äì but he is, at his core, a classical performer. Career By the time he attended the Royal College of Music, Richard Durrant was an experienced performer with a growing reputation. The fact that he spent much of his time at college singing Bob Dylan songs in London's tube stations hinted that this musician was unlikely to follow a conventional route through the profession. Indeed, following his debut recital at the South Bank, London in 1986, Richard turned sharply left and pursued his diverse interests in electro/acoustic music, improvisation, composition and multi-media. These interests have, in part, contributed to Durrant treading a difficult and at times solitary path through the music business. His career, firmly outside the classical establishment, is noteworthy as much for its display of versatility as this musician's tendency towards perfectionism. For several years Durrant toured a solo show billed as \\"Richard Durrant ‚Äì The Guitar Whisperer\\". The show used projections of specially commissioned, short films as occasional backdrops in this multi-media entertainment which was built around a classical guitar recital. Durrant also likes to include his striking interpretations of music by J.S. Bach on ‚Äòwrong‚Äô instruments such as banjo, tenor guitar and ukulele. In 2014 Durrant released his minimalist styled album Cycling Music. To promote the album and also to raise money for charity (The Big C 2014 and the Cyclist Defence Fund ‚Äì CDF ‚Äì 2015) he has toured over 3,000 miles around the UK with his one-man show cycling the whole production from gig to gig on the back of his bike. The music from Cycling Music was used by the BBC during their coverage of Le Tour 2014. Richard‚Äôs Cycling Music tour was featured on ITV‚Äôs The Cycling Show in July 2014. In recent years Richard Durrant has visited many UK venues including the Hawth Theatre Crawley, Norwich Playhouse, The Stables Wavendon, Yvonne Arnaud Guildford, Brighton Dome, BBC Proms Celebration in Trafalgar Square, Keswick Theatre by the Lake, Theatre Severn, The Royal Albert Hall (with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), Rose Theatre Tewkesbury, The Stables Milton Keynes, Bedford Prom in the Park, Aros Centre Isle of Skye, Rose Theatre, Kingston, Epsom Playhouse, Birmingham Conservatoire, The De La Warr Pavilion, Mold Theatr Clywd and the New Wolsey, Ipswich. He has also performed a large number of concerts over many years for the UK Rural Touring Network. UK festival performances include Wildlife Festival, Sidmouth, Adur, Brighton, and the International Guitar Festival of Great Britain. In Europe he has performed solo concerts in Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Switzerland and Spain. Durrant has played many concerts with the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as the Hanover Orchestra, BBC Midlands Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In May 2011, Durrant was invited to launch his latest solo album in Paraguay and, whilst there, in recognition of his services as a champion of Agust√≠n Barrios Mangor√©, Durrant was officially proclaimed an Illustrious Visitor to Asuncion. He has since returned to South America many times playing in Paraguay, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Arequipa, Peru. In November 2010 Durrant was awarded a fellowship of the London College of Music for professional achievement. He has been an official ambassador for the Brighton Youth Orchestra since 2015. He was chairman of the Adur Festival for many years until his resignation in 2005. He is still closely involved with the arts scene in West Sussex especially since the opening of The Ropetackle Arts Centre in Shoreham by Sea. He is a passionate supporter of community arts projects. He is a regular visitor to local schools wherever he is performing. In October 2002, as recognition of his work promoting art in the community, Richard was presented with a Daily Mail Golden Jubilee Award by The Prince of Wales.

Voter apathy or lack of interest is often cited as a cause of low turnout among eligible voters in jurisdictions where voting is optional, and the donkey vote where voting is compulsory. Voter fatigue describes a possible cause of voter apathy, which are elections that are held too frequently. Political alienation may be confused with voter apathy. Sometimes, alienated voters do care about an election, but feel \\"estranged or disaffected from the system or somehow left out of the political process.\\" Background The psychological factors that influence voter behavior are a voter's perceptions of politics, that is, how the voter sees the parties, the candidates, and the issues in an election. The farther down the ballot an office is, the fewer the number of votes that will be cast for it. This is called ballot fatigue. The expression suggests that many voters exhaust their patience or knowledge as they work their way down the ballot. Prominent Founding Fathers writing in The Federalist Papers believed it was \\"essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people,\\" and felt that a bond between the people and the representatives was \\"particularly essential.\\" They wrote \\"frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.\\" In 2009, however, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress. In the 19th century there was a substantially large amount of voter turnout with numerous years with over 80% participation. This be due to several factors. One, political machines gave voters an incredible incentive to vote with favors of work, wealth, and political power (which were especially attractive to poor immigrants); however, political machines lost much of their power with the increased ability to vote and with more exposure on corrupt policies. Numerous reports suggest voter apathy is widespread and growing. The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since.   * Vanderbilt professor Dana D. Nelson in Bad for Democracy argues that all citizens seem to do, politically, is vote for president every four years, and not much else; they've abandoned politics. Apathy was lower in the 2008 election, which featured a competitive election for president. Voter turnout in 2008 (62%) was the highest since 1968. On the other hand, Hunter College professor Jamie Chandler claims that voter apathy, or disinterest in the political system, is overstated in regards to socioeconomic factors. Wealth and educational attainment correlate most strongly with voter participation. = Civic technology = Civic technology seeks to counteract the effects of voter apathy through more modern means, such as social media, applications, and websites. Many startups within the field of civic technology attempt to connect voters to politicians and government, in an attempt to boost voter participation and turnout. Examples include PopVox in the United States and mySociety in the United Kingdom. A John S. and James L. Knight Foundation report found that $431 million had been invested in civic tech as a whole from January 2011 through May 2013, with $4 million specifically invested in voting technologies. For the 2016 US Presidential election, Facebook implemented reminders to register to vote in its social network. Several election officials have claimed that these efforts significantly increased voter registration. =Effects in the United States= As stated earlier, voter apathy leads to a lower turnout of eligible voters. According to the Pew Research Center, only 55.7 percent of the U.S. voting age population cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election. This percentage is a slight increase from the 2012 election, but lower than the 2008 election, which had record numbers. Voter turnout numbers in the United States are quite low compared to other developed nations. The United States was ranked 31 out of the 35 countries in this study. The Census Bureau recorded that there were roughly 245.5 million Americans, aged 18 and above, but only 157.6 million of them were registered to vote. The United States Election Project had similar findings, estimating apathy slightly higher: 46.9 percent of eligible voters did not vote in 2016. There is an overemphasis on the number of Americans who have claimed they voted. The Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives only recorded 136.8 million people, compared to the 137.5 million who claimed to have voted. This number also includes 170,000 ballots which were blank, spoiled, or null. Voter registration in the United States is an independent responsibility, so citizens choose whether they want to register or not. This led to only 64% of the voting age population being registered to vote in 2016. The United States is one of the sole countries that requires its citizens to register separately from voting. The lack of automatic registration contributes to the issue that there are over a third of eligible citizen in the United States that are not registered to vote. Turnout comparisons cannot be solely based on the number of registered voters because Americans who are registered to vote are more likely to vote in an election, since they already took the time to register. The methods used to calculate voter turnout can lead to higher numbers because additional factors are considered. Many Americans do not take the effort to figure and find out how and where to register, as some see it as a burden. Some states have begun to take steps to facilitate the registration process by authorizing \\"same day registration\\" or allowing registration at the time they receive their drivers license. On the other hand, there are quite a few states that have harsher voter ID laws. Some states required that a person must live at their current address for one year before they can register to vote in that state. Up until 2003, about 44 states allowed some kind of residency requirement for registration. Now, it is illegal for a state to require residency for more than 30 days before the election. Many critics believe that these restrictive laws make it more challenging for certain minorities to cast a ballot. Critics also emphasize the fact that elections are held on a Tuesday during the daytime, which is a time when many citizens are at work. To overcome this obstacle, some states offer absentee ballots and voting through mail. People from lower income families also will not register to vote because of jury duty. Registering to vote in many places across the United States means that a person's name is placed into the jury pool for that location. Many of the poor people in society cannot afford to skip work in order to go to jury duty. Rather than risking their income, these people will give up their chance to vote. There is no direct correlation between increased voter registration and higher voter turnout. The two have a relationship, especially since stricter registration rules in turn create a probability of restricting overall turnout rates. Although registration requirements have become more lenient over time, turnout continues to decline and stay comparatively low. Since 1976, voter turnout has stayed between an 8.5 percent range of fluctuation and has been on a historical downward trend, although it can differ among certain racial, ethnic, and age groups. Turnout has been lingering between 48% and 57% since 1980. The age factor in voting plays a significant part in the voter turnout. Voters in the older age groups (45-65 year old and 65 and older) have the highest rate of voter turnout. In the time span from 1964-2004, 18-24 year olds usually had a voter turnout of 41.8%, compared to 25-44 year olds who had a turnout of 57.9%. The older age groups, 45-65 year olds and the 65 and older group has turnout rates of 69.3% and 66.6%, respectively. Older Americans are overrepresented during elections. The greatest percentage of unregistered voters is in the 18-30 year old age group. These people are more focused on other aspects in their life, such as college, marriage, careers, etc. that they in turn do not pay attention to registration. Voters tend to be older, wealthier, and more educated than non-voters. In a USA Today poll taken in 2012, 59 percent of citizens who chose not to vote because they believed that \\"'nothing ever gets done' in government\\". Another 54% of non-voters believed there was corruption. Thirty seven percent just admitted that politics did not make any difference in their lives and that is why they choose not to vote. Certain voters are likely to refrain from elections in comparison to others because of politicians. Politicians generally oblige to the interests and wants of the citizens voting for them, and the welfare of some citizens is not properly attended to by these politicians. Voters and non-voters can have the gap of politicians taking into account certain needs over others. Low turnout rates during primaries are caused by the apathy about who will make it to the general election. Many believe only the general election matters. The voter apathy causes serious problems in congressional elections also, since the electorate either will be heavily Republican or Democrat. Candidates chosen out of these increasingly polarized voter pools heighten rigidness and gridlock in the government. Voter apathy has intensified along with the 2016 election, as citizens did not appreciate the political slander and denunciation of both candidates. \\"The smaller the voter pool becomes, the more weight a single vote carries and the easier it becomes for an active, partisan minority to determine an election's outcome.\\" There is generally an inverse relationship between level of government and turnout rates. = Causes = There are two primary causes for voter apathy: alienation and voter fatigue. Alienation is defined as, ‚Äúthis refers to the sense that voters feel like the political system does not work for them and any attempt to influence it will be a fruitless exercise.‚Äù This could be due to many factors. One of the reasons is due to lack of education. According to a study done by Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the director of CIRCLE, found that nearly 20% of youth did not feel that they knew enough to vote. Additionally, the study found that many youth had glaring misconceptions about the voting process with many several in the study thinking that they could not vote due to relatively minor violations (like driving under the influence). This 20% is especially significant when juxtaposed with the 20% total youth turnout in the 2018 midterms. Voter fatigue is defined in political science as, ‚Äúvoter fatigue is the apathy that the electorate can experience under certain circumstances, one of which could be that they are required to vote too often.‚Äù One of the possible causes for voter fatigue is the barrage of political messages through the internet (especially social media). With the large amount of exposure to political messages year-round can cause a fatigue that turns potential voters away from the voting process. Along with those two main causes, voter apathy can be caused by being uncomfortable with the possible choices, being are unable to vote due to legal or logistical barriers, being overwhelmed by personal issues, or encountering registration problems. = Possible Solutions = One of the possible solutions to voter apathy in the younger generation is increased education. Multiple studies have shown that decreased civic instruction starting in the 1960‚Äôs has led to decreased young voter turnout. In 2014, there was a record-low turnout of adults 18-29 with 20% casting a ballot. In 2018, only nine states required at least one year of government or civic education. According to a 2018 survey by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, only one third of Americans could pass a general citizenship test, 13% of young Americans knew when the Constitution was ratified, and less than 50% could identify which countries the United States fought in World War 2. According to the Tuft study, this has led 20% of young adults to avoid voting due to not knowing enough information to cast a ballot.

Donaldson, the second book of The Gap Cycle series. Plot introduction After Angus Thermopyle was framed and arrested for stealing station supplies from Com-Mine, Morn Hyland escaped with Captain Nick Succorso aboard his ship, the Captain's Fancy. As part of a deal Morn made with Angus, she will not reveal to anyone that she has a zone implant - a device Angus installed in her brain allowing him to control her while he raped and abused her - meaning that Angus will not face death for unauthorized use of a zone implant, and in turn Angus gave Morn the zone implant control. With the control in her hands she soon becomes addicted to the effects of a zone implant. Nick misinterpreted Morn's intentions and expects her to 'repay' him by being his new lover. The abuse Morn suffered under Angus has left her unable to stand the touch of another man, but she soon works out how to use the zone implant to induce artificial sexual desire to fulfil Nick's desires. While on board the Captain's Fancy, the data first Orn Vorbuld repeatedly molests Morn whenever they end up alone together, eventually leading to a showdown with Nick after Orn attempts to rape her. Orn reveals that he has planted a virus in the ship's computer that, if not deactivated by him, will wipe the computer's memory and leave the ship stranded in space. In spite of this, Nick still kills him and the ship soon falls under the effects of the virus. Meanwhile, Morn discovers that she has become pregnant, and the age of the fetus indicates that Angus Thermopyle is the father. Reflecting on the death of her family, she decides to keep it, which Nick allows her on the condition that she is able to stop the virus. She does so, and Nick keeps his end of the bargain, but not in a way Morn expected: Nick sets course for Enablement Station, an outpost in Forbidden Space, a region of space controlled by the mysterious Amnion. The Amnion are a race of creatures whose society is centered around their ability to manipulate DNA. They intend on dominating the human species through use of mutagens that would turn humans into Amnion themselves, but for now are held at bay in their section of the universe - what humans call forbidden space. No one but pirates and other illegals ever deal with the Amnion for fear that they themselves will be turned into Amnion, but Nick maintains that they would never go back on their word for fear that if they did no humans would deal with them. Once they arrive at the station Nick convinces the Amnion to give them enough credit to fix their gap drive (which was damaged previously) and to force grow Morn's unborn child to adulthood, in exchange for a phial of Nick's blood, which the Amnion mistakenly believe holds the key to genetic immunity to their mutagens (the \\"immunity\\" is actually caused by a drug, of which the Amnion are unaware). The Amnion keep their promises and give Nick the credit he asked for and force grow Morn's baby to the approximate age of 16. Her mind is copied onto her son, a traumatic process which she survives only due to the effects of her zone implant. Nick becomes enraged when he sees Morn's child, named Davies Hyland after her father; Davies is the spitting image of his real father, Angus Thermopyle. After getting back to the ship the Amnion inadvertently reveal the existence of Morn's zone implant when they explain that it protected her from the brain damage a mind imprint would cause. Nick realizes that Morn's love for him was all a masque and when the Amnion request that they return Davies Hyland to them for experimentation, Nick complies in return for parts to fix his gap drive. Morn soon manages to hold the ship and Enablement station hostage by putting the ship's self-destruct on a pressure release trigger so she can get her child back, as well as the parts needed to fix the ship. They enable their gap drive but it begins to fail. Vector Shaheed, the ship's engineer, manages to avert a disaster and they survive, coming 'back into tard' with a slagged gap drive far from Enablement, but still in Amnion space. To everyone's surprise the ship is travelling at an unprecedented .9C, or nine tenths the speed of light. In the ensuing chaos, Nick is able to retake command of the ship. Setting course for Thanatos Minor where an illegal trade outpost called Billingate resides, two Amnion warships catch up and Nick negotiates to have Davies transferred to one in an ejection pod. After being released from her cabin by some of the crew who no longer trust Nick, Morn manages to get the pod reprogrammed so that it misses the Amnion ship and heads toward Billingate. In the meantime, the incarcerated Angus Thermopyle is tortured and interrogated on Com-Mine by Milos Taverner, the head of Com-Mine security. Eventually he is requisitioned by the UMCP and transformed into a cyborg, (a process known as \\"welding\\") under the complete control of the computers connected to his brain. The UMCP then prepares to send Milos and Angus together on a highly classified mission against Thanatos Minor.

Donaldson, the third book of The Gap Cycle series. Plot summary As the newly 'welded' cyborg Angus Thermopyle and his distrusted companion Milos Taverner arrive in their Gap Scout, Trumpet, at the illegal outpost in Amnion space known as Billingate, The Bill, the ruler of Billingate, intercepts the escape pod containing Morn Hyland's recently forcegrown child, Davies Hyland. Despite being only a few days old, the forcegrowing technique the Amnion used on him have made him physically resemble a sixteen-year-old boy. Morn suffers from an insanity-causing ailment known as Gap Sickness for which she uses a device called a zone implant in the event of gap travel. When Morn's mind was copied onto Davies' during the force growing process to make up for his lack of a developmental/formative childhood, Morn somehow survived the copying which, it was explained, should have killed her. The Amnion, a misanthropic alien race bent on the eventual domination of the human race, and the ones who conceded to perform the force growing of Davies, suspect that it is the presence of Morn's zone implant that saved her; these circumstances make the mother and son uniquely valuable to the Amnion. The Amnion have followed Morn and her son to Billingate in the hopes of getting them back for further study. Captain Nick Succorso, aboard his ship the Captain's Fancy, is furious at Morn for not only making him think that she loved him, but, more recently, for diverting the escape pod containing her son away from an Amnion warship. Nick had promised Davies to the Amnion as a show of good faith. In his fury he gives them Morn, but not before she has broken into his quarters to steal an immunization drug designed to counteract Amnion mutagens that would turn her into one of them. Nick is left in a precarious position. The Amnion continue to demand Davies Hyland, but Davies is in the custody of The Bill, who shrewdly asks for compensation for the child. Because of their convoluted dealings, the Amnion have revoked a credit voucher they gave Nick, so he has no credit to give The Bill for Davies. Because of this, Nick is stuck on Billingate and simply wanders the 'cruise'. After Milos finishes abusing Angus by using the priority codes for Angus' computer, which were given to him by UMCPHQ, Angus and Milos disembark at Billingate and eventually meet up with Angus' nemesis, Nick. They form an uneasy truce. Nick explains that he needs Davies and will give Morn to them in exchange for Morn's son, should Nick be able to recover him. Nick of course does not mention he's already handed Morn over to the Amnion and, as far as he knows, has already been turned into one of them. Angus and Milos are surprised to learn that Angus' programming includes rescuing Morn, something they were told was not the case. Milos becomes furious and begins to distrust his orders, the UMCP and Angus. While waiting for Nick to find out where Davies is being held, Milos asserts his previously unperceived control over Angus, making him eat his live nic butts, in front of Billingate's bug eyes - a mistake that will cost him later. After finding out where the detention centre is, Angus' computer reveals to him that he is capable of emitting a type of jamming field that can bend light rendering him invisible to electronic surveillance, thus protecting his identity. His programming makes him take Milos with him, because he cannot really be trusted on his own. They descend into the depths of Billingate, where they find Davies locked away in a cell. When Nick handed Morn over to the Amnion, some of his crew, Mikka Vasaczk, Nick's second in command, Vector Shaheed, his engineer, Sib Mackern, his data first, and Ciro \\"Pup\\" Vasaczk, Vector's assistant, all begin to turn against him. Sensing a mutiny, Nick sends them to do specific tasks on Billingate to 'get them out of the way'. Against orders, they all meet up and decide to abandon Captain's Fancy as they've clearly outlived their usefulness to Nick. When Angus and Milos return to Trumpet with Davies, they confront Nick when he arrives and decide to keep Davies rather than hand him over to Nick, who intends to turn him over to the Amnion. Nick also reveals that Morn is in Amnion custody. Angus begins to form a plan to rescue her when Milos, and then Nick, leave the ship. Milos immediately heads to the Amnion sector of Billingate and there it becomes apparent that he's been working for them as a double agent for some time. The Amnion emissary, Marc Vestabule, an abortive Amnion attempt at turning a human into an Amnion while maintaining a human-like appearance, informs Milos that both they and The Bill are aware that he has some kind of control over Angus. Vestabule then, to Milos' extreme horror, subdues Milos and injects him with Amnion mutagens. In the meantime Nick is confronted by his former crew: Mikka, Vector, Sib and Pup. While arguing, they are all approached by Billingate security and Nick, being barred from Captain's Fancy, flees for Trumpet while being pursued by Mikka and company, followed closely by security. Angus reluctantly lets them in. While The Bill rages over the comm, they begin to formulate and act out a plan to rescue Morn. Nick contacts Captain's Fancy and instructs Liete Corregio, his third in command, to attack the ship called Soar, as Nick has discovered that it is captained by Sorus Chatelaine, a woman who seduced, betrayed and abandoned Nick as a young man, but not before leaving the streaked scars underneath his eyes that act as his emotional barometer. Angus instructs Davies, Vector and Pup to sabotage Billingate's communications systems while Nick, Mikka, Sib and Angus himself go EVA to the Amnion sector to rescue Morn. After breaking inside, Angus is confronted by Milos, who has now been turned into an Amnion while still retaining his human memories, mannerisms and form - the Amnion apparently having perfected their mutagens. Milos attempts to use Angus' priority codes against him and his newfound allies, but new programming takes over that overrides those codes with new ones, allowing Angus both to ignore Milos' orders and attempt to kill him. Milos escapes, but they soon find Morn in her cell, still human thanks to the immunity drug she stole from Nick. Angus puts Mikka in charge and gets Sib to help Morn into the spare EVA suit they brought when he suddenly leaves to sabotage Billingate's reactor. On their way back to Trumpet, the rescue party witnesses an Amnion shuttle containing The Bill leave the station, as well as the destruction of an Amnion warship that had been rammed by Captain's Fancy, which Leite did to prevent the ship from firing on Mikka, Morn, Sib and Nick while they were walking across the face of Billingate. When back on Trumpet, Nick attempts to take over the ship by holding Pup hostage, demanding that they leave without Angus. Pup manages to subdue Nick with a stun prod he landed on when forced into Milos' old command station. Then Angus appears back on board and begins to get Trumpet ready to leave. While Nick and Angus finish the preparations, everyone else leaves for quarters to secure for heavy g. An Amnion warship and a few other human pirate ships converge on Trumpet as it disengages from Billingate just as Billingate's reactor explodes. Trumpet escapes into the gap, presumably leaving all the other ships left behind to be destroyed. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Warden Dios, the director of the UMCP, gathers together his directors, Min Donner, director of the UMCP's Enforcement Division (ED), Hashi Lebwohl, director of Data Acquisition (DA), and Godsen Frik, director of Protocol (PR), for a video conference with the Governing Council of Earth and Space (GCES), brought about by the apparent escape of the known pirate Angus Thermopyle and suspected traitor Milos Taverner, as such was their cover story when they left UMCPHQ. The GCES demands disclosure and uses the opportunity to ask about Morn Hyland, a UMCP ensign they apparently abandoned to pirates and the Amnion. Warden and Hashi offer half-truths to the Council, telling them that they failed to recapture Angus and Milos, and that they arranged for Morn to be given to Nick as 'payment' for a job they had him do so that she could be used as a bargaining chip should Nick's mission at Billingate fail. The mission was to give a non-working anti-mutagen drug in hopes that it would disrupt Billingate's usefulness to the Amnion, not letting on that they gave him a working anti-mutagen drug that the UMCP suppressed years previous. Later Dios admits to Min in confidence that he did this purposely in hopes to get the UMCP severed from the UMC so that it would be reformed under the GCES. Dios hopes to disrupt the power that Holt Fasner, the CEO of the UMC, has over human controlled space. He then instructs Min to leave UMCPHQ, which is orbiting Earth, for Suka Bator. There Min meets with Captain Sixten Vertigus, the man who made first contact with the Amnion, and is now a member of the GCES. She convinces him to propose a bill of severance that would put the UMCP under the control of the GCES, persuading him to act as if it was his own idea so that no one would know that Min Donner or Warden Dios had anything to do with it. As Min is about to leave, she and Sixten are attacked by a kaze that Min recognizes in time to prevent the kaze's surgically implanted explosives from killing them. Despite being injured, Min then leaves so that no one knows she was there. The Kaze causes the GCES to announce a state of emergency, suspending GCES meetings until further notice. Warden Dios declares a similar lockdown at UMCPHQ, suspecting that Frik or Fasner might be behind the kaze to keep Sixten from proposing the bill of severance that Dios hoped only he, Min and Sixten knew about. Fasner attempts to summon Frik to his private orbiting station, but Frik refuses, citing Dios' orders as explanation, but in actuality he would rather not confront his boss and mentor. Another kaze kills Frik. Dios is summoned to Fasner's home instead and is asked to explain why he disclosed so much information as to horrify the GCES, and why he restricted Frik's movements, resulting in his death. Dios manages to answer, but does not completely satisfy Fasner. Fasner mentions that he is aware that Dios sent Min Donner to the borders of forbidden space to await the return of Angus and Milos. He instructs Dios to tell Donner to kill Angus and Milos should anything go wrong. Notes Category:1993 American novels Category:1993 science fiction novels Category:Novels by Stephen R.

Donaldson, the fourth book of The Gap Cycle series. Plot summary  Following the assassination of Godsen Frik, the former Director of Protocol for the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Hashi Lebwohl, the Director of the Data Acquisition (DA) branch of the UMCP, attempts to investigate how security failed to prevent the so- called 'kaze' attacks. Hashi learns that they were using more recent security badges that contained up-to-date security codes. As part of his investigation, Hashi accompanies Koina Hannish, Godsen's successor as Director of Protocol, to Earth to attend an emergency session of the GCES. It is there that, as Koina informed Hashi, Captain Vertigus will propose a bill of severance that will sever the UMCP from the UMC and merge it with the GCES so as to avoid the conflict of interest between UMC CEO Holt Farsner and the rest of humanity. Captain Vertigus manages to propose his bill to the GCES as Hashi recognizes a security guard as former Captain Nathan Alt. Hashi surmises that he is a kaze and is surprised that, instead of attacking Captain Vertigus, seems to be heading for the UMC's First Executive Assistant, Cleatus Fane. Hashi grabs Alt's IDs intact, which strangely identify him as one 'Clay Imposs', before having him arrested. Alt\\\\Imposs promptly explodes. Meanwhile, a cyborg named Angus Thermopyle is fleeing the newly destroyed Billingate installation in Forbidden Space with his makeshift crew. As luck would have it Vector Shaheed was one of the lead scientists working on an anti-mutagen drug. The Amnion, the beings that inhabit Forbidden Space, would have their mutagens turn the entire human race into Amnion themselves, and the immunity drug that Vector was working on would have assured humanity their safety. The UCMP took Shaheed‚Äôs research away from him and suppressed the drug on Holt Farsner‚Äôs orders. Hashi Lebwohl secretly finished Shaheed‚Äôs research and gave a sample of the drug to Nick Succorso to test. With samples of the drug in their possession, the crew of Trumpet decide to have Vector complete his research at an illegal lab run by a man named Deaner Beckmann. It is hoped, assuming Vector can complete his research, that the drug can be disseminated to the rest of humanity to protect them should the Amnion invade human space. On their way into human space Angus‚Äô programming has him send a message using a listening post to UMCPHQ coded for Warden Dios, the director of the UMCP itself. After sending the message Trumpet speeds off toward the Valdor Industrial system where the lab is located deep within an asteroid swarm orbiting a binary star. Having previously been sent to the very same listening post on orders from Warden Dios to await the return if Thermopyle, Min Donner and the crew aboard the UMCP cruiser Punisher are there to witness Trumpet‚Äôs transmission and successive flight. They also happen upon Free Lunch, a ship that we learn was hired by Hashi to destroy Trumpet, as well as an unknown ship in hot pursuit from Forbidden Space. Min and Punishers crew assume that the pursuing craft either belongs to the misanthropic Amnion, or is in their employ. Despite the protests of Punisher‚Äôs captain, Dolph Ubikwe, Min ignores the possibility that the encroaching ship is Amnioni and in the process of committing an act of war, and she has Punisher pursue Trumpet. Min soon receives instructions from Warden Dios to contact Thermopyle and get him to give his priority codes to Nick Succorso. After framing Angus, abusing Morn, and attempting to sell Morn and Davies to the Amnion, Nick is a prisoner aboard Trumpet. When he receives Angus‚Äô priority codes he proceeds to have most of the crew beaten and locked in quarters for betraying him. Fortunately Nick decides to proceed with the plan to reproduce the immunity drug, although he hopes to sell it rather than give it away. When Trumpet arrives at Beckmann‚Äôs lab they discover that the ship that was pursuing them had guessed where they might go and has already arrived. Soar is a human ship in the Amnion‚Äôs employ captained by Sorus Chatelaine, a woman who betrayed and scarred Nick as a young man, something he wants revenge for. Through Soar the Amnion hope to capture the crew of Trumpet for study. For that reason they have placed an Amnioni aboard, the former human Milos Taverner. Trumpet docks at the illegal lab, and while Mikka, Ciro, Vector, Sib and Nick go aboard the station, Angus‚Äô programming has him deliver his priority codes to Morn and Davies. Because of this the Hylands are able to help Angus release himself from his programming. While aboard the station Nick arranges for Ciro to be alone as a trap. Sorus takes the ‚Äòbait‚Äô and kidnaps him and Sorus and Milos inject Ciro with a slow acting mutagen that will change him if he stops taking an inhibiter every hour. Sorus tells Ciro that she will continue to supply him with the inhibiter if he sabotages Trumpet‚Äôs drives. When Vector finishes his work and everyone returns, Morn and Davies are able to incapacitate Nick once more and they retake the ship. Ciro reveals what Sorus did to him and Vector is able to cure him using the immunity drug. When Trumpet undocks from the lab, Soar destroys the installation and chases Trumpet as they attempt to leave the asteroid swarm. Nick convinces the rest to let him go EVA and attack Soar by himself as she chases Trumpet. The rest let him when Sib tells them he‚Äôll go with him to help make sure he doesn‚Äôt attack Trumpet. Nick and Sib manage to disable Soar‚Äôs most devastating weapon, a super-light proton cannon, before both are, presumably, killed. Free Lunch and Soar engage Trumpet at the same time and end up attacking each other when Trumpet seems to have lost thrust, appearing sabotaged. Angus goes EVA and launches a singularity grenade at Free Lunch and detonates it. The resulting black hole destroys Free Lunch and batters Soar badly. When Trumpet and Soar reach the edge of the swarm, then run into Punisher and an Amnion ‚Äòdefensive‚Äô named Calm Horizons heavily engaging each other. Nick suddenly appears on Soar‚Äôs bridge, having survived Sorus‚Äô attack and the black hole in EVA. Sorus dispatches him, and then Milos before ordering her crew to engage Calm Horizons and betray her former masters. Calm Horizons destroys Soar but Trumpet and Punisher escape, leaving the Amnioni ship behind.

On 27 April 1846, Brown helped to found the Texas Democratic Party in Austin. Brown served as a commissioner to help locate the state penitentiary in 1848. In 1850, Brown was one of the commissioners that selected Athens as the seat of Henderson County. Brown was married to Margaret Hodges Brooks. After her death in 1849, he married Elizabeth Holland in 1851. He probably died in 1852.

It is set in the fictional world of Virga, a world devoid of gravity containing multiple artificial stars, a fullerene sphere filled with air, drifting rocks and nations floating around Candesce (the eponymous \\"Sun of Suns\\"). The story focuses around three main characters: Hayden Griffin, Admiral Chaison Fanning, and his wife Venera Fanning. The sequel to the book, Queen of Candesce, was released in August 2007. Plot Hayden Griffin is a young, fatherless boy living in Aerie. Though exactly when or how his father died is never discovered, Hayden continually says that he was murdered by Slipstream, a rival nation migrating through Virga. Slipstream's sun is tethered to a migrating asteroid that has provided the nation with its wealth. As Slipstream follows its sun, it occasionally moves through other nation's territories, as it does with Aerie, Hayden Griffin's home nation. In these cases, it uses its military headed by a leader simply known as \\"the Pilot\\" to make this nation a client nation of Slipstream, only to leave these nations again when the asteroid moves far enough. His parent's ambition was to liberate Aerie from Slipstream's rule by constructing their own sun in secret. After his father's death, Hayden's mother made this her final goal in life. At the opening of the story, Aerie's sun is nearly finished, and the construction team was planning a test to assure of its functionality. Hayden gets out of his job as an apprentice in a kitchen, intending to watch the test from a jet bike. However, airships flying Slipstream's flag appear on the horizon and begin to attack the new sun. Aerie's resistance starts to defend themselves from the assault, but don't appear to be a true match against the highly trained Slipstreamers. In a suicidal last-ditch effort, Hayden's mother and the construction crew start the sun while inside of it, incinerating the ships attacking the sun itself but allowing at least one reported Slipstream ship to have escaped. During the fighting, Hayden is thrown off the town's spinning wheel and, as the first chapter leaves him, floating weightlessly in the darkness, where pirates call home and no suns or true governments have been established. Years later, the story picks up again with Venera Fanning (wife of Admiral Chaison Fanning of Slipstream fame) and her page walking down the hall to the office of the Admiralty in Rush, capital of Slipstream. Venera reminisces on another times, years ago, when she was walking down this hall and a bullet ripped through her jaw line, and she was left bleeding on the floor with no one around. She enters the office, and then continues to the bathroom, where she holds a secret meeting with an informant and a few others. Bleeding and exhausted, the informant shows Venera pictures of a secret dock and ship building facility of a rival nation, Falcon Formation, in a sargasso, which is an area where there is a build up of toxic gases that no one can enter without a specially designed sargasso suit. One of the pictures shows a frightfully large dreadnought approximately 3 km in length, as well as many other warships. Venera leaves the meeting and returns to her waiting page. As they walk out of the crowded office, the page accidentally bumps into Venera, knocking the pictures out of her hands. Venera then catches the page staring at the pictures of the dreadnought as they collect them off the floor. After she dismisses it as awe, they step outside, when the page gives his approximation and explanation of the length of the dreadnought. After the page flies Venera back to the Fanning household, he curses himself for his failure to get inside the house, and the page is revealed to be Hayden Griffin, who intends to kill Admiral Fanning for revenge. However, Griffin learns that Fanning was not present in Slipstream's attack of Aerie. Admiral Fanning is instructed by the Slipstream Pilot to move his fleet against Mavery but decides to divert part of the fleet including the ship Rook to attack the hidden Falcon Formation ship dock. Instead of moving there directly, Fanning decides to make a detour in order to recover the fabled treasure of Antene, the map to which is hidden in the Winding Tree of Fate artifact which, in turn, is stored in a station on Virga's skin. On the Rook, Griffin learns that the ship's armorer, Aubri Mahallan, is from outside Virga. She explains that the outside world is governed by Artificial Nature, apparently an artificial intelligence possessing vast power. However, some systems of Candesce, Virga's largest sun, disrupt Artificial Nature and prevent it from entering Virga. While passing icebergs that formed on the inside of Virga's skin, the fleet is attacked by winter pirates which are repelled by dislodging icebergs that then are drawn by gravity towards the center of Virga. During the fight, the Rook is boarded by pirates. Venera Fanning kills the Rook's captain and some of its crew as they try to scuttle the ship. Both Venera Fanning and Mahallan are taken prisoner by the pirate captain Dentius but regain control of the ship later. After retrieving the Tree of Fate, Admiral Fanning reveals that the treasure of Antene includes the key to Candesce and therefore means to turn off Candesce's disruption systems. He intends to temporarily shut off these systems in order to use radar while fighting Falcon Formation's ships. Mahallan is building the radar units. The treasure of Antene is located in Leaf's Choir, a sargasso near Gehellen. On the way, Mahallan explains to Griffin that Admiral Fanning had opposed the destruction of Aerie's sun. It was Slipstream's Pilot who led the attack, later presenting Fanning as the head behind it. Mahallan also explains that she was exiled to Virga because of her trying to overthrow Artificial Nature. Mahallan and Griffin become lovers. Having retrieved the key to Candesce, Venera Fanning, Mahallan, and Griffin eventually gain control of the sun while Admiral Fanning fights Falcon Formation. Mahallan disables Candesce's countermeasures, enabling Fanning to hit Falcon Formation hard. However, he is forced to steer his ship into the Formation's dreadnought. In Candesce, it is revealed that Mahallan is wired by Artificial Nature, forcing her to keep the countermeasures down. This enables Artificial Nature to invade Virga. Fanning kills Mahallan and re-enables Candesce's countermeasures. Griffin flees from Candesce which is about to re- ignite. He wants Fanning to accompany him but she declines, fearing that he wants to kill her as revenge for her killing his lover. At the last moment, she clings to Griffin's bike, to launch off it later after steering clear of the sun. Reception Sun of Suns is a 2007 Aurora finalist and a Kirkus Best Book of 2006 .

Harkins in February 1832.George W. Harkins, \\"Farewell Letter to the American People\\", 1832. The American Indian, December 1926. Reprinted in Great Documents in American Indian History, edited by Wayne Moquin with Charles Van Doren. New York: DaCapo Press. 1995; 151. It denounced the removal of the Choctaw Nation to Oklahoma. It also marked the beginning of a large process that would remove Native Americans who were living east of Mississippi, the Trail of Tears. Harkins wrote the letter to explain what it feels like to leave one's ancestral homes to satisfy the desires of others. The letter is still considered one of the most important documents in Native American history: Background Arthur H. DeRosier claims the reason Choctaws were removed from their settled land is difficult to understand, because the history does not \\"reveal any major provocation by these Indians, or moral justification by the United States. The Choctaws were one of the largest tribes in the Mississippian area, and they were one of the first to be removed by the US treaty. The Choctaw tribe had created an economic system where they were prosperous with their own materials, and they were not dependent on the United States government for their wealth and their ability to survive. Their ability to sustain themselves without the assistance of the United States government only added to the confusion surrounding the necessity of the movement. Despite the economic success of the Choctaw Nation, the White American settlers had an insatiable desire to have more land in the West. This desire mixed with the fear of an Indian attack left Native Americans across the region targets for removal. This desire extended across the majority of White settlers, which can be noted by the hundreds of settlers who applauded President Jackson for his definitive solution to the Indian Problem. For President Calhoun, removing the Choctaw nation first would benefit his overall moderate removal policy. The successful removal of a strong nation like the Choctaw would force other Indian groups to Consider their own removal to the West. The Treaty of the Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed on September 27, 1830. It was ratified by a vote of thirty-five to twelve. The treaty said that the Choctaws would leave in three separate groups over the course of three years. Prior to the signing of the treaty, nine other treaties occurred between the dates of 1802 and 1830. In response to the ratification of the treaty, the Choctaw people elected new leaders for their nation because they felt as though their Previous leaders, Greenwood Leflore and Mushulatubbee, had led them astray. Harkins was elected for the Northwestern Choctaws. Between the time that the treaty was ratified and placed into action, Harkins worked with the Choctaw population to register them as citizens of the United States so that they could stay on their land. In February 1832, the second group, including Harkins, of Choctaws boarded the Huron steamboat. Aboard the ship, Harkins drafted his open letter. Content It had three major parts: * It spoke out against the settlers for promising better relations with the Choctaw Nation but continuing to wrong them with their treaties. * Harkins admitted defeat believing that the only way for the Indian person to survive was to \\"form a government assimilated to that of our white brethren\\". * The letter asked why this tragedy happened to the Choctaw Nation, who had been peaceful with the white settlers and had even fought alongside them, in the Creek War of 1813. Aftermath The removal was only the first of the many Indian removal processes that would take place. The letter was only one of several letters that would be written from members of the Natives to the white settlers. It was written before several thousand Indians took the five-month journey after leaving Mississippi. Many people were ill by the time they reached Indian Territory, and many other natives who would be forced into the removal process would die. The US government realized that the cost of moving the Indians was \\"two to three times the original estimate\\". After the removal of the Choctaw tribe, Jackson continued to put policies in motion that would continue to remove Natives east of the Mississippi River. That created the removal process known as the Trail of Tears and the removal of five different tribal nations. The Creek, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Seminole Nations were removed after the Choctaw were. Impact The \\"Farewell Letter to the American People\\" is one of many public letters that was written during this removal era. The continued use of using public writing as a platform for telling the Indian story was questioned. The desire for more stories about the \\"tragic hero\\" became requested. Letters like it and others with defiant speeches were in decline by 1840. Letters like it were written and publicized frequently between 1774 and 1871. They provided an opportunity for Native Americans to create an open discourse surrounding Indian issues. They would be read by both Natives and whites. Phillip J. Round describes this as a way to engage with the imaginary public. Engaging with the public in that way deemed native tribes as being more civilized and intellectual. Writing letters like this also allowed an accurate depiction of the native experience to be publicized and accepted by the white population in the United States. The letter and its connection to the Choctaw tribe removal were also seen as a tragedy by some of the local newspapers. Although that occurred, people who believed it to be a tragedy were in the minority. It was only much later in the history, around the late 1950s, that people began to see the indigenous removal as a tragedy sparked by the desires of whites See also * Greenwood Leflore * Choctaw Trail of Tears * George W.

A facsimile mounted on its rollers The Joshua Roll is a Byzantine illuminated manuscript of highly unusual format, probably of the 10th century Macedonian Renaissance,\\"The 10th- century Joshua Roll is interesting as an example of Byzantine illuminated manuscript that shows the tenacious influence of Greco-Roman painting.\\" Excerpted from \\"painting, Western.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 12 January 2007. believed to have been created by artists of the Imperial workshops in Constantinople,\\"These illustrated book rolls could well have been derived from classical triumph columns whose artistic contents were rediscovered at the time when our manuscript was made.

Gr. 431\\", in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana Form and content The Roll is in the form of a continuous horizontal scroll or rotulus, common in Chinese art, but all but unique in surviving examples of medieval Christian art.Most rotuli, illuminated or not, are vertical in format. It is made of several joined pieces of sheep vellum, is 31 cm high and about 10 metres long, and may be incomplete, as it starts with Chapter II and ends with Chapter X.Facsimiles of Illuminated Manuscripts of the Medieval PeriodSchapiro, however, wonders if the manuscript, which covers Joshua's main military campaigns, was ever intended to be longer than it is. Chapters II‚ÄìX according to Schapiro, I‚ÄìXII according to Carleton College below. The Roll covers the early part of the Old Testament Book of Joshua using a reduced version of the Septuagint text; it includes Joshua's main military successes, ending with conquered kings paying him homage. At roughly this time, the Byzantine empire was enjoying military success in its campaigns in the Holy Land. It was originally painted in grisaille, by several artists, with partial coloring added later in a separate stage. The lettering is in majuscule and minuscule forms. Style Like the Paris Psalter, with which it is usually discussed, it is heavily classicising in style, though the extent to which this represents a revival or copying from a much earlier model is the subject of much debate. Its origins have been much debated by art historians, and the roll is considered to be \\"one of the most important and difficult problems of Byzantine art.\\" \\"The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance\\" ‚Äì (a review of the named book by Kurt Weitzmann.) Review written by Adolf Katzenellenbogen. Published in Speculum, Vol. 26, No. 2. (Apr. 1951), pp. 421‚Äì425. The roll itself is usually acknowledged to be of the 10th century AD, but the images are felt by most art historians to derive from one or more earlier works, perhaps going back as far as Late Antiquity. The subject produced a sharp disagreement between Kurt Weitzmann, who thought the form of the roll was a classicising invention of the Macedonian Renaissance, and Meyer Schapiro, who, whilst agreeing with Weitzmann on a 10th-century date, held to the more traditional view that painted rotuli existed in Late Antiquity, and that the roll was essentially copied from such a work, perhaps through intermediaries.The Place of the Joshua Roll in Byzantine History (1949) and The Frescoes of Castelseprio (1952 & 1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto & Windus, London, (or all on JSTOR). The images are clearly closely related to later manuscripts of the Octateuch or first eight books of the Old Testament,\\"Now believed to have been assembled in the tenth century on the basis of earlier, individual miniatures adorning volumes of the Octateuch (first eight books of the Bible: Genesis ‚Äì Deuteronomy and Ruth, Joshua, and Judges), the Joshua Roll presents the illustrated text of the first twelve chapters of the biblical book of Joshua, when Joshua is most active and successful in his conquests.\\". but where and when the compositions for the cycle originated is controversial.See Schapiro, Castelseprio op cit. Steven Wander, professor at the University of Connecticut, claims the images are slanted at ten degrees, in a continuous frieze along the ten meters of the roll. He suggests this may be because the roll was a copy of the actual preparatory sketches or working drawings for a real column, possibly to scale, like the bronze Easter column (Latin 'colonna') for Bishop Bernward in Hildesheim.in the Stamford Times Professor re-examines mysterious document See also *Macedonian Renaissance *Castelseprio ‚Äì Frescoes in a related style *Utrecht Psalter *Leo Bible Notes References *Walther, Ingo F. and Norbert Wolf.

Donaldson, the first book of The Gap Cycle series. Synopsis The patrons of a bar on a mining space station are struck by an unusual scene. Angus Thermopyle, an evil but unsuccessful pirate, walks in with a beautiful woman on his arm. The woman, Morn Hyland, is a police officer and a great beauty. No one understands why she would associate with Angus, but the dominant theory is that she is somehow his captive. A dashing swashbuckler, Nick Succorso, confronts Angus and apparently rescues the woman. At the end of the first chapter, The narrator describes this as an iconic drama of captor, victim and rescuer, but the narrator tells us that this is not the real story. The more complicated truth unfolds over the rest of this novella. Morn Hyland, an ensign with the United Mining Companies Police (\\"UMCP\\"), is on her first mission aboard the UMCP destroyer Starmaster (which is crewed by members of her extended family). When they arrive at Com-Mine Station, a ship, Bright Beauty, piloted by the pirate Angus Thermopyle, flees, and Starmaster follows. In his haste, Angus left the station without picking up some essential supplies including air-scrubbers. Out of desperation Angus incinerates a small mining settlement in hopes of stealing their supplies. Starmaster witnesses this slaughter and attempts combat, but is almost destroyed by a massive internal explosion. Morn suffers from gap-sickness, a mental disorder that inflicts itself on a small portion of people who travel through the Gap. Symptoms of gap-sickness vary wildly; in Morn, it manifests itself as an uncontrollable urge to engage self-destruct, and is triggered by exposure to 'heavy g'. Morn, left alone on the auxiliary bridge when Starmaster engaged Angus' ship, experienced gap-sickness for the first time, and attempted to destroy the Starmaster. Angus boards the wreck hoping to salvage some air scrubbers, murders Morn's father (who had survived Morn's attempted self-destruct) and kidnaps Morn. Seeking both control of her gap-sickness, and Morn herself, Angus places a zone implant - a remotely controlled electrode - onto her brain, which allows Angus to control Morn's every feeling and action. By giving Morn an unauthorized zone implant, Angus has committed a capital crime, and will be executed if he is caught. On the way back to Com-Mine, Angus activates Morn's zone implant, allowing him to repeatedly rape and abuse her. Unwittingly, he also starts to form an emotional attachment to her. Back at the station, Morn makes contact with another pirate - Nick Succorso, captain and owner of the ship Captain's Fancy, who she sees as a potential rescuer. She aids Nick in framing Angus for stealing station supplies, and Angus is arrested. Background Donaldson explains one of the intents in writing this first book, which was originally to be only a stand-alone novella, was to present the three classic archetypes of victim, villain & hero and then have them exchange roles. Here, we start with Morn as the damsel, Angus as villain and Nick as the hero. Then as the story develops over the course of the series, Morn is elevated to hero, Nick becomes the villain and Angus becomes a victim of sorts.

It is commonly called Oronamin C or Oronamin. Its name is similar to the Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. product \\"Arinamin\\" and its name comes from Otsuka's own and its main ingredient, vitamin C. Oronamin C was named after the Oronine H Ointment in hopes that it would prove to be equally successful. Product summary Oronamin C was introduced in February 1965 and was initially sold in a 120 ml glass bottle sealed with a bottle cap. It contains isoleucine and many other essential amino acids as well as many vitamins such as vitamin B2, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. It is not only available in supermarkets and convenience stores in Japan, but also in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. vending machines as well. The bottle cap was briefly replaced with a screw bottle cap, but following a nationwide scare during the 1980s regarding a large number of poisoned sealed bottled beverages, this screw cap was replaced with a one-time \\"pull-cap,\\" which cannot be re-sealed after opening. Child welfare activist Osamu Mizutani (Ê∞¥Ë∞∑ ‰øÆ Mizutani Osamu, born May 8, 1956) wrote that the previous screw caps allowed individuals to put in paint thinner and then re-seal the bottles. In 2000, a \\"sister\\" product was introduced. It contains royal jelly and propolis extracts. While originally sold as a medical health drink with carbonation added, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare filed a claim resulting in the judgement that Oronamin C could not be labeled as a medical health drink. This was a difficult time for Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., but before long, the television advertisement featuring comedian Kon Omura (Â§ßÊùëÂ¥ë ≈åmura Kon, born November 1, 1931) became recognizable nationwide, and Oronamin C grew into a best-selling health drink in Japan. In the past, many competing companies have introduced similar health drinks in an attempt to topple the current market oligopoly, but so far, none have been successful (see #Similar products). Commercials Oronamin C's slogan is . The initial spokesperson for this campaign was comedian Kon Omura. This campaign appeared for about 10 years. In the mid-1960s television advertisements and enamel billboards were used for marketing Oronamin along with other Otsuka Group products. Japanese baseball players from the Yomiuri Giants also promoted Oronamin with the phrase . The tagline was also used in some advertisements. The popular Japanese singing group SMAP's songs became featured in Oronamin commercials in 1994 and 1995. Around 2001, a television campaign called \\"Let's find the Yujiro of the 21st century!\\" debuted featuring actors from Ishihara International Productions, Inc.. Since then, many famous tarento have promoted Oronamin. Hideki Matsui worked as a spokesperson for sister product Oronamin C Royal Prolis during his career with the Yomiuri Giants. Another version of Oronamin television advertisements were broadcast along with the Giants version, featuring Y≈´z≈ç Kayama and the Southern All Stars. The campaign slogan was . Starting in 2004 a tie-in was established with the hit Japanese Kamen Rider Series. Actors Takayuki Tsubaki, Shigeki Hosokawa, Hiro Mizushima, Takeru Satoh, K≈çji Seto, and Masahiro Inoue; who appear in Kamen Rider Blade, Hibiki, Kabuto, Den-O, Kiva and Kamen Rider Decade; have promoted Oronamin with special television commercials. In 2009, the animators who did the Fresh Pretty Cure! series also did the same. 2015 saw Kamen Rider actors starring in commercials as a trio. These trios include Shun Nishime, Ryosuke Yamamoto and Hayato Isomura (Kamen Rider Ghost); Hiroki Iijima, Toshiki Seto and Ukyo Matsumoto (Kamen Rider Ex- Aid); Atsuhiro Inukai, Eiji Akaso and Kouhei Takeda (Kamen Rider Build); So Okuno, Gaku Oshida, and Keisuke Watanabe (Kamen Rider Zi-O); and Fumiya Takahashi, Ryutaro Okada, and Hiroe Igeta (Kamen Rider Zero-One). Current television commercials feature Japanese idol Aya Ueto as the main cast appearing along with a costar sports athlete or other celebrity. Aya's conversations with each celebrity are the topic of these commercials. The slogan also changed a little, to . Initially her co-stars answered \\"Of course!\\" but now answer .

The television advertisement introduced the shake with the copy \\"My older sister and I have Oronamin and juice. Mom puts in an egg and has an Oronamin shake. Dad has Oronamin and gin.\\" In 2004 a television advertisement featuring model Ai Tominaga (ÂÜ®Ê∞∏ÊÑõ Tominaga Ai, born August 1, 1983) and singer-songwriter Shigeru Izumiya (Ê≥âË∞∑„Åó„Åí„Çã Izumiya Shigeru, born May 11, 1948) reintroduced the Oronamin shake.

Ultimate Extras replaced the market role of Microsoft Plus!, a product sold for prior consumer releases of Microsoft Windows. According to Microsoft's Barry Goffe, the company's goal with Ultimate Extras was to delight customers who purchased the Ultimate edition of Windows Vista, the most expensive retail edition of the operating system. Windows Ultimate Extras have been discontinued as of Windows 7 and the operating system also removes all installed extras during an upgrade from Windows Vista Ultimate. Contents Microsoft released a total of nine Ultimate Extras for users of Windows Vista Ultimate. =BitLocker and EFS enhancements= The BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool utility and the Secure Online Key Backup utility were among the first Ultimate Extras to be made available, and were released to coincide with the general retail availability of Windows Vista. BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool prepares the hard drive to be encrypted with BitLocker, whereas Secure Online Key Backup enabled users to create an off-site backup of their BitLocker recovery password and Encrypting File System recovery certificates at Digital Locker, as part of the Windows Marketplace digital distribution platform. Secure Online Key Backup was rendered inoperable after Digital Locker shut down on August 2009. =Multilingual User Interface language packs= Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows Vista is language-independent; the language architecture separates the language resources for the user interface from the binary code of the operating system. Support for installing additional languages is included in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista. In the Ultimate edition, the functionality is made available through Windows Update as Ultimate Extras. Microsoft stated that 16 languages were made available on January 30, 2007. The company released the remaining language packs on October 23, 2007 for a total of 35 language packs. An additional 36th language pack version is available for Windows Vista that supports traditional Chinese characters with the Hong Kong encoding character set. =Microsoft Tinker= Microsoft Tinker is a puzzle game where players must navigate a robot through mazes and obstacles. A total of 60 levels are included, and players can create their own levels with a level editor. =Hold 'Em= The Hold 'Em game. Hold 'Em is a poker card game released on January 29, 2007 that is fundamentally similar to Texas hold 'em. Hold 'Em allows users to play against up to five computer players and up to three levels of difficulty, and also allows users to customize aspects of the game's appearance; the game relies on DirectX to produce hardware-accelerated 3D animations and effects. For optimal performance, Hold 'Em requires a computer with a Windows Experience Index rating of 2.0 or higher. According to Paul Thurrott, Hold 'Em was originally intended to be bundled alongside the premium games‚ÄîChess Titans, Mahjong Titans, and InkBall‚Äîincluded by default with the Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista, but was instead made an Ultimate Extra because of its gambling themes. =Windows sound schemes= A total of three sound schemes for Windows Vista were released: Ultimate Extras Glass, Ultimate Extras Pearl, and Microsoft Tinker. The first two were made available on April 22, 2008, while the latter was made available on the same day as Microsoft Tinker. The Glass and Pearl sound schemes are similar to the Default sound scheme included in Windows Vista as they were also developed in accordance with the design language and principles of the Windows Aero graphical user interface. =Windows DreamScene= Windows DreamScene is a utility that enables MPEG and WMV videos to be displayed as desktop backgrounds. DreamScene requires that the Windows Aero graphical user interface be enabled in order to function as the feature relies on the Desktop Window Manager to display videos on the desktop. =Proposed extras= Additional extras were also proposed but not released, including a podcast creation application, a game performance optimization utility, custom themes, exclusive access to online content and services, Windows Movie Maker effects and transitions, templates for Windows DVD Maker, digital publications, and the Group Shot photo manipulation application developed by Microsoft Research and shown by Bill Gates at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2007. Although not considered to be Ultimate Extras by the company, the Ultimate Extras team also released two wallpapers for users of Windows Vista Ultimate. Titled Start and Strands, the wallpapers were based on the design of the Windows Vista Ultimate retail packaging and were made available in three different display resolutions. Critical reception Reaction to Windows Ultimate Extras was mixed. While Microsoft was praised for creating a value proposition for users who purchased the most expensive edition of Windows Vista, the company was criticized for its delays during delivery of updates, perceived lack of quality of delivered updates, and a lack of transparency regarding their development. Early on, there were concerns that the features would not live up to users' expectations. The company announced several Ultimate Extras in January 2007, but only a fraction of these were released five months later. After months without an official update since January, Microsoft released an apology for the delays, stating that it intended to ship the remaining features before the end of summer of 2007. The delays between consecutive updates and months of silence had led to speculation that the development team within the company responsible for the features had been quietly disbanded. When Microsoft announced its intentions to release the remaining Ultimate Extras and released an apology for delays, Paul Thurrott stated that the company had \\"dropped the ball\\" with the features. Ed Bott wrote that Ultimate Extras were \\"probably the biggest mistake Microsoft made with Vista,\\" and that the company would downplay the Ultimate edition of Windows 7 as a result. Bott would later list them among his \\"decade's worth of Windows mistakes.\\" Microsoft was also criticized for changing the description for Ultimate Extras within the operating system. The offerings slated to be made available were initially described as \\"cutting-edge programs,\\" \\"innovative services,\\" and \\"unique publications,\\" but the description for the features within the Control Panel applet was later modified in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 to be more modest; this was interpreted as an attempt made by the company to avoid fulfilling prior expectations. Emil Protalinski of Ars Technica wrote that the Ultimate edition of Windows Vista \\"would have looked just fine without the joke that is 'Ultimate Extras'\\" and that the features were supposed to provide an incentive for consumers to purchase that edition, \\"not give critics something to point and laugh at.\\" In the second part of his review of Windows 7, Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that \\"the value proposition of the Ultimate Extras was nothing short of piss-poor.\\" Bright would later criticize Microsoft's decision not to release Internet Explorer 10 for Windows Vista, but would go on to state that this was still \\"not as bad as the Ultimate Extras farce.\\" See also * Windows Anytime Upgrade * Windows Easy Transfer * Windows Vista editions References Category:Discontinued Windows components Ultimate Extras ","title":"Windows Ultimate Extras"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",H]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/65.md","filePath":"quotes/65.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/65.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{L as __pageData,E as default};
