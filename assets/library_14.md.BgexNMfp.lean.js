She bears similarities to other White Ladies in British folklore. The Tale The Chetwynd Park estate was once home to the Pigott family. Squire Pigott was a neglectful husband. When Madam Pigott did fall pregnant, the birth was not an easy one. Her doctor explained to Squire Pigott that he was unable to save the lives of both his wife and baby. Upon hearing this, the squire said only that \\"one should lop the root to save the branch.\\" However, the doctor's efforts were unsuccessful and both mother and child died. Madame Pigott's spirit returned, unable to rest due to her husband's words. Every night at midnight, she appeared from a skylight of the Old Rectory in Chetwynd. Some of her favorite places were Cheney Hill, which became known as Madame Pigott's Hill, and a twisted tree-root called Madam Pigott's Armchair. She might be seen walking the road between Edgmond and Newport or sitting and combing her baby's hair. If a rider passed through the area, Madam Pigott would leap onto the horse behind him. Her spirit was unable to cross water, so when the rider crossed a stream, she would let go. The spirit was so well known in the area that twelve churchmen assembled to read Psalms and exorcise her. All but one of the clergymen gave in to exhaustion, leaving only Mr. Foy of Edgmond to continue reading. The prayers worked, but years after Foy's death, the ghost returned and had to be \\"laid\\" once more. Georgina Frederica Jackson, who recorded the tale, mentioned an informant living in 1883 who claimed to have personally seen the ghost. \\"Madame Piggott\\" sightings have been recorded as recently as 2014. She has been said to appear around the A41 road between Newport and Market Drayton. Other Versions In a Romani version of the tale, the ghost is \\"Miss Pigott,\\" who died thrown from a horse at Chetwynd End. People successfully \\"laid\\" her by trapping her spirit in a bottle and throwing it into Chetwynd Pool. During a skating accident some time later, the bottle resurfaced and broke. Miss Pigott returned and plagued riders by leaping onto their horses. Twelve priests set out to exorcise her. Eleven were exhausted, but the oldest priest encouraged them and they managed to bottle the spirit a second time. The Silky of Black Heddon is a similar White Lady. She had a preferred tree known as the Silky's Chair. She was also said to lurk in deserted roads, where she would climb on behind passing horsemen.

It is considered the market leader in providing translation software across the entire translation supply chain, including freelance translators, language service providers, corporate language departments and academic institutions. Alongside SDL Trados Studio, SDL also develops productivity tools SDL MultiTerm and SDL Passolo. History Trados GmbH was founded as a language-service provider (LSP) in 1984 by Jochen Hummel and Iko Knyphausen in Stuttgart, Germany. The company began developing translation software in the late 1980s, and released the first Windows versions of two of the suite's major components in the early 1990s – MultiTerm in 1992, and Translator's Workbench in 1994. In 1997, the company received a major boost when Microsoft decided to use Trados for its internal localization needs. Trados was acquired by SDL in 2005. Configuration SDL Trados Studio is delivered with several tools and applications. These are: ;SDL Trados Studio: The main application providing a complete environment to edit or review translations, manage translation projects, organize terminology, and connect to machine translation. ;SDL MultiTerm: A terminology management tool that is integrated with SDL Trados Studio for adding, editing and managing terms. ;SDL AppStore: SDL Trados Studio includes several applications on an online marketplace which offers apps to help with a range of translation processes, for example further file format support and task automation. Supported source document formats SDL Trados Studio supports over 70 different file types, including: various markup and tagged formats such as SGML, XML, HTML, XLIFF, SDLXLIFF (Studio's native format for translation), OpenDocument files; straight text files; source code files, such as Java and Microsoft .NET; Microsoft Word, Excel, Bilingual Excel and PowerPoint; and some Adobe file formats, such as PDF, scanned PDF (OCR is included), FrameMaker, InDesign, and InCopy.  Handling of translation memories and glossaries  The translation memory (TM) format of SDL Trados Studio is SDLTM, which consists in a particular SQLite database.SDL SDK API Help files When creating a new (file-based) translation memory, SDL Trados Studio creates a database file in which all translation units are stored. The translation memory also stores structural and context information to link all the different segments and their position in a document. This allows the tool to select the most relevant translation memory segment. *Main translation memory database file: .sdltm In previous version of Trados a neural network of files that enable fuzzy search capability was also created. A new translation memory consists of five new files: *Main translation memory database file: .tmw *Neural network files: .mdf, *.mtf, *.mwf, *.iix When copying a translation memory, you must copy all five translation memory files. Otherwise, Translator's Workbench displays an error message when opening the copied translation memory. SDL Trados Studio can also work with server-based translation memories by connecting to SDL Trados GroupShare. It can also connect to other Translation Providers created through the API by any developer, many examples of these can be found on the SDL AppStore. Glossaries are handled by the MultiTerm application. Glossaries can be bilingual or multi-lingual, file-based or Server based.  Integration of machine translation and postediting SDL Trados Studio has integrated machine translation and postediting into its translation workflow. If the appropriate parameter setting is made, SDL Trados Studio will insert a machine translation of a translation unit (TU) if no match is found in the translation memory. The translator can then post-edit the machine translation for added clarity. SDL Trados currently supports the following MT systems: Language Weaver, SDL BeGlobal, SDL LanguageCloud and Google Translate. SDL Trados Studio also supports the integration of Microsoft Translator and other MT system through its open API and plugin architecture on the SDL OpenExchange. SDL AppStore In December 2010 SDL launched the SDL OpenExchange, now known as SDL AppStore, a web portal allowing independent developers to leverage the software's open architecture to create applications and plug-ins for SDL Trados Studio. Apps can be downloaded to add functionality missing from the base product, such as legacy file support and new machine translation plugins. As of the end of August 2017 there has been over a million downloads of apps from the store. Today the SDL AppStore supports the needs of users through the ability to download and install additional functionality that often addresses niche requirements that cannot be solved in any translation tool. It also supports the needs of developers who use the APIs that are freely available for the products to integrate and add new features that support their own business needs. The SDL team supporting the SDL AppStore also maintain a github site where they provide opensource code using the APIs for many of the apps they have created on the SDL AppStore. This provides a very useful resource for developers looking for additional examples of how to use the APIs in practice. Market share According to a 2004 survey by the World Bank, Trados held an estimated 75% global market share with SDL holding an additional 10%. According to the ICU Translation Memory Survey from 2006, SDL Trados is used by a total of 75% of surveyed users - 51% used Trados with a further 24% SDL Trados (See table 21). A survey done by ProZ.com in 2013 indicated that 73% of ProZ translators have SDL Trados. Community and compatibility A number of solutions have been created for handling the different versions of Trados file formats. SDL did apparently respond to user complaints of licensing complexity and problems by simplifying the licensing scheme used in the SDL Trados Studio 2011 Freelance release. Successive versions of SDL Trados Studio have resolved the backward compatibility issues. SDL have also launched and maintain their own community which is actively used to support their customers in an open environment across every product in their portfolio.

Developed in response to the Great Recession, the primary objective of this federal statute was to save existing jobs and create new ones as soon as possible. Other objectives were to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy. The approximate cost of the economic stimulus package was estimated to be $787 billion at the time of passage, later revised to $831 billion between 2009 and 2019. The ARRA's rationale was based on the Keynesian economic theory that, during recessions, the government should offset the decrease in private spending with an increase in public spending in order to save jobs and stop further economic deterioration. Surveys of economists show overwhelming agreement that the stimulus reduced unemployment. In a 2014 IGM Forum survey, only one economist disagreed that the stimulus had lowered unemployment. The survey also showed majority support for the notion that the benefits of the stimulus outweighed the costs, with only two economists disagreeing. The politics around the stimulus was very contentious. On the right, it spurred the Tea Party movement and may have contributed to Republicans winning the House in the 2010 midterms. Not a single Republican member of the House voted for the stimulus. Only three Republican Senators voted for it. On the left, there were criticisms that the stimulus was watered down and did not do enough. Economist Paul Krugman argued that the stimulus was far smaller than the economic crisis warranted.  Legislative history  Both the House and the Senate versions of the bills were primarily written by Democratic Congressional committee leaders and their staffs. Because work on the bills started before President Obama officially took office on January 20, 2009, top aides to President-Elect Obama held multiple meetings with committee leaders and staffers. On January 10, 2009, President-Elect Obama's administration released a report that provided a preliminary analysis of the impact to jobs of some of the prototypical recovery packages that were being considered. = House of Representatives assembly = Official seal of Recovery.gov, the official site of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The House version of the bill, , was introduced on January 26, 2009.Legislative Day of January 26, 2009 for the 111th Congress, First Session (Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives) It was sponsored by Democrat David Obey, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, and was co- sponsored by nine other Democrats. On January 23, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the bill was on track to be presented to President Obama for him to sign into law before February 16, 2009. Although 206 amendments were scheduled for floor votes, they were combined into only 11, which enabled quicker passage of the bill.cqpolitics.com On January 28, 2009, the House passed the bill by a 244–188 vote. All but 11 Democrats voted for the bill, and 177 Republicans voted against it (one Republican did not vote). = Senate = The Senate version of the bill, , was introduced on January 6, 2009, and later substituted as an amendment to the House bill, . It was sponsored by Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, co-sponsored by 16 other Democrats and Joe Lieberman, an independent who caucused with the Democrats. The Senate then began consideration of the bill starting with the $275 billion tax provisions in the week of February 2, 2009. A significant difference between the House version and the Senate version was the inclusion of a one-year extension of revisions to the alternative minimum tax, which added $70 billion to the bill's total. Republicans proposed several amendments to the bill directed at increasing the share of tax cuts and downsizing spending as well as decreasing the overall price.See, for example: S.Amdt. 106, S.Amdt. 107, S.Amdt. 108, and S.Amdt. 109 President Obama and Senate Democrats hinted that they would be willing to compromise on Republican suggestions to increase infrastructure spending and to double the housing tax credit proposed from $7,500 to $15,000 and expand its application to all home buyers, not just first-time buyers. Other considered amendments included the Freedom Act of 2009, an amendment proposed by Senate Finance Committee members Maria Cantwell (D) and Orrin Hatch (R) to include tax incentives for plug-in electric vehicles.cantwell.senate.gov The Senate called a special Saturday debate session for February 7 at the urging of President Obama. The Senate voted, 61–36 (with 2 not voting) on February 9 to end debate on the bill and advance it to the Senate floor to vote on the bill itself. On February 10, the Senate voted 61–37 (with one not voting)Senator Judd Gregg (R) did not vote because, at the time, he was a nominee of the Democratic president to become Secretary of Commerce. Gregg also did not participate in the cloture vote. All the Democrats voted in favor, but only three Republicans voted in favor (Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, and Arlen Specter). Specter switched to the Democratic Party later in the year. At one point, the Senate bill stood at $838 billion. = Comparison of the House, Senate and Conference versions = President Barack Obama signs the ARRA into law on February 17, 2009 in Denver, Colorado. Vice President Joe Biden stands behind him. President Barack Obama speaks about the 2,000th project approved through the ARRA. The president is joined by Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood. Senate Republicans forced a near unprecedented level of changes (near $150 billion) in the House bill, which had more closely followed the Obama plan. A comparison of the $827 billion economic recovery plan drafted by Senate Democrats with an $820 billion version passed by the House and the final $787 billion conference version shows huge shifts within these similar totals. Additional debt costs would add about $350 billion or more over 10 years. Many provisions were set to expire in two years.\\"Stimulus bill far from perfect, Obama says\\" NBC News The main funding differences between the Senate bill and the House bill were: More funds for health care in the Senate ($153.3 vs $140 billion), renewable energy programs ($74 vs. $39.4 billion), for home buyers tax credit ($35.5 vs. $2.6 billion), new payments to the elderly and a one- year increase in AMT limits. The House had more funds appropriated for education ($143 vs. $119.1 billion), infrastructure ($90.4 vs. $62 billion) and for aid to low income workers and the unemployed ($71.5 vs. $66.5 billion).  Spending (Senate – $552 billion, House – $545 billion)  * Aid to low income workers and the unemployed  Senate – $47 billion to provide extended unemployment benefits through December 31, increased by $25 a week, and provide job training; $16.5 billion to increase food stamp benefits by 12 percent through fiscal 2011 and issue a one-time bonus payment; $3 billion in temporary welfare payments.  House – Comparable extension of unemployment insurance; $20 billion to increase food stamp benefits by 14 percent; $2.5 billion in temporary welfare payments; $1 billion for home heating subsidies and $1 billion for community action agencies. * Direct cash payments  Senate – $17 billion to give one-time $300 payments to recipients of Supplemental Security Income and Social Security, and veterans receiving disability and pensions.  House – $4 billion to provide a one-time additional Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance payment to the elderly, of $450 for individuals and $630 for married couples.  Conference – $250 one-time payment to each recipient of Supplemental Security Income, Social Security (Regular & Disability) Insurance, Veterans pension, Railroad Retirement, or State retirement systemConference report 111-16, Division B Title II 2/13/09 * Infrastructure  Senate – $46 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $11.5 billion for mass transit and rail projects; $4.6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers; $5 billion for public housing improvements; $6.4 billion for clean and drinking water projects.  House – $47 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $12 billion for mass transit, including $7.5 billion to buy transit equipment such as buses; and $31 billion to build and repair federal buildings and other public infrastructures. * Health care  Senate – $21 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the involuntarily unemployed under the COBRA program; $87 billion to help states with Medicaid; $22 billion to modernize health information technology systems; and $10 billion for health research and construction of National Institutes of Health facilities.  House – $40 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the involuntarily unemployed under the COBRA program or provide health care through Medicaid; $87 billion to help states with Medicaid; $20 billion to modernize health information technology systems; $4 billion for preventive care; $1.5 billion for community health centers; $420 million to combat avian flu; $335 million for programs that combat AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.  Conference – A 65% COBRA subsidy for 9 months will apply to workers laid off between Sep 1, 2008 and Dec 31, 2009. Those already laid off have 60 days to apply for COBRA.Conference report 111-16 * Education  Senate – $55 billion in state fiscal relief to prevent cuts in education aid and provide block grants; $25 billion to school districts to fund special education and the No Child Left Behind K–12 law; $14 billion to boost the maximum Pell Grant by $400 to $5,250; $2 billion for Head Start.  House – Similar aid to states and school districts; $21 billion for school modernization; $16 billion to boost the maximum Pell Grant by $500 to $5,350; $2 billion for Head Start.  Conference – The Conference Report merged most education aid with the State Fiscal Stabilization fund (administered by the Department of Education) and gave power over the funds to each governor under voluminous restrictions. The Governor is \\"Required\\" to spend $45 billion of the money on education to restore funding to 2008 levels but the mechanisms to enforce state maintenance of effort at 2005–06 levels are complex and potentially impossible to implement.Conference report 111-16, 2-13-09, Title 14 Hard hit states such as Nevada cannot possibly find enough funds to get to the 2005–06 state funding levels for education. Some states with no current budget cuts for education, such as Arkansas and North Carolina, may get nothing. This will result in a monumental 50 state legal and political fight over how to re-budget to best take advantage of the federal legislation. Many states will further reduce state funds for education to the 2005–06 minimum so these state resources can be used for other state priorities and the net gain for education will be far less than the total federal appropriation. * Energy  Senate – $40 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $2.9 billion to weatherize modest-income homes; $4.6 billion for fossil fuel research and development; $6.4 billion to clean up nuclear weapons production sites; $11 billion toward a smart electricity grid to reduce waste; $8.5 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy projects; and $2 billion for advanced battery systems.  House – $28.4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $6.2 billion to weatherize homes; $11 billion to fund a smart electricity grid. * Homeland security  Senate – $4.7 billion for homeland security programs, including $1 billion for airport screening equipment and $800 million for port security.  House – $1.1 billion, including $500 million for airport screening equipment. * Law enforcement  Senate – $3.5 billion in grants to state and local law enforcement to hire officers and purchase equipment.  House – Comparable provision.  Tax changes ($275 billion)   House – About $145 billion for $500 per-worker, $1,000 per-couple tax credits in 2009 and 2010. For the last half of 2009, workers could expect to see about $20 a week less withheld from their paychecks starting around June. Millions of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes could file returns next year and receive checks. Individuals making more than $75,000 and couples making more than $150,000 would receive reduced amounts.  Senate – The credit would phase out at incomes of $70,000 for individuals and couples making more than $140,000 and phase out more quickly, reducing the cost to $140 billion.  Conference – Tax Credit reduced to $400 per worker and $800 per couple in 2009 and 2010 and phaseout begins at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. Note retirees with no wages get nothing.House Conference report 111-? Final partially handwritten report released by Nancy Pelosi's Office 2/13/09 * Alternative minimum tax  House – No provision.  Senate – About $70 billion to prevent 24 million taxpayers from paying the alternative minimum tax in 2009. The tax was designed to make sure wealthy taxpayers can't use credits and deductions to avoid paying any taxes or paying at a far lower rate than would otherwise be possible. But it was never indexed to inflation, so critics now contend it taxes people it was not intended to. Congress addresses it each year, usually in the fall.  Conference – Includes a one-year increase in AMT floor to $70,950 for joint filers for 2009. * Expanded child credit  House – $18.3 billion to give greater access to the $1,000 per-child tax credit for low income workers in 2009 and 2010. Under current law, workers must make at least $12,550 to receive any portion of the credit. The change eliminates the floor, meaning more workers who pay no federal income taxes could receive checks.  Senate – Sets a new income threshold of $8,100 to receive any portion of the credit, reducing the cost to $7.5 billion.  Conference – The income floor for refunds was set at $3,000 for 2009 & 2010.House Conference report 111-16 2/13/09 * Expanded earned income tax credit  House – $4.7 billion to increase the earned income tax credit – which provides money to low income workers – for families with at least three children.  Senate – Same. * Expanded college credit  House – $13.7 billion to provide a $2,500 expanded tax credit for college tuition and related expenses for 2009 and 2010. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $160,000.  Senate – Reduces the amount that can be refunded to low-income families that pay no income taxes, lowering the cost to $13 billion. * Homebuyer credit  House – $2.6 billion to repeal a requirement that a $7,500 first-time homebuyer tax credit be paid back over time for homes purchased from Jan 1 to July 1, unless the home is sold within three years. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $150,000.  Senate – Doubles the credit to $15,000 for homes purchased for a year after the bill takes effect, increasing the cost to $35.5 billion.  Conference – $8,000 credit for all homes bought between 1/1/2009 and 12/1/2009 and repayment provision repealed for homes purchased in 2009 and held more than three years. * Home energy credit  House – $4.3 billion to provide an expanded credit to homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient in 2009 and 2010. Homeowners could recoup 30 percent of the cost up to $1,500 of numerous projects, such as installing energy-efficient windows, doors, furnaces and air conditioners.  Senate – Same.  Conference – Same. * Unemployment  House – No similar provision.  Senate – $4.7 billion to exclude from taxation the first $2,400 a person receives in unemployment compensation benefits in 2009.  Conference – Same as Senate * Bonus depreciation  House – $5 billion to extend a provision allowing businesses buying equipment such as computers to speed up its depreciation through 2009.  Senate – Similar. * Money-losing companies  House – $15 billion to allow companies to use current losses to offset profits made in the previous five years, instead of two, making them eligible for tax refunds.  Senate – Allows companies to use more of their losses to offset previous profits, increasing the cost to $19.5 billion.  Conference – Limits the carry-back to small companies, revenue under $5 million * Government contractors  House – Repeal a law that takes effect in 2011, requiring government agencies to withhold three percent of payments to contractors to help ensure they pay their tax bills. Repealing the law would cost $11 billion over 10 years, in part because the government could not earn interest by holding the money throughout the year.  Senate – Delays the law from taking effect until 2012, reducing the cost to $291 million. * Energy production  House – $13 billion to extend tax credits for renewable energy production.  Senate – Same.  Conference – Extension is to 2014. * Repeal bank credit  House – Repeal a Treasury provision that allowed firms that buy money-losing banks to use more of the losses as tax credits to offset the profits of the merged banks for tax purposes. The change would increase taxes on the merged banks by $7 billion over 10 years.  Senate – Same.  House – $36 billion to subsidize locally issued bonds for school construction, teacher training, economic development and infrastructure improvements.  Senate – $22.8 billion to subsidize locally issued bonds for school construction, industrial development and infrastructure improvements. * Auto sales  House – No similar provision.  Senate – $11 billion to make interest payments on most auto loans and sales tax on cars deductible.  Conference – $2 billion for deduction of sales tax, not interest payments phased out for incomes above $250,000.Conference Report 111-16, 2-13-09 = Conference report = Congressional negotiators said that they had completed the Conference Report on February 11. On February 12, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer scheduled the vote on the bill for the next day, before wording on the bill's content had been completed and despite House Democrats having previously promised to allow a 48-hour public review period before any vote. The Report with final handwritten provisions was posted on a House website that evening. On February 13, the Report passed the House, 246–183, largely along party lines with all 246 Yes votes given by Democrats and the Nay vote split between 176 Republicans and 7 Democrats. The Senate passed the bill, 60–38, with all Democrats and Independents voting for the bill along with three Republicans. On February 17, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Recovery Act into law. recovery.gov Note that there are deviations in how some sources allocate spending and tax incentives and loans to different categories  Provisions of the Act  Composition of the Act: Tax incentives – includes $15 B for Infrastructure and Science, $61 B for Protecting the Vulnerable, $25 B for Education and Training and $22 B for Energy, so total funds are $126 B for Infrastructure and Science, $142 B for Protecting the Vulnerable, $78 B for Education and Training, and $65 B for Energy. State and Local Fiscal Relief – Prevents state and local cuts to health and education programs and state and local tax increases. Section 3 of ARRA listed the basic intent behind crafting the law. This Statement of Purpose included the following: # To preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery. # To assist those most impacted by the recession. # To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health. # To invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits. # To stabilize State and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases. The Act specifies that 37% of the package is to be devoted to tax incentives equaling $288 billion and $144 billion, or 18%, is allocated to state and local fiscal relief (more than 90% of the state aid is going to Medicaid and education). The remaining 45%, or $357 billion, is allocated to federal spending programs such as transportation, communication, wastewater, and sewer infrastructure improvements; energy efficiency upgrades in private and federal buildings; extension of federal unemployment benefits; and scientific research programs. The following are details to the different parts of the final bill and an indivisual have to come with a store charge of $200 to $300(Refundable) that will be also added on amount.:recovery.gov = Tax incentives for individuals = Total: $237 billion * $116 billion: New payroll tax credit of $400 per worker and $800 per couple in 2009 and 2010.

A May 15, 2009, Washington Post article reported that the 'Buy American' provision of the stimulus package caused outrage in the Canadian business community, and that the government in Canada \\"retaliated\\" by enacting its own restrictions on trade with the U.S. On June 6, 2009, delegates at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities conference passed a resolution that would potentially shut out U.S. bidders from Canadian city contracts, in order to help show support for Prime Minister Stephen Harper's opposition to the \\"Buy American\\" provision. Sherbrooke Mayor Jean Perrault, president of the federation, stated, \\"This U.S. protectionist policy is hurting Canadian firms, costing Canadian jobs and damaging Canadian efforts to grow in the world-wide recession.\\" On February 16, 2010, the United States and Canada agreed on exempting Canadian companies from Buy American provisions, which would have hurt the Canadian economy.  Recommendations by economists  President Barack Obama announces the creation of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board on February 6, 2009. Economists such as Martin Feldstein, Daron Acemoğlu, National Economic Council director Larry Summers, and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winners Joseph StiglitzObama's $800bn stimulus may not be enough, Irish Times and Paul Krugman favored a larger economic stimulus to counter the economic downturn. While in favor of a stimulus package, Feldstein expressed concern over the act as written, saying it needed revision to address consumer spending and unemployment more directly. Just after the bill was enacted, Krugman wrote that the stimulus was too small to deal with the problem, adding, \\"And it's widely believed that political considerations led to a plan that was weaker and contains more tax cuts than it should have – that Mr. Obama compromised in advance in the hope of gaining broad bipartisan support.\\" Conservative economist John Lott was more critical of the government spending. On January 28, 2009, a full-page advertisement with the names of approximately 200 economists who were against Obama's plan appeared in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. This included Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates Edward C. Prescott, Vernon L. Smith, and James M. Buchanan. The economists denied the quoted statement by President Obama that there was \\"no disagreement that we need action by our government, a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy\\". Instead, the signers believed that \\"to improve the economy, policymakers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work, saving, investment and production. Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth.\\" The funding for this advertisement came from the Cato Institute. On February 8, 2009, a letter to Congress signed by about 200 economists in favor of the stimulus, written by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said that Obama's plan \\"proposes important investments that can start to overcome the nation's damaging loss of jobs\\", and would \\"put the United States back onto a sustainable long-term-growth path\\". This letter was signed by Nobel Memorial laureates Kenneth Arrow, Lawrence R. Klein, Eric Maskin, Daniel McFadden, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow. The New York Times published projections from IHS Global Insight, Moodys.com, Economy.com and Macroeconomic Advisers that indicated that the economy may have been worse without the ARRA. A 2019 study in the American Economic Journal found that the stimulus had a positive impact on the US economy, but that the positive impact would have been greater if the stimulus had been more frontloaded.  Congressional Budget Office reports  CBO estimates of the impact of the stimulus on GDP The CBO estimated ARRA would positively impact GDP and employment. It projected an increase in the GDP of between 1.4 percent and 3.8 percent by the end of 2009, between 1.1 percent and 3.3 percent by the end of 2010, between 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent by the end of 2011, and a decrease of between zero and 0.2 percent beyond 2014. The impact to employment would be an increase of 0.8 million to 2.3 million by the end of 2009, an increase of 1.2 million to 3.6 million by the end of 2010, an increase of 0.6 million to 1.9 million by the end of 2011, and declining increases in subsequent years as the U.S. labor market reaches nearly full employment, but never negative. Decreases in GDP in 2014 and beyond are accounted for by crowding out, where government debt absorbs finances that would otherwise go toward investment. A 2013 study by economists Stephen Marglin and Peter Spiegler found the stimulus had boosted GDP in line with CBO estimates. A February 4, 2009, report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said that while the stimulus would increase economic output and employment in the short run, the GDP would, by 2019, have an estimated net decrease between 0.1% and 0.3% (as compared to the CBO estimated baseline). The CBO estimated that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $185 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, and by $134 billion in 2011, or $787 billion over the 2009–2019 period. In a February 11 letter, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf noted that there was disagreement among economists about the effectiveness of the stimulus, with some skeptical of any significant effects while others expecting very large effects. Elmendorf said the CBO expected short term increases in GDP and employment. In the long term, the CBO expects the legislation to reduce output slightly by increasing the nation's debt and crowding out private investment, but noted that other factors, such as improvements to roads and highways and increased spending for basic research and education may offset the decrease in output and that crowding out was not an issue in the short term because private investment was already decreasing in response to decreased demand. In February 2015, the CBO released its final analysis of the results of the law, which found that during six years:https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th- congress-2015-2016/reports/49958-ARRA.pdf * Real GDP was boosted by an average ranging from a low of 1.7% to a high of 9.2% * The unemployment rate was reduced by an average ranging from a low of 1.1 percentage points to a high of 4.8 percentage points * Full-time equivalent employment-years was boosted by an average ranging from 2.1 million to 11.6 million * Total outlays were $663 billion, of which $97 billion were refundable tax credits  Recovery.gov  Recovery.gov, the website created for this Act. A May 21, 2009, article in The Washington Post stated, \\"To build support for the stimulus package, President Obama vowed unprecedented transparency, a big part of which, he said, would be allowing taxpayers to track money to the street level on Recovery.gov...\\" But three months after the bill was signed, Recovery.gov offers little beyond news releases, general breakdowns of spending, and acronym-laden spreadsheets and timelines.\\" The same article also stated, \\"Unlike the government site, the privately run Recovery.org is actually providing detailed information about how the $787 billion in stimulus money is being spent.\\" Reports regarding errors in reporting on the Web site made national news. News stories circulated about Recovery.gov reporting fund distribution to congressional districts that did not exist. A recovery.gov plaque on public transport in Miami A new Recovery.gov website was redesigned at a cost estimated to be $9.5 million through January 2010. The section of the act that was intended to establish and regulate the operation of Recovery.gov was actually struck prior to its passage into law. Section 1226, which laid out provisions for the structure, maintenance, and oversight of the website were struck from the bill. Organizations that received stimulus dollars were directed to provide detailed reports regarding their use of these funds; these reports were posted on recovery.gov. On July 20, 2009, the Drudge Report published links to pages on Recovery.gov that Drudge alleged were detailing expensive contracts awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for items such as individual portions of mozzarella cheese, frozen ham and canned pork, costing hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars. A statement released by the USDA the same day corrected the allegation, stating that \\"references to '2 pound frozen ham sliced' are to the sizes of the packaging. Press reports suggesting that the Recovery Act spent $1.191 million to buy \\"2 pounds of ham\\" are wrong. In fact, the contract in question purchased 760,000 pounds of ham for $1.191 million, at a cost of approximately $1.50 per pound.\\" As of 2016, the servers for recovery.gov have been shut down and the site is unavailable.  Developments under the Act and estimates of the Act's effects  Chart of BLS job-loss data based on OFA's chart. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden speak to state legislators about the implementation of the Recovery Act on March 20, 2009. The Congressional Budget Office reported in October 2009 the reasons for the changes in the 2008 and 2009 deficits, which were approximately $460 billion and $1.41 trillion, respectively. The CBO estimated that ARRA increased the deficit by $200 billion for 2009, split evenly between tax cuts and additional spending, excluding any feedback effects on the economy.CBO Monthly Budget Review – October 2009 On February 12, 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which regularly issues economic reports, published job-loss data on a month-by-month basis since 2000. Organizing for America, a community organizing project of the Democratic National Committee, prepared a chart presenting the BLS data for the period beginning in December 2007. OFA used the chart to argue, \\"As a result [of the Recovery Act], job losses are a fraction of what they were a year ago, before the Recovery Act began.\\" Others argue that job losses always grow early in a recession and naturally slow down with or without government stimulus spending, and that the OFA chart was mis- leading. In the primary justification for the stimulus package, the Obama administration and Democratic proponents presented a graph in January 2009 showing the projected unemployment rate with and without the ARRA. The graph showed that if ARRA was not enacted the unemployment rate would exceed 9%; but if ARRA was enacted it would never exceed 8%. After ARRA became law, the actual unemployment rate exceeded 8% in February 2009, exceeded 9% in May 2009, and exceeded 10% in October 2009. The actual unemployment rate was 9.2% in June 2011 when it was projected to be below 7% with the ARRA. However, supporters of the ARRA claim that this can be accounted for by noting that the actual recession was subsequently revealed to be much worse than any projections at the time when the ARRA was drawn up.Projected Unemployment Rate According to a March 2009 Industry Survey of and by the National Association of Business Economists, 60.3% of their economists who had reviewed the fiscal stimulus enacted in February 2009 projected it would have a modest impact in shortening the recession, with 29.4% anticipating little or no impact as well as 10.3% predicting a strong impact. The aspects of the stimulus expected by the NABE to have the greatest effectiveness were physical infrastructure, unemployment benefits expansion, and personal tax-rate cuts.\\"NABE Panel: A Mixed Scorecard for Economic, Financial System Remedies\\" . National Association of Business Economists. March 2009. One year after the stimulus, several independent macroeconomic firms, including Moody's and IHS Global Insight, estimated that the stimulus saved or created 1.6 to 1.8 million jobs and forecast a total impact of 2.5 million jobs saved by the time the stimulus is completed. The Congressional Budget Office considered these estimates conservative. The CBO estimated according to its model 2.1 million jobs saved in the last quarter of 2009, boosting the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by up to 2.1 percent. The CBO projected that the package would have an even greater impact in 2010. The CBO also said, \\"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\\"Estimated Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output The CBO's report on the first quarter of 2010 showed a continued positive effect, with an employment gain in that quarter of up to 2.8 million and a GDP boost of up to 4.2 percent. Economists Timothy Conley of the University of Western Ontario and Bill Dupor of the Ohio State University found that while the stimulus' effects on public sector job creation were unambiguously positive, the effects on private sector job creation were ambiguous. Economist Dan Wilson of the Federal Reserve, who used similar methodology, without the same identified errors, estimates that \\"ARRA spending created or saved about 2 million jobs in its first year and over 3 million by March 2011.\\"Fiscal Spending Jobs Multipliers: Evidence from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-05-11. The CBO also revised its assessment of the long-term impact of the bill. After 2014, the stimulus is estimated to decrease output by zero to 0.2%. The stimulus is not expected to have a negative impact on employment in any period of time.CBO letter to Sen. Judd Gregg. February 11, 2010. http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9987/Gregg_Year- by-Year_Stimulus.pdf In 2011, the Department of Commerce revised some of its previous estimates. Economist Dean Baker commented: > [T]he revised data ... showed that the economy was plunging even more > rapidly than we had previously recognised in the two quarters following the > collapse of Lehman. Yet, the plunge stopped in the second quarter of 2009 – > just as the stimulus came on line. This was followed by respectable growth > over the next four quarters. Growth then weakened again as the impact of the > stimulus began to fade at the end of 2010 and the start of this year. In > other words, the growth pattern shown by the revised data sure makes it > appear that the stimulus worked. The main problem would seem to be that the > stimulus was not big enough and it wasn't left in place long enough to lift > the economy to anywhere near potential output. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) established a \\"Hypocrisy Hall of Fame\\" to list Republican Representatives who had voted against ARRA but who then sought or took credit for ARRA programs in their districts. As of September 2011, the DCCC was listing 128 House Republicans in this category. Newsweek reported that many of the Republican legislators who publicly argued that the stimulus would not create jobs were writing letters seeking stimulus programs for their districts on the grounds that the spending would create jobs. The stimulus has been criticized as being too small. In July 2010, a group of 40 prominent economists issued a statement calling for expanded stimulus programs to reduce unemployment. They also challenged the view that the priority should be reducing the deficit: \\"Making deficit reduction the first target, without addressing the chronic underlying deficiency of demand, is exactly the error of the 1930s.\\" In July 2010, the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that the stimulus had \\"saved or created between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs as of the second quarter of 2010\\".Council of Economic Advisers, \\"The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\\" , July 14, 2010, p. 1. At that point, spending outlays under the stimulus totaled $257 billion and tax cuts totaled $223 billion.Council of Economic Advisers, \\"The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\\" , July 14, 2010, p. 4. In July 2011, the CEA estimated that as of the first quarter of 2011,Council of Economic Advisers, \\"The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\\" , July 1, 2011, p. 1. the ARRA raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.4 and 3.6 million. The sum of outlays and tax cuts up to this point was $666 billion. Using a straight mathematical calculation, critics reported that the ARRA cost taxpayers between $185,000 to $278,000 per job that was created, though this computation does not include the permanent infrastructure that resulted. In August 2010, Republican Senators Tom Coburn and John McCain released a report listing 100 projects it described as the \\"most wasteful projects\\" funded by the Act. In total, the projects questioned by the two senators amounted to about $15 billion, or less than 2% of the $862 billion. The two senators did concede that the stimulus has had a positive effect on the economy, though they criticized it for failing to give \\"the biggest bang for our buck\\" on the issue of job creation. CNN noted that the two senators' stated objections were brief summaries presenting selective accounts that were unclear, and the journalists pointed out several instances where they created erroneous impressions. One of the primary purposes and promises of the Act was to launch a large number of \\"shovel ready\\" projects that would generate jobs. However, a sizable number of these projects, most of which pertained to infrastructure, took longer to implement than they had expected by most. This was largely attributed to the regulatory process that is involved in such projects. Some of the tax incentives in the Act, including those related to the American opportunity tax credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, were extended for a further two years by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. In November 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) updated its earlier reports concerning the Act. The CBO stated that \\"the employment effects began to wane at the end of 2010 and have continued to do so throughout 2011.\\" Nevertheless, in the third quarter of 2011, the CBO estimated that the Act had increased the number of full-time equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million. Section 1513 of the Recovery Act stated that reports on the impact of the act were to be submitted quarterly, however the last report issued occurred for the second quarter of 2011. As of December 2012, 58.6% of Americans are employed. In 2013, the Reason Foundation, an American libertarian group, conducted a study of the results of the ARRA. Only 23% of the 8,381 sampled companies hired new workers and kept all of them when the project was completed. Also, just 41% of sampled companies hired workers at all, while 30% of sampled companies did hire but laid off all workers once the government money stopped funding. These results cast doubt on previously stated estimates of job creation numbers, which do not factor those companies that did not retain their workers or hire any at all. In February 2014, the White House stated in a release that the stimulus measure saved or created an average of 1.6 million jobs a year between 2009 and 2012, thus averting having the recession descend into another Great Depression. Republicans, such as House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, criticized the report since, in their views, the Act cost too much for too little result.  Oversight and administration  In addition to the Vice President Biden's oversight role, a high-level advisory body, the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board (later renamed and reconstituted as the \\"President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness\\"), was named concurrent to the passage of the act. As well, the President named Inspector General of the United States Department of the Interior Earl Devaney and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) to monitor administration of the Act, and prevent low levels of fraud, waste and loss in fund allocation.Wolf, Paula, \\"Obama picks F&M; alum to oversee stimulus plan\\" , LancasterOnline, February 25, 2009. Eleven other inspectors general served on the RATB, and the board also had a Recovery Independent Advisory Panel. In late 2011, Devaney and his fellow inspectors general on RATB, and more who were not, were credited with avoiding any major scandals in the administration of the Act, in the eyes of one Washington observer.Alter, Jonathan, \\"Scandal in the Age of Obama\\", Washington Monthly, November/ December 2011. Retrieved December 28, 2011. In May 2016, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), launched the first steps of an investigation into a part of the stimulus law that gave grants to solar and green energy companies. Hatch sent a letter to the IRS and Treasury Department with a list of questions about the program. According to the Wall Street Journal, letters from senior senators who chair committees can lead to formal investigations by Congress. One part of the stimulus law, section 1603, gave cash grants to solar companies to encourage investment in solar technology. Because many companies didn't yet make a profit in 2009 in that industry, they were offered cash instead of tax credits. In September 2015, the U.S. government asked that a Spanish company return $1 million it had received from the program. The company issued a statement saying it fully complied with the request.

As a young man, \\"Maurie\\" Sheehy (as he was then known) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). As an older gentleman, Sheehy was a politician, better known as Patrick Sheehy. Sports notoriety Sheehy began his sports career at Collingwood in 1914. After just two games he crossed to Fairfield where he spent the 1915 football season. The Northcote District recruit returned to Collingwood the following year and went on to appear in four Grand Finals. A back pocket in their 1919 premiership team, Sheehy also participated in the club's losing 1918, 1920 and 1922 Grand Final sides. He left Collingwood to coach Northcote in 1923. Political career Sheehy joined the Labor Party in 1911. He was a Richmond, Australia city councillor (1934-1956); and twice mayor (from 1941–42 and 1951–52).

Life and career Wong was born in Hong Kong, and immigrated to Sydney, Australia with her family at the age of seven. Musically inclined from a young age, she learned to play the piano at age five and later she also learned the violin. At Kambala in Sydney, she sang alto in the choir and appeared in the school dramas (Gilbert & Sullivan & the like) and entered a number of piano competitions. She received an associate diploma (ATCL) in piano from Trinity College London. Her first break in the music world was at the age of sixteen when her parents entered her for a singing contest in Sydney. It was organized by TVB with the winner to be offered a recording contract with one of the big music companies in Hong Kong. She won the competition and went to Hong Kong, where she met with the TVB producers who wanted her to sign with one of the music labels. After much deliberation she decided that a music career wasn’t right for her at that time and instead returned to Australia to study at University. After graduating from university, she returned to Hong Kong in 1997 to help run her family’s accounting business; at this time, she gained her CPA certification. One of her students, who she was teaching piano, was working for a Hong Kong independent label, and Wong asked the boss if they wanted a singer. Wong started recording her favourite English songs and made the album Close To You (2002). In early 2007, Susan Wong signed a new recording agreement with Hong Kong-based Evolution Music Group and released her first album under evosound in August 2007. The first release under this agreement, Someone Like You, was recorded in Nashville, USA and won critical and commercial success throughout South East Asia. Wong recorded her second album, 511, for the evosound label in Geneva Switzerland with producer Adrien Zerbini. It contained bossa nova influenced versions of songs such as Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean and Everytime You Go Away by Hall & Oates. Billie Jean received extensive airplay throughout South East Asia and a version on YouTube received over 450,000 views. Returning to Geneva in 2010, Wong started work again with producer Adrien Zerbini along with guitarist Ignacio Lamas. The recordings mostly concentrated on sparse acoustic new interpretations of classic pop songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s including California Dreamin', The Sound of Silence and Have You Ever Seen the Rain?. The ‘studio master’ download of the album peaked at No. 1 on the Linn Records ‘studio master’ download chart and spent over six months in the Top 10. Five years on from her first visit Susan Wong returned to Nashville to record at Ocean Way Studio. The live in the studio project My Live Stories was released on CD, SACD, and HQCD in December 2012 with the live DVD/Blu-ray released in 2013. In 2014, Wong released her fifth studio album, Woman in Love, which is a tribute to great female ballad singers.

The team was created in 2008 by Igor Makarov within the framework of the previously established Russian Global Cycling Project, which was intended to help boost cycling in Russia. In 2017 the team took an international direction, still supported by Igor Makarov's company ARETI International Group, clothing company Katusha Sports and German shampoo manufacturer Alpecin. The team competed as a UCI ProTeam/WorldTour team between 2009 and 2019. Joaquim Rodríguez, Alexander Kristoff, Daniel Moreno, Simon Špilak, Filippo Pozzato, Luca Paolini, Ilnur Zakarin and Tony Martin are some of the most successful riders who rode for Katusha. In 2019, the team was taken over by Israel Cycling Academy, along with its UCI World Tour license.

During the 2009 season, the team earned 23 wins. Some of the notable wins were Sergei Ivanov’s Amstel Gold victory, Filippo Pozzato's Italian road title and triumph at Giro del Veneto.Pozzato wins Giro del Veneto Cyclingnews; 29 August 2009; Accessed 16 July 2011 After the 2012 season, Katusha lost their UCI World Tour license, despite having in their ranks the champion of the 2012 season (Joaquim Rodríguez) and finishing the 2012 UCI World Tour team rankings in second position. The team appealed that decision before the Court of Arbitration for Sport and it was announced on 15 February 2013 that the decision of the UCI was overturned and that Katusha would be part of the 2013 UCI World Tour. Its most successful season was 2015 when the team took victories in the Tour of Flanders, Gent-Wevelgem, Scheldeprijs and GP Ouest France – Plouay, as well as overall wins in the Tour of the Basque Country, Tour de Suisse and Tour de Romandie and stage wins in the Tour de France, Tour of Italy and Tour of Spain. During the 2017 season, two staff members were videotaped dumping the team RV's septic system in a parking lot off the highway at the Amgen Tour of California. The California Highway Patrol and race organizers were informed of the incident and the waste was later professionally removed. The pair were suspended and sent home from the race. In October 2019, Israel Cycling Academy completed the takeover of Katusha–Alpecin, including its World Tour license.  Doping  In March 2009, Christian Pfannberger tested positive for EPO and was banned for life. In April of the same year Antonio Colom tested positive for EPO. In 2011, a number of police searches led by the Padova authorities were conducted in Italy during April. The searches were linked to a broader doping investigation linked to Michele Ferrari. Katusha riders Vladimir Gusev, Mikhail Ignatiev, Vladimir Karpets and Alexandr Kolobnev were searched. Later in July, Kolobnev tested positive for Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) on stage 5 of the 2011 Tour de France. Two weeks later Kolobnev's B-sample returned a positive for HCT. In April 2012, Denis Galimzyanov tested positive for EPO in an out of competition test. Galimzyanov later admitted to taking the banned substance. In June 2012 Filippo Pozzato admitted to using the services of Dr Ferrari from 2004 to 2009. In July 2015, Luca Paolini tested positive for cocaine (Benzoylecgonine metabolite) in a sample given on July 7 during the 2015 Tour de France. As a result, the team withdrew Paolini from the Tour de France. A month later, in August, Giampaolo Caruso returned an EPO positive from a sample taken in March 2012, which had been subsequently retested due to advances in detecting technology. He was suspended by the team awaiting testing of his B-sample. In February 2016, Eduard Vorganov tested positive for the newly WADA-banned compound Meldonium. Due to the frequency of doping positives, the teams faced a potential 15- to 45-day ban.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/katushas-eduard- vorganov-provisionally-suspended-by-uci-for-doping-violation/  Team roster   Major wins  Since the creation of Team Katusha in 2009, its riders have won many races. As of January 2017, these included 28 stages in Grand Tours and four cycling monuments: the 2012 and 2013 Il Lombardia were won by Joaquim Rodríguez, and the 2014 Milan–San Remo and the 2015 Tour of Flanders were won by Alexander Kristoff.  Sponsorship  In 2019, sponsors Alpecin and Canyon bikes confirmed that they were ending their sponsorship of the team, with Israel Cycling Academy buying the Katusha–Alpecin management company from Russian oligarch and UCI Management Committee member Igor Makarov.

He later became a regular umpire in both the National League and the Players' League. Playing career =1882= Pierce began his major league career on May 2, 1882 for the Louisville Eclipse of the American Association. He played a total of nine games, all as a second baseman, and batted .303 in 33 at bats. He scored three runs, and hit one double. Later that season, he played in 41 games for the Baltimore Orioles, also of the American Association. His batting average dropped to .199 in 151 at bats with Orioles, as well as his production, scoring just eight runs, two doubles, and one triple. His season average between the two teams was .217, and he led the league among second basemen with 65 errors. =1883= He began the season with the Columbus Buckeyes of the American Association, hitting .171 in 41 at bats, scored five runs, and did not gather one extra-base hit. Later in the season, he joined the New York Gothams of the National League, playing in 18 games, totaling just five hits in 62 at bats for a .080 batting average. He also began to play more in the outfield, mainly as a center fielder, rather than at second base. His batting average for the season was .117, but he did hit the second (and last) triple of his career. =1884= His last major league season was spent with the New York Metropolitans, where he played in just five games, splitting his time between second base and the outfield. He batted .250 for the season, with records indicating his participation in the game played August 1. His career totals include a .186 batting average, 21 runs scored, four doubles, and two triples in 84 games and 307 at bats. Post major league career =Minor leagues= He signed and played for an Elmira, New York minor league baseball team in 1886, along with fellow Metropolitans Ed Kennedy, and Dasher Troy, when players began to leave the team due to speculation that the American Association was going to eliminate them from the league. =As an umpire= Pierce had, during his playing days, filled in for the regular umpire from time to time. He registered three games in 1882 and one game in 1884. He began to umpire games regularly in 1886, when he called 47 games, and 1887, when he called 33, all in the National League. He didn't appear as an official umpire at a major league game until 1890, when he officiated at 57 games in the Players' League. During his major league umpiring career, he was involved in one forfeited game, and umpired game six of the 1886 World Series. The forfeited game was played between the St. Louis Maroons and the Washington Nationals on September 29, 1886. In the seventh inning, after a St. Louis player had struck out, the Maroons refused to play, complaining that it was too dark to continue. Pierce ruled that due to their refusal to play, they forfeited the game to the Nationals. On October 23, 1886, he umpired the sixth and final game of the 1886 World Series. The St. Louis Browns of the American Association were up on the Chicago White Stockings of the National League, three games to two entering the game. The game ended with St. Louis winning after ten innings of play, sealing the series victory, the only undisputed championship that the Association could claim over the National League. He was relieved of his umpiring duties in 1887 after allegedly misusing a railroad pass. Eight years later, Gracie Pierce died in his hometown of New York City. His age cannot be determined with certainty due to the unavailability of his birth year, but if he was in his twenties during the earliest years of his playing career, his death occurred while he was still in his mid-thirties.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure. Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's. Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed. Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion. Thus the birth of Modifications. It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance. FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence. Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal. Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash. Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them. Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s. During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions. The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices. During the so-called \\"Great Recession\\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization. Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow. The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'. that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow. Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due an annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead. This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder. The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally. The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \\"Watch Dog\\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally. Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions. Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason. Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of winning the prize of stealing from Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hope and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obama's Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate. It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders. Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned. Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public. Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as for banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification. There are reputable companies that are trained to assist with foreclosure defense and home retention options. In addition, hud.gov offers a variety of non-profit agencies that offer assistance. United States 1930s During the Great Depression in the United States a number of mortgage modification programs were enacted by the states to limit foreclosure sales and subsequent homelessness and its economic impact: is not true. United States of America birthed Modifications through The HAP Team late in the year of 2009 due to crimes collectively titled, \\" Predatory lenders.\\" Staff in various markets colluded together to get escrow by providing mortgages consumers were sure to foreclose on, providing balloon mortgage a lending product that is not recommended as it typically results in foreclosure and computer crimes by banking and lending staff as well as violating contract law many staff were incarcerated in prison for violations of real estate and other laws. The Mortgage Crash of 2008 was linked stick Market Crash of 2008 as legal records and historic records support. (Reference IRS Washington DC, public cases of prosecution by entering the name of the lending intuition name vs to view reason banks were prosecuted for and FDIC.GOV for acquisition and lending institution closure of banks and other lending intuitions that were closed by the government for breaking laws. Because of the shrinkage of the economy, many borrowers lost their jobs and income and were unable to maintain their mortgage payments. In 1933, the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Act was challenged by a bank which argued before the United States Supreme Court that it was a violation of the contract clause of the Constitution. In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, the court upheld the law imposing a mandatory mortgage modification. United States 2000s According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman, Sheila C. Bair, looking back as far as the 1980s, \\"the FDIC applied workout procedures for troubled loans out of bank failures, modifying loans to make them affordable and to turn nonperforming into performing loans by offering refinances, loan assumptions, and family loan transfers.\\" Sheila C. Bair, FDIC Chairman, Remarks on the IndyMAC Loan Modification Announcement (August 20, 2008). The U.S. housing boom of the first few years of the 21st century ended abruptly in 2006. Housing starts, which peaked at more than 2 million units in 2005, plummeted to just over half that level. Home prices, which were increasing at double-digit rates nationally in 2004 and 2005, have fallen dramatically since (see Chart 1). As home prices decline, the number of problem mortgages, particularly in sub-prime and Alt-A portfolios, is rising.[Alta-A loans are those made under expanded underwriting guidelines to borrowers with marginal to very good credit. Alt-A loans are riskier than prime loans because of the underwriting standards of the loans, not necessarily the credit of the borrowers.] As of third quarter 2007, the percentage of sub-prime adjustable- rate mortgages (ARMs) that were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure reached 15.6 percent, more than double the level of a year ago (see Chart 2).Mortgage Bankers Association, National Delinquency Survey Q307 (data cited not seasonally adjusted). The deterioration in credit performance began in the industrial Midwest, where economic conditions have been the weakest, but has now (2006–2007) spread to the former boom markets of Florida, California, and other coastal states. Chart 1 File:US Housing Market Activity 2007.gif Chart 2 File:Rise Mortgage Credit Distress 2007.gif During 2007, investors and ratings agencies have repeatedly downgraded assumptions about sub-prime credit performance. A Merrill Lynch study published in July estimated that if U.S. home prices fell only 5 percent, subprime credit losses to investors would total just under $150 billion, and Alt-A credit losses would total $25 billion.Merrill Lynch. \\"Mortgage Credit Losses: How Much, Where, and When?\\" (July 20, 2007) On the heels of this report came news that the S&P;/Case- Shiller Composite Home Price Index for 10 large U.S. cities had fallen in August to a level that was already 5 percent lower than a year ago, with the likelihood of a similar decline over the coming year. The complexity of many mortgage-backed securitization structures has heightened the overall risk aversion of investors, resulting in what has become a broader illiquidity in global credit markets. These disruptions have led to a precipitous decline in sub-prime lending, a significant reduction in the availability of Alt-A loans, and higher interest rates on jumbo loans (see Chart 3). The tightening in mortgage credit has placed further downward pressure on home sales and home prices, a situation that now could derail the U.S. economic expansion.Sheila C. Bair, FDIC Chairman, The Case for Loan Modification (December 6, 2007). Testimony before the United States House Committee on Financial Services; see also FDIC Quarterly (2007), Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 22. Chart 3 File:Available Subprime Credit Decline 2007.png Residential mortgage credit quality continues to weaken, with both delinquencies and charge-offs on the rise at FDIC-insured institutions.Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Quarterly Banking Profile for 2007 Quarter 3. This trend, in tandem with upward pricing of hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, falling home prices, and fewer refinancing options, underscores the urgency of finding a workable solution to current problems in the sub-prime mortgage market. Legislators, regulators, bankers, mortgage servicers, and consumer groups have been debating the merits of strategies that may help preserve home ownership, minimize foreclosures, and restore some stability to local housing markets. On December 6, 2007, an industry-led plan was announced to help avert foreclosure for certain sub- prime homeowners who face unaffordable payments when their interest rates reset. This plan provides for a streamlined process to extend the starter rates on sub-prime ARMs for at least five years in cases where borrowers remain current on their loans but cannot refinance or afford the higher payments after reset. An important component of the industry-led plan is detailed reporting of loan modification activity. Working with the United States Treasury Department and other bank regulators, the FDIC will monitor loan modification levels and seek adjustments to the protocols if warranted.  Loss Mitigation Mediation (LMM) Program  Mediation is usually a great way for a plaintiff and defendant to sit down with a neutral arbiter to hash out their differences and come to a resolution that is usually better than continued litigation. Mediation is successful in all types of disputes including personal injury cases, contract disputes and even divorces. However, in these cases, circuit court judges will readily punish a party who fails to attend mediation or who attends but fails to comply with the mediation order. In 2009, the Florida Supreme Court forced every Florida Circuit Court (the courts in which Foreclosure Lawsuits are heard), to implement a mediation program for homeowners facing Foreclosure. This program was called the “Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation” (RMFM) Program. The idea was for lenders to provide an in-person or telephonic meeting with the Homeowner/Defendant in the presence of an impartial mediator to discuss the Foreclosure Lawsuit and possible alternatives (including Loan Modification, Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure, and Short Sale).Shortcomings of the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation (RMFM) Program recognized by Panel, Fleysher Law Blog, http://fleysherlaw.com/blog/?p=105 The RMFM Program was cancelled in 2011 following widespread criticism of the program. The RMFM failed because it had no teeth, because judges were reluctant to punish the mortgage companies for failing to mediate in good faith, and because borrowers were not receiving the cooperation they needed from the banks. In short, the RMFM was a complete waste of time, not because mediation is a bad idea but because of the limited loss mitigation options and because most state court judges could not or would not enforce the program. In 2012, the Bankruptcy Court in the Middle District of Florida implemented its own version of the failed RMFM, but unlike the state court version, it has seen a much higher success rate. One Orlando bankruptcy attorney reported a 90% success rate, with 18% of his modifications involving principal reduction. Similar programs have also been instituted by Bankruptcy courts in New York and Rhode Island.Loss Mitigation in Bankruptcy: Judge-Made Programs that Need More Support, Douglass Buckley, ABI Committee News, http://www.abiworld.org/committees/newsletters/consumer/vol10num4/loss.html Following the lead of the Middle District, the Southern District of Florida Bankruptcy Court has initiated its own loss mitigation mediation (“LMM”) program. The LMM Program kicked off on April 1, 2013 and unlike the Middle District, the Southern District's program has more requirements for all parties and includes debtors in all chapters, not just Chapter 13. Chapter 7 debtors may use LMM to request a surrender of the property (a real surrender that provides for a transfer of title). LMM may be used by Chapter 13 debtors to request and apply for modification through mediation or surrender of any property they no longer want to own. The Southern District's program also includes the utilization of a document processing program called the DMM Portal. Participants in the LMM program will use this secure online portal for the exchange of documents and communication. This program will help ensure that documents sent between the lender and the borrower and not lost or misplaced. Instant uploads and verification of transmissions are a hallmark of the portal. Election to participate in the LMM program will suspend any pending motions for relief from stay (“MFR”). However, while an LMM is pending, debtors will be required to pay 31% of their gross monthly income through the Chapter 13 plan as an “adequate protection” payment. The fees a debtor will have to pay to participate in the program will typically include an $1,800 fee to their bankruptcy attorney for handling the modification through their Chapter 13 plan and an approximately $300 fee to the mediator.South Florida Bankruptcy Courts Implement Mortgage Modification Mediation Program, Fleysher Law Blog, http://fleysherlaw.com/blog/?p=666 While the bankruptcy mediation program does not guarantee a residential loan modification, it does make it much harder for a mortgage servicer to reject a modification because of the stringent requirement to act in good faith. For instance, if a servicer rejects a HAMP application, it will have to explain why. Often, a rejection is based upon a miscalculation, a misinterpretation, or an oversight. In this program, the debtor's attorney can demand that the servicer's representative explain his calculations. Often, the mistakes are found and corrected, resulting in the modification being accepted. While mortgage modification and bankruptcy may not be the solution to all distressed mortgage problems, it will certainly provide an additional venue for homeowners in need. Applying for a modification through bankruptcy may provide relief from the dischargeable debts that are keeping the debtor from being able to make the mortgage payments and provide the lenders a guarantee that the borrower is no longer obligated by those burdens.  Streamlined modification process  The adoption of this streamlined modification framework is an additional tool that servicers will now have to help avoid preventable foreclosures. This framework will not only help homeowners who receive a streamlined modification, but will also further address servicer capacity concerns by freeing up resources, helping ensure that borrowers do not fall through the cracks because servicers aren't able to get to them.Neel Kashkari, Interim Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability, Remarks on GSE, HOPE NOW streamlined loan modification program (November 11, 2008). This is the first time the industry has agreed on an industry standard. The benchmark ratio for calculating the affordable payment is 38 percent of monthly gross household income. Once the affordable payment is determined, there are several steps the servicer can take to create that payment – extending the term, reducing the interest rate, and forbearing interest. In the event that the affordable payment is still beyond the borrower's means, the borrower's situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis using a cash flow budget. This program resulted from a unified effort among the Enterprises, Hope Now and its 27 servicer partners, Treasury, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In addition, we’ve drawn on the FDIC's experience and assistance from developing the IndyMac streamlined approach and have greatly benefited from the FDIC's input and example. To accommodate the need for more flexibility among a larger number of servicers, the Streamlined Modification Program does differ from the IndyMac model in a few areas. However, it uses the same fundamental tools to achieve the same affordability target.Statement of FHFA Director James B. Lockhart (November 11, 2008) (press release). The Streamlined Modification Program (SMP) was developed in collaboration with the FHFA, the Department of Treasury, Freddie Mac, and members of the HOPE NOW Alliance.Federal National Mortgage Association, Streamlined Modification Program. = SMP eligibility criteria = The SMP eligibility criteria include: #Conforming conventional or jumbo conforming mortgage loans originated on or before January 1, 2008; #At least three payments past due; #The loan is secured by a one-unit property that is the borrower's primary residence; #Current mark-to-market loan to value (LTV) of 90 percent or more; and #Property is not abandoned, vacant, condemned, or in a serious state of disrepair. #SMP is designed to reduce distressed borrowers' monthly mortgage payments to an amount equal to 38 percent of their monthly gross income. To do so, servicers may, in the following order: #Capitalize accrued interest, escrow advances and costs, if allowed by state law; #Extend the term of the mortgage loan by up to 480 months; #Reduce the mortgage loan interest rate in increments of .125% to a fixed rate that is not less than 3% (if this exercise results in a below market rate, it will, after 5 years, step up in annual increments to a market rate); #As a last resort, provide for principal forbearance, which will result in a balloon payment fully due and payable upon borrower's sale of the property or payoff or maturity of the loan. Borrowers meeting the SMP eligibility requirements enter into a trial period in which they must make monthly loan payments equal to the proposed modified payment. Timely payments must be made for three consecutive months before a borrower's loan can be modified under the SMP. The \\"Streamlined Modification Plan,\\" or SMP, which is an expansion of what many lenders are already doing, was implemented starting December 15, 2008.  IndyMAC plan  With the George W.

FHFA, the GSEs and HOPE NOW relied heavily on the IndyMac model in developing this new protocol\\". As history unfolds on the U.S. Housing and Finance crisis that caused the persistent recession, the (IndyMac Bank) bankruptcy and ensuing scandal are important to understand. A dynamic interplay between social good, capital ownership and the rule of law is ongoing in the U.S. experiment with the democratic process. Much of the business models of IndyMac and also the government backed FrannieMae and FreddieMac quasi-banks were based on concentrated debt. This model became very high risk as it was based on the faulty assumption that housing values would increase. In fact, the prevalence of their mortgages greatly fed the housing bubble with significant crossfunding and possible corruption to the government regulatory function through dramatic campaign funding contributions from these organizations. In the less regulated business climate of the late 1800s, speculative bubbles were corrected by painful financial panics. True understanding is yet to be documented for the speculative housing bubble of 2008, but federal government management has seemingly replaced the severity of a financial panic with a persistent yet less severe correction. This correction is becoming known at the Great Recession.  Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Plan  In the task at hand to make headway against foreclosures and the depressed housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered a new phase on December 9, 2008 for a fast-track program meant to make \\"hundreds of thousands of mortgages affordable to people who can't currently meet their monthly payments.\\"Barbara Kiviat, \\"Fannie and Freddie Offer New Plan to Help Homeowners\\" (December 12, 2008).

If the new rate is set below the market interest rate, after five years it will step up in annual increments to either the original loan interest rate or the market interest rate at the time of the modification, whichever is lower; #Forbearing on a portion of the principal, which will require the borrower to make a balloon payment when the loan matures, is paid off, or is refinanced. = Eligibility requirements = #Conforming conventional and jumbo conforming mortgage loans originated on or before January 1, 2009; #Borrowers who are at least three or more payments past due and are not currently in bankruptcy; #Only one-unit, owner-occupied, primary residences; and #Current mark-to-market loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent or more. = New servicer guidance = Fannie Mae's foreclosure prevention efforts have generally been made available to a borrower only after a delinquency occurs. Under Fannie Mae's new guidance, loan servicers can use foreclosure prevention tools to assist distressed borrowers when a borrower demonstrates the need. As noted above, these guidelines apply to borrowers who are still current in their payments, but whose default is reasonably foreseeable. This new guideline is effective immediately, and borrowers may obtain information on eligibility at MakingHomeAffordable.gov.Fannie Mae, \\"Fannie Mae Provides New Servicer Flexibility to Help Borrowers Avoid Foreclosure\\" (December 8, 2008) (press release).

In a press conference Tuesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency director James Lockhart said the program would target high-risk borrowers — those 90 or more days delinquent on their mortgages — and employ various modification strategies to get borrowers down to an “affordable” mortgage payment, defined as 38 percent of a household's monthly gross income on a first mortgage payment.[Jackson, Paul.

Home Affordable Modification Program =Program Formed= =Purpose= The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was established on February 18, 2009 to help up from 7 to 8 million struggling homeowners at risk of foreclosure by working with their lenders to lower monthly mortgage payments. The Program is part of the Making Home Affordable Program which was created by the Financial Stability Act of 2009.http://www.financialstability.gov The program was built as collaboration with banks, services, credit unions, the FHA, the VA, the USDA and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to create standard loan modification guidelines for lenders to take into consideration when evaluating a borrower for a potential loan modification. Over 110 major lenders have already signed onto the program. The Program is now looked upon as the industry standard practice for lenders to analyze potential modification applicants.http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov Early 2012 the Treasury redesigned the HAMP as Tier 1 for the original first-lien modification process and on June 1, 2012 Tier 2 became available. Tier 2 is for either owner- occupied properties or rental properties. For mortgages secured by rental properties, only those that are two or more payments delinquent are eligible.Dodaro, G.L., (2012).

The NPV test will compare the net present value of cash flows with modification and without modification. If the test is positive: meaning that the net present value of expected cash flow is greater in the modification scenario: the servicer must modify absent fraud or a contract prohibition. *Parameters of the NPV test are spelled out in the guidelines, including acceptable discount rates, property valuation methodologies, home price appreciation assumptions, foreclosure costs and timelines, and borrower cure and redefault rate assumptions. *Servicers will follow a specified sequence of steps in order to reduce the monthly payment to no more than 31% of gross monthly income (DTI). *The modification sequence requires first reducing the interest rate for trial period of 3–9 months(subject to a rate floor of 2%), then if necessary extending the term or amortization of the loan up to a maximum of 40 years, and then if necessary forbearing principal. Principal forgiveness or a Hope for Homeowners refinancing are acceptable alternatives. *It is noteworthy that this interest rate is not fixed, and will generally increase 1%/year until it reaches what ever the current rate is 5 years after the modification. Often it includes a balloon payment at the end of the first 5 years. This practice has been found controversial by many in the financial world as it is expected to bring about a slurry of new foreclosures in 5 years when homeowners will once again not be able to pay their mortgage due to the interest rate hike, or the balloon payment. *The monthly payment includes principal, interest, taxes, insurance, flood insurance, homeowner's association and/or condominium fees. Monthly income includes wages, salary, overtime, fees, commissions, tips, social security, pensions, and all other income. *Servicers must enter into the program agreements with Treasury's financial agent on or before December 31, 2009. = Payments to servicers, lenders, and responsible borrowers = *The Program will share with the lender/investor the cost of reductions in monthly payments from 38% DTI to 31% DTI. *Servicers that modify loans according to the guidelines will receive an up-front fee of $1,000 for each modification, plus “pay for success” fees on still-performing loans of $1,000 per year. *Homeowners who make their payments on time are eligible for up to $1,000 of principal reduction payments each year for up to five years. *The program will provide one-time bonus incentive payments of $1,500 to lender/investors and $500 to servicers for modifications made while a borrower is still current on mortgage payments. *The program will include incentives for extinguishing second liens on loans modified under this program. *No payments will be made under the program to the lender/investor, servicer, or borrower unless and until the servicer has first entered into the program agreements with Treasury's financial agent. *Similar incentives will be paid for Hope for Homeowner refinances.http://www.ustreas.gov = Transparency and accountability = *Measures to prevent and detect fraud, such as documentation and audit requirements, will be central to the program. *Servicers will be required to collect, maintain and transmit records for verification and compliance review, including borrower eligibility, underwriting, incentive payments, property verification, and other documentation. *Freddie Mac is appointed the compliance officer of the program. = Warnings to people looking to apply for program = Foreclosure rescue and mortgage modification scams are a growing problem. Homeowners must protect themselves so they do not lose money or their home. Scammers make promises that they cannot keep, such as guarantees to “save” your home or lower your mortgage, often for a fee. Scammers may pretend that they have direct contact with your mortgage servicer when they do not. Even amongst reputable refinance organizations, the fundamental education of the house owner is not stressed. Some may even request struggling homeowners to pledge their time to become politically active. The controversy exists between personal integrity and the concept of a 'right to homeownership'. Many euphemisms are used to implicitly stress the concept that homeownership is not the result of a lifetime of effort but a government-given right. These euphemisms like \\"HOPE, relief and Save-the-Dream\\" as used above in naming or implementing the loan modification programs. The origins of the word 'mortgage' is a death pledge—a concept that perhaps even exceeds the common view of personal integrity. At the foundation of homeownership should be a personal long-term commitment to pay the terms of the mortgage. On the bankers side of the contract, their business model is regulated by the 'social good' which are implemented by government by chartering banks. If the banks implement policies that lead to financial bubbles and panics, a democratic government is equipped with the tools to uncharter and redistribute a banks assets.Bank crisis in the united states = Free resources for potential applicants = There are free resources available for potential applicants. *Homeowners can call the Homeowner's HOPE Hotline at 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) for information about the Making Home Affordable Program and to speak with a HUD approved housing counselor.

It is also very popular for famous temples. One amongst them is Kudroli Shree Bhagavathi Kshetra, at Kodialbail in the heart of the city. Kudroli Shree Bhagavathi Kshetra with a legacy of over 800 years has got its own significance amongst all Bhagavathi Kshetras of Northern Kerala and Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka. Because it is the only one temple where 14 Bhagavathi's are being worshipped together. Cheerumba Nalvar, Padangara Ivar and Pullurali Aivar. It is also known as Kudroli Kootakala means meeting place of 14 Bhagavathi's together. Legend: Cheerumbha Bhagavathi also known as Kali appeared from Lord Maheshwara's tear falling on his thigh. She was born to kill Darukasura a demon who was harassing all people, saints and even Devas. She killed Daruka after severe fight. Then she came to this world through a divine ship as advised by Lord Shiva to eliminate evil and thereby save and nourish good, that is as Dushta Samharini and Shista Paripalini. Thus Shree Cheerumba Bhagavathi came to this world along with Shree Eleya Bhagavathi, Dandaraja, Kandakarna, Parivara Daiva Guliga and selected amongst other places. Kudroli as her abode to stay permanently along with Shree Padangara Bhagavathi and Shree Pullurali Bhagavathi. She has been blessing and looking after the welfare of millions of her devotees, since then. Earlier, Shree Bhagavathi Kshetra was established at Kudroli. But subsequently, due to heavy sea erosion, the place where the temple was established was damaged. At that time there was a landlord by name Shri Manjanna Nayak (ancestors of Bailmane family, even now Bailmane family stays close to temple) who was not having any children, prayed Goddess Bhagavathi to bless him with a child. As a result, he got a child. He was very happy and gifted this land situated at Kodialbail, Mangalore tp Shree Bhagavathi Kshetra. Now this place of worship is called as \\"Kudroli Shree Bhagavathi Kshetra\\". Veerastambha: Another feather in the greatness of this temple is Veerastambha, a granite pillar of about 6 feet tall depicted with artistic carving of Lord Maheshwara and Devi. The pillar has got its own legend and powers. This Veerastambha pillar will be decorated with Jasmine and Kanakaambara flowers during festivals and pooja offerings will be given to this Devine pillar. Festivals: Nadavali, Bharani, Kaliata and Navarathri are the main festivals celebrated in this temple with pomp and pageantry. Nadavali is the annual festival being celebrated in the month if March every year. Thousands of devotees assemble together to worship and offer special prayers. The most significant part of this festival is Kenda Seva means Fire offering, wherein the Pathris along with other Poojaris walk on FIRE chanting Devi Stuthi. This event is worth witnessing at least once in one's lifetime. The temple is more than a thousand years old. The four renovated temple complexes were built by Karnataka and Kerala artisans using black granite and wood carvings. Ancient single stone multistage granite carvings known as \\"Veerastambha\\" can be found in the temple. The famous \\"Shri Narayana Guru\\" statue is carved in white marble and sits in the entrance.

It was based on the Armstrong Siddeley Lancaster saloon and continued the company's theme of naming cars after Hawker Siddeley World War II aircraft. The chassis had independent front suspension using longitudinal torsion bars and a live rear axle with leaf springs. A Girling hydro- mechanical braking system was fitted, with the front drums hydraulically operated while those at the rear used rod and cable. At first the Typhoon were fitted with a 70 bhp 1991 cc, six-cylinder, overhead-valve engine, carried over from the pre-war 16 hp model, but from 1949 this changed to 2309 cc and 75 bhp by increasing the cylinder bore from 65 to 70 mm. Hydraulic tappets were fitted to most engines, but towards the end of production there was a change to solid tappets. There was a choice of manual four-speed with synchromesh on the top three ratios or pre-selector gearbox. The four-seat, two-door body was made of steel and aluminium panels fitted over a wood-and- aluminium frame with a fabric roof. The doors were rear hinged, an arrangement that got the name of suicide doors. At launch, the car cost £1214 on the UK market. Armstrong Siddeley Tempest The Tempest was a very rare four-door variant and the prototype for the Whitley. Six were built in 1949, but 5 were later recalled and destroyed by Armstrong Siddeley. The remaining one (registered JHP 113) passed into the private ownership of the late Les Clark of Ilkeston in Derbyshire, UK. It has a 2309cc engine, with a 4-speed pre- select gearbox. It is a 4-door saloon, the front doors being of a \\"suicide\\" design. The car is painted in midnight blue over grey (originally all black), and was in regular use until the early 1990s. Its whereabouts are now unknown, but is believed to be in storage in the UK.

Mission The mission of the Greater Astoria Historical Society, founded in 1985, is to discover, procure and preserve the history of historic Long Island City, which was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898. In a borough well known for its diverse population (some 138 languages are spoken in Queens),*Queens: An Economic Review. New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, January, 2000. the Long Island City / Astoria area is home to more than 350,000 people. A primary goal of the GAHS is to foster a positive sense of community pride and identity through an understanding of history for all residents, both newly arrived immigrants and longtime residents. Programs The Greater Astoria Historical Society's “Long Island City Forum” is a multi-faceted program that includes lectures, video presentations, walking tours, exhibits and programs designed for local schools to increase awareness of Long Island City history. Regular tours include the East River and the piano factory Steinway & Sons. The Greater Astoria Historical Society sponsors an annual Haunted Waters Walking Tour along the East River in Long Island City as part of the Socrates Sculpture Park's Halloween Harvest Festival. The Greater Astoria Historical Society's most recent program, the Winged Fist Project, is dedicated to preserving the legacy of the Irish American Athletic Club, an amateur athletic organization that was active in Long Island City in the first two decades of the 20th century.

The GAHS holdings include dozens of antiquarian atlases and thousands of historic maps of Queens and surrounding areas from the now defunct Belcher Hyde map company among others. The holdings also include an almost complete run (or the morgue file) of the Long Island Star Journal, \\"a daily paper that informed the community about local and world news until it folded in 1968.

The GAHS holdings include thousands of black and white photographs, photographic slides, glass negatives and tintypes and include the works of notable Queens historians Vincent F. Seyfried and Frank Carrado, informally known as the \\"Mayor of Long Island City.\\" The GAHS has published hundreds of these photos in their books, and has scanned thousands of images. More than 3,000 of these images are available online through the Astoria History Project. The GAHS also has an extensive collection of images relating to the history of the East River, which can be viewed at East River NYC. The Greater Astoria Historical Society has a historical plaque program, which designates noteworthy locations in Queens. The GAHS has erected a plaque on the apartment building at 43-30, 46th Street, in Sunnyside, Queens, where legendary jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke, \\"the remote and mysterious jazz cornettist... died in obscurity.\\"\\"Solo in Sunnyside; Frank Gray travels through Queens, New York, in search of the late Bix Beiderbecke.\\" The Guardian, April 30, 2005. In collaboration with local historians, the Greater Astoria Historical Society has authored or co-authored four books on the history of Queens: Long Island City, Postcards of Long Island City, The East River, and The Queensboro Bridge. The GAHS has also published a free map that includes popular walking tours along the East River in Queens. The GAHS also compiles a weekly column for the Queens Gazette, summarizing historical articles from the Long Island Star Journal, a newspaper that chronicled life in Queens, from the 1840s until 1968. Facilities The Greater Astoria Historical Society offices in the historic Quinn Memorial Building on the corner of Broadway and 36th Street in Astoria include a exhibit space for both permanent and rotating exhibits of topical interest to the community. The GAHS, which is affiliated with the Queens Tourism Council, maintains a tourist information booth outside its office and provides free maps and pamphlets to visitors looking to explore the history of Queens.

Known for pioneering materialist feminism, she co-founded the French Women's Liberation Movement (Mouvement de Libération des Femmes, or MLF) in 1970 and the journal Nouvelles questions féministes (New Feminist Issues) with Simone de Beauvoir in 1981.→Delphy, Christine. Biography Christine Delphy was born in 1941 to her parents who owned a local pharmacy. In the documentary film on her life and ideas, \\"Je ne suis pas féministe, mais...\\" (\\"I am not a femnist, but...\\") Delphy describes an early feminist consciousness in observing her parents: though running the pharmacy was labor-intensive for both of them, when they came home at lunch, Delphy noticed her father putting his feet up to rest and read the newspaper while her mother was obliged to cook a midday meal and then do the dishes before they both returned to work. Nevertheless, Delphy did not always identify as a feminist, owing to stigma around the term. In a television interview in 1985, she described a period of her life when she routinely prefaced comments with, \\"Je ne suis pas féministe, mais...\\" (the phrase from which the film draws its title). Education Delphy studied sociology at the University of Chicago, the University of Paris and the University of California, Berkeley. Returning to France, Delphy was interested in pursuing a dissertation project on women, but she describes in Je ne suis pas féministe, mais... meeting resistance to the topic in her then- advisor Pierre Bourdieu, who told Delphy that there was no one to advise such a project because no one researches women (though French sociologists like Andrée Michel had already published significant research). Delphy agreed to pursue rural sociology instead, but the question of women, and particularly the economic role women played, emerged in this project as well. While pursuing fieldwork, \\"I realized there was a whole set of goods that absolutely did not pass through the marketplace,\\" with much of women's economic contributions functioning as unpaid labor, in contrast to the wage labor that was central to theories of capitalist oppression (that is, the capitalist class extracts the value between the wages they pay workers and the actual value of what the workers produce). \\"To a degree, the outline of [Delphy's magnum opus] The Main Enemy was already there. The bringing to light not just the economic exploitation of women, but a specific form of economic exploitation.\\" Academic career Delphy got a job as a researcher in 1978 and began applying for Director of Research (full professor) positions around 1990, but it took her nine years to win this promotion, encountering overt discrimination against her as a lesbian. In Je ne suis pas féministe, mais... she describes an incident where a faculty member responsible for reviewing her work for promotion offered his department an account that left out one of Delphy's major books, dismissed her research, and then added, \\"Plus, she's homosexual.\\" Activism Delphy arrived in the U.S. in 1962 during the Civil Rights Movement, and says that it was in the United States that she came to see the reality of racism. \\"Racism existed at home in France, but I didn't see it.\\" In 1965 Delphy left Berkeley to work for the Washington Urban League and, through these experiences in the Civil Rights Movement, developed a belief in the value of oppressed groups (like women) developing autonomous activist movements, as African-Americans had done. She returned to France and after the evens of May 1968, took part in a feminist group FMA (Féminin Masculin Avenir), which with other groups would eventually form the Women's Liberation Movement (Mouvement de Libération des Femmes, or MLF). In August 1970, Delphy and other members of the MLF brought flowers to the \\"unknown wife of the unknown soldier,\\" the first of the MLF's actions to receive attention in the media.Françoise Picq, Liberation des femmes, les années mouvement, 1990 Delphy is openly lesbianStevi Jackson, Christine Delphy, Sage Publications Ltd, 1996, p. 190 and a member of the Gouines rouges (\\"Red Dykes\\").Abigail Gregory, Ursula Tidd, Women in Contemporary France, Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 178 In 1971, she added her name to the Manifesto of the 343, publicly declaring she'd had an abortion when it was illegal in France.Le manifeste des 343 In more recent years, the implementation of the 2004 French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools—a law which includes banning French Muslim school-girls from wearing their headscarfs on school grounds—brought the issues and discrimination facing French Muslim women to Delphy's attention. In response to this, Delphy confronted and addressed the reaction of many French feminists who support the law, criticizing this stance as hypocritical and racist. Ideas Materialist Feminism Delphy was a pioneer of materialist feminism, applying a materialist approach to gender relations. Delphy analyzes inequalities between men and women as rooted in a material economic basis, specifically the domestic relations of production. This revision of Marxism questioned the idea that there are only capitalist classes. For Delphy, gender is also a position in the mode of production (domestic labor). In this view, the main enemy of women as a class is not capital but patriarchy.See \\"L'ennemi principal (The Main Enemy)\\" in Christine Delphy, L'Ennemi principal, tome 1 : L'Économie politique du patriarcat (1997) She also developed an analysis of gender arguing that gender precedes sex. Her theory constitutes a landmark in the process of denaturalizing sex, which is a marker of gender.Christine Delphy, L'Ennemi principal, tome 2 : Penser le genre (2001) With Nicole-Claude Mathieu, Emmanuèle de Lesseps, Colette Guillaumin, Monique Wittig, and Paola Tabet, Delphy launched the materialist feminism school. Materialist feminism is particularly present in the journal Nouvelles questions feministes, still directed by Delphy. Against Essentialism and the so-called \\"French Feminism\\" Delphy challenges the biological essentialist view of gender, even when it comes from the women's movement.See \\"Protofeminism and antifeminism\\" in Christine Delphy, L'Ennemi principal, tome 1 : L'Économie politique du patriarcat (1997) She also critiqued what she called \\"the invention of 'French Feminism'\\": she argues that most French feminists are against essentialism and very few support what was called \\"French Feminism\\" in the United States. For Delphy, the American invention of \\"French Feminism\\" had a political purpose: the acceptance of essentialism among Anglo-American feminists (it was expected they would think, If French women think this way, we have to respect and accept this).See \\"L'invention du 'French Feminism': une démarche essentielle\\", in Christine Delphy, L'Ennemi principal, tome 2 : Penser le genre (2001) All these ideas are elaborated in many articles from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in Questions féministes and Nouvelles questions féministes and were published in the following books: L'Ennemi principal, tome 1 : L'Économie politique du patriarcat (1997) and L'Ennemi principal, tome 2 : Penser le genre (2001).

Malaysia has had an embassy in Caracas since 1990, while Venezuela has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Diplomatic relations were established on 18 December 1986. Both countries are full members of the Group of 77.  History  President Hugo Chávez first visited Malaysia in 1999, and visited again in August 2006 to discuss investments in Malaysia's palm oil industry and to diversify Venezuela's energy industry. Malaysia promised to support Venezuela's bid for a seat on the UN security council. During the trip, an agreement on avoiding double taxation was signed.  Economic relations  Chávez proposed in December 2006 that Venezuela would build an oil refinery in Malaysia, and Golden Hope, a Malaysian state-owned palm oil company, agreed with the Venezuelan state oil company to cultivate 40,000 ha of oil palms in Venezuela, while Malaysian company Petronas would start oil exploration in Venezuela. Malaysia also agreed to help Venezuela with city planning. A Malaysia-Venezuela Business Council was formed in July 2008, partly so that Venezuela could learn from Malaysian experience in poverty reduction. Bilateral trade was only US$6.6 million in 1990, when the countries signed a bilateral trade agreement, US$30.6 million in 1998, when Venezuela set up legal protections for foreign investments, US$19.8 million in 2004, US$39.6 million in 2005, and US$61.68 million in 2007, with only $250,000 being exports from Venezuela. The Venezuelan ambassador to Malaysia proposed in February 2009 that the two countries form a new financial institution for developing countries.

The company was founded by Rajesh Rao in March 1997 as the first game company in India. In December 2016, Dhruva was majority-acquired by Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios. Starbreeze sold its stake in May 2019 to Rockstar Games, which merged Dhruva into its Rockstar India studio.  History  = Background and foundation (1995–1997) = Prior to founding Dhruva Interactive, Rajesh Rao was a programmer and engineering student. His final assignment in engineering was in multimedia, wherein he created his own multimedia engine, which he used as the foundation of a new multimedia company he then founded in 1995. His father provided him with seed money for a bank loan with which he acquired a computer and 14.4 kbp modem, and Rao began his company as a one-man operation on 15 March 1995. By 1997, the company had grown to five people. In February 1997, Rao's company was approached by Intel, who proposed them to develop software for their new Pentium II chip; the two companies signed an agreement in March and Rao's company developed a rendering engine for the Pentium II. According to Rao, this deal marked the end for \\"Dhruva 1.0\\" and the beginning of \\"Dhruva 2.0\\", with the company reinventing itself as a video game company through its deal with Intel. Rao formally founded Dhruva Interactive on 15 March 1997. Thus, Dhruva was first game company in India. = As a subsidiary (2016–2019) = In December 2016, Swedish video game developer Starbreeze Studios announced that it had acquired a 90.5% stake in Dhruva for in cash and , including an earn-out agreement of .

They were originally centered on Talegaon Dabhade (in present-day Maharashtra), but became the Maratha chiefs of Gujarat. A family belonging to the Dabhade clan held the hereditary title of senapati (commander-in-chief) and several jagirs in Gujarat until 1751. That year, Umabai Dabhade and her relatives were arrested for a rebellion against the Peshwa, and were stripped of their titles.  Rise to power  The Dabhade clan traces its ancestry to Bajajirao Dabhade. His son Yesajirao Dabhade was the personal bodyguard of the Maratha king Shivaji. The family rose to prominence under his son Khanderao Dabhade, a Maratha military leader. He was conferred the title of \\"Sarsenapati\\" (commander-in-chief) on 11 January 1717 by Shivaji's grandson Chhattrapati Shahu of Satara. His younger son Shivaji Dabhade helped Rajaram reach Gingee safely from the Mughals.  Rebellion against Peshwa Baji Rao  The Dabhades carried out several raids in the rich province of Gujarat, collecting chauth and sardeshmukhi taxes. When Chhattrapati Shahu's Peshwa (prime minister) Baji Rao I decided to take over the tax collection in Gujarat, the Dabhades and other Maratha clans that had traditionally controlled Gujarat (Gaekwad and Kadam Bande) rebelled against Shahu and Baji Rao. Baji Rao defeated them, and Trimbak Rao Dabhade was killed in a battle the Battle of Dabhoi on 1 April 1731. Umabai Dabhade, the wife of Khanderao and mother of Trimbak Rao, became the matriarch of the family after their death. Chhatrapati Shahu granted all of Trimbak Rao's assets and titles (including senapati) to his minor brother Yashwant Rao. The Peshwa allowed them to retain control of Gujarat, on the condition that they would remit half of the revenues to his treasury. Since Yashwant Rao was a minor, Umabai exercised the executive power. Even as he grew up, he was addicted to alcohol and opium, and the Dabhades' lieutenant Damaji Rao Gaekwad gradually increased his power during this time.  Rebellion against Peshwa Balaji Rao  Umabai pretended reconciliation with Peshwa Baji Rao, but always maintained a grudge against him for killing her son. Under her, the Dabhades never actually remitted half of the revenues to Shahu's treasury, but Shahu did not want to take any extreme measures against a grieving widow and a mother who had lost her son. However, after Shahu's death in 1749, Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, who was facing an empty treasury, sought a share of revenues from the Dabhades. Umabai then joined Tarabai in a rebellion against the Peshwa. In November 1750, she dispatched 15,000 troops under Damaji Gaekwad to support Tarabai. Damaji was defeated by the Peshwa loyalists after a few initial successes. He remained in the Peshwa's captivity from May 1751 to March 1752.  Decline  Shortly after the Peshwa's arrest, Umabai, Yashwant Rao and their relatives were also arrested. The Dabhades were deprived of their jagirs as well as their hereditary title senapati. In March 1752, Damaji Gaekwad agreed to Peshwa's demands, and abandoned the service of the Dabhades. Subsequently, the Gaekwad dynasty replaced the Dabhades as the Maratha chiefs of Gujarat. Gaekwad agreed to provide an annual maintenance expense to the Dabhades, but the latter lost all of their power and much of their wealth. Umabai died on 28 November 1753. After her death, Peshwa Balaji Rao took Yashwant Rao on his Carnatic campaign. On the way, Yashwant Rao died of fatigue in Miraj, on 18 May 1754. The Dabhade family line was continued by Trimbak Rao Dabhade II, who controlled a small riyasat (estate). The family was divided into the Senior Branch and Junior Branch in 1933. The descendants presently live in Talegaon Dabhade and Pune. Sardar Jayendraraje Sangramsinhraje Dabhade is the head of the senior branch since 1993 and Sardar Satyasheelraje Padmasenraje Dabhade is the head the junior branch since 2014.

It was used from 1741 to 1855 and since it was a silver standard regular issue coin and trade coin at this time, it had a different purpose to domestic silver coinage or Kurantgeld, the so-called window on the stock exchanges. It was normally traded at a small premium or discount to the face value of 5 thalers. In Prussian purchase contracts or bonds it was, due to its monetary usage, distinguished as the \\"preußisch Courant\\" or \\"Friedrich d'or\\". Around 1780, for example, the Saxon August d'or had a price of 116 to 120 Groschen sächsischen Silberkurantgeldes, as a maximum discount of 4 Groschen. In the 19th century it usually had a low premium. History Modelled on the Spanish doubloon and French Louis d'or, the forerunner of the Friedrich d'or was the Wilhelm d'or. It was first minted in 1741 by Frederick II. It was continued by his successors Frederick William II, Frederick William III and Frederick William IV, until 1855. From 1747 a double Friedrich d'or was minted, and a half Friedrich d'or from 1749. Its fine weight sank in 1770 from 6.05 to 6.03 grams. Other states, such as Saxony, were influence to mint an August-, Friedrich-August-, Christian- or Max d'or (after their rulers' names). These gold and silver coins also instituted a temporary fineness in the coinage of the German states. Appearance The Friedrich d'or was 21 carat gold. The fine weight was 6.032g. On the obverse was the king's head, and on the reverse was an eagle standing on its shield.

Synopsis  Jashnn the movie, is based on the character Akash Verma (Adhyayan Suman), a 23-year-old man, who thirsts to becoming a singing icon that can blaze a trail for himself among the galaxy of existing stars. But though he has dreams in his heart, he has been unable to find that distinctive voice that he can call his own, that will propel him to the top. Only when he's shattered by life and unflinchingly looks at the sordid truth straight in the face — that he is freeloading off his elder sister Nisha (Shahana Goswami), who in order to offer Akash a decent life style, has become the mistress of a rich businessman, Aman Bajaj (Humayun Saeed). Even though she is just a mistress, she is able to touch Aman's inner core. Call it irony or a twist of fate, but the person who sees Akash through this dark times and mentors him when he's down and out is none other than the sister of the very person who Akash hates most in the world - Aman Bajaj. It is Sara Bajaj (Anjana Sukhani), Aman's sister, who makes him realize that he is an extremely talented man who is simply going through a bad phase and that the biggest crime a human being can commit, is to give up on himself. Spurred by life's bittersweet lessons, and Sara's genuine love and support, Akash, in the harshest winter of his life discovers an invincible summer within himself, thereby discovering his own voice. With this very special tune which has been soaked with the passion of his lived life, he not only touches his inexhaustible potential and becomes an overnight star but also brings dignity it his beleaguered sister, humbles his biggest detractor Aman Bajaj and in the process, lives up to the faith that Sara had in him all along.
