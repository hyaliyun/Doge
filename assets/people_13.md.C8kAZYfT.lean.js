It was the final home of King Henry VIII's first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Originally a medieval castle but converted into a stately palace, it was the family seat of the Dukes of Manchester from 1615 until 1950. It now houses Kimbolton School. History Kimbolton Castle in 1880. This illustration shows the present mansion as rebuilt between 1690 and 1720. The castle was built by Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex in the late 12th century. The inner court was rebuilt by Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham in the late 15th century. The castle was acquired by Sir Richard Wingfield in 1522. Catherine of Aragon was sent here in April 1534 for refusing to give up her status or deny the validity of her marriage. The fenland climate damaged her health, and she died in the castle in January 1536. The castle was bought by Sir Henry Montagu, later created 1st Earl of Manchester, in 1615. The 4th Earl of Manchester, who was created 1st Duke of Manchester in 1719, had many works of reconstruction carried out between 1690 and 1720. These works included the rebuilding of the south wing, which had fallen down, to a design by Sir John Vanbrugh. The 4th Duke of Manchester commissioned Robert Adam to design the gatehouse which was constructed in 1766. Many members of the Montagu family (Earls and Dukes of Manchester) are buried at St Andrew's Church in Kimbolton. Several Montagu monuments still exist in the South Chapel, while the Montagu vault (extended in 1853) is located beneath the North Chapel. The 10th Duke of Manchester sold the contents in 1949, and the castle and 50 acres were sold to Kimbolton School in 1951. Warren House On the grounds of the castle is Warren House, where the warrener (estate rabbit gamekeeper) used to live, converted into a late 18th- century folly on command of one of the castle's inhabitants to add interest to his horizon, complete with a single decorative facade facing the castle; it is grade II* listed and owned by the Landmark Trust.

The castle was the original family seat of the Earldom of Pembroke. A Grade I listed building since 1951, it underwent major restoration during the early 20th century. In 1093, Arnulf of Montgomery built the first castle at the site when he fortified the promontory beside the Pembroke River during the Norman invasion of Wales. A century later, the castle was given by Richard I to William Marshal, who became one of the most powerful men in 12th-century Britain. He rebuilt Pembroke Castle in stone, creating most of the structure that remains today. The castle is open to the public and is the largest privately-owned castle in Wales. Construction The castle is sited on a strategic rocky promontory by the Milford Haven Waterway. The first fortification on the site was a Norman motte-and-bailey. It had earthen ramparts and a timber palisade. In 1189, Pembroke Castle was acquired by William Marshal. He soon became Lord Marshal of England, and set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive Norman stone castle. The inner ward, which was constructed first, contains the huge round keep with its domed roof. Its original first-floor entrance was through an external stairwell. Inside, a spiral staircase connected its four stories. The keep's domed roof also has several putlog holes that supported a wooden fighting-platform. If the castle was attacked, the hoarding allowed defenders to go out beyond the keep's massive walls above the heads of the attackers. Pembroke's Great Keep viewed from the south with the inner ward behind The inner ward's curtain wall had a large horseshoe-shaped gateway. But only a thin wall was required along the promontory. This section of the wall has a small observation turret and a square stone platform. Domestic buildings including William Marshal's Great Hall and private apartments were within the inner ward. The 13th century keep is tall with walls up to thick at its base. In the late 13th century, additional buildings were added to the inner ward, including a new Great Hall. A 55-step spiral staircase was also created that led down to a large limestone cave, known as Wogan Cavern, beneath the castle. The cave, which was created by natural water erosion, was fortified with a wall, a barred gateway and arrowslits. It may have served as a boathouse or a sallyport to the river where cargo or people could have been transferred. The outer ward was defended by a large twin-towered gatehouse, a barbican and several round towers. The outer wall is thick in places and constructed from Siltstone ashlar. Although Pembroke Castle is a Norman-style enclosure castle with great keep, it can be more accurately described as a linear fortification because, like the later 13th-century castles at Caernarfon and Conwy, it was built on a rocky promontory surrounded by water. This meant that attacking forces could only assault on a narrow front. Architecturally, Pembroke's thickest walls and towers are all concentrated on its landward side facing the town, with Pembroke River providing a natural defense around the rest of its perimeter.  History  Pembroke Castle stands on a site that has been occupied at least since the Roman period. Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury founded the first castle here in the 11th century. Although only made from earth and wood, Pembroke Castle resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years. The castle was established at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales. Arnulf de Montgomery appointed Gerald de Windsor as his castellan at Pembroke. When William Rufus died, Arnulf de Montgomery joined his elder brother, Robert of Bellême, in rebellion against Henry I, William's brother and successor as king; when the rebellion failed, he was forced to forfeit all his British lands and titles. Henry appointed his castellan, but when the chosen ally turned out to be incompetent, the King reappointed Gerald in 1102. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as an important base in the Norman invasion of Ireland. A display depicting the birth of Henry VII of England in the castle In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, de Clare's granddaughter, to William Marshal who received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He had the castle rebuilt in stone and established the great keep at the same time. Marshal was succeeded in turn by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241. All of Marshal's sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence (a half-brother of Henry III), who had become Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, William Marshal's granddaughter. The de Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern. Pembroke Castle became de Valence's military base for fighting the Welsh princes during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295. On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, William de Valence's son, the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident, ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years. Pembroke Castle (sometime in the 1890s) Pembroke Castle then reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by The Crown for its ownership. By 1400 Owain Glyndŵr had begun a rebellion in Wales. However, Pembroke escaped attack because the castle's Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndŵr in gold. Then in 1452, the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where, in 1457, she gave birth to her only child, who was to become King Henry VII of England. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the castle was a place of peace until the outbreak of the English Civil War. Although most of South Wales sided with the King, Pembroke declared for Parliament. It was besieged by Royalist troops but was saved after Parliamentary reinforcements arrived by sea from nearby Milford Haven. Parliamentary forces then went on to capture the Royalist castles of Tenby, Haverfordwest and Carew. In 1648, at the beginning of the Second Civil War, Pembroke's commander Colonel John Poyer led a Royalist uprising alongside Colonel Powell, Tenby Castle, and Sir Nicholas Kemoys, Chepstow Castle. Oliver Cromwell came to Pembroke on 24 May 1648 and took the castle after a seven- week siege. Its three leaders were found guilty of treason and Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed. Townspeople were even encouraged to disassemble the fortress and re-use its stone for their purposes. The castle was then abandoned and allowed to decay. It remained in ruins until 1880, when a three-year restoration project was undertaken. Nothing further was done until 1928, when Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps acquired the castle and began an extensive restoration of the castle's walls, gatehouses, and towers. After his death, a trust was set up for the castle, jointly managed by the Philipps family and Pembroke town council. Film location Pembroke has appeared in numerous feature films. These include the 1968 film The Lion in Winter, the 1976 film Jabberwocky, the BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis's Prince Caspian, the film of Shakespeare's Richard II, and the 2016 Anglo-American romantic film Me Before You. It features as the fictional Penleven Castle in Cornwall in the 2015 comedy film The Bad Education Movie.

In 2011 there were 29,936 listed buildings in Wales ; of these, 493 were the most important Grade I listed buildings, 2,124 were Grade II* and 27,319 were Grade II listed. Most of these were in private ownership. Also in Wales were 4,175 Scheduled Monuments, 6 Designated historic wrecks, and 523 Conservation Areas; these designations means that the buildings or objects concerned are protected by statute. A register of significant Welsh battlefield sites is also under preparation. Cadw also provides support to other organisations with responsibility for understanding, conserving and interpreting the archaeology and cultural heritage of Wales. These include the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales which functions as an archive (around 90% of its funding comes from Welsh Government), and the Welsh Archaeological Trusts which are active in research, heritage management and supporting sustainable development across Wales (only 50% of their funding is from Cadw). =Area character studies= There are 58 Historic Landscapes and 376 Historic parks and gardens in Wales.

It is about southwest of Hereford, just south of the A465 road and Welsh Marches Line to Abergavenny, and about from the border with Wales. On the 1st of April 2019 the parishes of Kenderchurch, St Devereux, Treville and Wormbridge were merged with Kilpeck. The village is renowned for its small but outstanding Norman (Romanesque) church, SS Mary and David's, but also has the earthworks of a Norman motte and bailey castle that is no longer standing. History Until the 9th century, when it was taken over by Mercia, the area around Kilpeck was within the Welsh kingdom of Ergyng. After the Norman conquest, the area became known as Archenfield and was governed as part of the Welsh Marches. It became part of Herefordshire, and England, in the 16th century, although the use of Welsh in the area remained strong until the 19th century.Colin Lewis, Herefordshire – the Welsh Connection, 2006, The English name for the village derives from the Welsh name, Llanddewi Kil Peddeg,Welsh place names in Herefordshire with Llanddewi meaning \\"church of St. David\\" and Kil Peddeg probably meaning the \\"cell of Pedic\\", an otherwise unknown local early Christian hermit.James Bailey, The Parish Church of St Mary and St David at Kilpeck, 2000 In the Domesday Book of 1086, Kilpeck (entered as Chipeete) was given by William the Conqueror to William Fitz Norman de la Mare, son of Norman de la Mare. The clan de la Mare is one of the oldest in Normandy and is descended from Ragnvald Eysteinsson, earl of Møre and Romsdal. According to the Domesday survey, Kilpeck had \\"3 ploughs, 2 serfs and 4 oxmen and there are 57 men with 19 ploughs.\\" There are mentions of a church on the site possibly from as early as the 7th century. There are vestiges of an enclosure, 200 yds (183 metres) by 300 yds (274 m) in the field, defining an Anglo-Saxon village. Landmarks Remains of Kilpeck Castle The St Mary and St David's Church was built around 1140. It consists of a nave, chancel and semicircular apse. It is remarkable for its wealth (and fine preservation) of Norman stone carvings, both inside and out,Stone carvings, both inside and out. all original both in form and position and incorporating many corbels with representations of human faces, hares, fish, fowl, stags etc. Eighty-five of 91 corbels survive, an extraordinarily high percentage. West of the church lies a ruined motte-and- bailey and earthworks. The castle is thought to have been first built around 1090 as the administrative centre of Archenfield. A few walls of the 12th or 13th-century keep still stand on top of the motte; these are not well preserved. A fireplace and chimney flues are visible and two sections of standing castle walls. A little over a mile to the north is the surviving motte of another castle, at Didley Court Farm. References External links * Renn, D. F. \\"Kilpeck Castle and Church\\".

He is best known for his writings on science, the environment, and economics. He has written several science books, including The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (1994), Genome (1999), The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (2010) and The Evolution of Everything: How Ideas Emerge (2015). He publishes a blog and has been a regular contributor to The Times newspaper. Ridley is a libertarian, and a staunch supporter of Brexit.The Times, January 2017 He has been a Conservative hereditary peer since 2013, with a seat in the House of Lords. Ridley was chairman of the UK bank Northern Rock from 2004 to 2007, during which period it experienced the first run on a British bank in 130 years. He resigned, and the bank was bailed out by the UK government; this led to the nationalisation of Northern Rock. Early life and education Ridley's parents were Matthew White Ridley, 4th Viscount Ridley (1925–2012), and Lady Anne Katharine Gabrielle Lumley (1928–2006), the daughter of Lawrence Roger Lumley, 11th Earl of Scarbrough. He is the nephew of the late Conservative MP and minister Nicholas Ridley and the great grandson of Edwin Lutyens. Ridley attended Eton College from 1970 to 1975, and then went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology. Obtaining a BA degree with first class honours, Ridley continued with research on the mating system of the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) supervised by Chris Perrins for his DPhil degree in 1983. Career =Journalism= Ridley joined The Economist in 1984, first working as a science editor until 1987, then as Washington, D.C. correspondent from 1987 to 1989 and as American editor from 1990 to 1992.Debrett's People of Today 2007, p. 1406, He was a columnist for The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph and an editor of The Best American Science Writing 2002. From 2010 to 2013, Ridley wrote the weekly \\"Mind and Matter\\" column for The Wall Street Journal, which \\"explores the science of human nature and its implications\\". Since 2013, Ridley has written a weekly column for The Times on science, the environment, and economics. Ridley wrote the majority of the main article of the August 2017 edition of BBC Focus magazine., #311 The article explains his scepticism regarding resource depletion, challenging the widespread belief that resource depletion is an important issue. He cites various previous resource scares as his evidence. =Northern Rock, 1994–2007= In 1994, Ridley became a board member of the UK bank Northern Rock. His father had been a board member for 30 years, and chairman from 1987 to 1992. Ridley became chairman in 2004.The Times, 19 September 2007 Northern Rock chairman gives chief full backing In September 2007, Northern Rock became the first British bank since 1878 to suffer a run on its finances, at the start of the financial crisis of 2007–2010. The bank applied to the Bank of England for emergency liquidity funding at the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08, but failed, and Northern Rock was nationalised. He resigned as chairman in October 2007. A parliamentary committee criticised Ridley for not recognising the risks of the bank's financial strategy and \\"harming the reputation of the British banking industry\\". =Business= From 1996 to 2003, Ridley served as founding chairman of the International Centre for Life, which opened in 2000 as a non-profit science centre in Newcastle upon Tyne; and is now its honorary life president.

Attracting over 100,000 people per year, the Northumberland art project, tourism and cultural landmark has won a global landscape architecture award, and has been named 'Miss World'. The Royal Agricultural Society of England awarded the Bledisloe Gold Medal in 2015 to Ridley for the work done on his Blagdon estate, saying that it \\"wanted to highlight the extensive environmental improvement work that has been undertaken across the land\\". Publications Ridley is best known as the author of a number of popular science books, listed below. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, 1993 : In Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, Alice meets the Red Queen who stays in the same place no matter how fast she runs. This book champions a Red Queen theory for the evolution of sexual reproduction: that it evolved so that the resultant genetic variation would thwart constantly mutating parasites. The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation, 1996 Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters, 1999 : This book examines one newly discovered gene from each of the 23 human chromosomes. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2000.The Samuel Johnson Prize http://www.thesamueljohnsonprize.co.uk/sjnav/books/2 Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, & What Makes Us Human, 2003 (also later released under the title The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture in 2004) : This book discusses reasons why humans can be considered to be simultaneously free- willed and motivated by instinct and culture. The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture, 2004 Francis Crick: Discoverer of the Genetic Code, 2006 : Ridley's biography of Francis Crick won the Davis Prize for the history of science from the US History of Science Society. The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, 2010 : The Rational Optimist primarily focuses on the benefits of the innate human tendency to trade goods and services. Ridley argues that this trait is the source of human prosperity, and that as people increasingly specialize in their skill sets, we will have increased trade and even more prosperity. It was shortlisted for the 2011 BBC Samuel Johnson Prize. The Evolution of Everything: How Ideas Emerge, 2015 : In The Evolution of Everything, Ridley \\"makes the case for evolution, rather than design, as the force that has shaped much of culture, technology and society, and that even now is shaping our future.\\" He argues that \\"Change in technology, language, mortality and society is incremental, inexorable, gradual and spontaneous…Much of the human world is the result of human action, but not of human design; it emerges from the interactions of millions, not from the plans of a few.\\" The science writer Peter Forbes, writing in The Independent, describes the book as \\"Ridley's magnum opus, ... decades in the making.\\" Forbes states that Ridley was inspired by the Roman poet Lucretius's long work on \\"atheistical atomism\\", De rerum natura, whose \\"arguments seem uncannily modern: like those of a Richard Dawkins 2000 years avant la lettre.\\" Forbes found the chapter on technology to be \\"utterly convincing\\", the most satisfying in the book. But he finds the \\"sustained polemic on behalf of libertarian anti-State ideas not a million miles from those of the US Republican Tea Party.\\" Forbes calls Ridley \\"a heretic on most counts\\", stating that the book has many excesses. All the same, he considers the book necessary reading. How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom, 2020 : This book argues that innovation is a disorganized, bottom-up process that emerges through the aggregate work of many low-level individuals, rather than the work of solitary geniuses at the top. Moreover, innovation is poorly understood by economists, and it is often impeded by politicians. Ridley makes his case by examining historical examples, rather than appealing solely to abstract principles. Although less well-known than his popular science books, Ridley's first book was Warts and All: The Men Who Would Be Bush (1989), which chronicled the evolution of George H. W. Bush's public image during the 1988 United States presidential election. In recent years, Ridley has described his first book as \\"bad\\" and has expressed gratitude that few people know about it.Science Salon Podcast #117: Michael Shermer with Matt Ridley — How Innovation Works: and Why It Flourishes in Freedom. May 26, 2020. . He no longer promotes the book on his personal website.\\"Books by author Matt Ridley.\\" Bibliography on Ridley's personal website. Accessed June 20, 2020. http://www.mattridley.co.uk/books/  In 2006, Ridley contributed a chapter to Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think, a collection of essays in honour of his friend Richard Dawkins (edited by his near-namesake Mark Ridley). Ridley's 2010 TED conference talk, \\"When Ideas Have Sex\\", received over 2 million views. Ridley argues that exchange and specialisation are the features of human society that lead to the development of new ideas, and that human society is therefore a \\"collective brain\\". Political and scientific views =Role of government regulation= In a 2006 edition of the online magazine Edge – the third culture, Ridley wrote a response to the question \\"What's your dangerous idea?\\" which was entitled \\"Government is the problem not the solution\\", in which he describes his attitude to government regulation: \\"In every age and at every time there have been people who say we need more regulation, more government. Sometimes, they say we need it to protect exchange from corruption, to set the standards and police the rules, in which case they have a point, though often they exaggerate it... The dangerous idea we all need to learn is that the more we limit the growth of government, the better off we will all be.\\" In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the £27 billion failure of Northern Rock. On 1 June 2010 Monbiot followed up his previous article in the context of Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist, which had just been published. Monbiot took the view that Ridley had failed to learn from the collapse of Northern Rock. Ridley has responded to Monbiot on his website, stating \\"George Monbiot's recent attack on me in the Guardian is misleading. I do not hate the state. In fact, my views are much more balanced than Monbiot's selective quotations imply.\\" On 19 June 2010, Monbiot countered with another article on the Guardian website, further questioning Ridley's claims and his response. Ridley was then defended by Terence Kealey in a further article published on the Guardian website. In November 2010, The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy exchange between Ridley and the Microsoft founder Bill Gates on topics discussed in Ridley's book The Rational Optimist. Gates said that \\"What Mr. Ridley fails to see is that worrying about the worst case—being pessimistic, to a degree—can actually help to drive a solution\\"; Ridley said \\"I am certainly not saying, 'Don't worry, be happy.' Rather, I'm saying, 'Don't despair, be ambitious.'\\" Ridley summarised his own views on his political philosophy during the 2011 Hayek Lecture: \\"[T]hat the individual is not – and had not been for 120,000 years – able to support his lifestyle; that the key feature of trade is that it enables us to work for each other not just for ourselves; that there is nothing so anti-social (or impoverishing) as the pursuit of self sufficiency; and that authoritarian, top-down rule is not the source of order or progress.\\" In an email exchange, Ridley responded to the environmental activist Mark Lynas' repeated charges of a right-wing agenda with the following reply: Ridley argues that the capacity of humans for change and social progress is underestimated, and denies what he sees as overly pessimistic views of global climate change and Western birthrate decline. =Climate change= In 2014, a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Ridley was sharply challenged by Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University's Earth Institute. Sachs termed \\"absurd\\" Ridley's characterization of a paper in Science magazine by the two scientists Xianyao Chen and Ka-Kit Tung. Sachs cited the actual data from the Science article to rebut Ridley's contentions, and stated that the \\"paper's conclusions are the very opposite of Ridley's\\".Sachs, Jeffrey, \\"The Wall Street Journal Parade of Climate Lies\\", Huffington Post, 09/06/2014. Sachs' article links to Ridley's \\"Whatever Happened to Global Warming?\\" (subscription required), The Wall Street Journal, 4 September 2014. Retrieved 2014-09-07. Ridley replied that 'it is ludicrous, nasty and false to accuse me of lying or \\"totally misrepresenting the science..I have asked Mr. Sachs to withdraw the charges more than once now on Twitter. He has refused to do so ....\\"'\\"Jeffrey Sachs blows a gasket, and our contributor cleans up the intellectual mess\\", online.wsj.com , 9 September 2014. Ridley quotes a tweet by Sachs: \\"Ridley climate ignorance in WSJ today is part of compulsive lying of Murdoch media gang. Ridley totally misrepresents the science,\\" at Ridley's weblog Friends of the Earth has connected Ridley's opposition to climate science to his ties to the coal industry. He is the owner of land in the north-east of England on which the Shotton Surface coal mine operates, and receives payments for the mine. In 2016 he was accused of lobbying for the coal industry.Matt Ridley accused of lobbying UK government on behalf of coal industry. The Guardian, 15 July 2016. Retrieved 15 July 2016. This was summarily dismissed by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. =Shale gas and fracking= Ridley was one of the earliest commentators to spot the economic significance of shale gas. He is a proponent of fracking. However, he has been found to have breached the Parliamentary Code of Conduct by the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards for not orally disclosing in debates on the subject personal interests worth at least £50,000 in Weir Group, which has been described as \\"the world's largest provider of special equipment used in the process\\" of fracking. =Euroscepticism= Ridley is a Eurosceptic and advocated for the withdrawal (Brexit) of the UK from the European Union during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He appeared in Brexit: The Movie, arguing for Britain to return to the policy of free trade that distinguished it after 1845 until the 1930s. Honours, awards and titles In 1996, he was a visiting professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and in 2006 was awarded an honorary DSc degree. In 2003, he received an honorary DSc degree from Buckingham University and in 2007, an honorary DCL degree from Newcastle University. In 2011, the Manhattan Institute awarded Ridley its $50,000 Hayek Prize for his book The Rational Optimist. In his acceptance speech, Ridley said: \\"As Hayek understood, it is human collaboration that is necessary for society to work... the key feature of trade is that it enables us to work for each other not just for ourselves; that attempts at self- sufficiency are the true form of selfishness as well as the quick road to poverty; and that authoritarian, top-down rule is not the source of order or progress.\\" In 2011, Ridley gave the Angus Millar Lecture on \\"scientific heresy\\" at the Royal Society of Arts (RSA). In 2012, on the death of his father, Ridley became the 5th Viscount Ridley and Baron Wensleydale. He is also the 9th Baronet Ridley. In 2013, he was elected as a hereditary peer to membership in the House of Lords, as a member of the Conservative Party. In 2013, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and won the Julian L. Simon award in March 2012. In 2014, he won the free enterprise award from the Institute of Economic Affairs. His nomination to become a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) reads: =Arms= As 5th Viscount Ridley, Matt Ridley bears arms blazoned as Gules on a Chevron Argent between three Falcons proper, as many Pellets. Personal life When his father died in 2012, Ridley succeeded him as the 5th Viscount Ridley, having taken over the running of the family estate of Blagdon Hall, near Stannington, Northumberland, some years before. In 1989, Ridley married Anya Hurlbert, a Professor of Neuroscience at Newcastle University; they live in northern England and have a son and a daughter. In 1980, his sister Rose married the British Conservative Party politician Owen Paterson, who held the posts of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until July 2014. During this time Ridley was described as 'in many ways Paterson's personal think tank'.Owen Paterson more than meets the two criteria for a good Cabinet minister June 2013, The Conservative Home. In 2015 Ridley's team won the celebrity Christmas special of University Challenge representing Magdalen College, Oxford, the year after the team of his son, also Matthew, had won the student version representing Trinity College, Cambridge.

However, there are other operations which could also be considered addition for matrices, such as the direct sum and the Kronecker sum. Entrywise sum Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added.Elementary Linear Algebra by Rorres Anton 10e p53 In which case, the sum of two matrices A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as A and B. The sum of A and B, denoted A + B, is computed by adding corresponding elements of A and B: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A}+\\\\mathbf{B} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & \\\\cdots & b_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} & \\\\cdots & b_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{m1} & b_{m2} & \\\\cdots & b_{mn} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} + b_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{2n} + b_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} + b_{m1} & a_{m2} + b_{m2} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} + b_{mn} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Or more concisely (assuming that A + B = C): : c_{ij}=a_{ij}+b_{ij} For example: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\+ \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 7 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1+0 & 3+0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1+7 & 0+5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1+2 & 2+1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 8 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 3 \\\\end{bmatrix} Similarly, it is also possible to subtract one matrix from another, as long as they have the same dimensions. The difference of A and B, denoted A − B, is computed by subtracting elements of B from corresponding elements of A, and has the same dimensions as A and B. For example: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix}  \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 7 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1-0 & 3-0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-7 & 0-5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-2 & 2-1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -6 & -5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Direct sum Another operation, which is used less often, is the direct sum (denoted by ⊕). Note the Kronecker sum is also denoted ⊕; the context should make the usage clear. The direct sum of any pair of matrices A of size m × n and B of size p × q is a matrix of size (m + p) × (n + q) defined as : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A} & \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{0} & \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m 1} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_{11} & \\\\cdots & b_{1q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_{p1} & \\\\cdots & b_{pq} \\\\end{bmatrix} ''' For instance, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\oplus \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} The direct sum of matrices is a special type of block matrix. In particular, the direct sum of square matrices is a block diagonal matrix. The adjacency matrix of the union of disjoint graphs (or multigraphs) is the direct sum of their adjacency matrices. Any element in the direct sum of two vector spaces of matrices can be represented as a direct sum of two matrices. In general, the direct sum of n matrices is: : \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n} \\\\mathbf{A}_{i} = \\\\operatorname{diag}( \\\\mathbf{A}_1, \\\\mathbf{A}_2, \\\\mathbf{A}_3, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{A}_n) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_1 & \\\\boldsymbol{0} & \\\\cdots & \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{0} & \\\\mathbf{A}_2 & \\\\cdots & \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{0} & \\\\boldsymbol{0} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{A}_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where the zeros are actually blocks of zeros (i.e., zero matrices). Kronecker sum The Kronecker sum is different from the direct sum, but is also denoted by ⊕. It is defined using the Kronecker product ⊗ and normal matrix addition. If A is n-by-n, B is m-by-m and \\\\mathbf{I}_k denotes the k-by-k identity matrix then the Kronecker sum is defined by: : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{I}_m + \\\\mathbf{I}_n \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}.

Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, Washington, on 23 January 1978, Stark was laid down on 24 August 1979, launched on 30 May 1980, and commissioned on 23 October 1982 with CDR Terence W. Costello commanding. In 1987, an Iraqi jet fired two missiles at Stark, killing 37 U.S. sailors on board. Decommissioned on 7 May 1999, Stark was scrapped in 2006. Missile attack USS Stark was deployed to the Middle East Force in 1984 and 1987. Captain Glenn R. Brindel was the commanding officer during the 1987 deployment. The ship was struck on 17 May 1987 by two Exocet anti-ship missiles during the Iran–Iraq War fired from an Iraqi aircraft officially identified as a Dassault Mirage F1 fighter,Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Attack of the USS Stark in 1987 but which some sources later asserted was a modified Falcon 50 business jet. The Reagan administration attributed the blame to Iran for its alleged belligerence in the underlying conflict. The plane had taken off from Shaibah, Iraq at 20:00 and had flown south into the Persian Gulf. The pilot fired the first Exocet missile from a range of , and the second from , just about the time Stark issued a standard warning by radio. The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar; warning was given by the lookout only moments before the missiles struck. The first penetrated the port-side hull and failed to detonate, but left flaming rocket fuel in its path. The second entered at almost the same point, and, leaving a gash, and exploded in crew quarters. The missiles killed 37 sailors and injured 21. Stark listing following two hits by Exocet missiles. No weapons were fired in defense of Stark. The Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode, Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed until seconds before the missile hit. The attacking Exocet missiles and Mirage aircraft were in a blindspot of the STIR fire control director (Separate tracking and illumination Radar, part of the Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System), and the Oto Melara Mk 75 76 mm/62 caliber naval gun, but in the clear for the MK 92 CAS (Combined Antenna System, primary search and tracking radar of the Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System) and the Mk 13 Mod 4 single-arm launcher. The ship failed to maneuver to bring its Mk 75 to bear before the first missile hit. On fire and listing, the frigate was brought under control by its crew during the night. The ship made its way to Bahrain where, after temporary repairs by the destroyer tender to make her seaworthy, she returned to her home port of Naval Station Mayport, under her own power. The ship was eventually repaired at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi for $142 million. A view of external damage to the port side. It is unknown whether Iraqi leaders authorized the attack. Initial claims by the Iraqi government (that Stark was inside the Iran–Iraq War zone) were shown to be false. The motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered. American officials have claimed he was executed, but an ex-Iraqi Air Force commander later said that the pilot who attacked Stark was not punished, and remained alive. Citing lapses in training requirements and lax procedures, the U.S. Navy's board of inquiry relieved Captain Brindel of command and recommended him for court-martial, along with Tactical Action Officer Lieutenant Basil E. Moncrief. Instead, Brindel and Moncrief received non-judicial punishment from Admiral Frank B. Kelso II and letters of reprimand. Both opted for early retirement, while Executive Officer Lieutenant Commander Raymond Gajan Jr. was detached for cause and received a letter of admonition. 1990s The frigate was part of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic Fleet in 1990 before returning to the Middle East Force in 1991.

The result matrix has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. The product of matrices A and B is then denoted simply as AB. Matrix multiplication was first described by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet in 1812, to represent the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices. Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, statistics, physics, economics, and engineering. Computing matrix products is a central operation in all computational applications of linear algebra. Notation This article will use the following notational conventions: matrices are represented by capital letters in bold, e.g. , vectors in lowercase bold, e.g. , and entries of vectors and matrices are italic (since they are numbers from a field), e.g. and . Index notation is often the clearest way to express definitions, and is used as standard in the literature. The entry of matrix is indicated by , or , whereas a numerical label (not matrix entries) on a collection of matrices is subscripted only, e.g. , etc. Definition If is an matrix and is an matrix, :\\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & \\\\cdots & b_{1p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} & \\\\cdots & b_{2p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{n1} & b_{n2} & \\\\cdots & b_{np} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} the matrix product (denoted without multiplication signs or dots) is defined to be the matrix :\\\\mathbf{C}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} c_{11} & c_{12} & \\\\cdots & c_{1p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{21} & c_{22} & \\\\cdots & c_{2p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{m1} & c_{m2} & \\\\cdots & c_{mp} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} such that : c_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} +\\\\cdots + a_{in}b_{nj}= \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}, for and . That is, the entry of the product is obtained by multiplying term-by-term the entries of the th row of and the th column of , and summing these products. In other words, is the dot product of the th row of and the th column of .

In most scenarios, the entries are numbers, but they may be any kind of mathematical objects for which an addition and a multiplication are defined, that are associative, and such that the addition is commutative, and the multiplication is distributive with respect to the addition. In particular, the entries may be matrices themselves (see block matrix). = Illustration = thumb The figure to the right illustrates diagrammatically the product of two matrices and , showing how each intersection in the product matrix corresponds to a row of and a column of . : \\\\overset{4\\\\times 2 \\\\text{ matrix}}{\\\\begin{bmatrix} {a_{11}} & {a_{12}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{32}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}} \\\\overset{2\\\\times 3\\\\text{ matrix}}{\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cdot & {b_{12}} & {b_{13}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & {b_{22}} & {b_{23}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}} = \\\\overset{4\\\\times 3\\\\text{ matrix}}{\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cdot & c_{12} & c_{13} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & c_{32} & c_{33} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}} The values at the intersections marked with circles are: :\\\\begin{align} c_{12} & = {{a_{11}}}{{b_{12}}} + {{a_{12}}}{{b_{22}}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{33} & = {{a_{31}}}{{b_{13}}} + {{a_{32}}}{{b_{23}}} \\\\end{align} Fundamental applications Historically, matrix multiplication has been introduced for facilitating and clarifying computations in linear algebra. This strong relationship between matrix multiplication and linear algebra remains fundamental in all mathematics, as well as in physics, engineering and computer science. =Linear maps= If a vector space has a finite basis, its vectors are each uniquely represented by a finite sequence of scalars, called a coordinate vector, whose elements are the coordinates of the vector on the basis. These coordinate vectors form another vector space, which is isomorphic to the original vector space. A coordinate vector is commonly organized as a column matrix (also called column vector), which is a matrix with only one column. So, a column vector represents both a coordinate vector, and a vector of the original vector space. A linear map from a vector space of dimension into a vector space of dimension maps a column vector :\\\\mathbf x=\\\\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_n\\\\end{pmatrix} onto the column vector :\\\\mathbf y= A(\\\\mathbf x)= \\\\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{1n}x_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{2n}x_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{mn}x_n\\\\end{pmatrix}. The linear map is thus defined by the matrix ::\\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, and maps the column vector \\\\mathbf x to the matrix product :\\\\mathbf y = \\\\mathbf {Ax}. If is another linear map from the preceding vector space of dimension , into a vector space of dimension , it is represented by a matrix \\\\mathbf B. A straightforward computation shows that the matrix of the composite map is the matrix product \\\\mathbf {BA}. The general formula ) that defines the function composition is instanced here as a specific case of associativity of matrix product (see below): :(\\\\mathbf{BA})\\\\mathbf x = \\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf {Ax}) = \\\\mathbf{BAx}. =System of linear equations= The general form of a system of linear equations is :\\\\begin{matrix}a_{11}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{1n}x_n=b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{2n}x_n =b_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1}x_1+\\\\cdots + a_{mn}x_n =b_m\\\\end{matrix}. Using same notation as above, such a system is equivalent with the single matrix equation :\\\\mathbf{Ax}=\\\\mathbf b. =Dot product, bilinear form and inner product = The dot product of two column vectors is the matrix product :\\\\mathbf x^\\\\mathsf T \\\\mathbf y, where \\\\mathbf x^\\\\mathsf T is the row vector obtained by transposing \\\\mathbf x and the resulting 1×1 matrix is identified with its unique entry. More generally, any bilinear form over a vector space of finite dimension may be expressed as a matrix product :\\\\mathbf x^\\\\mathsf T \\\\mathbf {Ay}, and any inner product may be expressed as :\\\\mathbf x^\\\\dagger \\\\mathbf {Ay}, where \\\\mathbf x^\\\\dagger denotes the conjugate transpose of \\\\mathbf x (conjugate of the transpose, or equivalently transpose of the conjugate).  General properties Matrix multiplication shares some properties with usual multiplication. However, matrix multiplication is not defined if the number of columns of the first factor differs from the number of rows of the second factor, and it is non-commutative, even when the product remains definite after changing the order of the factors. = Non- commutativity = An operation is commutative if, given two elements and such that the product \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} is defined, then \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A} is also defined, and \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A}. If and are matrices of respective sizes and , then \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} is defined if , and \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A} is defined if . Therefore, if one of the products is defined, the other is not defined in general. If , the two products are defined, but have different sizes; thus they cannot be equal. Only if , that is, if and are square matrices of the same size, are both products defined and of the same size. Even in this case, one has in general :\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} eq \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A}. For example :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, but :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. This example may be expanded for showing that, if is a matrix with entries in a field , then \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A} for every matrix with entries in , if and only if \\\\mathbf{A}=c\\\\,\\\\mathbf{I} where , and is the identity matrix. If, instead of a field, the entries are supposed to belong to a ring, then one must add the condition that belongs to the center of the ring. One special case where commutativity does occur is when and are two (square) diagonal matrices (of the same size); then . Again, if the matrices are over a general ring rather than a field, the corresponding entries in each must also commute with each other for this to hold. =Distributivity= The matrix product is distributive with respect to matrix addition. That is, if are matrices of respective sizes , , , and , one has (left distributivity) :\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{B} + \\\\mathbf{C}) = \\\\mathbf{AB} + \\\\mathbf{AC}, and (right distributivity) :(\\\\mathbf{B} + \\\\mathbf{C} )\\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\mathbf{BD} + \\\\mathbf{CD}. This results from the distributivity for coefficients by :\\\\sum_k a_{ik}(b_{kj} + c_{kj}) = \\\\sum_k a_{ik}b_{kj} + \\\\sum_k a_{ik}c_{kj} :\\\\sum_k (b_{ik} + c_{ik}) d_{kj} = \\\\sum_k b_{ik}d_{kj} + \\\\sum_k c_{ik}d_{kj}. =Product with a scalar= If is a matrix and a scalar, then the matrices c\\\\mathbf{A} and \\\\mathbf{A}c are obtained by left or right multiplying all entries of by . If the scalars have the commutative property, then c\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{A}c. If the product \\\\mathbf{AB} is defined (that is, the number of columns of equals the number of rows of ), then : c(\\\\mathbf{AB}) = (c \\\\mathbf{A})\\\\mathbf{B} and (\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{B})c=\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{B}c). If the scalars have the commutative property, then all four matrices are equal. More generally, all four are equal if belongs to the center of a ring containing the entries of the matrices, because in this case, for all matrices . These properties result from the bilinearity of the product of scalars: :c \\\\left(\\\\sum_k a_{ik}b_{kj}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_k (c a_{ik} ) b_{kj} :\\\\left(\\\\sum_k a_{ik}b_{kj}\\\\right) c = \\\\sum_k a_{ik} ( b_{kj}c). =Transpose= If the scalars have the commutative property, the transpose of a product of matrices is the product, in the reverse order, of the transposes of the factors. That is : (\\\\mathbf{AB})^\\\\mathsf{T} = \\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\mathsf{T} where T denotes the transpose, that is the interchange of rows and columns. This identity does not hold for noncommutative entries, since the order between the entries of and is reversed, when one expands the definition of the matrix product. =Complex conjugate= If and have complex entries, then : (\\\\mathbf{AB})^* = \\\\mathbf{A}^*\\\\mathbf{B}^* where denotes the entry-wise complex conjugate of a matrix. This results from applying to the definition of matrix product the fact that the conjugate of a sum is the sum of the conjugates of the summands and the conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates of the factors. Transposition acts on the indices of the entries, while conjugation acts independently on the entries themselves. It results that, if and have complex entries, one has : (\\\\mathbf{AB})^\\\\dagger = \\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\dagger\\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\dagger , where denotes the conjugate transpose (conjugate of the transpose, or equivalently transpose of the conjugate). = Associativity = Given three matrices and , the products and are defined if and only if the number of columns of equals the number of rows of , and the number of columns of equals the number of rows of (in particular, if one of the products is defined, then the other is also defined). In this case, one has the associative property :(\\\\mathbf{AB})\\\\mathbf{C}=\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{BC}). As for any associative operation, this allows omitting parentheses, and writing the above products as This extends naturally to the product of any number of matrices provided that the dimensions match. That is, if are matrices such that the number of columns of equals the number of rows of for , then the product : \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{A}_i = \\\\mathbf{A}_1\\\\mathbf{A}_2\\\\cdots\\\\mathbf{A}_n is defined and does not depend on the order of the multiplications, if the order of the matrices is kept fixed. These properties may be proved by straightforward but complicated summation manipulations. This result also follows from the fact that matrices represent linear maps. Therefore, the associative property of matrices is simply a specific case of the associative property of function composition.  Complexity is not associative  Although the result of a sequence of matrix products does not depend on the order of operation (provided that the order of the matrices is not changed), the computational complexity may depend dramatically on this order. For example, if and are matrices of respective sizes , computing needs multiplications, while computing needs multiplications. Algorithms have been designed for choosing the best order of products, see Matrix chain multiplication. When the number of matrices increases, it has been shown that the choice of the best order has a complexity of O(n \\\\log n). Application to similarity Any invertible matrix \\\\mathbf{P} defines a similarity transformation (on square matrices of the same size as \\\\mathbf{P}) :S_\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{A}) = \\\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{P}. Similarity transformations map product to products, that is :S_\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{AB}) = S_\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{A})S_\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{B}). In fact, one has :\\\\mathbf{P}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{AB}) \\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{P}\\\\mathbf{P}^{-1})\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\mathbf{P} =(\\\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{P})(\\\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\mathbf{P}). Square matrices Let us denote {\\\\mathcal M}_n(R) the set of square matrices with entries in a ring , which, in practice, is often a field. In {\\\\mathcal M}_n(R), the product is defined for every pair of matrices. This makes {\\\\mathcal M}_n(R) a ring, which has the identity matrix as identity element (the matrix whose diagonal entries are equal to 1 and all other entries are 0). This ring is also an associative -algebra. If , many matrices do not have a multiplicative inverse. For example, a matrix such that all entries of a row (or a column) are 0 does not have an inverse. If it exists, the inverse of a matrix is denoted , and, thus verifies : \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{I}. A matrix that has an inverse is an invertible matrix. Otherwise, it is a singular matrix. A product of matrices is invertible if and only if each factor is invertible. In this case, one has :(\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B})^{-1} = \\\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}. When is commutative, and, in particular, when it is a field, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants. As determinants are scalars, and scalars commute, one has thus : \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{AB}) = \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{BA}) =\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A})\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{B}). The other matrix invariants do not behave as well with products. Nevertheless, if is commutative, \\\\mathbf{AB} and \\\\mathbf{BA} have the same trace, the same characteristic polynomial, and the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. However, the eigenvectors are generally different if \\\\mathbf{AB} eq \\\\mathbf{BA}. = Powers of a matrix = One may raise a square matrix to any nonnegative integer power multiplying it by itself repeatedly in the same way as for ordinary numbers. That is, :\\\\mathbf{A}^0 = \\\\mathbf{I}, :\\\\mathbf{A}^1 = \\\\mathbf{A}, :\\\\mathbf{A}^k = \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdots\\\\mathbf{A}}_{k\\\\text{ times}}. Computing the th power of a matrix needs times the time of a single matrix multiplication, if it is done with the trivial algorithm (repeated multiplication). As this may be very time consuming, one generally prefers using exponentiation by squaring, which requires less than matrix multiplications, and is therefore much more efficient. An easy case for exponentiation is that of a diagonal matrix. Since the product of diagonal matrices amounts to simply multiplying corresponding diagonal elements together, the th power of a diagonal matrix is obtained by raising the entries to the power : : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a_{22} & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & a_{nn} \\\\end{pmatrix}^{k} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}^k & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a_{22}^k & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & a_{nn}^k \\\\end{pmatrix}. Abstract algebra The definition of matrix product requires that the entries belong to a semiring, and does not require multiplication of elements of the semiring to be commutative. In many applications, the matrix elements belong to a field, although the tropical semiring is also a common choice for graph shortest path problems. Even in the case of matrices over fields, the product is not commutative in general, although it is associative and is distributive over matrix addition. The identity matrices (which are the square matrices whose entries are zero outside of the main diagonal and 1 on the main diagonal) are identity elements of the matrix product. It follows that the matrices over a ring form a ring, which is noncommutative except if and the ground ring is commutative. A square matrix may have a multiplicative inverse, called an inverse matrix. In the common case where the entries belong to a commutative ring , a matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant has a multiplicative inverse in . The determinant of a product of square matrices is the product of the determinants of the factors. The matrices that have an inverse form a group under matrix multiplication, the subgroups of which are called matrix groups. Many classical groups (including all finite groups) are isomorphic to matrix groups; this is the starting point of the theory of group representations.  Computational complexity Improvement of estimates of exponent over time for the computational complexity of matrix multiplication O(n^\\\\omega). The matrix multiplication algorithm that results of the definition requires, in the worst case, multiplications of scalars and additions for computing the product of two square matrices. Its computational complexity is therefore , in a model of computation for which the scalar operations require a constant time (in practice, this is the case for floating point numbers, but not for integers). Rather surprisingly, this complexity is not optimal, as shown in 1969 by Volker Strassen, who provided an algorithm, now called Strassen's algorithm, with a complexity of O( n^{\\\\log_{2}7}) \\\\approx O(n^{2.8074}). The exponent appearing in the complexity of matrix multiplication has been improved several times, leading to Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm with a complexity of (1990). This algorithm has been slightly improved in 2010 by Stothers to a complexity of , in 2013 by Virginia Vassilevska Williams to , and in 2014 by François Le Gall to . This was further refined in 2020 by Josh Alman and Virginia Vassilevska Williams to a final (up to date) complexity of . The greatest lower bound for the exponent of matrix multiplication algorithm is generally called . One has , because one has to read the elements of a matrix for multiplying it by another matrix. Thus . It is unknown whether . The largest known lower bound for matrix-multiplication complexity is , for a restricted kind of arithmetic circuits, and is due to Ran Raz. =Related complexities= The importance of the computational complexity of matrix multiplication relies on the facts that many algorithmic problems may be solved by means of matrix computation, and most problems on matrices have a complexity which is either the same as that of matrix multiplication (up to a multiplicative constant), or may be expressed in term of the complexity of matrix multiplication or its exponent \\\\omega. There are several advantages of expressing complexities in terms of the exponent \\\\omega of matrix multiplication. Firstly, if \\\\omega is improved, this will automatically improve the known upper bound of complexity of many algorithms. Secondly, in practical implementations, one never uses the matrix multiplication algorithm that has the best asymptotical complexity, because the constant hidden behind the big O notation is too large for making the algorithm competitive for sizes of matrices that can be manipulated in a computer. Thus expressing complexities in terms of \\\\omega provide a more realistic complexity, since it remains valid whichever algorithm is chosen for matrix computation. Problems that have the same asymptotic complexity as matrix multiplication include determinant, matrix inversion, Gaussian elimination (see next section). Problems with complexity that is expressible in terms of \\\\omega include characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues (but not eigenvectors), Hermite normal form, and Smith normal form. =Matrix inversion, determinant and Gaussian elimination= In his 1969 paper, where he proved the complexity O(n^{2.807}) for matrix computation, Strassen proved also that matrix inversion, determinant and Gaussian elimination have, up to a multiplicative constant, the same computational complexity as matrix multiplication. The proof does not make any assumptions on matrix multiplication that is used, except that its complexity is O(n^\\\\omega) for some \\\\omega \\\\ge 2 The starting point of Strassen's proof is using block matrix multiplication. Specifically, a matrix of even dimension may be partitioned in four blocks :\\\\begin{bmatrix} {A} & {B} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{C} & {D} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Under this form, its inverse is : \\\\begin{bmatrix} {A} & {B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {C} & {D} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} {A}^{-1}+{A}^{-1}{B}({D}-{CA}^{-1}{B})^{-1}{CA}^{-1} & -{A}^{-1}{B}({D}-{CA}^{-1}{B})^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -({D}-{CA}^{-1}{B})^{-1}{CA}^{-1} & ({D}-{CA}^{-1}{B})^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}, provided that and {D}-{CA}^{-1}{B} are invertible. Thus, the inverse of a matrix may be computed with two inversions, six multiplications and four additions or additive inverses of matrices. It follows that, denoting respectively by , and the number of operations needed for inverting, multiplying and adding matrices, one has :I(2n) \\\\le 2I(n) + 6M(n)+ 4 A(n). If n=2^k, one may apply this formula recursively: :\\\\begin{align} I(2^k) &\\\\le 2I(2^{k-1}) + 6M(2^{k-1})+ 4 A(2^{k-1})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le 2^2I(2^{k-2}) + 6(M(2^{k-1})+2M(2^{k-2})) + 4(A(2^{k-1}) + 2A(2^{k-2}))\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\ldots \\\\end{align} If M(n)\\\\le cn^\\\\omega, and \\\\alpha=2^\\\\omega\\\\ge 4, one gets eventually :\\\\begin{align} I(2^k) &\\\\le 2^k I(1) + 6c(\\\\alpha^{k-1}+2\\\\alpha^{k-2} + \\\\cdots +2^{k-1}\\\\alpha^0) + k 2^{k+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le 2^k + 6c\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^k-2^k}{\\\\alpha-2} + k 2^{k+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le d(2^k)^\\\\omega. \\\\end{align} for some constant . For matrices whose dimension is not a power of two, the same complexity is reached by increasing the dimension of the matrix to a power of two, by padding the matrix with rows and columns whose entries are 1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. This proves the asserted complexity for matrices such that all submatrices that have to be inverted are indeed invertible. This complexity is thus proved for almost all matrices, as a matrix with randomly chosen entries is invertible with probability one. The same argument applies to LU decomposition, as, if the matrix is invertible, the equality :\\\\begin{bmatrix} {A} & {B} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{C} & {D} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}I & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\CA^{-1}&I;\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,\\\\begin{bmatrix}A&B;\\\\\\\\\\\\0&D-CA;^{-1}B\\\\end{bmatrix} defines a block LU decomposition that may be applied recursively to A and D-CA^{-1}B, for getting eventually a true LU decomposition of the original matrix. The argument applies also for the determinant, since it results from the block LU decomposition that :\\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} {A} & {B} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{C} & {D} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\det(A)\\\\det(D-CA^{-1}B).

Spanish speakers from different countries or backgrounds can show a preference for one term or the other, or use them indiscriminately, but political issues or common usage might lead speakers to prefer one term over the other. This article identifies the differences between those terms, the countries or backgrounds that show a preference for one or the other, and the implications the choice of words might have for a native Spanish-speaker. Formally speaking, the national language of Spain, the official Spanish language, is the Castilian language (as opposed to regional Spanish languages like Galician, Catalan, Asturleonese and Basque). As such both names, español and castellano, have distinct and independent meanings that may be required for clarity in some specific contexts. Generally speaking, though, both terms can be used to refer to the (national) Spanish language as a whole, with a preference for one over the other that depends on the context or the speaker's origin. Castellano (as well as Castilian in English) has another, more restricted, meaning, relating either to the old Romance language spoken in the Kingdom of Castile in the Middle Ages, predecessor of the modern Spanish language, or to the variety of Spanish nowadays spoken in the historical region of Castile, in central Spain. History of the terms Originally Castilian (castellano) referred to the language of the Kingdom of Castile, one of several northern kingdoms that spread across the Iberian Peninsula through the Middle Ages, from about the 8th to the 15th centuries. Traditionally the first recorded examples of written Castilian/Spanish are considered to be the Glosas Emilianenses, a number of isolated words added to a Latin text as an aid to the reader, dated to the eleventh century. Soon after that there begin to appear discursive texts in Castilian, such as the Cantar de Mio Cid. This early Romance language was derived from Latin and evolved into modern Spanish. However, the term Spanish (español) is a more recent term that first referred to Spain as a country, and then to the predominant language spoken in that country. Spain as a truly unified nation appeared centuries later than the language and the Kingdom of Castile; in fact, it was only in the late 15th century that the personal union between the Crowns of Castile and Aragon unified Spain. The actual legal unification date is disputed, but commonly agreed to have occurred not earlier than the eighteenth century at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Only then did the Castilian language begin to be commonly called Spanish. In 1492, the arrival of Christopher Columbus on a Castilian- paid expedition paved the way for the Spanish colonization of the Americas. As a result of this process, most countries in South America now speak the same language as Castile. Until about the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Castile, and not Spain as a whole, was the colonizing power, and the language used was called castellano. Thus, some Latin American countries formerly under Spanish rule have retained the custom of calling it castellano, while others eventually switched to calling it español, with many different factors influencing the final choice. In English, the term Spanish relates both to the language and to the nation. The noun used for a person from Spain is Spaniard, with the collective noun the Spanish. The term Castilian is much less widespread amongst English speakers than the term Spanish. =Español= Two main hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the word español: one based on dissimilation in Old Spanish españón (from a presumed Vulgar Latin *hispaniōne), and the other on an Occitan term derived from a presumed Vulgar Latin *hispaniolus. Both Latin ancestor words are based on the place name Hispania (which evolved into España by regular sound changes); and both are marked with an asterisk to indicate that they are reconstructed, not directly attested. The dissimilation hypothesis, advanced by Ramón Menéndez Pidal,Manual de gramática histórica española (1904/1980), p. 181 (§66.2). presumes that Latin Hispania was lengthened by the derivational suffix -ōne (which survives in other ethnonyms such as bretón, borgoñón, sajón, and lapón). The Old Spanish form españon is documented in works of the 13th and 14th centuries.For example the Poema de Fernán González and the Libro del cauallero Zifar. It is suggested that the final /n/ of this form changed to /l/ by dissimilation from the previous nasal consonant, ñ. This sporadic sound change is observed in some other words: Menéndez Pidal cites Barcelona (from Barcinone) and delante (from de in ante); Lathrop adds ingle (from ing[ui]ne) and sangre (from sang[ui]ne).Thomas A. Lathrop, The Evolution of Spanish (Newark, Del.: Juan de la Cuesta), p. 97. According to the Occitan scenario, advanced by Rafael Lapesa,Historia de la lengua española (Madrid: Gredos, 1981), p. 199 (§51.3). the Spanish borrowed the Occitan name for themselves, which was the name España plus the diminutive suffix -ol, from the Latin -olus. The Occitan influence is inferred because in Castilian the same Latin suffix would have produced *españuelo rather than español. Lapesa counters the dissimilation hypothesis by citing other words with -ñón in which dissimilation did not take place: cañón, borgoñón, riñón, etc.P. 200, note 8. (However, the suffix could have been restored analogically in these, or they were formed after the dissimilation took place.) Penny, in discussing loans from French and Occitan, calls this \\"the most remarkable loan of all, español 'Spanish', replacing native españón.\\"Ralph Penny, A History of the Spanish Language (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 225. The name Hispania was applied to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans when they discovered and later subjugated it. One theory about this name is that it comes from Canaanite אי שפנים (ʾî šəpānîm), meaning 'island of hyraxes', named by Canaanite-speaking Phoenicians who mistook Spain's large rabbit population for hyraxes.Today the Spanish population of wild rabbits is much less abundant than in ancient times, due to the introduction of the myxomatosis virus to mainland Europe in the 1950s. Several other theories about the name have been advanced as well (see Hispania). The Romans called the inhabitants of Hispania hispani (singular: hispanus), and the relevant adjective was hispanicus. These terms, had they undergone regular sound change into Castilian, would have developed into España, *espanos (singular: *espano) and *espánego or *espango—but in reality, only the first term exists in modern Castilian. As the branches of Vulgar Latin began to evolve into separate Romance languages, the term that would evolve into español began to be used to refer to these derivative languages (especially as opposed to the Arabic and Hebrew of the Moorish and Jewish inhabitants of Iberia). It was at first a general term that embraced the various dialects of Iberian Romance spoken in the area, including the forebears of modern Portuguese, Galician, Castilian and Catalan. However, with the rise of Castile as a power, and its absorption of all surrounding regions into an ever-growing empire that eventually spread to the New World, the term España was eventually equated with the peninsular territories ruled by the Crown. With this, the break with the Roman concept of Hispania was complete, and the term acquired its modern meaning of 'all of Iberia except for Portugal and Andorra'. Similarly, español came to be used to refer to the common language of this new country: Castilian. The terms España and español spread to other languages. The English name Spain is from the French Espagne. Spanish is Spain plus the English suffix -ish. The term continues evolving as other languages adapt these words to form their own name for Spain—for example, Japanese スペイン語 (Supein-go), 'Spanish language', and スペイン人 (Supein-jin), 'Spaniard', derive from the Japanese word for Spain, スペイン (Supein), which, in turn, derives from English Spain. In Chinese, the word is taken directly from Spanish (or perhaps even Latin) rather than English: 西班牙 (Pinyin phonetic symbols: xībānyá) for Spain and 西班牙语 (Pinyin: xībānyá yǔ), or the abbreviation 西語 (Pinyin: xī yǔ) for the Spanish language. The Arabic إسبانية (isbāniya) for Spain derives directly from the word España: the absence of \\"p\\" in the Arabic alphabet makes it a \\"b\\", and the sound \\"ñ\\" is transformed into \\"n\\". إسباني (isbāni) is the name for Spanish, with the \\"nisba\\" suffix. In Guatemala, although Spanish is the official language, the Maya peoples, descendants of the original inhabitants of the region, call it la castilla, keeping the original name from colonial times. Mayans speak at least 22 different Mayan languages and dialects, including Mam, Pocomam, Kaqchikel, Tz’utujil, Q’eqchi’, and K’iche’. =Castellano= Castilla (Castile in English) means 'Castle-land'. The word is derived from Latin castella, the plural of castellum, which, in turn, is a diminutive form of castrum 'fortress, castle'. Through most of the Middle Ages the word was spelled Castiella, a form that survives in Leonese today. (Modern Spanish has transformed all words ending in -iello, -iella into -illo, -illa.) The adjective derived from Castilla is castellano. Castellano also means 'castellan', i.e. a castle master. There is a comic scene based on the play on words Castilian/castellan in the novel Don Quixote (Chapter 2). The region was thus named because it was a frontier land controlled from a series of fortified castles. It shared borders with rival Moorish Iberia (to the south) and the Christian kingdoms of Leon (to the west) and Navarre and Aragon (to the east). While espanyol is used in Standard Philippine and other languages of the Philippines, the word kastilà is more frequently used. Furthermore katsila is also used among those who speak Visayan languages, such as Cebuano. =Other local names= \\"Cristiano\\" During the presence of Moors in Hispania, Spanish was sometimes given the name cristiano (\\"Christian\\") to distinguish it from the Arabic and Hebrew languages. This term is still used occasionally today to refer to the language, in a jocular tone. The expression Háblame en cristiano \\"talk to me in Christian\\", uttered to people not speaking Spanish at the moment, is used in opposition of the other languages of Spain, which is felt as annoying by them (Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, but not in the Americas). \\"Háblame en cristiano\\" is also a phrase used to ask for clarification in a conversation, when the topic of the discussion is not clear or is vaguely hinted at by one of the speakers. \\"Language of Cervantes\\" The term \\"lengua de Cervantes\\" as an epithet for the Spanish language begins to be used early in the 19th century. Mariano José de Larra uses the expression in his essay \\"Literatura\\", first published in 1823.Obras completas, Vol. 4 (Madrid: José M. Repullés, 1837), p. 66. In 1829 it appears in Una cuestión de derecho, by Manuel Sivela.Paris: Gaultier-Laguionie, p. 185. Soon after that it appears in an anonymous article in the Gaceta de Madrid.\\"De las traducciones\\", No. 64 (May 29, 1832), p. 264. The poet Nicasio Camilo Jover, in his poem \\"Miguel de Cervantes\\", states directly \\"Y la lengua del pueblo castellano / Hoy se llama la lengua de Cervantes.\\"Glorias de España: Poesías históricas (Madrid: D.F.A. Fernel, 1848), p. 227 Spanish is called \\"el idioma de Cervantes\\" in a book published in 1830,Rafael Díaz Arenas, Memorias históricas y estadísticas de Filipinas y particularmente de la grande isla de Luzón (Manila: Diario de Manila and in another one published in 1838.\\"El Tío Cigüeña\\" (pseud. of Juan Mieg), Cuatro palabras á los señores traductores y editores de novelas (Madrid: Hijos de Doña Catalina Piñuela), p. 67. Occasionally the term refers to the language of Spanish Golden Age literature generally, rather than simply to that of Cervantes.For example Héctor M. Ardila A. and Inés Vizcaíno G., Hombres y mujeres en las letras colombianas (Bogotá: Magisterio, 2008), p. 14: \\"La lengua clásica, la lengua de Cervantes y Fray Luis de León\\". \\"The language of Cervantes\\" in English—as a term for the Spanish language generally—comes into use in the 1840s. Examples appear in Janin (1841)Jules Janin, \\"Biographical Notice of Le Sage\\", in Asmodeus: Or, the Devil on Two Sticks by Alain René Le Sage (London: Joseph Thomas, 1841), p. xi. and Campbell (1849).Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell, ed. William Beattie (London: Edward Moxon, 1849), Vol. 2, p. 149. \\"Román paladino\\" The poet Gonzalo de Berceo, writing in the 13th century, used the phrase \\"román paladino\\" to mean simple, straightforward language, the language spoken by the common people, as opposed to Latin. In the famous passage from his Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos, Berceo says \\"Quiero fer una prosa en roman paladino, / en cual suele el pueblo fablar con so vezino; / ca non so tan letrado por fer otro latino. / Bien valdra, como creo, un vaso de bon vino\\" (\\"I want to write verse [sic] in clear vernacular, in which the townsfolk speak to their neighbor; for I'm not so learned as to make another in Latin. It will be worth, I think, a glass of good wine\\").La Vanguardia, Nov 8 2012: \\"En roman paladino\\" Roman—and, more frequently romanz (and later romance)—was used in medieval Spanish as a synonym of castellano, i.e. the language now commonly called Old Spanish.Lloyd A. Kasten and Florian J. Cody, Tentative Dictionary of Medieval Spanish, New York: The Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 2001. And paladino meant—in Berceo's time the same as it does today—\\"public, clear, obvious\\".Diccionario de la Real Academia Española (Old Spanish paladino existed alongside its learned cognate palatino, which usually referred to the Palatine Hill of Rome. Both words are derived ultimately from Latin palatīnus \\"of the palace\\", with influence from Latin palam \\"openly\\".) Today \\"román paladino\\" is a high-sounding epithet for clear, straightforward Spanish. Recently it has been popularized in public speeches by Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has used it frequently as an equivalent for \\"I will clearly state...\\". Royal Spanish Academy In Spain, the Royal Spanish Academy is a normative body that rules on the orthography and general usage rules of the language. The Academy has used castellano since the 18th century, but since 1923, its dictionary and grammar are de la lengua española (\\"of the Spanish language\\"). The Academy's usage of one term is not necessarily a condemnation of the other. There are many other academies (grouped under the Association of Spanish Language Academies) that may or may not have an official normative recognition but nevertheless cooperate in the creation of the Diccionario panhispánico de dudas (a compendium of corrected typical mistakes and doubts). The dictionary, whose production was agreed upon by the 22 different Spanish Language Academies, says: Thus, even if both terms are allowed in Spanish, the use of español is recommended for the language as a whole. However, popular choice of terms is not so clear, with other factors, such as customs or geographical location, being factors. Usage in Spain Spaniards tend to call the language español (Spanish) to contrast it to languages of other states, such as in a list with French (francés), German (alemán), etc. Castellano (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other regional languages of Spain: official languages like Basque, Catalan and Galician or unofficial ones like Aragonese, Asturian, Extremaduran and Leonese. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term el castellano to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to las demás lenguas españolas (the other Spanish languages). Article 3 reads in part: This choice of words, however, varies depending on many factors, including the origin of the speaker or some political nuances. =Bilingual and multilingual regions of Spain= In the regions where regional languages are spoken, there is obviously a daily need to make the contrast between the national language and the regional language and so the national language is most often referred to as Castilian, particularly in the regional languages themselves (for example, espanyol is virtually never used to refer to the language in Catalan: castellà is used instead; in Basque, the name of the language is gaztelania or gaztelera, rather than espainiera; and in Galician, the most commonly used term is \\"castelán\\" rather than \\"español\\"). That is often mirrored by educated English-speakers to refer to the linguistic situation in Spain. For some, this use of the term castellano is a political or cultural statement that Spanish is only the language of Castile, perhaps also of some areas that Castile colonised, but not the language of their region, which they consider the only legitimate language to be the regional one: Catalan, Basque, Galician etc. That stance is common in regionalist circles. Conversely, some nationalist circles prefer the term español because they perceive their ethnic community to be distinct from that of Spain and therefore do not object to the language of Spain being called Spanish. In Basque-speaking regions, whose language is not of Romance origin (Basque is considered by many scholars to be a language isolate), some Basque speakers also use the term erdara or erdera erdara in the Morris Student Plus Basque- English dictionary. (foreign) specifically for Spanish, since for them, it is the prevalent foreign language, just as in the French Basque Country, \\"French language\\" is the usual meaning of erdara; in fact, erdara is another language, different from Basque. =Monolingual regions of Spain= In monolingual regions, the implications are a little different. In such regions, there is no identity implication, but still, they must choose one of the two terms. Castilians usually use the term el español, legitimately presenting it as the national language . However, they also frequently call it el castellano, either to assert their ownership or to distinguish it from the regional languages. Monolingual regions outside of Castile include mainly Andalusia but also other regions where the regional languages are not developed enough to be widely spoken by the majority of the population, such as Extremadura, Cantabria or Aragon. There, español may be used, as in Castile, to stress the national nature of the language but with a slightly different nuance: they are accepting another region's historical language as their own. =Concept of a standard= The term castellano is occasionally used to imply more of a standard form than español does. For example, if someone mispronounces a word, they might be told ¡Habla castellano!, i.e. 'Speak Castilian!', 'Speak properly!'. However, that nuance is not to be exaggerated, as it is perfectly possible that the term español or even, jocularly, cristiano ('Christian') could be used instead. Moreover, the term castellano is also commonly and correctly used to refer to dialects of Spanish, which deviate dramatically from the standard. Usage and implications in former colonies Geographic distribution of the preferential use of the terms castellano (in red) and español (in blue). Both names are commonly used in parts of the world colonized by Spanish speakers, such as Latin America and the Canary Islands. As in Spain, the implications are complex. The most common term used in Latin America is español, generally considered to be a neutral term simply reflecting the country that the language came from. For people who use that term, castellano may possibly imply greater correctness, as it sometimes does in Spain, or it may merely be an alien term, referring to a region in a far- off country. However, some Latin Americans prefer the term castellano, especially in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. One reason for this is that many early Argentine settlers were Galician,Another relic of this fact is the Argentine use of gallegos to mean recent immigrants from Spain, to be compared with the Australian use of pommy. for whom castellano had long been associated with the Spanish state in addition to Castile. Along with Basques or Catalans, Galicians might perceive the term español as imperialistic and misrepresenting the language of Castile as the language of Spain. In Chile the term castellano is more popular mainly because this was the term introduced by the Spanish themselves during colonial times, and continued to be the one used by Chileans throughout history. As most people who colonised were from Castilla, and the unification of Spain as a kingdom was very recent, colonisers normally referred to their language as lengua castellana. In Chile, the introduction of español to refer to the Spanish language has mainly come from foreign influence, either through U.S. translations of T.V. shows or Latino and Central American cultural exchange. Peruvians often prefer the term castellano for similar reasons to avoid the linkage between español and España. The Governorate of New Castile (Gobernación de Nueva Castilla) was established in Lima, Peru in 1528, and Peruvian history classes still emphasize the Castilian origin of the first conquerors and settlers. That tendency often manifests itself in a preference for films dubbed into Latin American Spanish, which often take longer to reach the market, over those in Español (Peninsular Spanish characterized by the use of vosotros), which tend to be found in pirated \\"cam\\" versions of films. Using español to refer to Peninsular Spanish is exactly the opposite of how English-speakers use the two terms, which can create some confusion. Castellano may also be used to refer to the dialect of Spanish spoken in Castile, and español would generally refer to Standard Spanish. In practice, usage tends to be a matter of local custom rather than reflecting any philosophical or political position. However, the fact that Castile is now a region subsumed within modern Spain has been the decisive factor in the preferential usage of español in an international context. =Countries whose constitutions use the term castellano= *Bolivia: The amendment of 1994 mentions castellano in passing; schools use castellano, but español is still frequent in common speech. *Colombia: The Colombian Constitution of 1991 uses the term castellano to define the official language of the country: \\"El castellano es el idioma oficial de Colombia\\". However, español is the most used term in common speech. *Ecuador *El Salvador *Paraguay *Peru: The Peruvian Constitution of 1993 uses the term castellano to define the official language of the country. However, español is the most used term in common speech. *Philippines: The various constitutions of the Philippines use the term castellano, both in Spanish and Filipino (Kastila). The term español (Espanyol) is also encountered in common speech and writing, and both terms are used interchangeably in Philippine Spanish and other languages of the Philippines. *Spain: Castilian (castellano) is the official language of the State. All Spaniards have the duty to know it and the right to use it. Other Spanish languages (languages of Spain) shall be official in the respective autonomous communities, according to their Statutes of Autonomy.La Constitución española de 1978 *Venezuela =Countries whose constitutions use the term español= *Costa Rica *Equatorial Guinea *Guatemala *Honduras *Nicaragua *Panama =Countries whose constitutions do not mention language= *Argentina *Chile *Cuba *Dominican Republic *Mexico *Uruguay Usage and misconceptions abroad Some philologists use \\"Castilian\\" only for the language spoken in Castile during the Middle Ages and state that it is preferable to use \\"Spanish\\" for its modern form. The dialect of Spanish spoken in northern parts of modern Castile may also be called \\"Castilian.\\" It differs from those of other regions of Spain (Andalusia for example); the Castilian dialect is conventionally considered in Spain to be the same as Standard Spanish. Another use of Castilian in English is to distinguish between Standard Spanish and regional dialects. As noted above, the distinction is made to some extent in Spanish but not as far as some English-speakers go; for example, websites with language selection screens give the choice between Castilian Spanish and Latin American Spanish, among other languages. In the Americas, where Spanish is the native language of 20 countries, usage of castellano and español is sometimes reversed to refer to another nation. For example, a Peruvian talking about a Uruguayan might say, Yo hablo en español peruano, él habla en español uruguayo, pero los dos hablamos castellano (\\"I speak Peruvian Spanish, he speaks Uruguayan Spanish, but we both speak Castilian\\"). That usage comes from the historical association of español with the language that was brought to America by conquistadores and was later transformed in each nation through daily usage, with castellano as the basis for all variants.

It involves 50,000 youngsters from all around Europe in its events and has around 5,000 active members in the different countries. It was established in 1987 in Fontainebleau, France.  History  The European Youth Parliament was founded by Laurent Grégoire (FR) and Bettina Carr-Allinson (NL), initially as a school project at the Lycée François-Ier in Fontainebleau, to the south of Paris. It is there that three of the first four International Sessions were held, starting in 1988, about a year after the idea took place. It then developed steadily for a few years until it moved to Witney, Oxfordshire, in 1991, and was legally recognised as the European Youth Parliament International Ltd., a subsidiary of a charity created in 1992 for this purpose, the Fontainebleau Youth Foundation. The organisation experienced an enduring growth for the next ten years, its network counting an increasing number of National Committees and its activities becoming both larger and more numerous. The National Committees stretch beyond the scope of countries within the European Union and try to encompass all European countries. In the years 2001 to 2004, the EYP encountered various problems of financial nature. On November 4, 2004, however, the European Youth Parliament was reborn due to a mutual agreement between representatives of EYP's Board of National Committees, alumni and the Heinz-Schwarzkopf Foundation. The EYP's status since then has been a programme of the Schwarzkopf-Stiftung Junges Europa, and is hosted in Berlin, Germany. The actual activities of the EYP never faltered during this period. Since 2004, the EYP has introduced several reforms to introduce more transparency in its institutions and further enlarged its activities.  Management  At the international level, the EYP is governed by an international board, the Governing Body. The Governing Body has six members elected by the National Committees and by the alumni of past sessions. A representative of the Heinz- Schwarzkopf Foundation is also a member. The board is largely responsible for the quality assurance of the International Sessions but also takes responsibility for the overall direction of the organisation and the long-term sustainability and protection of the organisation. The day-to-day business of the organisation is administered by a hired manager at the International Office in Berlin. Philipp J. Scharff was the manager from 2004 until 2008, Jan Phillip Beck (DE) from 2008 until 2011, Ville Vasaramäki (FI) from 2011 until 2013 and Krista Lagus (FI) from 2013 until 2017. Lukas Fendel (DE) has been taken on the role of Executive Director from 2017 until 2020. At the national level, the National Committees are free to choose how to manage themselves, though the form of management must comply with basic democratic principles. It is the responsibility of the National Committees to organise and fund their own national sessions (more about them below). International Sessions can receive limited funding from EYP at the international level but are largely responsible for their economy as well. Sessions are usually funded through sponsorship from various organisations or corporations. Each session must be economically independent.  Sessions  EYP organises three international nine-day sessions each year. They are organised in different countries and all European countries are invited to join, not just members of the EU. Each country's national committee selects a delegation to participate in each session, the size of the delegation depends on the country and how long time its National Committee has been part of EYP. The delegations are then spread out in different committees, each committee with a particular topic. This ensures a maximised cultural diversity in the committee and serves as a strong incentive to socialise and make friends with people from the committee. Each international session starts with a two-day Teambuilding part, in which delegates get acquainted with each other and start improving the group dynamics of the committee. The delegates play different games which are meant to bring the delegates from an initial shyness stage to a comfortable, open atmosphere optimal for efficient Committee work. This is followed by four or five days for Committee Work. During this time the delegates discuss a problematic topic on current European political matters and write a resolution on how to deal with the issue. A member of the European Parliament or some alternative expert will generally visit once to answer questions and quickly discuss the topic with the Committee. The sessions end with a General Assembly, in which the committee resolutions are looked through, altered and approved (or if the resolution is found unacceptable, not approved). If a resolution is approved it is sent on to the European Parliament, for the consideration of MEPs. General Assembly is usually held in some honorary or prestigious location, such as the host country's Houses of Parliament or the main hall of the City Council. Additionally National Committees of EYP organise several national and regional sessions every year. National sessions are to select a delegation for one of the upcoming international sessions. These sessions are shorter, lasting normally three days and do not invite a member of the European Parliament to the committees. Regional sessions are of varying length, from 3 to 7 or 8 days, and in essence imitate international sessions. They have, however, a more constrained budget and tend to be less formal than international sessions. For both national and regional sessions, resolutions are not sent on to the European Parliament.

delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, or some other misleading effects of perception. Delusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, paraphrenia, manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression. Types Delusions are categorized into four different groups: * Bizarre delusion: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences. An example named by the DSM-5 is a belief that someone replaced all of one's internal organs with someone else's without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question. * Non-bizarre delusion: A delusion that, though false, is at least technically possible, e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance. * Mood-congruent delusion: Any delusion with content consistent with either a depressive or manic state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity. * Mood-neutral delusion: A delusion that does not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania. =Themes= In addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are: * Delusion of control: False belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior. * Cotard delusion: False belief that one does not exist or that one has died. * Delusional jealousy: False belief that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up their claim. * Delusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation): Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity. * Delusion of mind being read: False belief that other people can know one's thoughts. * Delusion of thought insertion: Belief that another thinks through the mind of the person. * Delusion of reference: False belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. \\"Usually the meaning assigned to these events is negative, but the 'messages' can also have a grandiose quality.\\" * Erotomania: False belief that another person is in love with them. * Religious delusion: Belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god. * Somatic delusion: Delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance. Usually the false belief is that the body is somehow diseased, abnormal or changed. A specific example of this delusion is delusional parasitosis: Delusion in which one feels infested with insects, bacteria, mites, spiders, lice, fleas, worms, or other organisms. * Delusion of poverty: Person strongly believes they are financially incapacitated. Although this type of delusion is less common now, it was particularly widespread in the days preceding state support.Barker, P. 1997. Assessment in Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing in Search of the Whole Person. UK: Nelson Thornes Ltd. P241. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of delusional disorder but could possibly feature as a symptom of schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) American Psychiatric Association (2000) Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a supernatural, science-fictional, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have \\"delusions of grandeur\\". This is generally due to excessive pride, rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania. =Persecutory delusions= Persecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals. Persecutory delusions are a condition in which the affected person wrongly believes that they are being persecuted. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:Freeman, D. & Garety, P.A. (2004) Paranoia: The Psychology of Persecutory Delusions. Hove: PsychoIogy Press. The individual thinks that: # harm is occurring, or is going to occur. # the persecutor(s) has (have) the intention to cause harm. According to the DSM-IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in schizophrenia, where the person believes they are \\"being tormented, followed, sabotaged, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed.\\" In the DSM- IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the main feature of the persecutory type of delusional disorder. When the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action, they are sometimes called \\"querulous paranoia\\". Causes Explaining the causes of delusions continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view. This condition is more common among people who have poor hearing or sight. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions. Examples of such stressors are immigration, low socioeconomic status, and even possibly the accumulation of smaller daily hassles. =Specific delusions= The top two factors mainly concerned in the germination of delusions are: 1. Disorder of brain functioning; and 2. background influences of temperament and personality. Higher levels of dopamine qualify as a symptom of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis. There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite HVA and homovanillyl alcohol (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population. It is too simplistic to say that a certain measure of dopamine will bring about a specific delusion. Studies show age and gender to be influential and it is most likely that HVA levels change during the life course of some syndromes. On the influence of personality, it has been said: \\"Jaspers considered there is a subtle change in personality due to the illness itself; and this creates the condition for the development of the delusional atmosphere in which the delusional intuition arises.\\" Cultural factors have \\"a decisive influence in shaping delusions\\". For example, delusions of guilt and punishment are frequent in a Western, Christian country like Austria, but not in Pakistan, where it is more likely persecution. Similarly, in a series of case studies, delusions of guilt and punishment were found in Austrian patients with Parkinson's being treated with l-dopa, a dopamine agonist. Pathophysiology The two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \\"jumping to conclusions\\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions. The aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders. Specific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer's disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces. Diagnosis James Tilly Matthews illustrated this picture of a machine called an “air loom”, which he believed was being used to torture him and others for political purposes. The modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature. Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief. Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not. In other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused. In other cases, the belief may be mistakenly assumed to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing it, just because it seems to be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane). Similar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as R. D. Laing) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the subjective understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to \\"fix\\" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially. This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author Philip Jose Farmer and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel Red Orc's Rage, which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.AJ Giannini. Afterword. (in) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage.NY, Tor Books, 1991, pp.279-282. Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in \\"normal\\" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist Anthony David to note that \\"there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.\\" In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments. It is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as anxiety, fear, or paranoia. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes appearance, mood, affect, behavior, rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and concentration, insight and judgment, as well as short-term memory. Johnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, the person takes irrelevant information and puts it in the form of disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, the person takes the relevant information, in the form of counterexamples, and ignores it. =Definition= Although non- specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book General Psychopathology. These criteria are: * certainty (held with absolute conviction) * incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary) * impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre, or patently untrue) Furthermore, when a false belief involves a value judgment, it is only considered a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be, or never can be proven true. For example: a man claiming that he flew into the Sun and flew back home. This would be considered a delusion, unless he were speaking figuratively, or if the belief had a cultural or religious source. Robert Trivers writes that delusion is a discrepancy in relation to objective reality, but with a firm conviction in reality of delusional ideas, which is manifested in the \\"affective basis of delusion\\" Criticism Some psychiatrists criticize the practice of defining one and the same belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.D. Double 2006 \\"Critical Psychiatry: The Limits of Madness\\"Gavin Davidson, Jim Campbell, Ciarán Shannon 2015 \\"Models of Mental Health\\" Gaslighting Sometimes a correct belief may be mistaken for a delusion, such as when the belief in question is not demonstrably false but is nevertheless considered beyond the realm of possibility. A specific variant of this is when a person is fed lies in an attempt to convince them that they are delusional, a process called gaslighting, after the 1938 play Gaslight, the plot of which centered around the process. Sometimes, gaslighting can be unintentional, for example if a person, or a group of people aim to lie or cover up an issue, it can lead to the victim being gaslighted as well.The Sociopath Next Door by Martha Stout (2006) Harmony. . Treatment Psychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include individual psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and family therapy.

Mary Baker Eddy described it as her \\"most important work.\\" She began writing it in February 1872 and the first edition was published in 1875. However, she would continue working on it and making changes for the rest of her life. The book was selected as one of the \\"75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World,\\" by the Women's National Book Association.75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World Basic beliefs Christian Science develops its theology and its healing method from these simple statements: \\"God is All-in all.\\" \\"God is good.\\" \\"God is Mind, and God is infinite; hence all is Mind.\\" The conclusions are that humans are all perfect spiritual ideas of the one divine Mind, and manifest Spirit, not a material body. The five physical senses, which take no account of Spirit, are the origin of all false beliefs. Adherents of Christian Science claim that sickness is just a belief, not a property of matter. Praying from this standpoint removes the belief and brings healing. Structure The latest edition of the book consists of a short preface, the main section, a \\"Key to the Scriptures\\", and Fruitage. Some editions include a word index. =Main section= The main section is 500 pages long and comprises chapters titled as follows: * Prayer * Atonement and Eucharist * Marriage * Christian Science versus Spiritualism * Animal Magnetism Unmasked * Science, Theology, Medicine * Physiology * Footsteps of Truth * Creation * Science of Being * Some Objections Answered * Christian Science Practice (which explains how healing is undertaken) * Teaching Christian Science * Recapitulation (the text used for class instruction in Christian Science healing). = Key to the Scriptures = This section is 100 pages long, and comprises * Genesis (a detailed analysis of the two versions of the creation story given in Genesis) * The Apocalypse (an analysis of parts of Revelation) * Glossary (giving the spiritual meaning of 114 Biblical terms) = Fruitage = This 100 page long section consists of 84 testimonials of the healing power derived from reading the text in Science and Health. There are descriptions of addiction, asthma, broken bone, cataract, cancer, deafness, eczema, a fibroid tumor, and rheumatism. Prior intervention by physicians is mentioned in 50 of these cases, and one relates a confirmatory X-ray by a physician. Copyright The first edition was copyrighted in 1875.Eddy, 1906: p. ii. The copyright for Science and Health went through several renewals including a posthumous renewal in 1934 by the Christian Science Board of Directors. At the request of the Christian Science Board of Directors, in December 1971 Congress passed a law extending the copyright on Science and Health by 75 years.Private Law 92-60, AN ACT For the relief of Clayton Bion Craig, Arthur P. Wuth, Mrs. Lenore D. Hanks, David E. Sleeper, and DeWitt John However, following a legal suit brought by David James Nolan and Lucile J. Place of United Christian Scientists, the copyright extension was found unconstitutional in 1985 by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. In 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the ruling of the district court. As a result, Science and Health has been in the public domain since 1987. Editions The Bible (left) and Science and Health (right) The first edition was printed by W. F. Brown & Co. Their invoice for 1,000 copies, dated 30 October 1875, was made out to George M. Barry and Edward Hitchins for $2285.35. It consisted of 456 pages, plus 2 pages of errata. Unfortunately there were hundreds of typographic errors, some because the printer, not understanding the author's meaning, had tried to correct the wording without consulting her. The second edition, printed by Rand, Avery & Co, appeared in 1878, with 167 pages of new material. It was called Science and Health Volume 2 to indicate that it was a supplement to the first edition, but it, too, was full of typographic errors. However the third edition, printed by John Wilson at the University Press in Cambridge was of a high standard. Twelve further two-volume editions followed, before the 16th edition appeared as a single volume in 1886. This edition of the book had 552 pages, plus an index of 38 pages, and \\"with Key to the Scriptures\\" had been added to the title. Eddy remained loyal to the University Press for the rest of her life, and in 1897 even made a substantial investment to save it from bankruptcy. Eddy closed her college and left Boston in 1889, in order to revise the text for the 50th edition (1891). This consisted of 578 pages plus a 73-page index, and for the first time included marginal headings. The 226th \\"thousand\\" (edition) appeared in 1902, and this included \\"Fruitage,\\" making up the page count of 700 pages which remains to this day. The last numbered edition was the 418th, which appeared in 1906, but further changes were made until 1910. The German translation appeared in 1912. At Eddy's insistence, the English text of each page was printed opposite the German translation. The same format was kept for the subsequent versions in other languages: Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish. During the 1990s, a trade edition was released which included an index and a banner headline \\"More than 10 million copies sold.\\" This edition was intended for marketing through ordinary booksellers. Summary Science and Health encapsulates the teachings of Christian Science and Christian Scientists often call it their \\"textbook.\\" At Sunday services, passages from the book are read along with passages from the Bible.

She also founded the Christian Science Monitor, a Pulitzer Prize winning secular newspaper, in 1908; and three religious magazines: the Christian Science Sentinel, The Christian Science Journal, and The Herald of Christian Science. She wrote numerous books and articles, the most notable of which was Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures which had sold over nine million copies as of 2001.Paul C.

Early life =Bow, New Hampshire= Family Eddy's birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire Eddy was born Mary Morse Baker in a farmhouse in Bow, New Hampshire, to farmer Mark Baker (d. 1865) and his wife Abigail Barnard Baker, née Ambrose (d. 1849). Eddy was the youngest of the Bakers' six children: boys Samuel Dow (1808), Albert (1810), and George Sullivan (1812), followed by girls Abigail Barnard (1816), Martha Smith (1819), and Mary Morse (1821).Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore, Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition, A. A. Knopf, 1932, 3. Mark Baker was a strongly religious man from a Protestant Congregationalist background, a firm believer in the final judgment and eternal damnation, according to Eddy.Mary Baker Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, Christian Science Publishing Society, 1891, 13. McClure's magazine published a series of articles in 1907 that were highly critical of Eddy, stating that Baker's home library had consisted of the Bible.Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine, \\"Mary Baker G. Eddy: The Story of Her Life and the History of Christian Science\\", McClure's, January 1907, 232. Eddy responded that this was untrue and that her father had been an avid reader.Mary Baker Eddy, \\"Reply to McClure's Magazine\\" , Christian Science Endtime Center, undated.Mary Baker Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, Christian Science Publishing Society, 1913, 308. According to Eddy, her father had been a justice of the peace at one point and a chaplain of the New Hampshire State Militia.Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, 309. He developed a reputation locally for being disputatious; one neighbor described him as \\"[a] tiger for a temper and always in a row.\\"Bates and Dittemore 1932, 4–5. McClure's described him as a supporter of slavery and alleged that he had been pleased to hear about Abraham Lincoln's death.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 229. Eddy responded that Baker had been a \\"strong believer in States' rights, but slavery he regarded as a great sin.\\" The Baker children inherited their father's temper, according to McClure's; they also inherited his good looks, and Eddy became known as the village beauty. Life was nevertheless spartan and repetitive. Every day began with lengthy prayer and continued with hard work. The only rest day was the Sabbath.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 230, 234. Health Mark Baker Eddy and her father reportedly had a volatile relationship. Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore wrote in 1932 that Baker sought to break Eddy's will with harsh punishment, although her mother often intervened; in contrast to Mark Baker, Eddy's mother was described as devout, quiet, light-hearted, and kind.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7. Eddy experienced periods of sudden illness, perhaps in an effort to control her father's attitude toward her.Caroline Fraser, God's Perfect Child, Metropolitan Books, 1999, 35. Those who knew the family described her as suddenly falling to the floor, writhing and screaming, or silent and apparently unconscious, sometimes for hours.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 236; Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7. Robert Peel, one of Eddy's biographers, worked for the Christian Science church and wrote in 1966: Gillian Gill wrote in 1998 that Eddy was often sick as a child and appears to have suffered from an eating disorder, but reports may have been exaggerated concerning hysterical fits.Gillian Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, Da Capo Press, 1998, 39–47. Eddy described her problems with food in the first edition of Science and Health (1875). She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread, and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: \\"Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation.\\"Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health, 1st edition, Christian Science Publishing Company, 1875, 189–190. Eddy experienced near invalidism as a child and most of her life until her discovery of Christian Science. Like most life experiences, it formed her lifelong, diligent research for a remedy from almost constant suffering. Eddy writes in her autobiography, \\"From my very childhood I was impelled by a hunger and thirst after divine things, - a desire for something higher and better than matter, and apart from it, - to seek diligently for the knowledge of God as the one great and ever-present relief from human woe.\\" She also writes on page 33 of the chapter, \\"Medical Experiments,\\" in her autobiography, \\"I wandered through the dim mazes of 'materia medica,' till I was weary of 'scientific guessing,' as it has been well called. I sought knowledge from the different schools, - allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, and from various humbugs, - but without receiving satisfaction.\\"(Retrospection and Instrospection, Copyright 1901, by Mary Baker G. Eddy, Copyright renewed 1929) =Tilton, New Hampshire= Tilton, New Hampshire, which Eddy attended In 1836 when Eddy was fifteen, the Bakers moved twenty miles to Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire, known after 1869 as Tilton.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 235. Bates and Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser. She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 16–17, 25. She was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on 26 July 1838 when she was 17, according to church records published by McClure's in 1907. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of predestination with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old Jesus in the Temple.Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 14–15; Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 237. She wrote in response to the McClure's article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken by her.Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, 311: \\"My reply to the statement that the clerk's book shows that I joined the Tilton Congregational Church at the age of seventeen is that my religious experience seemed to culminate at twelve years of age. Hence a mistake may have occurred as to the exact date of my first church membership.\\" Eddy objected so strongly to the idea of predestination and eternal damnation that it made her ill: =Marriage, widowhood= Eddy in the 1850s Eddy was badly affected by four deaths in the 1840s.Stephen Gottschalk, Rolling Away the Stone, Indiana University Press, 2006, 62–64. She regarded her brother Albert as a teacher and mentor, but he died in 1841. In 1844, her first husband George Washington Glover (a friend of her brother Samuel) died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843 and set up home in Charleston, South Carolina, where Glover had business, but he died of yellow fever in June 1844 while living in Wilmington, North Carolina. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington II was born on 12 September in her father's home.Gottschalk 2006, 62–63; Gill 1998, xxix, 68–69 Her husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months.Gottschalk 2006, 63. She tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire Patriot and various Odd Fellows and Masonic publications. She also worked as a substitute teacher in the New Hampshire Conference Seminary, and ran her own kindergarten for a few months in 1846, apparently refusing to use corporal punishment.Gill 1998, 74–75. Then her mother died in November 1849. Eddy wrote to one of her brothers: \\"What is left of earth to me!\\" Her mother's death was followed three weeks later by the death of her fiancé, lawyer John Bartlett.Gottschalk 2006, 64. In 1850, Eddy wrote, her son was sent away to be looked after by the family's nurse; he was four years old by then.Eddy Retrospection and Introspection, 20. Sources differ as to whether Eddy could have prevented this.Fraser 1999, 38. It was difficult for a woman in her circumstances to earn money and, according to the legal doctrine of coverture, women in the United States during this period could not be their own children's guardians. When their husbands died, they were left in a legally vulnerable position.\\"Women and the Law\\", Women, Enterprise & Society, Harvard Business School, 2010: \\"A married woman or feme covert was a dependent, like an underage child or a slave, and could not own property in her own name or control her own earnings, except under very specific circumstances. When a husband died, his wife could not be the guardian to their under-age children.\\" Elizabeth Patterson Duncan Baker, Mark Baker's second wife Mark Baker remarried in 1850; his second wife Elizabeth Patterson Duncan (d. 6 June 1875) had been widowed twice, and had some property and income from her second marriage.Gill 1998, 86–87. Baker apparently made clear to Eddy that her son would not be welcome in the new marital home. She wrote: George was sent to stay with various relatives, and Eddy decided to live with her sister Abigail. Abigail apparently also declined to take George, then six years old. Eddy married again in 1853. Her second husband, Daniel Patterson, was a dentist and apparently said that he would become George's legal guardian; but he appears not to have gone ahead with this, and Eddy lost contact with her son when the family that looked after him, the Cheneys, moved to Minnesota, and then her son several years later enlisted in the Union army during the Civil War. She did not see him again until he was in his thirties: Study with Phineas Quimby Eddy's methods are seen as derived from the ideas of Phineas Quimby and homeopathy.Rennie Schoepflin, \\"Christian Science\\", in Paul S. Boyer (ed.), The Oxford Companion to United States History, Oxford University Press, 2001, 119. In October 1862, Eddy became a patient of Phineas Quimby,Gill 1998, 131. a mental healer from Maine. From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of mesmerism entirely benign.Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II. Quimby wrote in 1864, \\"The wise man, in like measure ... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science.\\"Quimby papers, Library of Congress, Vol. 6, 112. In a letter to the Portland Evening Courier in November 1862, Eddy wrote: \\"With this physical and mental depression I first visited P. P. Quimby, and in less than one week from that time I ascended by a stairway of one hundred and eighty-two-steps to the dome of the City Hall, and am improving ad infinitum. To the most subtle reasoning, such a proof, coupled to as it is with numberless similar ones, demonstrates his power to heal.\\"Paul Buchanan, American Women's Rights Movement: A Chronology of Events and of Opportunities from 1600 to 2008, Branden Books, 2009, 80–81.}} Eddy around 1864 She wrote in a letter in 1864: \\"I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord.\\"Lyman Powell, Christian science, the faith and its founder, G.P. Putnam's sons, 1917, 31. Eddy denied mesmerism in another letter to the Portland Evening Courier, claiming that Christ was the cure: Quimby had his own notions concerning the nature of these unseen forces which Eddy accepted early on, but she later drew decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and rejected any form of hypnotism. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another, and learned from one another. Quimby reportedly later said that he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and, at one point, referred to him as an \\"advanced thinker\\" with a \\"high and noble character\\".Peel 1971, 172, 183. She later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. In Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, she calls hypnotism mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient: \\"The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him.\\"Mary Baker Eddy, \\"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,\\" 375. Fall in Lynn On February 1, 1866, Eddy slipped and fell on ice while walking in Lynn, Massachusetts, causing a spinal injury: Eddy's son George Washington Glover II She later filed a claim for money from the city of Lynn for her injury on the grounds that she was \\"still suffering from the effects of that fall\\" (though she afterwards withdrew the lawsuit). Gill writes that Eddy's claim was probably made under financial pressure from her husband at the time. Her neighbors believed her sudden recovery to be a near-miracle.Gill 1998, 161-170. Eddy's attending physician Alvin M. Cushing, a homeopath, testified under oath that he \\"did not at any time declare, or believe, that there was no hope for Mrs. Patterson's recovery, or that she was in critical condition.\\"Martin Gardner, The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy, Prometheus Books, 1993. Eddy wrote in her autobiography, Retrospection and Introspection, that she devoted the next three years of her life to biblical study and what she considered the discovery of Christian Science: \\"I then withdrew from society about three years,to ponder my mission, to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take the things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great curative Principle, Deity.\\"Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 8–9, 22, 24–5. Eddy became convinced that illness could be healed through an awakened thought brought about by a clearer perception of God and the explicit rejection of drugs, hygiene, and medicine, based on the observation that Jesus did not use these methods for healing: Spiritualism Eddy separated from her second husband Daniel Patterson, after which she boarded for four years with several families in Lynn, Amesbury, and elsewhere. Frank Podmore wrote: Eddy in Lynn, MA, 1871 After she became well known, reports surfaced that Eddy was a medium in Boston at one time.Peel 1966, 133. At the time when she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away.Gill 1998, 627. According to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer.Gill 1998, 179–180. For example, she visited her friend Sarah Crosby in 1864, who believed in Spiritualism. According to Sibyl Wilbur, Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy's dead brother Albert and writing letters which she attributed to him.Sibyl Wilbur, \\"The Story of the Real Mrs. Eddy,\\" Human Life, March 1907, 10. In regard to the deception, biographer Hugh Evelyn Wortham commented that \\"Mrs. Eddy's followers explain it all as a pleasantry on her part to cure Mrs. Crosby of her credulous belief in spiritualism.\\"Wortham, Hugh Evelyn. (1930). Three Women: St. Teresa, Madame de Choiseul, Mrs. Eddy. Little, Brown, and Co. p. 220 However, Martin Gardner has argued against this, stating that Eddy was working as a spiritualist medium and was convinced by the messages. According to Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.Gardner 1993, 26. In one of her spiritualist trances to Crosby, Eddy gave a message that was supportive of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, stating \\"P. Quimby of Portland has the spiritual truth of diseases. You must imbibe it to be healed. Go to him again and lean on no material or spiritual medium.\\"Dakin, Edwin Franden. (1929). Mrs. Eddy, the Biography of a Virginal Mind. New York: London, C. Scribner's Sons. p. 56 The paragraph that included this quote was later omitted from an official sanctioned biography of Eddy. Between 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark who was interested in Spiritualism.Gill 1998, 172. Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them.Gill 1998, 173. Eddy's arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least one other who was there at the time—Hiram Crafts—that \\"her science was far superior to spirit teachings.\\"Gill 1998, 174. Clark's son George tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said that she abhorred the idea.Peel 1966, 210-211. According to Cather and Milmine, Mrs. Richard Hazeltine attended seances at Clark's home,Cather and Milmine, McClure's, May 1907, 108. and she said that Eddy had acted as a trance medium, claiming to channel the spirits of the Apostles.Cather and Milmine 1909, 64–68, 111–116. Mary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was Abraham Lincoln. According to eyewitness reports cited by Cather and Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872.Cather nd Milmine, 1909. Also see Robert Hall, The Modern Siren, H. L. Thatcher, 1916 (archive.org). In these later séances, Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science.Todd Leonard, Talking to the Other Side: a History of Modern Spiritualism And Mediumship: A Study of the Religion, Science, Philosophy and Mediums that Encompass this American-Made Religion, iUniverse, Inc., 2005, 32-33 Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice but denounced it in her Christian Science writings.Christian Science versus Spiritualism Historian Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy came to believe, after she founded Christian Science, that spirit manifestations had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death.Ann Braude, Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America, Indiana University Press, 2001, 186. Divorce, publishing her work Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery in 1873. She published her work in 1875 in a book entitled Science and Health (years later retitled Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures) which she called the textbook of Christian Science, after several years of offering her healing method. The first publication run was 1,000 copies, which she self-published. During these years, she taught what she considered the science of \\"primitive Christianity\\" to at least 800 people.Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Authority, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977, 483, n. 104. Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of Science and Health (chapter entitled \\"Fruitage\\") contains testimonies of people who claimed to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.Gill 1998, 324. In 1877, she married Asa Gilbert Eddy; in 1882, they moved to Boston, and he died that year.Mary Baker Eddy Timeline Accusations of plagiarism =Quimbyism= Phineas Quimby by 1859 had connected his healing practices with the Christ of the New Testament. He also called his method of healing the \\"science of health\\" and the \\"science of Christ,\\" and had used the term \\"Christian Science\\" to describe his work.Walter Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Bethany House Publishers, 2003, 151. According to the historian of science James C. Whorton, \\"In Quimby's mind, Christ and science were synonymous; his method of healing he thus called the Science of Christ and even, toward the close of his life, \\"Christian Science.\\"James C. Whorton, Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America, 119. Several critics, including Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine in McClure's, and Martin Gardner, have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy: Eddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating: \\"The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser. This greater error thereafter occupies the ground, leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error.\\"Eddy, Science and Health, 104:22–28. =Hinduism= In the 24th edition of Science and Health, up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between Vedanta philosophy and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita, but they were later removed. According to Gill, in the 1891 revision Eddy removed from her book all the references to Eastern religions which her editor, Reverend James Henry Wiggin, had introduced.Gill 1998, 332–333. On this issue Swami Abhedananda wrote: Other writers, such as Jyotirmayananda Saraswati, have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient Hindu philosophy.Maya Nanda, Vivekananda: His Gospel of Man-making with a Garland of Tributes and a Chronicle of his Life and Times, with Pictures, Swami Jyotirmayananda, 1993, 480; Timothy Miller, America's Alternative Religions, State University of New York, 1995, 174. The historian Damodar Singhal wrote: Wendell Thomas in Hinduism Invades America (1930) suggested that Eddy may have discovered Hinduism through the teachings of the New England Transcendentalists such as Bronson Alcott.Wendell Thomas, Hinduism Invades America, The Beacon Press, Inc., 1930, 228–234 (archive.org). Stephen Gottschalk, in his The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life (1973), wrote: In regards to the influence of Eastern religions on her discovery of Christian Science, Eddy states in The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany: \\"Think not that Christian Science tends towards Buddhism or any other 'ism'. Per contra, Christian Science destroys such tendency.\\"Eddy, Mary Baker The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany, page 119, line 10 Building a church Mary Baker G. Eddy in later years. Eddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, The Manual of The Mother Church, and revising Science and Health. By the 1870s she was telling her students, \\"Some day I will have a church of my own.\\"Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, 62. In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, \\"to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.\\"Eddy, Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1910, 17–18. In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist, \\"designed to be built on the Rock, Christ. ... \\"Eddy, Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1910, 18–19. In 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College,Peel 1971, 81–82. where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it.Peel 1977, 483, n. 104. Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition, a large sum for the time.Eric Caplan, Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy, University of California Press, 2001, 75. Her students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as Christian Science Practitioners in the church's periodical, The Christian Science Journal. She also founded the Christian Science Sentinel, a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing. In 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston.A New Home,\\" The Christian Science Journal, September 1888, 317. This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today.See Christian Science Reading Room listings in current edition of the Christian Science Journal. In 1894 an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston (The Mother Church). In the early years Eddy served as pastor. In 1895 she ordained the Bible and Science and Health as the pastor.NOTES: Eddy, Manual of the Mother Church, 58. Eddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers.Peel 1977, 372. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded The Christian Science Monitor, a daily newspaper.Gill 1998, xv. She also founded the Christian Science Journal in 1883,Gill 1998, 325. a monthly magazine aimed at the church's members and, in 1898,Gill 1998, 410. the Christian Science Sentinel, a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the Herald of Christian Science, a religious magazine with editions in many languages.Peel 1977, 415, n. 121. Malicious animal magnetism The converse of mental healing was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health – what Eddy termed \\"malicious animal magnetism.\\" She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon.Laurence Moore, Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans, Oxford University Press, 1986. In 1872 Eddy had an argument with her student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe that he was using mental powers to destroy her so she ordered her students to \\"mobilize all their mental energy to combat him\\".Ruth A. Tucker, Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement, 157. Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of \\"mental assassination\\".Miller 1995, 62. Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism.John S. Haller, American Medicine in Transition, 1840-1910, 139. According to Eugene V. Gallagher: The belief in malicious animal magnetism \\"remains a part of the doctrine of Christian Science.\\"William Williams, Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File, 2000. In an article entitled \\"Malicious Animal Magnetism\\" published in the Christian Science Journal, February 1889, Eddy wrote that mental assassination was one of the greatest crimes and that anyone practicing it should be put to death by a human executioner.Frederick W. Peabody, Religio-Medical Masquerade, 172. Several persons committed suicide because of the fear of malicious animal magnetism.Charles Locke, Eddyism: Is it Christian? Is it Scientific? How Long Will it Last?, Grafton Publishing Company, 1911, 39. Mary Tomlinson, a student of Mary Baker Eddy, committed suicide by throwing herself out of a window.Edwin Dakin, Mrs. Eddy: the biography of a virginal mind, Blue Ribbon Books, 1930, 462. Another Christian Scientist Marion Stephens committed suicide by gassing herself in a bathroom.\\"Lay Eddyite Suicide to 'Death Thought'. Malicious Animal Magnetism\\" Said to Have Caused Miss Stephens to End Her Life\\", The New York Times. In her later years Eddy apparently became paranoid, believing that 50,000 people were trying to kill her by projecting their evil thoughts.Bates and Dittemore 1932. Eddy wrote that if she died it would be due to malicious animal magnetism rather than from natural causes.Tucker 2004, 166. Use of medicine Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary There is controversy about how much Eddy used morphine. Biographers Ernest Sutherland Bates and Edwin Franden Dakin described Eddy as a morphine addict.Moreman, Christopher M. (2013). The Spiritualist Movement: Speaking with the Dead in America and Around the World. Volume 1: American Origins and Global Proliferation. Praeger. p. 58. Miranda Rice, a friend and close student of Eddy, told a newspaper in 1906: \\"I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies.\\"Fleta Springer, According to the Flesh: A Biography of Mary Baker Eddy, Coward-McCann, 1930, 299. A diary kept by Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary, suggests that Eddy occasionally reverted to \\"the old morphine habit\\" when she was in pain.Gardner 1993. Gillian Gill writes that the prescription of morphine was normal medical practice at the time, and that \\"I remain convinced that Mary Baker Eddy was never addicted to morphine.\\"Gill 1998, 546. Eddy recommended to her son that, rather than go against the law of the state, he should have her grandchildren vaccinated. She also paid for a mastectomy for her sister-in-law.Whorton 2004, 128. Eddy was quoted in the New York Herald on 1 May 1901: \\"Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vaccinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will do the children no harm. So long as Christian Scientists obey the laws, I do not suppose their mental reservations will be thought to matter much.\\"Eddy, General Miscellany, 344–345. Eddy used glasses for several years for very fine print, but later dispensed with them almost entirely.Peel 1977, 108–109, 411, n. 65. She found she could read fine print with ease.Peel 1971, 376. In 1907 Arthur Brisbane interviewed Eddy. At one point he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six, she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses.Arthur Brisbane, \\"An Interview with Mrs. Eddy,\\" Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1907. Towards the end of her life she was frequently attended by physicians.Rodney Stark, \\"The Rise and Fall of Christian Science\\", Journal of Contemporary Religion, 13(2), 1988, 189–214. Next Friends lawsuit  In 1907, the New York World sponsored a lawsuit, known as \\"The Next Friends suit,\\" which journalist Erwin Canham described as \\"designed to wrest from [Eddy] and her trusted officials all control of her church and its activities.\\"Erwin Canham Commitment To Freedom: The Story Of The Christian Science Monitor, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1958, 14-15 During the course of the legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed Eddy, then 86 years old, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs, and concluded that she was able to.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 411, 413, 417. Physician Allan McLane Hamilton told The New York Times that the attacks on Eddy were the result of \\"a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself,\\" and that \\"there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity.\\"The New York Times 1907. A 1907 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that Eddy exhibited hysterical and psychotic behaviour.Anonymous. (1907). Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy’s Case of Hysteria. Journal of the American Medical Association 7: 614-615. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger in his book The Human Mind (1927) cited Eddy's paranoid delusions about malicious animal magnetism as an example of a \\"schizoid personality\\".Karl Menninger, The Human Mind, Garden City Publishing Company, 1927, p. 84 Psychologists Leon Joseph Saul and Silas L. Warner, in their book The Psychotic Personality (1982), came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of Psychotic Personality Disorder (PPD).Leon Saul and Silas Warner, The Psychotic Personality, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982, 287–288. In 1983, psychologists Theodore Barber and Sheryl C. Wilson suggested that Eddy displayed traits of a fantasy prone personality.Wilson, Sheryl C; Barber, Theodore X. (1983). The Fantasy-Prone Personality. In Anees A. Sheikh. Imagery: Current Theory, Research and Application. New York: John Wiley & Sons. pp. 340-387. Psychiatrist George Eman Vaillant wrote that Eddy was hypochrondriacal.George Vaillant, Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers, American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1992, 70 Psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel has written that Eddy's lifelong secret morphine habit contributed to her development of \\"progressive paranoia\\".Ronald K. Siegel, Whispers: The Voices of Paranoia, Simon & Schuster, 1994, p. 105 Death Monument to Eddy in Mount Auburn Cemetery Eddy died on the evening of December 3, 1910, at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in.\\"Mrs. Eddy Dies Of Pneumonia; No Doctor Near\\", The New York Times, December 5, 1910: \\"Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, died Saturday night at 10:45 o'clock. The death was kept a secret until this morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. It was first publicly announced at the Mother Church this morning. Mrs. Eddy was in her ninetieth year.\\" She was buried on December 8, 1910, at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her memorial was designed by New York architect Egerton Swartwout (1870–1943). Hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including The Boston Globe, which wrote, \\"She did a wonderful—an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good.\\"\\"Mrs. Eddy's Life and Achievement,\\" The Boston Globe, December 5, 1910, 4. Legacy The influence of Eddy's writings has reached outside the Christian Science movement. Richard Nenneman wrote \\"the fact that Christian Science healing, or at least the claim to it, is a well-known phenomenon, was one major reason for other churches originally giving Jesus' command more attention. There are also some instances of Protestant ministers using the Christian Science textbook [Science and Health], or even the weekly Bible lessons, as the basis for some of their sermons.\\" The Christian Science Monitor, which was founded by Eddy as a response to the yellow journalism of the day, has gone on to win seven Pulitzer Prizes and numerous other awards. Residences In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy's birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn) pyramid with a footprint was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire. A gift from James F. Lord, it was dynamited in 1962 by order of the church's Board of Directors. Also demolished was Eddy's former home in Pleasant View, as the Board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage.Andrew W. Hartsook, Christian Science After 1910, Bookmark, 1994, 25–28. Eddy is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 105) along New Hampshire Route 9 in Concord.

(2015). A Dictionary of Psychology. p441.Alexander, G. J. (1996). International Human Rights Protection Against Psychiatric Political Abuses. Santa Clara L. Rev., 37, 387. Description According to Bell et al., \\"Sometimes, improbable reports are erroneously assumed to be symptoms of mental illness (Maher, 1998)\\", due to a \\"failure or inability to verify whether the events have actually taken place, no matter how improbable intuitively they might appear to the busy clinician\\". Examples of such situations are: * Pursuit by organized criminals * Surveillance by law enforcement officers * Infidelity by a spouse * Physical issues Quoting psychotherapist Joseph Berke, the authors report that, \\"even paranoids have enemies\\". Delusions are \\"abnormal beliefs\\" and may be bizarre (considered impossible to be true), or non-bizarre (possible, but considered by the clinician as highly improbable). Beliefs about being poisoned, followed, marital infidelity or a conspiracy in the workplace are examples of non- bizarre beliefs that may be considered delusions. Any patient can be misdiagnosed by clinicians, especially patients with a history of paranoid delusions. Patients may be diagnosed as delusional when their grievances concern health care workers and/or health care institutions, even when the patient has no history of delusion. \\"A patient arriving claiming to have been injured by another health care professional is regarded as a crazy person who potentially could ruin the career of an innocent colleague.\\" Origin Psychologist Brendan Maher named the effect after Martha Mitchell.Maher, Brendan A. (1988) \\"Anomalous Experience and Delusional Thinking: The Logic of Explanations\\". In T. Oltmanns and B. Maher (eds) Delusional Beliefs. New York: Wiley Interscience Mitchell was the wife of John Mitchell, United States Attorney General in the Nixon administration.

Ultimately, however, the facts of the Watergate scandal vindicated her and garnered her the label \\"The Cassandra of Watergate\\". Although it has been stated that many of her allegations remain unproved, such as her claim that she had been drugged and put under guard during a visit to California after her husband was summoned back to Washington, D.C., in order to prevent her from leaving the hotel or making phone calls to the news media,Reeves, Richard President Nixon: Alone in the White House, p. 511 James McCord admitted in 1975 that her story was true, as reported in The New York Times.

(1989), \\"La vita e le opera di Gregorio Sinaita.\\" Cristianesimo nella storia 10: 579–608. was a Byzantine Greek prominent theologian and ecclesiastical figure of the late Byzantine period. A monk of Mount Athos (modern Greece) and later archbishop of Thessaloniki, he is famous for his defense of hesychast spirituality, the uncreated character of the light of the Transfiguration, and the distinction between God's essence and energies (i.e., the divine will, divine grace, etc.). His teaching unfolded over the course of three major controversies, (1) with the Italo-Greek Barlaam between 1336 and 1341, (2) with the monk Gregory Akindynos between 1341 and 1347, and (3) with the philosopher Gregoras, from 1348 to 1355. His theological contributions are sometimes referred to as Palamism, and his followers as Palamites. Gregory is venerated since 1368 as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church; some Byzantine Catholic Churches, which form part of the communion of the Catholic Church, also venerate him. (He has also been called a saint, and repeatedly cited as a great theological writer, by Pope John Paul II.Pope John Paul II, Homily at Ephesus, 30 November 1979, General Audience, 14 November 1990, General Audience, 12 November 1997, General Audience, 19 November 1997, Jubilee of Scientists) Some of his writings are collected in the Philokalia, and since the Ottoman period, the second Sunday of Great Lent is dedicated to the memory Gregory Palamas in the Orthodox Church. The Byzantine Synodikon of Orthodoxy also celebrates his memory and theology while condemning his opponents, including some anti- Palamites who flourished after Gregory's death.  Early life  Gregory was born in Constantinople around the year 1296. His father, Constantine, was a courtier of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328), but died when Gregory was still young. The Emperor himself took part in the raising and education of the fatherless boy and hoped that the gifted Gregory would devote himself to government service, but Palamas chose monastic life on Mt. Athos. Gregory's mother (Kalloni) and siblings (Theodosios, Makarios, Epicharis, and Theodoti) would also embrace monasticism, and the entire family was canonized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2009. Before leaving for Mt. Athos, Gregory received a broad education, including the study of Aristotle, which he would display before Theodore Metochites and the emperor.John Meyendorff, A Study of Gregory Palamas, trans. George Lawrence (London: The Faith Press, 1964), pp. 28-41. Monastic career Despite the Emperor's ambitions for him, Gregory, then barely twenty years old, withdrew to Mount Athos in the year 1316 and became a novice there in the Vatopedi monastery under the guidance of the monastic Elder St Nicodemos of Vatopedi. Eventually, he was tonsured a monk, and continued his life of asceticism. After the demise of the Elder Nicodemus, Gregory spent eight years of spiritual struggle under the guidance of a new Elder, Nicephorus. After this last Elder's repose, Gregory transferred to the Great Lavra of St. Athanasius the Athonite on Mount Athos, where he served the brethren in the trapeza (refectory) and in church as a cantor. Wishing to devote himself more fully to prayer and asceticism he entered a skete called Glossia, where he taught the ancient practice of mental prayer known as \\"prayer of the heart\\" or hesychasm. In 1326, because of the threat of Turkish invasions, he and the brethren retreated to the defended city of Thessaloniki, where he was then ordained a priest. Dividing his time between his ministry to the people and his pursuit of spiritual perfection, he founded a small community of hermits near Thessaloniki in a place called Veria. He served for a short time as Abbot of the Esphigmenou Monastery but was forced to resign in 1335 due to discontentment regarding the austerity of his monastic administration.Archbishop Chrysostomos, Orthodox and Roman Catholic Relations from the Fourth Crusade to the Hesychastic Controversy (Etna, CA: Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, 2001), pp. 199‒232  The hesychast controversy  Hesychasm attracted the attention of Barlaam, a man who either converted to Orthodoxy or was baptized OrthodoxThe Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1341 condemned the Platonic mysticism of Barlaam the Calabrian who had come from the West as a convert to Orthodoxy. Of course the rejection of Platonic type of mysticism was traditional practice for the Fathers. But what the Fathers of this Council were completely shocked at was Barlaam’s claim that God reveals His will by bringing into existence creatures to be seen and heard and which He passes back into non existence after His revelation has been received. One of these supposed creatures was the Angel of The Lord Himself Who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. For the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils this Angel is the uncreated Logos Himself. (See John S. Romanides, Underlying Positions of This Website.)Jugie, Martin (1940) \\"Barlaam, est-il ne catholique?.\\" Échos d'Orient, 39 (197) : 100-125. Available on-line at: Persee.fr who encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices during a visit to Mount Athos; he had also read the writings of Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the hesychasts taught. On the hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by Palamas who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. Palamas was well- educated in Greek philosophy. Gregory wrote a number of works in its defense and defended hesychasm at six different synods in Constantinople ultimately triumphing over its attackers in the synod of 1351. =Early conflict between Barlaam and Palamas= Although Barlaam came from southern Italy, his ancestry was Greek and he claimed Eastern Orthodoxy as his Christian faith. Arriving in Constantinople around 1330, Barlaam was working on commentaries on Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite under the patronage of John VI Kantakouzenos. Around 1336, Gregory received copies of treatises written by Barlaam against the Latins, condemning their insertion of the Filioque into the Nicene Creed. Although this condemnation was solid Orthodox theology, Palamas took issue with Barlaam's argument in support of it, namely that efforts at demonstrating the nature of God (specifically, the nature of the Holy Spirit) should be abandoned, because God is ultimately unknowable and undemonstrable to humans. Thus, Barlaam asserted that it was impossible to determine from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds. According to Sara J. Denning-Bolle, Palamas viewed Barlaam's argument as \\"dangerously agnostic\\". In his response titled \\"Apodictic Treatises\\", Palamas insisted that it was indeed demonstrable that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father but not from the Son. A series of letters ensued between the two but they were unable to resolve their differences amicably. =Triads= Icon of St. Gregory Palamas in the Metropolitan Cathedral named after him and where his relics are kept (on the left) In response to Barlaam's attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled \\"Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude\\". The treatises are called \\"triads\\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises. The Triads were written in three stages. The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name. Gregory's teaching was affirmed by the superiors and principal monks of Mt. Athos, who met in synod during 1340–1. In early 1341, the monastic communities of Mount Athos wrote the Hagioritic Tome under the supervision and inspiration of Palamas. Although the tome does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam's views. The tome provides a systematic presentation of Palamas' teaching and became the fundamental textbook for Byzantine mysticism. In response, Barlaam drafted \\"Against the Messalians\\", which attacked Gregory by name for the first time. Barlaam derisively called the hesychasts omphalopsychoi (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East.1\\\\. His teaching about the light on Mt. Tabor, which he claimed was created. 2.

Romanides The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, Volume VI, Number 2, Winter, 1960-61. Published by the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Theological School Press, Brookline, Massachusetts. Barlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration.Parry (1999), p. 231 Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \\"uncreated light\\" to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.

Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline Appendix I:Timeline: Barlaam and the Councils of 1341 from Baron Meyendorff The second triad quotes some of Barlaam's writings directly. In response to this second triad, Barlaam composed the treatise \\"Against the Messalians\\" linking the hesychasts to the Messalians and thereby accusing them of heresy. In the third Triad, Palamas refuted Barlaam's charge of Messalianism by demonstrating that the hesychasts did not share the antisacramentalism of the Messalians nor did they claim to physically see the essence of God with their eyes. According to Fr. John Meyendorff \\"Gregory Palamas orients his entire polemic against Barlaam the Calabrian on the issue of the Hellenic wisdom which he considers to be the main source of Barlaam’s errors.\\"John Meyendorff. Byzantine Theology: Historical trends and doctrinal themes (Fordham University Press; 2nd edition, 1983, ). =Role in the Byzantine civil war= Although the civil war between the supporters of John VI Kantakouzenos and the regents for John V Palaeologus was not primarily a religious conflict, the theological dispute between the supporters and opponents of Palamas did play a role in the conflict. Steven Runciman points out that \\"while the theological dispute embittered the conflict, the religious and political parties did not coincide.\\" The aristocrats supported Palamas largely due to their conservative and anti-Western tendencies as well as their links to the staunchly Orthodox monasteries. Although several significant exceptions leave the issue open to question, in the popular mind (and traditional historiography), the supporters of \\"Palamism\\" and of \\"Kantakouzenism\\" are usually equated. Thus, the eventual triumph of Kantakouzenos in 1347 also brought with it the conclusive triumph of the Palamists over the anti-Palamists. =Fifth Council of Constantinople= It became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council. A series of six patriarchal councils were held in Constantinople on 10 June 1341, August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 February 1347, 8 February 1347, and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues.Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline Collectively, these councils are accepted as having ecumenical status by Orthodox Christians, some of whom call them the Fifth Council of Constantinople and the Ninth Ecumenical Council. The dispute over hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the emperor Andronicus III. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who recanted. The ecumenical patriarch insisted that all of Barlaam's writings be destroyed and thus no complete copies of Barlaam's treatise \\"Against Messalianism\\" have survived. Barlaam's primary supporter Emperor Andronicus III died just five days after the synod ended. Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Church and was appointed Bishop of Gerace. After Barlaam's departure, Gregory Akindynos became the chief critic of Palamas. A second council held in Constantinople in August 1341 condemned Akindynos and affirmed the findings of the earlier council. Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at a council held in 1344 which excommunicated Palamas. However, the last of these councils, held in May 1351, conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents. This synod ordered that the metropolitans of Ephesus and Ganos be defrocked and jailed. All those who were unwilling to submit to the orthodox view were to be excommunicated and kept under surveillance at their residences. A series of anathemas were pronounced against Barlaam, Akindynos and their followers; at the same time, a series of acclamations were also declared in favor of Gregory Palamas and the adherents of his doctrine. One notable opponent of Palamism was Nicephorus Gregoras who refused to submit to the dictates of the synod and was effectively imprisoned in a monastery for two years. =Gradual acceptance of the Palamist doctrine= Metropolitan Church of Saint Gregory Palamas in Thessaloniki (arch. Ernst Ziller), where his relics are kept. Kallistos I and the ecumenical patriarchs who succeeded him mounted a vigorous campaign to have the Palamist doctrines accepted by the other Eastern patriarchates as well as all the metropolitan sees under their jurisdiction. However, it took some time to overcome initial resistance to his teachings. For example, the metropolitan of Kiev, upon receiving tomes from Kallistos that expounded the Palamist doctrine, rejected it vehemently and composed a reply in refutation. Similarly, the patriarchate of Antioch remained steadfastly opposed to what they viewed as an innovation; however, by the end of the fourteenth century, Palamism had become accepted there. Similar acts of resistance were seen in the metropolitan sees that were governed by the Latins as well as in some autonomous ecclesiastical regions, such as the Church of Cyprus. One notable example of the campaign to enforce the orthodoxy of the Palamist doctrine was the action taken by patriarch Philotheos I to crack down on Prochoros Kydones, a monk and priest at Mount Athos who was opposed to the Palamites. Kydones had written a number of anti-Palamist treatises and continued to argue forcefully against Palamism even when brought before the patriarch and enjoined to adhere to the orthodox doctrine. Finally, in exasperation, Philotheos convened a synod against Kydones in April 1368. However, even this extreme measure failed to effect the submission of Kydones and in the end, he was excommunicated and suspended from the clergy in perpetuity. The long tome that was prepared for the synod concludes with a decree canonizing Palamas who had died in 1357/59. Despite the initial opposition of some patriarchates and sees, over time the resistance dwindled away and ultimately Palamist doctrine became accepted throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church. During this period, it became the norm for ecumenical patriarchs to profess the Palamite doctrine upon taking possession of their see. Martin Jugie states that the opposition of the Latins and the Latinophrones, who were necessarily hostile to the doctrine, actually contributed to its adoption, and soon Latinism and Antipalamism became equivalent in the minds of many Orthodox Christians. According to Aristeides Papadakis, \\"all Orthodox scholars who have written on Palamas — Lossky, Krivosheine, Papamichael, Meyendorff, Christou — assume his voice to be a legitimate expression of Orthodox tradition.\\"  Later years  Interior of the Cathedral, Thessaloniki. The reliquary of St Gregory Palamas inside the Cathedral. Palamas's opponents in the hesychast controversy spread slanderous accusations against him, and in 1344 Patriarch John XIV imprisoned him for four years. However, in 1347 when Patriarch Isidore came to the Ecumenical Throne, Gregory was released from prison and consecrated as the Metropolitan of Thessalonica. However, since the conflict with Barlaam had not been settled at that point, the people of Thessalonica did not accept him, and he was forced to live in a number of places. It was not until 1350 that he was able to occupy the episcopal chair. In 1354, during a voyage to Constantinople, the ship he was in fell into the hands of Turkish pirates; he was imprisoned and beaten. He was obliged to spend a year in detention at the Ottoman court where he was well treated. Eventually his ransom was paid and he returned to Thessaloniki, where he served as archbishop for the last three years of his life. Death and canonization Palamas died in 1357/59. His dying words were, \\"To the heights! To the heights!\\" He was canonized a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1368 by Patriarch Philotheos of Constantinople, who also wrote his Vita and composed the service which is chanted in his honour. His feast day is celebrated twice a year on November 14, the anniversary of his death, and on the Second Sunday of Great Lent. The reason for his commemoration on the Second Sunday of Great Lent is because Gregory's victory over Barlaam is seen as a continuation of the Triumph of Orthodoxy (i.e., the victory of the Church over heresy) which was celebrated the previous Sunday. Gregory's relics are kept in the Metropolitan Cathedral which is named after him. The Cathedral is in Thessaloniki, Greece.

Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his career as a painter, having previously attended the Liverpool College of Art. Sutcliffe and John Lennon are credited with inventing the name \\"Beetles\\", as they both liked Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets. The band used this name for a while until Lennon decided to change the name to \\"The Beatles\\", from the word beat. As a member of the group when it was a five-piece band, Sutcliffe is one of several people sometimes referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\". When he performed with the Beatles in Hamburg, he met photographer Astrid Kirchherr, to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art, studying under future pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students. Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to abstract expressionism. While studying in Germany, Sutcliffe began suffering from intense headaches and experiencing acute light sensitivity. In February 1962, he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed tests, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. After collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way there. The cause of death was later found to have been a brain haemorrhage – severe bleeding in the right ventricle of his brain. Early years Sutcliffe was the eldest child of Martha (known as Millie; 1907–1983), a schoolteacher at an infants' school and Charles Sutcliffe (25 May 1905 – 18 March 1966) a senior civil servant. Sutcliffe's father had moved to Liverpool to help with wartime work in 1943 and subsequently signed on as a ship's engineer, and so was often at sea during his son's early years. Sutcliffe had two younger sisters, Pauline and Joyce, as well as three older half-brothers, Joe, Ian, and Charles, and an older half-sister, Mattie, from his father's first marriage, to a woman whose name was also Martha. Sutcliffe was born at the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh, Scotland, and after his family moved to England, he was brought up at 37 Aigburth Drive in Liverpool. He attended Park View Primary School, Huyton (1946–1951), and Prescot Grammar School from 4 September 1951 to 1956. When Sutcliffe's father returned home on leave, he invited his son and art college classmate Rod Murray (also Sutcliffe's housemate and best friend), for a \\"real good booze-up\\", slipping £10 into Sutcliffe's pocket before disappearing for another six months. The Beatles' biographer, Philip Norman, wrote that Charles Sutcliffe was a heavy drinker and physically cruel to his wife, which the young Sutcliffe had witnessed.

Retrieved: 9 May 2007 Lennon took a train home, but as Sutcliffe had a cold he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from his girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, in order to fly back to Liverpool on Friday, 20 January 1961, although he returned to Hamburg in March 1961, with the other Beatles. In July 1961, Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass guitar of his own in June 1961, but specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change the strings around or restring the instrument, so McCartney had to play the bass as it was. In 1967, a photo of Sutcliffe was among those on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album (extreme left, in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley). Astrid Kirchherr Sutcliffe met Astrid Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club, where she had gone to watch the Beatles perform. She had been brought up by her widowed mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, on Eimsbütteler Strasse, in a wealthy part of the Hamburg suburb of Altona. After a photo session with the Beatles, Astrid invited them to her mother's house for tea and showed them her bedroom, which she'd decorated in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling. Sutcliffe was smitten and began dating Kirchherr shortly afterwards. He wrote to friends that he was infatuated with her, and asked her German friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked. Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was \\"like one of those fairy stories\\". Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom. Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as they thought he would give up his career as an artist, although he told Kirchherr that he would like to be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future. After moving into the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes. He wore her leather trousers and jackets, collarless jackets, oversized shirts and long scarves, and also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit. Art Hamburg Painting no. 2 Sutcliffe displayed artistic talent at an early age. Helen Anderson, a fellow student, remembered his early works as being very aggressive, with dark, moody colours, which was not the type of painting she expected from such a \\"quiet student\\". One of Sutcliffe's paintings was shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool as part of the John Moores exhibition, from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, Moores bought Sutcliffe's canvas for £65 (, which was then equal to 6–7 weeks' wages for an average working man. The picture Moores bought was called Summer Painting, and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student, Susan Williams. Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition (because they stopped off in a pub to celebrate), but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son. Sutcliffe had been turned down when he applied to study for an ATD (Art Teachers Diploma) course at the Liverpool Art College, but after meeting Kirchherr, he decided to leave the Beatles and attend the Hamburg College of Art in June 1961, under the tutelage of Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students.Hamburg identity card, 1961 liverpoolmuseums.org.uk. Retrieved 13 May 2007Eduardo Paolozzi's Report liverpoolmuseums.org.uk. Retrieved 13 May 2007 He wrote: \\"Sutcliffe is very gifted and very intelligent. In the meantime he has become one of my best students.\\" Sutcliffe's few surviving works reveal influence from the British and European abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist movement in the United States. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the kitchen sink school, particularly of John Bratby, though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s, including The Summer Painting, purchased by Moores. Sutcliffe's works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and Nicolas de Staël, though they are more lyrical (Sutcliffe used the stage name \\"Stu de Staël\\" when he was playing with the Beatles on a Scottish tour in spring 1960). His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël, whom he learned about from Surrey born, art college instructor, Nicky Horsfield, and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. Hamburg Painting no. 2 was purchased by Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery and is one of a series entitled Hamburg in which the surface and colour changes produced atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were also influencing Sutcliffe at the time. Hamburg Painting No. 2 1961 liverpoolmuseums.org.uk.

Death While in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light.Sefton General Hospital report liverpoolmuseums.org.uk. Retrieved 13 May 2007 According to Kirchherr, some of the headaches left him temporarily blind. In February 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed during an art class in Hamburg. Kirchherr's mother had German doctors examine him, but they were unable to diagnose the exact cause of the headaches. They suggested he go back to Britain and have himself checked into a hospital with better facilities, but, there, Sutcliffe was told nothing was wrong, so he returned to Hamburg. He continued living with the Kirchherrs, but his condition soon worsened. After he collapsed again on 10 April 1962, Kirchherr took him to the hospital, riding with him in the ambulance, but he died before they arrived. The cause of death was cerebral haemorrhage, specifically a ruptured aneurysm resulting in cerebral paralysis, due to severe bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain. He was 21 years old.Ingham, Chris, (2003) The Rough Guide to the Beatles, First Edition. London: Rough Guide, Ltd. P. 361. . Accessed 2013-08-25. On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met the group at Hamburg Airport, telling them that Sutcliffe had died a few days earlier. Sutcliffe's mother flew to Hamburg with Beatles manager Brian Epstein and returned to Liverpool with her son's body. Sutcliffe's father did not hear of Stuart's death for three weeks, as he was sailing to South America, although the family arranged for a padre, a military chaplain, to give him the sad news as soon as the ship docked in Buenos Aires. After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr wrote a letter to his mother, apologizing for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: > Oh, Mum, he (Lennon) is in a terrible mood now, he just can't believe that > darling Stuart never comes back. [He's] just crying his eyes out ... John is > marvellous to me, he says that he knows Stuart so much and he loves him so > much that he can understand me.Astrid's letter to Millie Sutcliffe > liverpoolmuseums.org.uk. Retrieved 13 May 2007 The cause of Sutcliffe's aneurysm is unknown, although it may have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against a brick wall during an attack outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon's little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep an X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital. Although Lennon did not attend or send flowers to Sutcliffe's funeral, his second wife, Yoko Ono, remembered that Lennon mentioned Sutcliffe's name very often, saying that he was \\"[My] alter ego ... a spirit in his world ... a guiding force\\". Posthumous music releases The Beatles' compilation album Anthology 1, released in 1995, featured previously unreleased recordings from the group's early years. Sutcliffe plays bass with the Beatles on three songs they recorded in 1960: \\"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\\", \\"You'll Be Mine\\", and \\"Cayenne\\".The Beatles Anthology (DVD) 2003 In addition, he is pictured on the front covers of all three Anthology albums. In 2011, Sutcliffe's estate released a recording claimed to be Sutcliffe singing a cover of Elvis Presley's \\"Love Me Tender\\", recorded in 1961 and donated to the estate in 2009. The cover art shows a Sutcliffe painting entitled Homage to Elvis. The authenticity of the recording has been much debated. Film, television, and books Part One of The Beatles Anthology video documentary covers Sutcliffe's time with the group. There is no mention of his death in the documentary, but it is discussed in the accompanying book. Sutcliffe was portrayed by David Nicholas Wilkinson in the film Birth of the Beatles (1979) and by Lee Williams in In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000). Sutcliffe's role in the Beatles' early career, as well as the factors that led him to leave the group, is dramatised in the 1994 film Backbeat, in which he was portrayed by American actor Stephen Dorff. Sutcliffe does not appear in the 2009 film Nowhere Boy, but is briefly mentioned toward the end of the film.

Jolliet and Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette, a Catholic priest and missionary, were the first non- Natives to explore and map the Mississippi River in 1673. Early life Jolliet was born in 1645 in Beaupré, a French settlement near Quebec City.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Jolliet When he was seven years old, his father died; his mother then married a successful merchant. Jolliet's stepfather owned land on the Ile d'Orleans, an island in the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec that was home to First Nations. Jolliet spent much time on Ile d'Orleans, so it was likely that he began speaking Indigenous languages of the Americas at a young age. Besides French, he also learned English and Spanish. During his childhood, Quebec was the center of the French fur trade. The Natives were part of day-to-day life in Quebec, and Joliet grew up knowing a lot about them. Jolliet entered a Jesuit school in Quebec as a child and focused on philosophical and religious studies, aiming for priesthood. He also studied music, becoming a skilled harpsichordist and church organist. He received minor orders in 1662 but abandoned his plans to become a priest, leaving the seminary in 1667 to pursue fur trading instead.Wilson, James Grant & Fiske, John (Eds.). Appleton's Cyclopædia of American Biography. New York: D. Appleton and Company (1887), Vol. III, p. 461. Exploration of the Upper Mississippi Ca. 1681 map of Marquette and Jolliet's 1673 expedition. While Hernando de Soto was the first European to make official note of the Mississippi River by discovering its southern entrance in 1541, Jolliet and Marquette were the first to locate its upper reaches, and travel most of its length, about 130 years later. De Soto had named the river Rio del Espiritu Santo, but tribes along its length called it variations \\"Mississippi\\", meaning \\"Great River\\" in the Algonquian languages. On May 17, 1673, Jolliet and Marquette departed from St. Ignace, Michigan with two canoes and five other voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry. The group sailed to Green Bay. They then paddled upstream (southward) on the Fox River to the site now known as Portage, Wisconsin. There, they portaged a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak forest to the Wisconsin River. Europeans eventually built a trading post at that shortest convenient portage between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. On June 17, the canoeists ventured onto the Mississippi River near present-day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. The Jolliet-Marquette expedition traveled down the Mississippi to within 435 miles (700 km) of the Gulf of Mexico. They turned back north at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By this point, they had encountered natives carrying European goods and worried about a possible hostile encounter with explorers or colonists from Spain.Cotton, Bruce (1984). Michigan: A History, p. 14. W. W. Norton & Company. . The voyageurs then followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the Illinois River, which friendly natives told them was a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. Following the Illinois river upstream, they then turned up its tributary the Des Plaines River near modern-day Joliet, Illinois. They then continued up the Des Plaines River and portaged their canoes and gear at the Chicago Portage. They then followed the Chicago River downstream until they reached Lake Michigan near the location of modern-day Chicago. Father Marquette stayed at the mission of St. Francis Xavier at the southern end of Green Bay, which they reached in August. Joliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries. Later years Jolliet married Claire-Françoise Byssot de la Valtrie. Like Jolliet, she was Canadian born, a daughter of Francois Byssot de la Riviere and his wife Marie Couillard. Claire Francoise was also a sister of Louise Byssot de la Valtrie, wife of Seraphin de Margane, Seigneur de la Valtrie. In 1680, Jolliet was granted the Island of Antwhere where he created a fort and maintained soldiers. In 1693, he was appointed \\"Royal Hydrographer\\", and on April 30, 1697, he was granted a seigneury southwest of Quebec City which he named Jolliest. In 1694, he sailed from the Gulf of St. Lawrence north along the coast of Labrador as far north as Zoar, a voyage of five and a half months. He recorded details of the country, navigation, the Inuit and their customs. His journal (\\"Journal de Louis Jolliet allant à la descouverte de Labrador, 1694,\\") is the earliest known detailed survey of the Labrador coast from the Strait of Belle Isle to Zoar. In May 1700, Louis Jolliet left for Anticosti Island. He then disappears from the historical record. There is no listing of his death or burial place, and the sole record of his fate is the notation that a mass for his soul was said in Quebec on September 15, 1700. Legacy Plaque commemorating Jolliet in Chicago. Monument commemorating Jolliet in Quebec City. Jolliet's main legacy is most tangible in the Midwestern United States and Quebec, mostly through geographical names, including the cities of Joliet, Illinois; Joliet, Montana; and Joliette, Quebec (founded by one of Jolliet's descendants, Barthélemy Joliette). The several variations in the spelling of the name \\"Jolliet\\" reflect spelling that occurred at times when illiteracy or poor literacy was common and spelling was unstandardized.Joliet, Louis Jolliet's descendants live throughout eastern Canada and the United States. The Louis Jolliet rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honor.Louis Jolliet rose The Jolliet Squadron of cadets at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean in the Province of Quebec was named in his honor. Joliet Junior College in Joliet, Illinois, is named after the explorer, as are numerous high schools in North America. A cruise ship sailing out of Quebec City is also named in his honour.

Example of a NuBus graphics card, a Radius PrecisionColor Pro 8/24xj. This is a \\"half-length\\" card, with a maximum length of 7 inches. The maximum length for full-size NuBus cards is 12 inches. NuBus (pron. 'New Bus') is a 32-bit parallel computer bus, originally developed at MIT and standardized in 1987 as a part of the NuMachine workstation project. The first complete implementation of the NuBus was done by Western Digital for their NuMachine, and for the Lisp Machines Inc. LMI Lambda. The NuBus was later incorporated in Lisp products by Texas Instruments (Explorer), and used as the main expansion bus by Apple Computer and a variant called NeXTBus was developed by NeXT. It is no longer widely used outside the embedded market. Architecture Early microcomputer buses like S-100 were often just connections to the pins of the microprocessor and to the power rails. This meant that a change in the computer's architecture generally led to a new bus as well. Looking to avoid such problems in the future, NuBus was designed to be independent of the processor, its general architecture and any details of its I/O handling. Among its many advanced features for the era, NuBus used a 32-bit backplane when 8- or 16-bit busses were common. This was seen as making the bus \\"future-proof\\", as it was generally believed that 32-bit systems would arrive in the near future while 64-bit buses and beyond would remain impractical and excessive. In addition, NuBus was agnostic about the processor itself. Most buses up to this point conformed to the signalling and data standards of the machine they were plugged into (being big or little endian for instance). NuBus made no such assumptions, which meant that any NuBus card could be plugged into any NuBus machine, as long as there was an appropriate device driver. In order to select the proper device driver, NuBus included an ID scheme that allowed the cards to identify themselves to the host computer during startup. This meant that the user didn't have to configure the system, the bane of bus systems up to that point. For instance, with ISA the driver had to be configured not only for the card, but for any memory it required, the interrupts it used, and so on. NuBus required no such configuration, making it one of the first examples of plug-and-play architecture. On the downside, while this flexibility made NuBus much simpler for the user and device driver authors, it made things more difficult for the designers of the cards themselves. Whereas most \\"simple\\" bus systems were easily supported with a handful of input/output chips designed to be used with that CPU in mind, with NuBus every card and computer had to convert everything to a platform-agnostic \\"NuBus world\\". Typically this meant adding a NuBus controller chip between the bus and any I/O chips on the card, increasing costs. While this is a trivial exercise today, one that all newer buses require, in the 1980s NuBus was considered needlessly complex and expensive. Implementations The NuBus became a standard in 1987 as IEEE 1196. This version used a standard 96-pin three-row connector, running the system on a 10 MHz clock for a maximum burst throughput of 40 MB/s and average speeds of 10 to 20 MB/s. A later addition, NuBus 90, increased the clock rate to 20 MHz for better throughput, burst increasing to about 70 MB/s, and average to about 30 MB/s. The NuBus was first developed commercially in the Western Digital NuMachine, and first used in a production product by their licensee, Lisp Machines, Inc., in the LMI-Lambda, a Lisp Machine. The project and the development group was sold by Western Digital to Texas Instruments in 1984. The technology was incorporated into their TI Explorer, also a Lisp Machine. In 1986, Texas Instruments used the NuBus in the S1500 multiprocessor UNIX system. Later, both Texas Instruments and Symbolics developed Lisp Machine NuBus boards (the TI MicroExplorer and the Symbolics MacIvory) based on their Lisp supporting microprocessors. These NuBus boards were co-processor Lisp Machines for the Apple Macintosh line (the Mac II and Mac Quadras). NuBus was also selected by Apple Computer for use in their Macintosh II project, where its plug-n-play nature fit well with the Mac philosophy of ease-of- use.Macintosh II technical specifications at apple.com It was used in most of the Macintosh II series that made up the professional-level Mac lineup from the late 1980s. It was upgraded to NuBus 90 starting with the Macintosh Quadras and used into the mid-1990s. Early Quadras only supported the 20 MHz rate when two cards were talking to each other, since the motherboard controller was not upgraded. This was later addressed in the NuBus implementation on the 660AV and 840AV models. This improved NuBus controller was used in the first generation Power Macintosh 6100, 7100 and 8100 models. Later Power Mac models adopted Intel's PCI bus. Apple's NuBus implementation used pin and socket connectors on the back of the card rather than edge connectors with Phillips screws inside the case that most cards use, making it much easier to install cards. Apple's computers also supplied an always-on +5 V \\"trickle\\" power supply for tasks such as watching the phone line while the computer was turned off. This was apparently part of an unapproved NuBus standard. NuBus was also selected by NeXT Computer for their line of machines, but used a different physical PCB layout. NuBus appears to have seen little use outside these roles, and when Apple switched to PCI in the mid 1990s, NuBus quickly disappeared.

His Thomas Wolsey, Late Cardinall, his Lyffe and Deathe is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as the \\"most important single contemporary source for Wolsey's life\\" which also offers a \\"detailed picture of early sixteenth-century court life and of political events in the 1520s, particularly the divorce proceedings against Catherine of Aragon. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Family Cavendish was born in 1497, the elder son of Thomas Cavendish (d. 1524), who was a senior financial official, the \\"clerk of the pipe\\", in the Court of Exchequer, and his wife, Alice Smith of Padbrook Hall, Suffolk. He was the great-grandson of Sir John Cavendish from whom the Dukes of Devonshire and the Dukes of Newcastle inherited the family name of Cavendish. George was an English courtier and author and the brother of William Cavendish, the second husband of Bess of Hardwick. He was probably born at his father's manor of Cavendish, in Suffolk. Later the family resided in London, in the parish of St Albans, Wood Street, where Thomas Cavendish died in 1524. Around this time Cavendish married Margery Kemp, of Spains Hall, an heiress, and the niece of Sir Thomas More. Career Probably aided by his father's position at the exchequer, in about 1522 Cavendish entered the service of Cardinal Wolsey as gentleman-usher, and stayed in his service until Wolsey's death in 1530.George Cavendish in Encyclopædia Britannica (1911), 11th Edition, Vol. 5, pp. 579–80 His position required him personally to attend the Cardinal at all times, as well as responsibilities for the lavish entertainments that Wolsey enjoyed. During this time Cavendish was often separated from his wife, children and estates. Cavendish also knew Anne Boleyn when she was first a 'debutante' at Henry VIII's court in 1522. He was adamant that she remained a virgin until her marriage, despite Catholic rumours to the contrary. However, although he attested to her sexual morals, he never forgave her for her hatred of Cardinal Wolsey or her animosity towards the Pope. Cavendish was wholly devoted to Wolsey's interests, and also he saw in this appointment an opportunity to gratify his master-passion, a craving \\"to see and be acquainted with strangers, in especial with men in honour and authority.\\" He was faithful to his master in disgrace, and showed the courage of the \\"loyal servitor.\\" It is plain that he enjoyed Wolsey's closest confidence to the end, for after the cardinal's death Cavendish was called before the privy council and closely examined as to Wolsey's latest acts and words. He gave his evidence so clearly and with so much natural dignity, that he won the applause of the hostile council, and the praise of being \\"a just and diligent servant.\\" He was not allowed to suffer in pocket by his fidelity to his master, but retired, as it would seem, a wealthy man to his estate of Glemsford, in West Suffolk, in 1530, having refused the offer of a position as gentleman usher from Henry VIII. He was only thirty years of age, but his appetite for being acquainted with strange acts and persons was apparently sated, for we do not hear of his engaging in any more adventures. Writings and influence It is likely that Cavendish had taken down notes of Wolsey's conversation and movements, for many years passed before his biography was composed. Between 1554 and 1558, he wrote it out in its final form. It was not, however, possible to publish it in the author's lifetime, but it was widely circulated in manuscript. Evidently one of these manuscripts fell into the hands of William Shakespeare, for that poet made use of it in his Henry VIII, and Samuel Weller Singer even said that Shakespeare \\"merely put Cavendish's language into verse.\\" Thomas Wolsey, Late Cardinall, his Lyffe and Deathe was first printed in 1641, in a garbled text, and under the title of The Negotiations of Thomas Wolsey. The genuine text, from contemporary manuscripts, was published in 1810. Singer published the first complete edition in 1825: The Life of Cardinal Wolsey, and Metrical Visions; from the original autograph manuscript. The \\"metrical visions\\" were his tragic poems: laments in the voice of ill-fated contemporary figures like Lady Jane Grey. Until the 19th century it was believed that the book was the composition of George Cavendish's younger brother William, the founder of Chatsworth House, who also was attached to Wolsey. Joseph Hunter proved this to be impossible, and definitely asserted the claim of George. The latter is believed to have died at Glemsford before July 1562. The intrinsic value of Cavendish's Life of Cardinal Wolsey has long been perceived, for it is the sole authentic record of a multitude of events highly important in a particularly interesting section of the history of England. Its importance as a product of biographical literature was first emphasised by Mandell Creighton, who insisted on the claim of Cavendish to be recognised as the earliest of the great English biographers, and an individual writer of charm and originality. He writes with simplicity and vividness, rarely yielding to the rhetoric which governed the ordinary prose of his age. Fictional portrayals George Cavendish appears as a minor character in Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, a fictional biography of Thomas Cromwell. Cavendish is portrayed as a devoted servant who genuinely admires Wolsey; in the novel, Cromwell describes him as \\"a sensitive sort of man.\\"Mantel, Hilary. Wolf Hall. 2009.

History The Hunterdon County Courthouse, where Bruno Hauptmann was tried. Before European settlement, the land that comprises Flemington, as was all of Hunterdon County, was the territory of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. In 1712, as part of a land parcel of , the Flemington area was acquired by William Penn and Daniel Coxe. The surrounding fertile farmland dictated that the beginnings of Flemington were agricultural. Early German and English settlers engaged in industries dependent on farm products. As time passed poultry and dairy farms superseded crops in agricultural importance. An example of early settlement families was Johann David and Anna Maria Ephland, who emigrated in 1709 from Germany through London to New York and settled on his farm in 1717. They raised their seven children, and two from his previous marriage, on the farm that now makes up the core of Flemington. In 1785, Flemington was chosen as the County Seat of Hunterdon. Fire destroyed the old courthouse in 1826 and the City of Lambertville made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to have the seat relocated there. Flemington remained the County Seat and the Courthouse which stands today on Main Street was built. What is now Flemington was originally formed as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1870, within portions of Raritan Township. It became a village as of June 11, 1894, still within Raritan Township. Flemington was finally incorporated as an independent borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 7, 1910, based on the results of a referendum held on April 26, 1910, and was formally separated from Raritan Township. The borough's incorporation was confirmed on April 27, 1931.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 155.

Originally from the Picardy region of France, they had fled after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 when the King began persecution of non Catholics in France. One notable settler was Luther Calvin, a landowner and ferry operator who also bought a Hotel on Everittstown Road. Calvin also served as a 1st Lieutenant of the Associated Companies in 1756 during the French and Indian War. In 1757, three joint owners of a tract purchased from the West Jersey Land Society began laying out streets and building lots at what was then known as Calvin's Ferry.

Boatmen and river men helped fuel Frenchtown's growth through their buying of cargo and food, and hiring of pilots. In the years after Henri Mallet-Prevost's death, his sons sold off portions of their property and no longer was the town privately owned. The arrival of the Belvidere Delaware Railroad in 1853 sparked continued growth in Frenchtown. Steam-powered industry became widely developed, and by the 1860s, water powered mills were being converted into larger factories. Around the same time, the town had three major hotels: The Lower Hotel (Present day Frenchtown Inn), The Middle Hotel (no longer existing), and the Upper Hotel (The National Hotel). In 1889, Britton Brothers Big Brick Store, which sold a variety of goods, opened on Bridge Street. The railroad eventually became a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It no longer operates but its tracks are still evident. The Delaware and Raritan Canal had been constructed adjacent to the Delaware River in the 1800s. It was quickly abandoned upon the arrival of the paralleling railroad. Its extant towpaths are now a popular biking and hiking trail from Trenton through Lambertville to Frenchtown and beyond. It is maintained by the State of New Jersey as the Delaware and Raritan State Park Trail. In the early 20th century, growth was spurred by the arrival of Frenchtown Porcelain Works, the establishment of the Milford plant of the Warren Paper Company, and the rise of the poultry industry.Friends of the Frenchtown Library.

In 1909, the name changed to the Musconetcong Fire Company and then later to the Hampton Fire Company. The fire company built the current Borough Hall/Fire House for the borough in 1951. The Borough occupied the east side of the building and the fire company used the west side. In 1981, the fire company expanded the building by adding a second floor for borough use and the Fire Company took over the entire lower floor.History, Hampton Fire Company No. 1. Accessed August 14, 2018. The Fire Company currently has as active apparatuses a 1959 International Harvester fire engine, a 1987 Emergency One Fire Engine, a 2000 Pierce Fire Engine, a 1995 Chevy Suburban command vehicle, and a 1978 GMC Rescue Truck. There are over 40 active members on the rolls which includes an active Junior Firefighter program for young people age 14 and over. ;Emergency Squad In 1955, the Hampton Fire Company selected one of its members, Gilbert Riddle, to organize an emergency squad. With the backing of the Fire Company, the present squad became operational in 1956. The Fire Company purchased the first ambulance, which was housed in the firehouse until the squad's permanent facilities were completed. On August 6, 1966 the dedication of the permanent home of the Emergency Squad took place. The Hampton Emergency Squad incorporated itself in 1976, becoming independent of the Fire Company, however its name did not change. In January 1978, the squad established an auxiliary membership. This membership is made up of people who wish to help the Hampton Fire Company Emergency Squad in its endeavors to provide the finest in first aid protection. A new GMC rescue truck was purchased in 1978. It was specially equipped with four-wheel drive and quartz spotlights for better lighting during accidents and fires. The rescue truck is still in service with the fire company today. The old 1968 Cadillac ambulance was replaced in 1982 by a Braun ambulance, and was later used as a service vehicle. A Ford Horton ambulance was purchased in 1987, and in 1992 another Ford Horton ambulance was added. An additional bay was added to the building in 1979 to provide storage of emergency vehicles and equipment. The Hampton Emergency Squad dedicated their building to the memory of Charles Tampier and William Deemer in 1982 in recognition of their exceptional service to our squad and community. Construction of the second story addition began in September 1985. After many long hours of planning sessions, the building committee and the community saw the fruits of their labor come to completion in 1986. The members of the Hampton Emergency Squad are committed to providing the latest in pre-hospital emergency medical care to the community.

History Originally settled by the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans, a area around Lambertville was acquired for 700 Pounds by the Council of West Jersey and divided into smaller plots. The earliest European settler in present-day Lambertville was John Holcome, who purchased a lot and built a stone home in 1724. Emanuel Coryell bought a property in the area in 1732. He received a charter to operate a ferry connecting what is now Lambertville and New Hope, and opened a tavern and inn to host travelers stopping halfway along the route between New York City and Philadelphia. The settlements on either side of the Delaware River were each called Coryell's Ferry. During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington and his colonial forces camped in the city. The Delaware River and the Delaware and Raritan Canal were instrumental in the early prosperity of Lambertville. In June 1834, the opening of the canal was celebrated with a barge ride from Trenton to Lambertville. The canal's completion was not without hardship. 4,000 Irish immigrants were hired to dig the canal with pick and shovel. During the construction, an epidemic of cholera broke out in 1832 and dozens of men were buried along the banks of the canal and the Delaware River.\\"Honoring the Irish Who Built the D&R; Canal DEP Commissioner Campbell and Senator Codey Dedicate an Irish Immigrant Memorial\\", New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, press release dated March 17, 2003.

The area was reincorporated as a city on March 26, 1872.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606–1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 156. Since the 19th century, Lambertville, due to its proximity to the canal and the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, became a factory town where the range of products produced extended from underwear to rubber bands. After the introduction of motorized vehicles made the canal obsolete, the factories began shutting down. Some made it into the 1970s. The railroad continued to serve as a vital freight carrier until the mid 1970s. Later, the Black River and Western Railroad acquired the line into town and continued operating short distance local freight trains as well as scenic tourist passenger excursion trains into the late 1990s.History of the Black River & Western Railroad, Black River and Western Railroad.

The large surface area of the tracks distributes the weight of the vehicle better than steel or rubber tyres on an equivalent vehicle, enabling continuous tracked vehicles to traverse soft ground with less likelihood of becoming stuck due to sinking. Modern continuous tracks can be made with soft belts of synthetic rubber, reinforced with steel wires, in the case of lighter agricultural machinery. The more common classical type is a solid chain track made of steel plates (with or without rubber pads), also called caterpillar track or tank tread, which is preferred for robust and heavy construction vehicles and military vehicles. The prominent treads of the metal plates are both hard-wearing and damage resistant, especially in comparison to rubber tyres. The aggressive treads of the tracks provide good traction in soft surfaces but can damage paved surfaces, so some metal tracks can have rubber pads installed for use on paved surfaces. Other than soft rubber belts, most chain tracks apply a stiff mechanism to distribute the load equally over the entire space between the wheels for minimal deformation, so that even the heaviest vehicles can move easily, just like a train on its straight tracks. The idea of continuous tracks can be traced back as far as the 1830s, however, the stiff mechanism was first introduced by Hornsby & Sons in 1904 and then made popular by Caterpillar Tractor Company, with tanks emerging during World War I. Today, they are commonly used on a variety of vehicles, including snowmobiles, tractors, bulldozers, excavators and tanks.  History  Polish mathematician and inventor Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński conceived the idea in the 1830s. The British polymath Sir George Cayley patented a continuous track, which he called a \\"universal railway\\". In 1832 a steam ploughing engine using continuous tracks was built by a British textile manufacturer called John Heathcote which apparently was somewhat successful but was lost when it sank into a swamp by accident and was then abandoned as the inventor did not have the funds to continue development. In 1837, Russian inventor Dmitry Zagryazhsky designed a \\"carriage with mobile tracks\\" which he patented the same year, but due to a lack of funds and interest from manufacturers he was unable to build a working prototype, and his patent was voided in 1839. = Dreadnaught wheel by Boydell (1846) = Although not a continuous track in the form encountered today, a dreadnaught wheel or \\"endless railway wheel\\" was patented by the British Engineer James Boydell in 1846. In Boydell's design, a series of flat feet are attached to the periphery of the wheel, spreading the weight. A number of horse-drawn wagons, carts and gun carriages were successfully deployed in the Crimean War, waged between October 1853 and February 1856, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich manufacturing dreadnaught wheels. A letter of recommendation was signed by Sir William Codrington, the General commanding the troops at Sebastopol. Boydell patented improvements to his wheel in 1854 (No. 431) – the year his dreadnaught wheel was first applied to a steam engine – and 1858 (No. 356), the latter an impracticable palliative measure involving the lifting one or other of the driving wheels to facilitate turning. A number of manufacturers including Richard Bach, Richard Garrett & Sons, Charles Burrell & Sons and Clayton & Shuttleworth applied the Boydell patent under licence. The British military were interested in Boydell's invention from an early date. One of the objectives was to transport Mallet's Mortar, a giant 36 inch weapon which was under development, but, by the end of the Crimean War, the mortar was not ready for service. A detailed report of the tests on steam traction, carried out by a select Committee of the Board of Ordnance, was published in June 1856, by which date the Crimean War was over, consequently the mortar and its transportation became irrelevant. In those tests, a Garrett engine was put through its paces on Plumstead Common. The Garrett engine featured in the Lord Mayor's show in London, and in the following month that engine was shipped to Australia. A steam tractor employing dreadnaught wheels was built at Bach's Birmingham works, and was used between 1856 and 1858 for ploughing in Thetford; and the first generation of Burrell/Boydell engines was built at the St. Nicholas works in 1856, again, after the close of the Crimean War. Between late 1856 and 1862 Burrell manufactured not less than a score of engines fitted with dreadnaught wheels. In April 1858, \\"The Engineer\\" gave a brief description of a Clayton & Shuttleworth engine fitted with dreadnaught wheels, which was supplied not to the Western Allies, but to the Russian government for heavy artillery haulage in Crimea in the post-war period. Steam tractors fitted with dreadnaught wheels had a number of shortcomings and, notwithstanding the creations of the late 1850s, were never used extensively. = Endless Railway by John Fowler (1858) = In August 1858, more than two years after the end of the Crimean War, John Fowler filed British Patent No. 1948 on another form of \\"Endless Railway\\". In his illustration of the invention, Fowler used a pair of wheels of equal diameter on each side of his vehicle, around which pair of toothed wheels ran a 'track' of eight jointed segments, with a smaller jockey/drive wheel between each pair of wheels, to support the 'track'. Comprising only eight sections, the 'track' sections are essentially 'longitudinal', as in Boydell's initial design. Fowler's arrangement is a precursor to the multi- section caterpillar track in which a relatively large number of short 'transverse' treads are used, as proposed by Sir George Caley in 1825, rather than a small number of relatively long 'longitudinal' treads. Further to Fowler's patent of 1858, in 1877, a Russian, Fyodor Blinov, created a tracked vehicle called \\"wagon moved on endless rails\\" (caterpillars). It lacked self- propulsion and was pulled by horses. Blinov received a patent for his \\"wagon\\" in 1878. From 1881 to 1888 he developed a steam-powered caterpillar-tractor. This self-propelled crawler was successfully tested and featured at a farmers' exhibition in 1896. = 20th century efforts = Steam traction engines were used at the end of the 19th century in the Boer Wars. But neither dreadnaught wheels nor continuous tracks were used, rather \\"roll-out\\" wooden plank roads were thrown under the wheels as required.The Implement and Machinery Review, 1901-01-02 In short, whilst the development of the continuous track engaged the attention of a number of inventors in the 18th and 19th centuries, the general use and exploitation of the continuous track belonged to the 20th century, mainly in the United States and England. A little-known American inventor, Henry T. Stith, had developed a continuous track prototype which was, in multiple forms, patented in 1873, 1880, and 1900. The last was for the application of the track to a prototype off-road bicycle built for his son. The 1900 prototype is retained by his surviving family. Frank Beamond, a less- commonly known but significant British inventor, designed and built caterpillar tracks, and was granted patents for them in a number of countries, in 1900 and 1907. Lombard Steam Log Hauler (Designed, patented 1901) = First commercial success (1901) = A first effective continuous track was not only invented but really implemented by Alvin Orlando Lombard for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. He was granted a patent in 1901 and built the first steam-powered log hauler at the Waterville Iron Works in Waterville, Maine, the same year. In all, 83 Lombard steam log haulers are known to have been built up to 1917, when production switched entirely to internal combustion engine powered machines, ending with a Fairbanks diesel-powered unit in 1934\\\\. Undoubtedly, Alvin Lombard was the first commercial manufacturer of the tractor crawler. At least one of Lombard's steam-powered machines apparently remains in working order. A gasoline-powered Lombard hauler is on display at the Maine State Museum in Augusta. In addition, there may have been up to twice as many Phoenix Centipeed versions of the steam log hauler built under license from Lombard, with vertical instead of horizontal cylinders. In 1903, the founder of Holt Manufacturing, Benjamin Holt, paid Lombard $60,000 for the right to produce vehicles under his patent. = The stiff chain by Hornsby & Sons (1904) = At about the same time a British agricultural company, Hornsby in Grantham, developed a continuous track which was patented in 1905.British Patent No. 16,345 (1904) The design differed from modern tracks in that it flexed in only one direction, with the effect that the links locked together to form a solid rail on which the road wheels ran. Hornsby's tracked vehicles were given trials as artillery tractors by the British Army on several occasions between 1905 and 1910, but not adopted. The Hornsby tractors featured a track-steer clutch arrangement, which is the basis of the modern crawler operation. The patent was purchased by Holt. { border=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\"  First Chain Tracked Tractor (1905, Richard Hornsby & Sons)  Hornsby Chain Tracked Tractor (1907 enhanced Version) } = Holt and the Caterpillar = A modern Caterpillar Inc.

The soldiers immediately christened the 70bhp No.2 machine the 'caterpillar'.\\"The Devil's Chariot, John Glanfield Holt adopted that name for his \\"crawler\\" tractors. Holt began moving from steam to gasoline-powered designs, and in 1908 brought out the 40 horsepower \\"Holt Model 40 Caterpillar\\". Holt incorporated the Holt Caterpillar Company, in early 1910, later that year trademarked the name \\"Caterpillar\\" for his continuous tracks. Caterpillar Tractor Company began in 1925 from a merger of the Holt Manufacturing Company and the C. L. Best Tractor Company, an early successful manufacturer of crawler tractors. With the Caterpillar D10 in 1977, Caterpillar resurrected a design by Holt and Best, the high-sprocket-drive, since known as the \\"High Drive\\", which had the advantage of keeping the main drive shaft away from ground shocks and dirt,The Earthmover Encyclopedia, Page 28, Keith Haddock and is still used in their larger dozers. = Snow vehicles = In a memorandum of 1908, Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed.R. F. Scott (1908). The Sledging Problem in the Antarctic, Men versus Motors Snow vehicles did not yet exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces.Roland Huntford (2003) Scott and Amundsen. Their Race to the South Pole. The Last Place on Earth. Abacus, London, p.224 These tracked motors were built by the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company in Birmingham, tested in Switzerland and Norway, and can be seen in action in Herbert Ponting's 1911 documentary film of Scott's Antarctic Terra Nova Expedition. Scott died during the expedition in 1912, but expedition member and biographer Apsley Cherry-Garrard credited Scott's \\"motors\\" with the inspiration for the British World War I tanks, writing: \\"Scott never knew their true possibilities; for they were the direct ancestors of the 'tanks' in France.\\" = Military application = Continuous track was first applied to a military vehicle on the British prototype tank Little Willie. British Army officers, Colonel Ernest Swinton and Colonel Maurice Hankey, became convinced that it was possible to develop a fighting vehicle that could provide protection from machine gun fire. During World War I, Holt tractors were used by the British and Austro-Hungarian armies to tow heavy artillery and stimulated the development of tanks in several countries. The first tanks to go into action, the Mark I, built by Great Britain, were designed from scratch and were inspired by, but not directly based on, the Holt. The slightly later French and German tanks were built on modified Holt running gear.  Patent history  A long line of patents disputes who was the \\"originator\\" of continuous tracks. There were a number of designs that attempted to achieve a track laying mechanism, although these designs do not generally resemble modern tracked vehicles. Blinov's steam-powered continuous track tractor = Blinov = In 1877 Russian inventor Fyodor Abramovich Blinov created a tracked vehicle called \\"wagon moved on endless rails\\" (caterpillars). It lacked self- propelling and was horse-drawn. Blinov got a patent for his \\"wagon\\" the next year. Later, in 1881–1888 he created a steam-powered caterpillar-tractor. This self-propelled crawler was successfully tested and showed at a farmers' exhibition in 1896. = Dinsmoor = According to Scientific American, it was Charles Dinsmoor of Warren, Pennsylvania that invented a \\"vehicle\\" that was on endless tracks. The article gives a detailed description of the endless tracks and the illustration looks much like today's tracked vehicles.Scientific American, December 18, 1886, Vol. LV, No. 25 The invention has been patented as No. 351,749 on November 2, 1886.Kane, Joseph Nathan, Famous First Facts, H. W. Wilson Company (1950), p. 47 A design for a tracked vehicle. = Lombard = Alvin O. Lombard of Waterville, Maine was issued a patent in 1901 for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler that resembles a regular railroad steam locomotive with sled steerage on front and crawlers in rear for hauling logs in the Northeastern United States and Canada. The haulers allowed pulp to be taken to rivers in the winter. Prior to then, horses could be used only until snow depths made hauling impossible. Lombard began commercial production which lasted until around 1917 when focus switched entirely to gasoline powered machines. A gasoline-powered hauler is on display at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, Maine. =Hornsby / Holt / Phoenix= A Model of the Hornsby tractor After Lombard began operations, Hornsby in England manufactured at least two full length \\"track steer\\" machines, and their patent was later purchased by Holt in 1913, allowing Holt to claim to be the \\"inventor\\" of the crawler tractor. Since the \\"tank\\" was a British concept it is more likely the Hornsby, which had been built and unsuccessfully pitched to their military, was the inspiration. In a patent dispute involving rival crawler builder Best, testimony was brought in from people including Lombard, that Holt had inspected a Lombard log hauler shipped out to a western state by people who would later build the Phoenix log hauler in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, under license from Lombard. The Phoenix Centipeed typically had a fancier wood cab, steering wheel tipped forward at a 45 degree angle and vertical instead of horizontal cylinders. = Linn = In the meantime, a gasoline-powered motor home was built by Lombard for Holman Harry (Flannery) Linn of Old Town, Maine to pull the equipment wagon of his dog & pony show, resembling a trolley car only with wheels in front and Lombard crawlers in rear. Linn had experimented with gasoline and steam-powered vehicles and six-wheel drive before this, and at some point entered Lombard's employment as a demonstrator, mechanic and sales agent. This resulted in a question of proprietorship of patent rights after a single rear-tracked gasoline-powered road engine of tricycle arrangement was built to replace the larger motor home in 1909 on account of problems with the old picturesque wooden bridges. This dispute resulted in Linn departing Maine and relocating to Morris, New York, to build an improved, contour following flexible lag tread or crawler with independent suspension of halftrack type, gasoline and later diesel powered. Although several were delivered for military use between 1917 and 1946, Linn never received any large military orders. Most of the production between 1917 and 1952, approximately 2500 units, was sold directly to highway departments and contractors. Steel tracks and payload capacity allowed these machines to work in terrain that would typically cause the poorer quality rubber tyres that existed before the mid-1930s to spin uselessly, or shred completely. Linn was a pioneer in snow removal before the practice was embraced in rural areas, with a nine-foot steel v-plow and sixteen foot adjustable leveling wings on either side. Once the highway system became paved, snowplowing could be done by four wheel drive trucks equipped by improving tyre designs, and the Linn became an off highway vehicle, for logging, mining, dam construction, arctic exploration, etc.  Engineering  Diagram of tracked suspension.(1=rear drive wheel (rear wheel drive), 2=track, 3=return rollers, 4=front drive wheel (front wheel drive), 5=road wheels, 6=idler) A sprocket wheel on a tank = Construction and operation = Modern tracks are built from modular chain links which together compose a closed chain. The links are jointed by a hinge, which allows the track to be flexible and wrap around a set of wheels to make an endless loop. The chain links are often broad, and can be made of manganese alloy steel for high strength, hardness, and abrasion resistance. Track construction and assembly is dictated by the application. Military vehicles use a track shoe that is integral to the structure of the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely unsprung, reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a track with shoes that attach to the chain with bolts and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows track shoes to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle. The vehicle's weight is transferred to the bottom length of track by a number of road wheels, or sets of wheels called bogies. Road wheels are typically mounted on some form of suspension to cushion the ride over rough ground. Suspension design in military vehicles is a major area of development; the very early designs were often completely unsprung. Later-developed road wheel suspension offered only a few inches of travel using springs, whereas modern hydro-pneumatic systems allow several feet of travel and include shock absorbers. Torsion-bar suspension has become the most common type of military vehicle suspension. Construction vehicles have smaller road wheels that are designed primarily to prevent track derailment and they are normally contained in a single bogie that includes the idler-wheel and sometimes the sprocket. Overlapped and interleaved road wheels of a German Tiger I heavy tank An Sd.Kfz. 11's half-track units, showing the rims of its six Schachtellaufwerk overlapped/interleaved roadwheel sets for each track unit per side  Overlapping road wheels  Many World War II German military vehicles, initially (starting in the late 1930s) including all vehicles originally designed to be half-tracks and all later tank designs (after the Panzer IV), had slack-track systems, usually driven by a front-located drive sprocket, the track returning along the tops of a design of overlapping and sometimes interleaved large diameter road wheels, as on the suspension systems of the Tiger I and Panther tanks, generically known by the term Schachtellaufwerk in German, for both half-track and fully tracked vehicles. There were suspensions with single or sometimes doubled wheels per axle, alternately supporting the inner and outer side of the track, and interleaved suspensions with two or three road wheels per axle, distributing the load over the track.Peter Chamberlain and Hilary Doyle, Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War II, 1999 The choice of overlapping/interleaved road wheels allowed the use of slightly more transverse-orientation torsion bar suspension members, allowing any German tracked military vehicle with such a setup to have a noticeably smoother ride over challenging terrain, leading to reduced wear, ensuring greater traction and more accurate fire. However, on the Russian front, mud and snow would get stuck in-between the overlapping wheels, freeze, and immobilize the vehicle. As a tracked vehicle moves, the load of each wheel moves over the track, pushing down and forward that part of the earth or snow underneath it, similarly to a wheeled vehicle but to a lesser extent because the tread helps distribute the load. On some surfaces, this can consume enough energy to slow the vehicle down significantly. Overlapped and interleaved wheels improve performance (including fuel consumption) by loading the track more evenly. It also must have extended the life of the tracks and possibly of the wheels. The wheels also better protect the vehicle from enemy fire, and mobility is improved when some wheels are missing. This relatively complicated approach has not been used since World War II ended. This may be related more to maintenance than to original cost. The torsion bars and bearings may stay dry and clean, but the wheels and tread work in mud, sand, rocks, snow, and other surfaces. In addition, the outer wheels (up to nine of them, some double) had to be removed to access the inner ones. In WWII, vehicles typically had to be maintained for a few months before being destroyed or captured, but in peacetime, vehicles must train several crews over a period of decades.  Drive train  Transfer of power to the track is accomplished by a drive wheel, or drive sprocket, driven by the motor and engaging with holes in the track links or with pegs on them to drive the track. In military vehicles, the drive wheel is typically mounted well above the contact area on the ground, allowing it to be fixed in position. In agricultural crawlers it is normally incorporated as part of the bogie. Placing suspension on the sprocket is possible, but is mechanically more complicated. A non-powered wheel, an idler, is placed at the opposite end of the track, primarily to tension the track, since loose track could be easily thrown (slipped) off the wheels. To prevent throwing, the inner surface of the track links usually have vertical guide horns engaging grooves, or gaps between the doubled road and idler/sprocket wheels. In military vehicles with a rear sprocket, the idler wheel is placed higher than the road wheels to allow it to climb over obstacles. Some track arrangements use return rollers to keep the top of the track running straight between the drive sprocket and idler. Others, called slack track, allow the track to droop and run along the tops of large road wheels. This was a feature of the Christie suspension, leading to occasional misidentification of other slack track-equipped vehicles.  Steering  Continuous track vehicle steer by applying more or less drive torque to one side of the vehicle than the other, and this can be implemented in a variety of ways. = \\"Live\\" and \\"dead\\" track = Tracks may be broadly categorized as live or dead track. Dead track is a simple design in which each track plate is connected to the rest with hinge-type pins. These dead tracks will lie flat if placed on the ground; the drive sprocket pulls the track around the wheels with no assistance from the track itself. Live track is slightly more complex, with each link connected to the next by a bushing which causes the track to bend slightly inward. A length of live track left on the ground will curl upward slightly at each end. Although the drive sprocket must still pull the track around the wheels, the track itself tends to bend inward, slightly assisting the sprocket and somewhat conforming to the wheels. = Rubber track pads = Small tracks on a roadworks machine. Note the rubber pads to reduce wear on the carriageway. Worn and new track pads on an M1 Abrams battle tank. Rubber tracks (Case IH 8240) Tracked vehicles long-distance hauling on semi-trailers or railway cars Tracks are often equipped with rubber pads to improve travel on paved surfaces more quickly, smoothly and quietly. While these pads slightly reduce a vehicle's cross-country traction, they prevent damage to any pavement. Some pad systems are designed to remove easily for cross-country military combat. = Rubber tracks = Many manufacturers provide rubber tracks instead of steel, especially for agricultural applications. Rather than a track made of linked steel plates, a reinforced rubber belt with chevron treads is used. In comparison to steel tracks, rubber tracks are lighter, make less noise and do not damage paved roads. However, they impose more ground pressure below the wheels, as they are not able to equalize pressure as well as the stiff mechanism of track plates, especially the spring loaded live tracks. Another disadvantage is that they are not as solid as steel tracks and cannot be repaired in segments, so discarded as whole if once damaged. Previous belt-like systems, such as those used for half-tracks in World War II, were not as strong, and during military actions were easily damaged. The first rubber track was invented and constructed by Adolphe Kégresse and patented in 1913; rubber tracks are often called Kégresse tracks. = Advantages = * Tracks are much less likely to get stuck in soft ground, mud or snow since they distribute the weight of the vehicle over a larger contact area, decreasing its ground pressure: The seventy-ton M1 Abrams tank has an average ground pressure of just over . Since tyre air pressure is approximately equal to average ground pressure, a typical car will have an average ground pressure of to . * Tracked vehicles have better mobility over rough terrain than those with wheels: They smooth out the bumps, glide over small obstacles and are capable of crossing trenches or breaks in the terrain: Riding in a fast tracked vehicle feels just like riding in a boat over heavy swells. * The larger contact area, coupled with the cleats, or grousers, on the track shoes, allows vastly superior traction that results in a much better ability to push or pull large loads where wheeled vehicles would dig in. Bulldozers, which are most often tracked, use this attribute to rescue other vehicles, (such as wheel loaders) which have become stuck in, or sunk into, the ground. * Tracks can also give higher maneuverability, as tracked vehicles can turn in place without forward or backward movement by driving the tracks in opposite directions. * Tracks cannot be punctured or torn and are more resistant in military combat. Should a track be broken, it often can be repaired immediately using some special tools and spare parts, without the need for special facilities, which might be crucial in combat situations. = Disadvantages = A JSDF Type 10 with a thrown track The disadvantages of tracks are lower top speed, much greater mechanical complexity, shorter life and the damage that their all-steel versions cause to the surface on which they pass: They often cause damage to less firm terrain such as lawns, gravel roads, and farm fields, as the sharp edges of the track easily rout the turf. Accordingly, vehicle laws and local ordinances often require rubberised tracks or track pads. A compromise between all-steel and all-rubber tracks exists: attaching rubber pads to individual track links ensures that continuous track vehicles can travel more smoothly, quickly, and quietly on paved surfaces. While these pads slightly reduce a vehicle's cross-country traction, in theory they prevent damage to any pavement. Additionally, the loss of a single segment in a track immobilizes the entire vehicle, which can be a disadvantage in situations where high reliability is important. Tracks can also ride off their guide wheels, idlers or sprockets, which can cause them to jam or to come completely off the guide system (this is called a 'thrown' track). Jammed tracks may become so tight that the track may need to be broken before a repair is possible, which requires either explosives or special tools. Multi- wheeled vehicles, for example, 8 X 8 military vehicles, may often continue driving even after the loss of one or more non-sequential wheels, depending on the base wheel pattern and drive train. Prolonged use places enormous strain on the drive transmission and the mechanics of the tracks, which must be overhauled or replaced regularly. It is common to see tracked vehicles such as bulldozers or tanks transported long distances by a wheeled carrier such as a tank transporter or train, though technological advances have made this practice less common among tracked military vehicles than it once was.

Of noble birth from the Spencer family, married into the Cavendish family, she was the first wife of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, and the mother of the 6th Duke of Devonshire. As the Duchess of Devonshire, she garnered much attention and fame in society during her lifetime. With a pre-eminent position in the peerage of England, the duchess was famous for her charisma, political influence, beauty, unusual marital arrangement, love affairs, socializing, and gambling. She was the great-great- great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales. Their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy. Early life and family Sir Joshua Reynolds The duchess was born Miss Georgiana Spencer, on 7 June 1757, as the first child of John Spencer (later Earl Spencer) and his wife, Georgiana (née Poyntz, later Countess Spencer), at the Spencer family home, Althorp. After her daughter's birth, her mother wrote that \\"I will own I feel so partial to my Dear little Gee, that I think I never shall love another so well\\". Two younger siblings followed: Henrietta and George. (The daughter of her sister Henrietta, Lady Caroline Lamb, would become a writer and lover of Lord Byron). Mr John Spencer, great-grandson of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, came from a wealthy English noble family. He built a Spencer family residence at St. James's, London, and raised his children there. The parents raised Georgiana and her siblings in a happy marriage which bears no record of there ever having been any extramarital affairs – a rarity in the era. Meanwhile, Georgiana grew to be close to her mother who was said to favour Georgiana over her other children. When her father assumed the title of Viscount Spencer in 1761, she became The Honourable Georgiana Spencer. In 1765, her father became Earl Spencer and she Lady Georgiana Spencer. Marriage and children With her siblings, Henrietta and George, by Angelica Kauffman, c. 1774. The painting was painted just before Georgiana's marriage to the Duke of Devonshire. On her seventeenth birthday, 7 June 1774, Lady Georgiana Spencer was married to society's most eligible bachelor, William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire (aged 25). The wedding took place at Wimbledon Parish Church. It was a small ceremony attended only by her parents, her maternal grandmother (Lady Cowper), one of her prospective brothers-in-law, and soon- to-be sister-in-law (the Duchess of Portland). Her parents were emotionally reluctant to let their daughter go, but she was wed to one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the land. Her father, who had always shown affection to his children, wrote to her, \\"My Dearest Georgiana, I did not know till lately how much I loved you; I miss you more every day and every hour.\\" Mother and daughter continued to correspond throughout their lives and many of their letters survive. From the beginning of the marriage, the Duke of Devonshire proved to be an emotionally reserved man who was quite unlike the Duchess's father, and who did not meet the emotional needs of the Duchess. The spouses also had little in common. He would seldom be at her side and would spend nights at Brooks's playing cards. The Duke continued with adulterous behaviour throughout their married life and discord followed pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or failure to produce a male child as heir. Before their marriage, the Duke had fathered an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte Williams, born from a dalliance with a former milliner, Charlotte Spencer (of no relation to the House of Spencer). This was unknown to the Duchess until years after her marriage to the duke. After the death of the child's mother, she was compelled to raise Charlotte herself. The Duchess of Devonshire was \\"very pleased\\" with Charlotte, although her own mother, now Countess Spencer, expressed disapproval: \\"I hope you have not talk'd of her to people.\\" The Duchess replied, \\"She is the best humoured little thing you ever saw.\\" In 1782, while on a retreat from London with the Duke, the Duchess met Lady Elizabeth Foster (widely known as \\"Bess\\") in the City of Bath. She became close friends with Lady Elizabeth, who had become destitute after separating from her husband and two sons. Given the bond that developed between the two women (and the difficult position her new friend was in), with the Duke's acquiescence, the Duchess agreed to having Lady Elizabeth live with them. When the Duke began a sexual relationship with Lady Elizabeth, a ménage à trois was established and it was arranged that Lady Elizabeth live with them permanently. While it was common for male members of the upper class to have mistresses, it was not common or generally acceptable for a mistress to live so openly with a married couple. Furthermore, the Duchess had become emotionally dependent on Lady Elizabeth, whom she believed to be her best friend. Having no alternative, she became complacent over the matter. The arrangement among the three is more commonly referred to as a ménage à trois, but, while the relationship between the Duke and Lady Elizabeth was obviously sexual, there is no concrete evidence of anything beyond emotional dependence, and a particular and open affection, on the part of the Duchess, towards Lady Elizabeth. In one of her letters, the Duchess of Devonshire wrote to Lady Elizabeth, \\"My dear Bess, Do you hear the voice of my heart crying to you? Do you feel what it is for me to be separated from you?\\" Nevertheless, Lady Elizabeth Foster herself was said to actually envy her and wished for her position. (That Lady Elizabeth shared a love for her was proven at her death years later when a locket, containing a strand of the Duchess's hair, was found around her neck, as well as a bracelet also containing hair of the Duchess on a table beside her deathbed). Lady Elizabeth was reported to have insinuated her way into the marriage by taking advantage of the Duchess's friendship and love and having \\"engineered her way\\" into a sexual relationship with the Duke. Lady Elizabeth engaged in well documented sexual relations with other men while she was in the \\"love triangle\\" with the Duke and Duchess. Among their contemporaries, the relationship between the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Elizabeth Foster was the subject of speculation which has continued beyond their time. The love triangle itself was a notorious topic; it was an irregular arrangement in a high-profile marriage. Lady Elizabeth's affair with the Duke resulted in two illegitimate children: a daughter, Caroline Rosalie St Jules, and a son, Augustus Clifford. The Duchess of Devonshire by Thomas Gainsborough, 1783. Despite her unhappiness with her detached and philandering husband and volatile marriage, the duchess, as contemporary norms dictated, was not socially permitted to take a lover without first having produced an heir. The first successful pregnancy resulted in the birth of Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish on 12 July 1783. Called \\"Little G\\", she would become the Countess of Carlisle and have issue of her own. The Duchess had developed a strong mothering sentiment since raising Charlotte, and she insisted on nursing her own children (contrary to the aristocratic custom of having a wet nurse). On 29 August 1785, a second successful pregnancy resulted in another daughter: Lady Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, called \\"Harryo\\", who would become Countess Granville and also have children of her own. Finally, on 21 May 1790, the duchess gave birth to a male heir to the dukedom: William George Spencer Cavendish, who took the title of Marquess of Hartington at birth, and was called \\"Hart\\". He would never marry and became known as \\"the bachelor duke\\". With the birth of the Marquess of Hartington, the Duchess was able to take a lover. While there is no evidence of when the Duchess began her affair with Charles Grey (later Earl Grey), she did become pregnant by him in 1791. Sent off to France, the Duchess believed she would die in childbirth. In this spirit, she wrote a letter to her recently born son stating, \\"As soon as you are old enough to understand this letter it will be given to you. It contains the only present I can make youmy blessing, written in my blood...Alas, I am gone before you could know me, but I lov'd you, I nurs'd you nine months at my breast. I love you dearly.\\" On 20 February 1792, Eliza Courtney was born without complications to mother and child, and the Duchess was forced to give away the illegitimate daughter to Grey's family. The Duchess would later be given the opportunity to pay visits to her illegitimate daughter, providing her with presents and affection, and Eliza would grow up to marry Lieutenant- Colonel Robert Ellice and bear a daughter named Georgiana. While in exile in France in the early 1790s, the Duchess of Devonshire suffered from isolation and felt her separation from her children. To her eldest, she wrote, \\"Your letter dated the 1st of Nov was delightful to me tho' it made me very melancholy my Dearest Child. This year has been the most painful of my life. . . when I do return to you, never leave you I hope againit will be too great a happiness for me Dear Georgiana & it will have been purchased by many days of regret - indeed ev'ry hour I pass away from you, I regret you; if I amuse myself or see anything I admire I long to share the happiness with you - if on the contrary I am out of spirits I wish for your presence which alone would do me good.\\" In order to return to England and her children, she conceded to her husband's demands and renounced her love for Charles Grey. Records of her exile in France were subsequently erased from the family records. However, the children of the duke and duchess had at one point been informed as to the reason of her absence during that period of their lives. Throughout her marriage, while the Duchess of Devonshire coped with the marital arrangements on the surface, she nevertheless suffered emotional and psychological distress. She sought further personal consolation from a \\"dissipated existence\\" in passions (socializing, fashion, politics, writing), addictions (gambling, drinking, and drugs), and affairs (with a number of men, not just Grey, possibly including the bachelor Duke of Dorset).  Pursuits and fame  With her renowned beauty and character, alongside her marriage to the affluent and powerful Duke of Devonshire, the duchess enjoyed preeminence in society and was a high emblem of the era. Her keen sense made her the extravagant female leader in fashion and style in England. (The fashionable styling of her hair alone reached literally extraordinary heights above her exuberant costume). Using her influence as a leading socialite and fashion/style icon, she contributed to politics, science, and literature. As part of her illustrious social engagements, she would gather around her a large salon of literary and political figures. Among her major acquaintances were the most influential figures of her time including the Prince of Wales (later King George IV); Marie Antoinette of France and her favourite in court, the Duchess of Polignac; Charles Grey (later Earl Grey and British Prime Minister); and Lady Melbourne (lover of the Prince of Wales). Newspapers chronicled her every appearance and activity. She was called a \\"phenomenon\\" by Horace Walpole who proclaimed, \\"[she] effaces all without being a beauty; but her youthful figure, flowing good nature, sense and lively modesty, and modest familiarity make her a phenomenon\\". Madame d'Arblay, who had a preference for acquaintances of talent, found that her appeal was not generally for her beauty but for far more which included fine \\"manner, politeness, and gentle quiet.\\" Sir Nathaniel Wraxall stated that her success as an individual lay \\"in the amenity and graces of her deportment, in her irresistible manners, and the seduction of her society.\\" Famously, when the Duchess was stepping out of her carriage one day, an Irish dustman exclaimed: \\"Love and bless you, my lady, let me light my pipe in your eyes!\\" Thereafter, whenever others would compliment her, the duchess would retort, \\"After the dustman's compliment, all others are insipid.\\"\\"Beauty — A natural compliment\\", The Every-day Book and Table Book.

Retrieved 11 July 2008. =Politics= The Spencer family, from which she derived, was an ardent supporter of the Whig party as were she and the House of Cavendish. However, because the duke's high position in the peerage disallowed him from participating so commonly in politics, the duchess took it as a positive outlet for herself. In an age when the realization of women's rights and suffrage were still more than a century away, the duchess became a political activist as the first woman to make active and influential front line appearances on the political scene. Having begun her involvement in politics in 1778 (when she inspired a mass of women to promote the Whig party), she relished Enlightenment and Whig party ideals and took it upon herself to campaign—particularly for a distant cousin, Charles James Fox, who was chief party leader alongside Richard Sheridan—for Whig policies which were anti-monarchy and advocated for liberty against tyranny. At the time of her involvement, King George III (who detested the Whigs) and his ministers had a direct influence over the House of Commons, principally through their power of patronage. The Prince of Wales, who always relished going against the grain with his father, joined the Whig party at the time his friend, the duchess, became involved. She was renowned for hosting dinners that became political meetings, and she took joy in cultivating the company of brilliant radicals. \\"THE DEVONSHIRE, or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes\\", by Thomas Rowlandson, 1784 During the general election of 1784, the duchess became a major subject of scrutiny. Fanciful rumours and political cartoons circulated during the campaign, ridiculing her for securing votes in exchange for sexual – and monetary – rewards. Thomas Rowlandson even satirized her with a rumour of her trading kisses in his print \\"THE DEVONSHIRE, or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes\\". Her mother pleaded with her to step down, but the duchess was not daunted and was adamant in her activism. On election day, the Duchess of Devonshire walked the streets of London, even gaining blisters on her feet, meeting face-to-face with commoners as equals. She was instrumental in the success of Fox and Lord Hood, but after the extensive campaigning and negative media against her, she retired, after the win, from the political arena for a while. In 1788, she returned to political activism though behind the scenes. Even in the last years of her life, she pushed ahead in the field and attempted to help rebuild the Whig party which had become fragmented; her efforts were to no avail and the political party would eventually come to dissolve decades after her death. =Literature= In her life, the duchess was an avid writer and composed a number of works, of both prose and poetry, of which some were published. She composed poetry as a young girl to her father and some of it later circulated in manuscript and was read by Walpole (who said it was \\"easy and prettily expressed, though it does not express much\\") and Reverend William Mason (who was more favorable with higher opinions). The first of her published literary works was Emma; Or, The Unfortunate Attachment: A Sentimental Novel in 1773. In 1778, the epistolary novel The Sylph was released. Published anonymously, it had autobiographical elements, centering on a fictional aristocratic bride who had been corrupted, and as \\"a novel-cum-exposé of [the duchess's] aristocratic cohorts, depicted as libertines, blackmailers, and alcoholics.\\" It has been speculated that The Sylph may have instead been written by Sophia Briscoe, and a receipt at the British Library suggests that Briscoe was paid for the published work. However, it is thought more likely that Briscoe may have served as an intermediary between the Duchess of Devonshire and her publisher, so that the duchess could keep her anonymity. The duchess is said to have at least privately admitted to her authorship. The Sylph was a success and underwent four reprintings. Memorandums of the Face of the Country in Switzerland (1799) is often wrongly attributed to her. It was in fact written by Rowley Lascelles, based on a Swiss tour in 1794. One more piece was published in the last years of her life, The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard, first in an unauthorized version in the 'Morning Chronicle' and 'Morning Post' of 20 and 21 December 1799, then in a privately printed edition in 1800. A poem dedicated to her children, The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard was based on her passage of the Saint Gotthard Pass, with Bess, between 10 and 15 August 1793 on her return to England. The thirty-stanza poem, together with 28 extended notes, were furthermore translated into some of the main languages of Western Europe including into French, by the Abbé de Lille, in 1802; Italian, by Signor Polidori, in 1803; and German in 1805. The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard was then reprinted in 1816, after the duchess's death. Samuel Taylor Coleridge published a glowing response to the poem, 'Ode to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire' in the 'Morning Post' on 24 December 1799. The 5th Duchess of Devonshire was connected to some of the greatest men of letters of her time, and Samuel Johnson, a famed writer of the era, had even paid visit to the duke and duchess, in 1784, at their Chatsworth home. =Science= The duchess played a key role in formulating, with Thomas Beddoes, the idea of establishing the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol. Her interest arose in part as she was related through marriage to the pneumatic chemist Henry Cavendish. She took interest in scientific experiments and began a collection of crystals at Chatsworth, the main seat of the dukedom of Devonshire. =Gambling= As was common among the aristocracy of her time, the duchess routinely gambled for leisure and amusement. Her gaming spiraled into a ruinous addiction, however, made worse by her emotional instability. In the first years of her marriage, she accumulated debts that surpassed the 4,000 pounds that the duke provided her annually as pin money. Her own mother was disapproving and admonished her, unsuccessfully, to break her habit. After she had incurred over 300,000 pounds in debt, the duchess implored her parents to give her a loan as she absolutely would not inform her husband of her debts. Her parents acquiesced and told her to inform the duke, who nevertheless found out beforehand and repaid them. For the rest of her life the duchess continued to amass an immense, ever escalating debt that she always tried to keep hidden from her husband (even though he was among the richest men in the land), and while she would admit to some amount, it was always less than the total, which even she could not keep up with. In confidence, she would ask for loans from the Prince of Wales and at one point, to try to settle some of her debts, she did not shrink from pressing her friend the affluent banker Thomas Coutts for funds. Later life and death Her absence from English society and exile in France had isolated the duchess and was a low point for her in every respect; she returned to England a \\"changed woman\\". The duke began suffering from gout, and she spent her time at his side nursing him. With also a new miscarriage, this circumstance with her husband brought about a softening and closeness between the spouses. She took a positive interest in science, took up writing again (producing two more works), and even continued her political activism while trying to rebuild the Whig party (to no avail before its end). The duchess also came to meet and become friends with the wife of her former lover, Charles Grey. In 1796, the Duchess of Devonshire succumbed to illness in one eye; the medical treatment resulted in a scarring of her face. However, \\"Those scars released her from her fears. All the inhibitions about whether she was beautiful enough or whether she was up to the job left her.\\" In her late thirties, the duchess was able to regain preeminence and enjoyment in open society, although her personal life would continue to be marred by degrees of unhappiness, debt, and decline in health. During her early forties, the Duchess of Devonshire devoted her time to the coming out of her eldest daughter, Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish. The debutante was presented in 1800, and the duchess saw her daughter wed Lord Morpeth, the heir apparent of the Earl of Carlisle, in 1801; it was the first and only time the Duchess of Devonshire saw one of her issue marry. Her health continued to decline well into her forties, and her addiction to gambling continued. She once reached out to her mother, begging for a sum of 100 pounds and complaining to her of jaundice. While her mother at first believed her daughter was just ill from her gambling, Countess Spencer, as well as those around the duchess, soon came to realize the duchess was truly sick. She was thought to be suffering from an abscess on her liver. Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, died on 30 March 1806, at 3:30, at the age of 48. She was surrounded by her husband, the 5th Duke of Devonshire; her mother, Countess Spencer; her sister, the Countess of Bessborough; her eldest daughter, Lady Morpeth (who was eight months pregnant); and Lady Elizabeth Foster. They were all said to have been inconsolable over her death. For the first time, the duke showed moving emotion towards his late wife, as a contemporary wrote, \\"The Duke has been most deeply affected and has shown more feeling than anyone thought possible indeed every individual in the family are in a dreadful state of affliction.\\" The late duchess' eldest daughter furthermore poured out her feelings, \\"Oh my beloved, my adored departed mother, are you indeed forever parted from me Shall I see no more that angelic countenance or that blessed voiceYou whom I loved with such tenderness, you who were the . . . best of mothers, AdieuI wanted to strew violets over her dying bed as she strewed sweets over my life but they would not let me.\\" Her distant cousin, Charles James Fox, for whom she had triumphantly campaigned, was noted to have cried. The Prince of Wales himself lamented, \\"The best natured and the best bred woman in England is gone.\\" Thousands of the people of London congregated at Piccadily, where the Cavendish home in the city was located, to mourn her. She was buried at the family vault at All Saints Parish Church (now Derby Cathedral) in Derby. Legacy Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, c. 1775, The Devonshire Collection. The legacy of the life of Georgiana Cavendish, 5th Duchess of Devonshire, has remained a topic of study and intrigue in cultural and historical spheres centuries after her death. Immediately after her death, the Duke of Devonshire discovered the extent of her debts. He soon enough married Lady Elizabeth Foster who, as his second wife, became Duchess of Devonshire. Georgiana's children were discontented with the marriage as they never liked Lady Elizabeth at all (something which caused dismay with their mother when she was alive). When William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, died on 29 July 1811, the Marquess of Hartington became 6th Duke of Devonshire. He sought to liquidate his late mother's entire debts. Meanwhile, Lady Elizabeth fought to keep Cavendish properties to which she wasn't entitled; furthermore, the 6th Duke denied her demand that her illegitimate son with the 5th Duke of Devonshire, Clifford, bear the Cavendish crest. Infuriated, Lady Elizabeth brought back up her affair with the 5th Duke of Devonshire by publicly announcing he had sired her illegitimate children. The 6th Duke of Devonshire finally oversaw an end to it all - the mistake of his late mother of bringing in Lady Elizabeth into her life and all the ensuing consequences - with the final dismissal of Lady Elizabeth by paying her off. Nevertheless, Georgiana's children lived the remainder of their lives with mutually positive relations with Lady Elizabeth Foster's children, having grown up together. In 1786, Susanna Rowson, who went on to become a bestselling author, dedicated her first published work, Victoria, to the Duchess of Devonshire. With the topic of liberation at the heart of policies she supported in life, the bold involvement of the Duchess of Devonshire in political activism pioneered women's public frontstage and influential participation in the field in a time before the validation of women's rights and subsequent feminist ideals. Artwork representing the Duchess of Devonshire by reputable painters of the Georgian era remain, including a 1787 portrait by the famed Thomas Gainsborough which was once thought lost. Over 1,000 of personal letters written by the Duchess of Devonshire remain in existence. Chatsworth, the seat of the duke of Devonshire, houses a majority of her letters in historical archives. In modern times, the circumstances of her life are seen as an example of female oppression by historical cultural and legal constructs favoring male interests, while denying rights to the female party in a relationship, and they have become the subject of scholarly and dramatized works. =Film portrayals= * The Divine Lady (1929), portrayed by Evelyn Hall * Berkeley Square (1933), portrayed by Juliette Compton * The House in the Square (also titled I'll Never Forget You (US) and Man of Two Worlds) (1951), portrayed by Kathleen Byron * The Duchess (2008), portrayed by Keira Knightley and directed by Saul Dibb, based on the biography Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman =Opera pasticcio= * ’’Georgiana’’ (2019), was commissioned by the Buxton Festival for its 40th anniversary, and was premièred there on 7 July 2019.

History  The earlies known photograph of the Princeton Junction train station - c. 1870s. The station building was originally located on the northwest side of the railroad tracks. Following the mid-1860s relocation of the Camden & Amboy rail line from next to the Delaware & Raritan Canal to the present location of the Northeast Corridor, and the subsequent construction of a train station south of the intersection of Washington Road and the new rail line, a community called \\"Princeton Junction\\" developed. This community originally featured several farmhouses, a hotel, a general store, a feed mill, and several other businesses centered around the intersection of Station Drive & Washington Road, profiting off of access to other cities provided by the rail line. The construction of the neighborhood of Berrien City (focused around Scott Avenue, Alexander Road, and Berrien Avenue) represented West Windsor's first planned development. Following the reconstruction of the Washington Road railroad bridge in 1939, the business center of the community shifted to the intersection of Washington Road and Cranbury Road, where a lumber yard, service station, liquor store, strip mall, several gas stations, and several more businesses operated for decades. Following World War II,, the Princeton Junction population grew with the construction of residential developments such as Sherbrooke Estates, Windsor Chase, and Wellington Estates. Princeton Junction is currently the proposed site of a \\"Transit Village\\" to be built northwest of the train station. In October 2019, the Historical Society of West Windsor published an online museum exploring the history of West Windsor - including that of Princeton Junction.

Business and industry At the turn of the century two of Princeton Junction's landmark retailers closed. One was Lick-It ice cream, a tiny kiosk-like yellow building that served ice cream to walk-in and drive-through customers, always including a trademark nonpareil in the ice cream. Also, the family-owned Lucar Hardware store shut down due to competition with superstores like Home Depot and Lowe's Hardware. Competition was not the only factor, however. The owners sought to retire, and the land had become more valuable. The site is now occupied by PNC Bank. In 2008-2009, Princeton Junction saw the further closure of a number of businesses that had been longtime fixtures. Among the most significant is the closure of an Acme Supermarket, which had been an anchor tenant in the Windsor Plaza Shopping Center for 50 years. Other closures (of Chicken Holiday fast food shop, a paint store and an Asian restaurant) were prompted to make way for the construction of a new Rite Aid store.

White Horse Circle White Horse Circle is a traffic circle locally known by name, in the southwest part of White Horse. Up until 2018 it was not a true traffic circle, because it was bisected by northbound U.S. Route 206, which made a left turn in the circle. This intersection connects South Broad Street (US 206 north and Route 524 east), White Horse-Mercerville Road (Route 533 north) and Bordentown Road (US 206 south). Only Route 533 had a stop sign at the circle, while Route 524 and the southern part of Route 206 have traffic signals some distance from the circle. To allow cars to move in a safe fashion, there were six yield-signed road segments allowing cars to get to Route 206 and from the highway to Route 533.

Hatuey (), also Hatüey (; died February 2, 1512), was a Taíno cacique (chief) originally from the island of Hispaniola, who lived in the early sixteenth century and fled to Cuba during the Spanish conquest. He has attained legendary status for leading a group of natives in a fight against the invading Spaniards, and thus becoming one of the first fighters against colonialism in the New World. He is celebrated as \\"Cuba's First National Hero\\".Running Fox, 'The Story of Cacique Hatuey, Cuba's First National Hero', La Voz del Pueblo Taíno (The Voice of the Taíno People) (United Confederation of Taino People, U.S. Regional Chapter, January 1998) The 2010 film Even the Rain includes a cinematic account of Hatuey's execution. Legend In 1511, Diego Velázquez set out from Hispaniola to conquer the island of Cuba to steal gold and Taíno as slaves (Cuba's indigenous people, the Taíno, were previously recorded by Columbus). Velázquez was preceded, however, by Hatuey, who fled Hispaniola with a party of four hundred in canoes and warned some of the Native people of eastern Cuba about what to expect from the Spaniards.J. A. Sierra. 'The Legend of Hatuey', The History of Cuba (August 2006). Retrieved September 9, 2006. Bartolomé de Las Casas later attributed the following speech to Hatuey. He showed the Taíno of Caobana a basket of gold and jewels, saying: :Here is the God the Spaniards worship. For these they fight and kill; for these they persecute us and that is why we have to throw them into the sea... They tell us, these tyrants, that they adore a God of peace and equality, and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves. They speak to us of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments, and yet they rob our belongings, seduce our women, violate our daughters. Incapable of matching us in valor, these cowards cover themselves with iron that our weapons cannot break...Bartolomé de Las Casas, Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. Translated by Nigel Griffin. (London: Penguin, 1999) The Taino chiefs in Cuba did not respond to Hatuey's message, and few joined him to fight. Hatuey resorted to guerrilla tactics against the Spaniards, and was able to confine them for a time. He and his fighters were able to kill at least eight Spanish soldiers. Eventually, using mastiffs and torturing the Native people for information, the Spaniards succeeded in capturing him. On February 2, 1512, he was tied to a stake and burned alive at Yara, near the present-day City of Bayamo.Barreiro, Jose \\"A Note on Taino,\\" in Akwe, Cornell, View From the Shore, Pon Press, 1990 Before he was burned, a priest asked Hatuey if he would accept Jesus and go to heaven. Las Casas recalled the reaction of the chief: :[Hatuey], thinking a little, asked the religious man if Spaniards went to heaven. The religious man answered yes... The chief then said without further thought that he did not want to go there but to hell so as not to be where they were and where he would not see such cruel people. This is the name and honor that God and our faith have earned.\\"A violent evangelism: the political and religious conquest of the Americas\\", Luis N. Rivera, Luis Rivera Pagán, Westminster John Knox Press, 1992, Legacy The town of Hatuey, located south of Sibanicú in the Camagüey Province of Cuba, was named after the Taíno hero. Hatuey also lives on in as a beer brand name. Beer has been brewed in Santiago de Cuba and sold under the Hatuey brand name since 1927, initially by the native Cuban company, Compañia Ron Bacardi S.A.. After nationalization of industry in 1960, brewing was taken over by Empresa Cerveceria Hatuey Santiago. Beginning in 2011, the Bacardi family again began making beers in the United States to market under the Hatuey label.Klein, Lee. Hatuey Beer Returns as a Microbrew. Miami New Times, Dec. 6, 2011.
