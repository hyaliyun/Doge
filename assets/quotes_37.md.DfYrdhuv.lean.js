The pipeline failed from external corrosion. * On February 28, a gas compressor station explosion severely burned a worker, and set off a raging fire near De Beque, Colorado. A second explosion at that site soon after caused no injuries. * The Prudhoe Bay oil spill: On March 2, a surveillance crew discovered a crude oil spill from a BP crude pipeline near North Slope Borough, Alaska. The pipeline failure resulted in a release currently estimated at of processed crude oil, impacting the arctic tundra and covering approximately of permafrost. The pipeline's leak detection system was not effective in recognizing and identifying the failure. Failure to run cleaning pigs to remove internal corrosive build up was a factor. The failure caused crude oil prices to spike throughout the World. * On March 23, a pipeline failed west of Toledo, Ohio, spilling about of unleaded gasoline. During the repair work, another smaller nearby leak was also found. * On April 17, a Plantation Pipeline line experienced a failure in Henrico County, near Richmond, Virginia. The failure resulted in the release of 23,226 gallons of jet fuel in a residential area. The jet fuel sprayed for approximately 14 minutes and the spray traveled the distance of approximately . The jet fuel did not ignite. * On June 27, a Koch Industries pipeline carrying crude oil failed near the town of Little Falls, Minnesota. The pipeline operator estimated that approximately of crude oil were released. The pipeline failed due to previous mechanical damage to it. * On July 22, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company gas transmission pipeline ruptured, resulting in an estimated release of of natural gas near Clay City in Clark County, Kentucky. The gas ignited, but there were no injuries, and just minor property damage. External corrosion was suspected. * On July 22, 2006, near Campbellsville, Kentucky, a Kinder Morgan Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded. A 25-foot-long piece of pipe blew out of the ground and landed 200 feet away; the pipe wad twisted and mangled, its external coating burned off. The 24\\" pipeline ruptured due to an area of external bacterial corrosion more than two feet long at the bottom of a valley in an area of wet shale, known to cause corrosion on buried pipelines in this part of Kentucky. The pipe was manufactured in 1944.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (1986-2001) link on the Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and-statisticspipelinepipeline-incident- flagged-files.

About of butane were lost. External corrosion was the cause, but there were no injuries. * On September 8, a leak on a pump on an LPG pipeline in Apex, North Carolina spilled about 12,000 gallons of propane, forcing evacuations. * On September 29, a crew replacing an old pipeline hit a high pressure gas pipeline in Labette County, Kansas, killing a crewman. Residents within a mile of the incident were evacuated for a time. * On October 12, a pipeline exploded when a tugboat pushing two barges hit that pipeline in West Cote Blanche Bay, about two miles (3 km) from shore and southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. Four crew members were killed, and two were missing and later presumed dead. * On October 25, an ammonia pipeline failed from corrosion near Clay Center, Kansas, releasing about 4500 barrels of ammonia. two people were injured by the fumes. * On November 11, 2006, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, a jet-black, burn site surrounded the skeletal hulk of a bulldozer that struck the Rockies Express (REX) natural-gas pipeline, setting off an explosion and fire. The bulldozer operator was killed. The subcontractor did not know there was another pipeline there because no one had marked the position of the existing pipeline. The company building the new pipeline was fined $2.3 million for failing to obtain a location for the other pipeline. Two months after this explosion, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission threatened to shut the project down if REX didn‚Äôt improve its ‚Äúpoor compliance record‚Äù involving construction activity outside the approved work area.Tom Beyerlein, ‚ÄúFatal explosion puts Kinder Morgan‚Äôs past in spotlight,‚Äù Dayton Daily News [Ohio], September 14, 2008, in Tar Sands Free BC, September 15, 2008, http://tarsandsfreebc.org/?p=236 , accessed June 16, 2014. * On or about November 27, 2006, approximately 97 barrels of gasoline were discharged from a portion of Plantation Pipeline in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, into Paw Creek and its adjoining shorelines. The leak resulted from a failed gasket on an above-ground block valve. * 2006 Falk Corporation explosion: Leaks in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin propane pipe running below an apartment building caused an explosion. Three people were killed and forty-seven others injured. * On December 19, a lineman for Midwest Energy hit a natural gas transmission pipeline near Mason, Michigan.

The system is expected to link, in the future, to Rwanda's two other neighbors, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Through Uganda, the SGR will allow, faster access to the Kenyan port of Mombasa, Rwanda's primary access to the oceans. With no previously existing railway network, Rwanda is developing its railway system from scratch. Location The railway system would consist of several major sections: ; Rusumo‚ÄìKigali Section This section, measuring , is part of the Isaka‚ÄìKigali Standard Gauge Railway, a joint railway between the governments of Rwanda and Tanzania. Construction is scheduled to begin in October 2018, and the Rusumo‚ÄìKigali section is budgeted to cost US$847 million. ; Kigali‚ÄìRubavu Section When the SGR reaches Kigali, the governments of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are expected to work out the modalities for the extension of this railway system to DRCongo territory. The section from Kigali to Rubavu is about . In June 2019, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo indicated its willingness to participate in a feasibility study for the SGR to extend to Rubavu and Goma. ; Kigali‚ÄìBugesera Airport‚ÄìNemba Section This section, measuring about , stretching from Masaka, in Kigali, through Bugesera International Airport to Nemba, at the international border with Burundi, is yet to be awarded to a contractor, as of September 2018. The government of Rwanda has committed to extending the SGR to Bugesera International Airport, at a budgeted cost of US$85 million. ; Kagitumba‚ÄìKigali Section When the Uganda Standard Gauge Railway is built, the Ugandan SGR is planned to connect to the Rwanda SGR at Mirama Hills/Kagitumba. From there, the line would pass through Nyagatare, Gatsibo, Gicumbi, Rwamagana, Gasabo and terminate at Masaka for cargo and Ndera for passengers. This section measures approximately . Overview This 1435 mm (4 ft in) railway line is intended to ease the transfer of goods between the ports of Dar es Salaam and Mombasa, to Kigali in Rwanda and subsequently to Bujumbura in Burundi, and to Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In conformity with its neighbors Uganda and Tanzania, Rwanda will use electricity to power its locomotives. This will allow the passenger locomotive speeds to be increased to per hour and cargo locomotives to per hour.

The boat remained in France until November 1943, during which time she laid several minefields, and was then assigned to the Torpedo School before beginning a lengthy refit in 1944. T14 was assigned to convoy escort duties in the Skagerrak around the beginning of 1945 and survived the war.

Knight was the daughter of a tenant farmer and one of eight children. She became active in the Communist Party after she finished her training as a nurse. She was one of the first British volunteers to arrive in Spain on the side of the Spanish Republican Government during the Spanish Civil War.  Biography  Annie Cargill Murray was born to George Wilson Murray and Anne Cargill in 1906 in Aberdeen, one of eight children who grew up in rural Perthshire, including brothers George Murray and Tom Murray, one of two Scots awarded special citations from the Republicans for their efforts during the Spanish Civil War. Murray trained as a nurse at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in 1936. While there, she protested with other nurses about the pay and working conditions. Murray joined the Communist Party and went to Spain, as soon as her training finished. She was followed to Spain and occasionally visited, by her brothers George (who served for two years and wounded) and Tom (served for about six months, but was wanted at home by the Communist Party in Scotland). They were among approximately 500 Scottish volunteers in the Spanish Civil War who believed in the principles of the Spanish Republican Government and travelled to the front to fight Fascism Before Murray left Barcelona, she witnessed an act of atrocity: > \\"We found a whole lot of children, of dozens of them, with their hands off, > completely off. The Italians had dropped anti-personnel bombs marked > \\"Chocolatti\\". The children were picking up these things - they hadn't had > chocolate for years - and they just blew their hands off. This Spanish > surgeon that I worked with, he was in tears. We all were.\\" During the Second World War, Murray was in charge of an air-raid station in the Civil Defence of London. She later said that the Spanish Civil War was the most important thing in her life, and that she did not regret going and \\"the Spanish war had a great impact on me\\" that it was a \\"terrible, terrible thing when the whole struggle collapsed.. the Fascists got the upper hand\\". Murray spoke at an unveiling of the memorial to the Spanish Civil War and Scottish lives lost in the International Brigades in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens in 1982 and her two brothers were also present. She married Frank Knight in 1948 and moved to Dunfermline, Fife, upon her retirement in 1964, where she and her husband both died in 1996. Murray's letters are now at the National Library of Scotland, where a curator notes: \\"The 1930s were a man's world and it is extremely difficult to appreciate with modern perspectives what [Murray] and other volunteers did. Many of them had never even left Edinburgh before, never mind the country.\\"Memorial to Scottish international brigade volunteers in the Spanish Civil War; in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh Murray spoke at the dedication of the memorial to the Scottish international brigade volunteers in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh in 1986.  Work  After finishing her training as a nurse in Edinburgh, Murray went to Spain as a volunteer of the British medical aid committee to support care for the International Brigades. Murray was one of the first British volunteers to arrive in Spain in September 1936 and she first worked with the republican forces in a small hospital in Huete with mostly untrained local staff, before moving to Barcelona to work in theatres with a team of Spanish doctors for about two and a half years in all. She witnessed serious injuries and although most of Murray's patients were International Brigades or Spanish Republic troops, she also treated Prisoners of war from North Africa, known locally as 'Moors' and (despite other patients protests), a fascist soldier. She told her brother Tom of one Moor patient whose leg was seriously injured but had held on tight to a parcel, which nurses eventually got him to release so they could treat his bleeding. It was a bundle of obsolete German Marks (from 1914-20) which showed exploitation of the mercenary Moors by Franco's regime. She found Spanish doctors and equipment were very good, and she arranged sending of more equipment supplies from London, through the British Medical Aid Committee. Murray found the Spanish people were good to the volunteers, although housing of local villagers was primitive compared to her home experience, food and coffee limited and of poor quality. She did get home leave and letters during the war and a break where Spanish people looked after nurses near the sea. When Franco's troops entered Barcelona Murray left with patients invalided out and treated them in France briefly before heading for London in 1939. She worked in Dulwich Hospital. She went on to work for the Civil Defence in London before returning to work in a nursery in Stepney, an east end district of London and finally working near Mount Pleasant.

The anal fasciole is excavated and spirally faintly striated, especially on the anterior slope. The axial sculpture consists of (on the body whorl) about 20 sharp low straight narrow ribs, with much wider interspaces, and extending from the shoulder to the siphonal canal. The spiral sculpture between the sutures consists of 4 fine elevated threads, including 1 at the shoulder and a fifth on which the suture is laid, with wider flat interspaces. On the body whorl, there are 14 or 15 equal and equally spaced similar threads. The aperture is narrow. The wide anal sulcus is shallow. The outer lip is defective.

It set several national records, competed at both national and international level and remained a Polish gliding club mainstay until the outbreak of World War II. Design and development CW 5 bis ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lw√≥w Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lw√≥w which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski. The 1931 CW 5 was his response to a call from the government for a high performance glider. His earliest draft, the CW 5, specified the G√¥ttingen G√¥ 652 airfoil that Alexander Lippisch had used on the RRG Fafnir, despite the lack of full information on its characteristics at the time, and wind tunnel tests proved very disappointing. The CW 5.bis design that followed used a thinner and lower camber airfoil from the Warsaw Aerodynamic Institute. Wind tunnel results for it were much closer to expectations and the CW 5.bis was completed in the ZASPL workshops in 1932. The Cw 5.bis had a single spar, high mounted gull wing with an aspect ratio of 18, very high for the 1930s. It was covered with plywood ahead of the spar, forming a D-box, and with fabric behind. Only the inner part, about a quarter of the span, carried dihedral. Out to half span the wing had a rectangular plan but beyond this long, curved ailerons, mounted at an angle to the centre- line, narrowed the chord to fine tips. The wing was braced by V-struts from the lower fuselage to the spar and false spar of the central section. Its pilot sat ahead of the leading edge; the prototype had an open cockpit but in the production models it was enclosed with multi-panel glazing. The fuselage was a semi-monocoque structure which became progressively more slender aft of the wing and had a sprung landing skid mounted below the forward part. The CW 5.bis's elevator was its most unconventional feature. Semi-elliptical in plan and with a ply covered leading edge and fabric elsewhere, it was mounted on a short, streamlined V-strut clear and ahead of the integral, ply covered fin. The latter was narrow and ply covered and carried a curved, fabric covered rudder. There was a short tailskid under the fin. There is some uncertainty about the year of the first light, but according to Cynk this occurred in the summer of 1932. After successful flight trials a short production run of the CW 5.bis/33 followed. The first air-towed launch was in May 1933. 1934 saw an improved version, the CW 5.bis/34. A final version, the CW 5.bis/35, had an aerodynamically cleaner, deeper and strengthened fuselage. About ten of this version were produced. The final airframe count over all models was about twenty. In 1936 Michal Blaicher produced a markedly different derivative of the CW 5.bis/35. It was constructed in the workshops of the W.O.S. (Military Gliding Camp) at Ustjanowa G√≥rna and first flew in 1937, appearing in public in August of that year at the Fifth National Glider Contest. Named the WOS-37 Splett, it used a different airfoil, a different wing plan and shorter wing struts, though the span was unchanged. The fuselage was about 6% shorter. Most noticeably, it had a tailplane, which was integral with the fin. Either one or two were built. Operational history The CW 5/bis was widely used for advanced pilot training in Poland in the remaining pre-World War II period. Examples also took part in many national competitions and set a series of national records for altitude and distance. For example, on 4 October 1935 ≈ªabski reached . The same year Maria Younga set the women's altitude record at . One CW 5.bis was flown by ≈ªabski on the Wasserkuppe in the international Rh√∂n contest of 1937, where it was placed eighth and helped Poland into second place.

The film is produced and directed by Jay Baruchel, who wrote the screenplay with Jesse Chabot, and stars Jesse Williams, Jordana Brewster, and Baruchel. The film follows Todd Walkley (Williams), a comic book creator whose works are used as inspiration for a string of real-life murders. The film has been in development since 2011 when Baruchel and Chabot were first hired to adapt the screenplay. Attempts to begin production failed several times in subsequent years; principal photography took place between August 2018 and September 2018. The film debuted at the 2019 Fantastic Fest on September 19, 2019. It was released by Elevation Pictures in Canada on July 31, 2020, followed by a release in the United States on August 20, 2020, by Shudder. The film received polarizing reviews from critics, who both praised and criticized the violent visuals, messages, and special effects.  Premise   Cast  * Jesse Williams as Todd Walkley, a comic book writer and the creator of Slasherman. * Jordana Brewster as Kathy, Todd's girlfriend. * Niamh Wilson as Aurora, Todd's assistant. * Jay Baruchel as Ezra, Todd's best friend and the owner of Hard Calibre Comics.  Production  = Development = Writing partners Jay Baruchel and Jesse Chabot were provided a copy of the one-shot comic Random Acts of Violence in 2010. They met with publisher Kickstart Comics about a separate project, and were later hired to write the film adaptation in May 2011. Comic co-writer Jimmy Palmiotti praised the hiring, and also said that \\"having [Baruchel] also star in it would be a super bonus\\", suggesting him for either of the lead roles. The project was not discussed publicly again until a January 2015 interview, where Baruchel revealed that financing and casting had been completed and that he was attempting to film the project that year. He also said that he \\"might get to direct that this year as well\\" and announced various crew members, including editor Jason Eisener, cinematographer Bobby Shore, make-up artist Paul Jones, and composer Matthew Good. In a 2019 interview, Baruchel credited Eisener for pushing him to direct the film. = Filming = In July 2018, Jesse Williams, Jordana Brewster, and Niamh Wilson were announced to lead the cast. Williams was cast as Todd Walkley, the creator of the fictional comic character Slasherman. Brewster will portray his girlfriend Kathy, Wilson will play his assistant Aurora, and Baruchel was also confirmed to be starring as Todd's best friend Ezra. By August 2018, principal photography had begun in Toronto and lasted until September 2018. According to Baruchel, filming lasted for \\"technically 20, but really 19 days\\" and included shoots in Hamilton, Ontario. = Post-production = By October 2018, Baruchel was working on editing the film, balancing his time between an editing suite set up in his basement and promotion of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. In a February 2019 interview, Baruchel gave more insight on the film by stating, \\"We‚Äôre trying our best to give the world something interesting and unique and legitimately scary. So it goes very hard and hopefully, if we‚Äôve done our jobs, it‚Äôll have something to say about the genre itself. It‚Äôs a horror flick that has as much of a brain as a set of fangs to it. I think it should fk people up, but also leave them thinking about a bunch of sh*t ‚Äì that‚Äôs the goal.\\" In a May 2019 interview, Baruchel said \\"[he is] currently in post-production on the film; hopefully its scary and ruins people's ability to dream normally.\\" Post-production concluded on August 13, 2019.  Release  Random Acts of Violence premiered at the 2019 Fantastic Fest on September 19, 2019. Elevation Pictures released the film in Canada on July 31, 2020, before debuting it on Shudder in the United States on August 20, 2020. = Reception = On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 66 reviews, and an average rating of 5.67/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Random Acts of Violence falls short as an intelligent analysis of its themes, but viewers looking for chance instances of brutality won't be let down\\". At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". After its premiere at the 2019 Fantastic Fest, the film garnered positive reviews. Trace Thurman, of Bloody Disgusting, gave the film three stars out of five, praising the violence in the film, describing them as \\"brutal and merciless\\". Hazem Fahmy, of Film Inquiry, praised \\"the timely message\\" and the way the film delivers its central theme. Amelia Emberwing, of Birth.Movies.Death., praised the film as \\"quick, bloody and brimming with some genuinely solid special effects\\". Matthew Monagle, of The Playlist, gave the film a grade B‚àí, also praising the violence and the film's commentary on the media. Michael Gingold, of Rue Morgue, praised the film's \\"potent meta look at the genre\\". Conversely, Chris Knight, of National Post, gave a negative review, criticizing the violence and \\"the lack of humor\\". Roger Moore, of Movie Nation, also gave a negative review, criticizing the film for \\"not doing much more than stumble and angst-out from one killing to the next\\". Josh Bell, of Comic Book Resources, felt that the film \\"seems contemptuous of horror fans\\". Cath Clarke, of The Guardian, described it as an \\"exasperating serial killer-slasher\\". Brian Tallerico, of RogerEbert.com, took issue with the film thinking \\"it's saying something about gratuitous violence and exploitation of real tragedy but is even more hypocritically hollow than the films it purports to criticize\\".

She was the first woman to hold a chair in the law faculty at the University of Buenos Aires, first woman to be appointed to the National Academy of Law and Social Sciences, as well as the first woman to serve on the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. Internationally, she was the first woman to become president of the International Law Association, serving from 1968 to 1970 and was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague between 1977 and 1983. She was posthumously honored with a Konex Foundation award in 1986 for her work in Civil and International Law. Early life Margarita Arg√∫as Royol was born on 29 October 1902 in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Margarita Royol and Domingo Arg√∫as. After completing her secondary studies, she enrolled in the law faculty at the University of Buenos Aires in 1923, graduating with honors in 1925. She continued with her studies, earning a doctorate with the thesis La regla locus regit actum, en la legislaci√≥n civil y la jurisprudencia argentina (The rule of Locus regit actum (locality governs legal interpretation) in civil legislation and Argentine jurisprudence) in 1926. She received the Premio Acc√©sit for her thesis, which was published in 1928. Career In 1926, Arg√∫as became the first woman to teach private international law at the University of Buenos Aires and was the first woman appointed to the Carlos Vico Chair in the law faculty. That same year, she published Tratado de Derecho Internacional Privado (Treaty on Private International Law), which set forth the idea that in international treaties, the intent of the parties as understood in their jurisdiction was an important consideration for contractual and commercial law. By 1933, she was elevated to an assistant professorship and was granted a designation allowing her to stand in for Professor Carlos M. Vico in his private law lectures. Between 1939 and 1940, she served as the Advisory Secretary to the Second Congress of Montevideo. The Congress, revised the 1889 treaties between Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay regarding international legal matters, covering a wide array of topics including commercial law, intellectual property, navigation, penal reforms, political asylum and various reciprocity specifications for banking, educational and professional rankings. After ten years of teaching, in 1943, Arg√∫as tendered her resignation in response to the mass dismissal of university professors by the Ram√≠rez regime. In 1945, the university attempted to reinstate her, but Arg√∫as refused, stating, \\"...despu√©s de haber meditado detenidamente en la posici√≥n adoptada, me he reafirmado en ella, considerando que mientras la Naci√≥n no recupere el libre juego de sus instituciones fundamentales y no haya entrado en la normalidad jur√≠dica, por las √∫nicas v√≠as leg√≠timas que la Constituci√≥n le fija, yo no podr√≠a, sin faltar a mi compromiso ya lo que creo es mi deber, reintegrarme a la c√°tedra de Derecho Internacional Privado, que dictaba en esa Facultad...\\" (Having meditated carefully on the position taken, I have reaffirmed myself in it, considering that as long as the nation does not regain the freedom of action of its fundamental institutions and has not entered into legal normality, by the only legitimate means fixed in the Constitution, I could not, without failing in my commitment and what I believe is my duty, reinstate myself as the chair of private international law, from which I taught in the faculty.) The law school tried again to lure her back in 1946 and though she returned in March, she resigned again in November, protesting that the Farrell and Per√≥n governments were also not constitutionally compliant. Arg√∫as moved to Paris in 1947 and attended the international law courses taught by at the University of Paris. At Niboyet's invitation, she delivered lectures on Argentine law. In December 1955, when the Ministry of Education agreed to reinstate the professors who had been dismissed or resigned under the previous political climate and granted the university its autonomy, Arg√∫as returned as the Carlos Vico Chair. The following year, she was recognized with an Order of Merit in the second degree for her expertise in international private law. At various times over the next decade, she replaced Vico as the director in charge, while serving as his Deputy Director. Simultaneously, she represented Argentina as a delegate at numerous international conferences, including the 11th Pan American Women's Association Congress, held in 1956 in Santo Domingo; the Congress of Jurisconsults, hosted in Jerusalem in 1958; and the 5th International Congress of Comparative Law, held in Brussels in 1958, among others. In 1966, she was made a full professor, becoming the first woman to teach as a titular professor at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1968, Arg√∫as became the first woman appointed to the Argentine National Academy of Law and Social Sciences and that same year was elected as the first woman to serve as president of the International Law Association. After serving her two-year term as president, she later served as vice president from 1974 to 1975 and was the president of the Argentine chapter until her death. On 7 October 1970, Arg√∫as was appointed by President Roberto M. Levingston to the Argentine Supreme Court, to fill the remaining term of , who had died in office. With her appointment, Arg√∫as became the first Argentine woman to serve on the nation's highest court and continued in the capacity until 24 May 1973. She was recognized by the Mexican National Council for Women's Rights in 1971, with the \\"Lady of the Americas\\" award. Between 1977 and 1983, Arg√∫as served as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. She was awarded the Silver Clover of Rotary International in 1980 for her career in international justice. Death and legacy Arg√∫as died in Buenos Aires on 27 July 1986 having never married and without children. That same year, she was posthumously honored with a Konex Award for her career achievements. She is remembered for her pioneering work in private international law, and work to promote understanding of how local customs effected international commercial and contractual agreements. In 2017, the University of Buenos Aires hosted a seminar in remembrance of her contributions to Argentine jurisprudence.

Most of his murders took place in the town of Velsk. The majority of his victims were women that he raped before killing. Early life Shipilov was born on May 17 1959 in Arkhangelsk to a simple, working-class family. Shipilov had a sister two years his junior. His mother died when he was seven years old. Shipilov claims his father then began to bring women and alcohol into their home. In his early life, Shipilov received a secondary special education, served in the army, married, and had three children. He worked as a foreman in a vocational school, where he taught students how to drive. At work he was viewed positively by his co-workers. In view of this he was able to use the official car at his own discretion. Initial crimes The first murder Shipilov committed was in 1995, when he robbed and then killed a woman. However, he did not confess to this crime until 2016. In 1996, a series of rapes and murders began. While Shipilov was driving his truck, he picked up a fellow traveler. He claims that while inebriated, the woman agreed to an intimate relationship. However, Shipilov then killed the woman, stabbing her multiple times. The blade broke during the killing and stuck in the victim's body. Later Shipilov admitted to being afraid that the victim would come to his house and tell his wife about the betrayal. He buried the woman's corpse in the vicinity of Arkhangelsk's brickworks. That same year he killed two more women in the same way. Another woman was killed by a blow to the head. The victims' bodies were buried in the Primorsky District; they were found only after Shipilov was captured. In late 1996, Shipilov committed a rape. The victim managed to escape (according to other sources, he let her go), and she reported him to the police. Shipilov was subsequently arrested. In the trunk of his car a bead from one of the victims' ornaments was found. In addition, it was found that he had committed eight more rapes in 1996. On January 16, 1997, the Primorsky District Court sentenced him to eight years imprisonment in a general regime colony. He was not even suspected in the three murders. Later, while serving his life sentence, Shipilov said that there was no rape: the sexual intercourse with the woman had been by mutual agreement, and that she had submitted a statement \\"in order to make money from it\\". In the colony Arriving in Colony UG-42/14 in Velsk, Shipilov came up with a unique scheme which he used to commit all his crimes. In this colony the so-called beskonvoynaya {–±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–≤–æ–π–Ω–∞—è - \\"infinityless\\") system of detention where convicts could move freely throughout the colony. On occasion they could even travel beyond its borders for any administrative needs. Shipilov understood immediately that this could be used for his criminal purposes. In the summer of 1998, as a reward for good behavior, he was allowed to drive the colony's honeywagon. On December 8, 1998, he killed his fourth victim, a woman named Doilnitsyna. Unlike his other victims, he did not bury her body, but only covered it with branches. After that Shipilov hid as he was afraid of getting caught. When he returned later to the crime scene and found that the body had not been discovered, he buried it and decided to continue committing murders. He committed his next murder on May 16, 1999. A week later, on May 24, Shipilov killed another woman. He buried the bodies at the final point of his route, the dump. Between June 11 and June 27, Shipilov committed four more murders. Two of the victims were middle-aged women, two were young girls. According to his confession made after his arrest, \\"he was sorry for the young virgins\\", so he switched to killing only to middle-aged women. Then, in August, Shipilov hid again. Between September 22 and 24, he committed his last murders. Each of the murders was carefully committed. He picked up women on deserted roads, and since the inside passenger door handle was removed, they had no way to escape from the truck. On the way, he offered the women vodka and when he was refused, he stopped in a deserted place and killed them. In one of the interviews, Shipilov told reporters that he only killed those victims he considered were prostitutes. He claimed that he always let any woman who refused to drink with him leave. However, later investigations found that he poured the alcohol violently into his victims. Arrest, trial and sentencing The investigation team set up under the Prosecutor's Office of the Arkhangelsk Oblast, were unsuccessful in their investigation into the disappearing women. Nevertheless, one day they noticed Shipilov's honeywagon pass by a place where one of the victims has disappeared. Investigators learned that a honeywagon from the UG-42/14 Colony often passed by on the same road. Since Shipilov's schedule coincided with the time of the murders, he was detained. Initially there was no evidence against him, and for a long time Shiplov did not provide any evidence. Later Shipilov lost his nerve, and attempted suicide by cutting his veins. He was saved by doctors, and subsequently confessed to committing 12 murders, including the three before his conviction. During his interrogation, he calmly related the details of how he raped and killed his victims. Demonstrating a sharp memory, he described in detail the atrocities and pointed out the burial locations with great accuracy. When asked by the investigators if he had intended to continue killing, he replied that he did and that he had even \\"figured out different ways of killing his victims\\". Despite raping each victim, Shipilov denied sexual gratification was his main motive. According to his own words, he was motivated only by the thirst of \\"crime for the sake of crime\\". On October 25, 2000, the Arkhangelsk Regional Court convicted Shipilov of 12 murders and nine rapes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment due to the moratorium in Russia on the death penalty. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change, and Shipilov was sent to the Black Dolphin Prison correctional facility in the city of Sol-Iletsk. Post-sentencing confessions On May 25, 2016, Shipilov confessed to committing several more crimes. He was sent to the Arkhangelsk Central, where he sits in a single solitary cell. He confessed to two additional murders committed in 1995 and 1996, for which he was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years of imprisonment. This punishment was absorbed into his sentence of life imprisonment. Experts do not rule out that Shipilov, in order not to return to the Black Dolphin, can stay in Arkhangelsk Central for a couple of years and possibly remember any other crimes he committed earlier.

It will be built under a public-private partnership program between the Makati City Government and a private consortium, led by Philippine Infradev Holdings. Proponents of the subway are expected to begin construction by December 2018, and Makati Mayor Abigail Binay projects completion by the year 2025. The subway will cost $3.7 billion (or ‚Ç±192 billion) and is expected to accommodate 700,000 passengers daily. It will also have ten stations, with connections to the existing Line 3, the Pasig River Ferry Service, and the approved Line 9 (Metro Manila Subway). History =Early planning= Preparatory work officially began on December 12, 2018, following a ceremonial drilling ceremony at the front of the Makati City Hall, which is near the site of one of the proposed stations of the subway. The signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Makati City Government and a consortium consisting of Philippine Infradev and Chinese firms Greenland Holdings Group, Jiangsu Provincial Construction Group Co. Ltd., Holdings Ltd. and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd was also held on the same day. Preparatory work included soil testing and feasibility studies of the proposed locations for the subway line's stations. As of June 2019, the locations of 8 out of the 10 proposed stations have been finalized. The two proposed stations along Ayala Avenue are yet to be finalized due to \\"non-response\\" from its owners. The proponents have stated that they may divert the subway towards PNR Buendia Station or the Mile Long property in Legazpi Village instead. In the interim, the first station would be in the current location of the Makati Central Fire Station, which will be demolished, then towards a Lucio Tan owned property near Circuit Makati,and Makati City Hall. The remaining stations would be located near Century City, Rockwell Center, Makati Bliss Housing in the Guadalupe area, University of Makati, Cembo and the final station will be in the vicinity of Ospital ng Makati. By July 2019, soil testing related to the subway was completed and the Philippine Infradev and the Makati City Government signed a joint venture agreement regarding the project. As of October 2019, the plan to move the terminus of the line to the Mile Long property being redeveloped by the national government along Amorsolo Street has been finalized. Favorable soil test results and the route diversion meant that the cost of the project might go down to as low as $2.5 billion. A joint venture with Megaworld Corp. was formed to build a common station located in Guadalupe for the subway system and for the planned SkyTrain. In a disclosure to the stock exchange, the Philippine Infradev wholly owned subsidiary, Makati City Subway Inc. (MCSI) has received the term sheet from Megaworld. The joint venture will build access and connections to the Line 3 Guadalupe Station and the Pasig River Ferry. Philippine Infradev executed an agreement with China Construction First Group Corp. Ltd. (CCFG) to build a transit-oriented development. Under the agreement, CCFG is responsible for the construction, materials, manpower, equipment and other requirements to complete the project, according to Infradev. Construction will last for 42 months. =Construction= Actual construction of the subway is yet to begin. A tunnel boring machine from China to be used in building the subway is expected to be delivered by December 2019. Philippine Infradev Holdings, Inc. received an environmental clearance from the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR) and is looking to begin construction before the year ends. If pushed through, the subway may be completed at 2024, a year ahead of schedule. On July 23, 2020, land acquisition for the project has begun with 55 land owners being given ‚Ç±1,000,000 (US$20,270) each as initial pay for selling their lots to Makati Subway, Inc. The owners will be later given a grand total of ‚Ç±1.18 billion (US$23.9 million).  Fares and ticketing  The upcoming line will use a distance-based fare structure and will be charged 20% to 25% higher than the fares of Line 1 and Line 3. A 25 percent premium will bring the subway's rate to about ‚Ç±38 (75 U.S. cents) for 10 stops. Expansion In the aftermath of the 2019 elections, Antonio Tiu, President of Philippine Infradev has stated that he is open to initiate and enter a similar partnership deal with Makati's neighboring cities for the expansion of the subway system. The cities of Manila, Mandaluyong, San Juan, Pasay, and Pasig were specifically mentioned by Tiu. With the finalized move of the terminus to the Mile Long property, Tiu has started negotiations with the Calixto siblings, Mayor Emi and Congressman Tony, of Pasay to extend the line up to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which is only three kilometers away from Mile Long and is slated for redevelopment.

She subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Iowa. Fiez joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh in 1997. She is the Co-Director of the Behavioral Brain Research Training Program at Carnegie Mellon University.  Research  Fiez is known for her research in neuroscience, specifically on the cerebellum and how it is involved in processing information separately and in unison with the frontal lobes, and its functions that extend beyond motor control. Fiez's research on the role of the cerebellum and its influence on non-motor behavior has focused on how the cerebellum interacts with non-motor areas of the brain. Using neuroimaging, Fiez and her colleagues found evidence for closed-loop circuits in cerebro-cerebellar interactions that indicate the role of the cerebellum not only in movement, but also in cognition. In her research, she uses behavioral, neuropsychological,and neuroimaging methods to discover how the brain gives rise to the mind. Fiez and her colleagues have used positron emission tomography to study distinct functions of the cerebellum and non- motor cortical areas of the frontal lobe, also known as the fronto-cerebellar dissociation. Such studies have identified differences in brain activity in the left-frontal and right-cerebellar parts of the brain when research participants are given simple verbal response tasks, such as generating associations between nouns and verbs. Her research team also used positron emission tomography to study short-term memory and discovered the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be active in short-term maintenance of verbal and nonverbal information while the left frontal opercular regions were only linked to verbal memory. Fiez and Petersen used neuroimaging to identify the involvement of multiple brain areas in word reading, including left- lateralized regions in occipital and occipitotemporal cortex, the left frontal operculum, bilateral regions in the cerebellum, primary motor cortex, and the superior and middle temporal cortex, and medial regions in the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate. In other research, Fiez and her colleagues used mixed methods, including electrical brain simulation, to elaborate on the long debated visual word form hypothesis. They found that stimulating and surgically removing the left midfusiform gyrus of a patient made the patient unable to recognize words or letters; these and other findings indicate the involvement of this area as part of a visual word form system specialized for representing orthography in the brain.

Flores (born January 30, 1960) is an American retired game warden and politician from Pleasanton, Texas, who is a Republican Texas Senator from District 19, the largest Senate district in Texas. He is the first Hispanic Republican Texas State Senator in Texas history, and he is first Republican to be elected in District 19 in 139 years, since 1879 during the Reconstruction Era. Early life Flores's parents, Margarito Flores (who was in the U.S. Air Force) and Lydia Solis Flores, retired in Laredo, Texas. Flores grew up in South Texas. He graduated from Laredo Martin High in Laredo and attended Laredo Junior College before graduating from Texas A&M; University. Flores worked as a farm technician for Texas A&M; Veterinary School then was accepted to the Texas Game Warden Academy in 1985. Career Flores retired as a Colonel Game Warden for Texas Parks and Wildlife. He is a former leader of Texas Parks and Wildlife‚Äôs statewide law enforcement division. He was the first Hispanic to hold that position. Texas Senate In 2016, Flores ran for the Texas Senate District 19, losing to Democratic incumbent Carlos Uresti with about 40% of the vote. District 19 is geographically the largest district in the Texas Senate, with about 400 miles of the Texas‚ÄìMexico border, and it contains all or part of 17 counties and spread over more than 35,000 square miles in the southwestern portion of the state. The district is 66% Hispanic. The district is also 73% African-American and Hispanic.Gingrich, Newt. Newt Gingrich: Texas offers a blueprint for a red wave election in November, Fox News, September 21, 2018. =2018 special election= Uresti resigned from his senate seat after being convicted of federal fraud and money laundering charges in February 2018, and a special election was called. Flores ran for the seat again, and in an upset, Flores won the September 18, 2018, special election for state senate district 19 over former state representative and U.S. Congressman Pete Gallego 57% to 43%. Flores took 81% of the Medina County, Texas vote, yielding him a 3,000-vote lead, which Gallego could not overcome. Flores will serve out the next two years and three months of a term formerly held by Uresti. Flores was endorsed by U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, Governor Greg Abbott, and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick. During the campaign he stated that his focus would be property tax reform, economic development, support for law enforcement, support for the unborn, and support for the 2nd Amendment. Political positions =Property tax reform= Flores wants to lower Texas's property taxes. He believes that Texas taxpayers are overtaxed and the current tax rates are unsustainable. He wants to change the way property is being appraised. He wants a uniform methodology of appraisal that is consistent throughout Texas, instead of having 254 different counties using 254 different ways, limiting the role of individual chief appraisers in the each county. He wants the appraisers to be accountable to the voters. He wants the members of the board of appraisal districts to be voted in office, instead of appointed by taxing entities, making them directly accountable to the voters, removing the buffer that separates the taxing entities and the voters that currently exists. He has said, \\"The system is broken. We need some meaningful tax reform so you and I can keep our houses and we won‚Äôt be taxed out of our property. We want to pay our fair share, but it‚Äôs not right to have a system that‚Äôs not fair and equitable.\\" =Abortion= Flores identifies as pro-life. Personal life Flores and his wife Elizabeth, married in 1982, live in Pleasanton, Texas where he decided to retire after serving the State of Texas for 27 years as a state peace officer. They have two children and two grandchildren.McGuinness, Dylan. Flores wants to bring everyman style of governing to Texas Senate, San Antonio Express- News, September 19, 2018.

It was first identified by A. H. Chivers in 1912, who named it Chaetomium aureum. It was later transferred to the genus Arcopilus by Wang and colleagues. The fungus has recently been recognized to have industrial use for the production of the metabolites resveratrol. and sclerotiorin Additionally, A. aureus has high lead tolerance and clearance, suggesting a potential role in environmental biotechnology. History and taxonomy The genus Chaetomium first characterized in 1817 by Gustav Kunze based on the globular morphology of the perithecia. However, no comprehensive monograph of the species within Chaetomium was written following Kunze's initial publication. In 1912, A. H. Chivers identified Chaetomium aureum while attempting to classify Chaetomium specimens in his herbarium. Ch. aureum was transferred to the genus Arcopilus in 2016 based on phylogenetic analysis of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II large subunits by X.W. Wang and R. A. Samson. Growth and morphology Species within the genus Chaetomium are distinguished through morphological features. In general, the perithecium morphology of members of Chaetomium changes throughout maturation, changing from spherical and translucent, to globular or elongated and coloured when mature. Arcopilus aureus is morphologically similar to Chaetomium trilateral and Ch. fusiforme, leading to confusion in classification of species. However, the curvature of terminal hairs distinguish A. aureus from Ch. fusiforme, whereas spore discharge differentiates A. aureus from Ch. trilateral. Consistent with the perithecium morphology of the genus Chaetomium, the perithecia of A. aureus are flask- shaped, brown-black, and covered with long hairs. The terminal hairs (on the apex of the perithecium)' are olive-yellow, brown, or reddish-brown in colour, and curved at the tips. The lateral hairs (on the sides of the perithecium) are similarly olive-yellow in colour and uniform in diameter with less pronounced curvature at the tips. The growth rate of A. aureus is approximately 4-5mm per day. The mature ascomata are approximately 80-160Œºm in size, and maturation usually occurs within 10 days. Mature ascomata are olive- green and either spherical or oval-shaped. Ascomatal hairs are broad at the base, coiled at the tips, and can be either pale brown or yellow in colour. Theasci are club-shaped with eight spores arranged either irregularly, or in two rows. Within the asci, young ascospores are translucent when young, but dark-green or brown when mature. Upon maturation, ascospores are boat, kidney, or lemon-shaped, with tapering and germ pores at both ends. A. aureus can be distinguished from similar species by its red, yellow and orange exudates producing colourful colonies in culture. Ecology Species in the genus Chaetomium are common saprophytic plant pathogens involved in the decomposition of plant matter in soil, and cellulose-based man-made materials. Chaetomium species have been specifically recognized in the decay of cotton, and as the agent of fruit and wood rot. Arcopilus aureus was first identified from isolates growing on plant species collected in New England. Since its initial discovery, A. aureus appears to have a large geographic range, having been identified in Morocco, Brazil, and India. A. aureus has been isolated from paper and dung, as well as pineapple field soil, and snap bean seeds. Additionally, A. aureus endophytic to plant species, notably Vitis vinifera, and Thymelaea lythroides, a medicinal plant used in Moroccan traditional medicine for cancer treatment. Detection Species within the genus Chaetomium are generally classified based on morphology of asci, ascospores, and terminal hairs. This however, leads to discrepancies in classification and determination of synonymous versus distinct species. For example, Dreyfuss (1976) considered Ch. aureum, Ch. trilaterale, Ch. fusiforme, Ch. cupreum, Ch. confusum, Ch. humicola, and Ch. rubrogenum to be a single species, whereas Ch. trilaterale was considered to be a distinct species by Millner et al. 1977. Molecular phylogenetic determination of fungi by means of protein electrophoresis has been reported, but with varying success. However, using isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels to compare esterase enzymes in isolates of the Chaetomium species group, the number of esterase bands distinguishes Arcopilus aureus from its synonymous species. Although A. aureus is morphologically similar to Ch. trilaterale, protein electrophoresis shows the presence of two extra esterase bands in A. aureus. Additionally, protein electrophoresis shows that Ch. confusum, Ch. humicola, Ch. rubrogenum, and Ch. trilaterale are a synonymous species because of identical banding, supporting Dreyfuss's report in 1976. Therapeutics Species in the genus Chaetomium are sources of many secondary metabolites with anti-malarial, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer properties. Notably, Arcopilus aureus has been found to produce resveratrol, and sclerotiorin. Resveratrol has many benefits effects on human health; it has been found to reduce the progression of neurological diseases such as dementia, and is used to treat cardiovascular problems and ischemic conditions. Isolates from the genera Aspergillus, Botryosphaeria, Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria, Arcopilus, and Lasiodiplodia that are endophytic to Vinis vinifera were all found to produce varying levels of resveratrol. Of these isolates, A. aureus was found to produce the highest levels of resveratrol, based on the Liebermann test to detect a free para position in phenolic compounds, the acetic anhydride test to confirm presence a free -OH group, and quantification of resveratrol by HPLC. A. aureus isolates endophytic to Thymelaea lythroides were shown to have anti-cancer properties. Hsp90 chaperone machinery maintains stability of activated protein kinase and transcription factors that contribute to tumorigenesis. Thus, inhibition of Hsp90 leads to cellular degradation of target oncoproteins. Accordingly, inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery is a potential therapeutic target for cancer. A. aureus isolates were found to produce sclerotiorin, which was tested for its ability to inhibit the Hsp90 machinery by examining Hsp90-mediated folding of the progesterone receptor. In vitro reconstitution of progesterone receptor re-folding following heat stress showed that sclerotiorin inhibited recovery of the progesterone receptor. Additionally, the inhibitory function of sclerotiorin is dependent on the oxygen atom in the heterocycle, as inhibitory function was abolished in compounds containing nitrogen instead of oxygen. Environmental biotechnology A potential usage of Arcopilus aureus in environmental biotechnology is bioremediation of soils contaminated with lead, organic matter, and abnormal pH levels. Previous studies have shown that species of the genus Chaetomium have been isolated from soils with high concentrations of metals, including lead. Additionally, growth of members of the genus Chaetomium are promoted by intermediate concentrations of lead. In agreement with early studies, A. aureus was isolated from soils with high lead concentration near a metallurgical plant in Brazil. Isolates of A. aureus shows high tolerance to lead nitrate and increased mycelial growth in the presence of metallic lead. Additionally, inoculation of the fungus in lead- contaminated soil showed a reduction in exchangeable lead concentration, in addition to maintenance of soil pH and establishment of organic matter in the presence of microbiota. The mechanism of lead reduction by A. aureus is unknown, but the two major hypotheses are: A. aureus produces oosporein, which creates a complex with lead, transforming it into insoluble pyromorphite.

The viaduct carries the Harrogate line over the River Nidd in the town. The viaduct was supposed to have opened in 1848, but the first construction collapsed into the river very near to completion, which necessitated a new viaduct and delayed the opening of the line through Knaresborough by three years. The viaduct can be seen striking across the Nidd Gorge from the ruins of Knaresborough Castle and is a well-known viewpoint in the town. One writer has stated that it is one of the region's better known landmarks. History The viaduct connects with on the Harrogate line, in North Yorkshire, England. The line was built in 1848 with the Leeds and Thirsk Railway creating a branch from their line at railway station to go through Knaresborough and connect with the line that was being built westwards from as part of the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway. Just as the viaduct had been almost completed, it collapsed into the River Nidd on 11 March 1848. The resultant noise of the falling masonry was said to have lasted for five minutes. Whilst there was no official inquiry, it is believed that the collapse of the viaduct was down to a combination of bad workmanship, poor materials and excess water in the swollen river below as a result of heavy rain over a period of two months. Despite the collapse, the centre span was still in-situ and had to be demolished before work could start again on a replacement viaduct. The fall of the viaduct necessitated a temporary Knaresborough railway station situated to the east of the present day station whilst a new viaduct was completed and the permanent station was built. The collapse of the viaduct allowed a considerable amount of stone and lime to enter the river. Due to the presence of lime in the water, thousands of fish were found dead over a large stretch of the river downstream. The contractors, Wilson and Benson, took the two railway companies to court as Thomas Grainger had been engaged to act as an arbitrator in the resultant argument about who should pay for the failed viaduct. Grainger decided that the railway companies should pay over ¬£5,600, but that the two contractors must pay ¬£2,389 and relinquish any further claims on property, materials or the right to build the new viaduct. The main complaint that Benson and Wilson had against Grainger was that he had been employed by both companies to engineer the railway line and stations, so they alleged a bias on his part. A new viaduct was started in 1848 and used the same source of stone as the previous viaduct; a quarry at Abbey Crags, part of the Nidd Gorge through Knaresborough some to the south of the viaduct. The stone was quarried from the same Upper Plompton Grit that was used in the castle and other buildings in the town. A replacement viaduct was opened on 1 October 1851 costing ¬£9,803, and was constructed with castellated walls and piers to blend in with the ruined walls of Knaresborough Castle. It consists of four arches and three piers, the middle of which stands in the water. Railway mapping lists the viaduct as being , but other sources list its length to be . The viaduct is high, and each span is across in width. The height of the parapets is only which has led to Network Rail installing temporary fencing to protect workers when maintenance is underway on the structure. The viaduct can be seen from the castle (looking upstream along the River Nidd) and is a regular viewpoint of the structure that has attracted accolades, though opinion is divided on the subject. In his 1967 survey of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Nikolaus Pevsner stated that the viaduct was \\"one of the most notable railway crimes in England. To castellate the bridge does not make it a picturesque object\\". Conversely, noted Yorkshire-born writer, J B Priestley, was in admiration of how the river reflected the viaduct and said that it \\"added a double beauty to the scene\\". In a 2015 poll conducted by the Dalesman magazine, the viaduct came at number 23 out of the 50 best views in Yorkshire. The viaduct is now a grade II* listed structure.

The name of the book is a reference to conservative writer William F. Buckley Jr.'s 1951 college memoir God and Man at Yale. Judge had previously written a 1997 memoir about the same institution, Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk. He would go on to publish a third book about Catholicism in 2010, A Tremor of Bliss. The author details rampant alcohol abuse at Georgetown Preparatory School, including downing beers with a music teacher from the school, while the teacher was entertained by a stripper. The author recounts a \\"100 Kegs or Bust\\" challenge, where the goal was to consume 100 kegs of beer before the end of the school year. Judge chronicles his exit from religiousness, followed by a return to Catholicism later in life. He criticizes those who diverge from traditional Catholicism and advocates for a return to more stringent religious practices. Judge's book garnered reviews from multiple publications including Publishers Weekly, First Things, Christianity Today, and the National Catholic Register. Publishers Weekly called the book \\"a humorous, edgy look\\" at the author's Catholic school experiences. First Things called it \\"a compelling account\\". Christianity Today recommended the book as \\"a model for an intellectual life\\". National Catholic Register characterized the work as a \\"wonderful and ultimately hopeful book\\". Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in his 2015 book, RFK Jr. that Judge's book significantly affected Georgetown Preparatory School. Oppenheimer commented that the book \\"caused quite a storm\\", due to its revelation by Judge that \\"alcoholism was rampant\\" at the school. God and Man at Georgetown Prep received increased attention in 2018 during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the wake of statements by psychologist Christine Blasey Ford that implicated Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge in possible sexual assault. Demand for Judge's work significantly increased after reporting by The Washington Post on his books and the statements by Ford. The price of the book rose to US$550 in Internet purchases. In the wake of the increased attention to student alcohol consumption, the president of Georgetown Preparatory School released a public letter saying he was trying to change the situation. Contents summary God and Man at Georgetown Prep examines the author's trials and travails at three different well-respected Catholic educational institutions in the United States. Judge discusses how his initial education in multiple Catholic schools motivated him to wish to become less religious in nature. He circles back to religion later in life, and discusses how he eventually found a renewed strength in Catholicism. The author recounts the religiousness of his father, Joseph Judge. Judge discusses a broken road of various mistakes made throughout his lifetime, which in the end brought him back to Catholicism as his choice of how to practice his faith. Georgetown Preparatory School in 2009 The author criticizes what he views as a form of atheism through non-religious practice of Catholicism among Christians in the American middle class. Judge explains his perspective that the Catholic faith he observed being taught in Catholic schools from his youth in the 1970s had been unnecessarily simplified from its traditional moorings. He laments that at Georgetown Preparatory School during his time as a student there, the faculty appeared to embrace sexuality and New Age views in favor of Catholic doctrine. Judge writes that the faculty at Georgetown Prep contained a multitude of homosexual priests. God and Man at Georgetown Prep details an atmosphere of unmonitored copious alcohol consumption among members of the student body at Georgetown Preparatory School. The book recounts how the author published the school's underground newspaper that had information on wild parties. The paper was distributed among students at Georgetown Preparatory School, and entitled, The Unknown Hoya, also released under the title The Heretic. In one periodical, the newspaper showed an image of a music teacher attending a bachelor party. According to Judge, the music teacher was shown, \\"chugging a beer, surrounded by a group of us with raised mugs, sitting down while being entertained by the stripper.\\" The author admits that at Georgetown Preparatory School, the students \\"partied with gusto‚Äìoften right under the noses of our teachers\\". The author recounts a \\"100-Keg Quest\\" also known as \\"100 Kegs or Bust\\" in the book, an attempt during his time at Georgetown Preparatory School to have consumed 100 kegs of beer by the end of the school year. Judge states that his and his fellow students' attempt to reach the 100 kegs of beer challenge resulted in a \\"disastrous\\" drinking incident \\"at my house where the place was trashed\\". The author extends to a critique of his time at Catholic University of America as a baccalaureate student. Similar to his writings about Georgetown Preparatory School, Judge criticizes his university for eschewing traditional Catholic doctrine in favor of newer views such as those who advocated an ability to oppose a ban on birth control. Judge writes that these views are a form of apostasy. Judge traces his career as a journalist after obtaining his undergraduate degree. He cites the impact of his early success, publishing articles on society, belief, and culture for In These Times, The Progressive, and The Washington Post. Unfortunately, although he writes that he achieves early success as a journalist, at the same time Judge was suffering from negative impacts of alcoholism. He attributes his ability to overcome alcoholism to Alcoholics Anonymous, later also criticizing the organization for its casting off of its original influences from Christianity. After the author's father passes away from cancer, Judge explains this motivated him to return to his original faith and religion of Catholicism. Judge explains his period of religious renewal, writing, \\"My father had been dead for several months before it dawned on me that he'd been a Catholic.\\" The author recounts reading the collected books on Catholicism previously owned by his father, including writings by Dietrich von Hildebrand, Joseph Pieper, Jacques Maritain, and G.K. Chesterton. The author realizes what he was missing from his experiences at three Catholic schools, writing, \\"I am a member of a generation of Catholics raised after Vatican II who was cheated out of a Catholic education.\\" Composition and publication Prior to writing God and Man at Georgetown Prep, Judge had worked as a journalist in his early twenties. He was a freelance writer in 1989 in the Washington, D.C. area. Judge received his bachelor of arts degree from Catholic University of America in 1990. By 1990 he had become a contributor to The Progressive, In These Times, and Sojourners. Judge briefly taught at Georgetown University, but left in the 1990s. Before publishing God and Man at Georgetown Prep, Judge had written a previous book on the subject of alcoholism at the same school, Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk. Judge published God and Man at Georgetown Prep in 2005. The book was released in a print format by Crossroad Publishing Company. It was published in eBook format the same year. Judge's subsequent book on the same topic of Catholicism and religious practice, A Tremor of Bliss: Sex, Catholicism, and Rock 'n' Roll, was published in 2010. Critical reception Publishers Weekly called the book, \\"a humorous, edgy look at his experiences in three prestigious U.S. Catholic schools.\\" First Things reviewed the book, and called it a \\"compelling account\\". The religious journal concluded, \\"God and Man at Georgetown Prep is warmly recommended for young people, their parents and teachers\\". Christianity Today published a book review of Judge's work, and observed, \\"In God and Man at Georgetown Prep, Mark Gauvreau Judge writes as a survivor not of abuse, but of neglect.\\" The book review drew comparisons to God and Man at Yale by William F. Buckley. Christianity Today concluded, \\"Catholics and non-Catholics alike will find in his account a model for an intellectual life firmly rooted in the particularities of one faith tradition, yet determined to speak to the world in a common language.\\" National Catholic Register found Judge's writing to be too vague, commenting, \\"There are too many theories and too little space.\\" The reviewer lamented the author had found no true religious meaning from his early Catholic upbringing. The book review observed, \\"Judge has written an autobiography that is part Thomas Merton, part Augustine with a rock and roll beat in the background.\\" National Catholic Register worried the author's views echoed those of others who had also become less religious since their initial Catholic upbringing, \\"Sadly, his story‚Äìlaid out in painful detail in this wonderful and ultimately hopeful book‚Äîdiffers little from that of millions of baby-boomer Catholics.\\" The Washington Times commented, \\"Some authors try to separate themselves from their arguments. Mr. Judge's books tend toward the confessional.\\" God and Man at Georgetown Prep received a book review in Crisis Magazine. Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in his 2015 book RFK Jr.: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream that Judge's book affected the educational institution of Georgetown Preparatory School itself: \\"It caused quite a storm, especially among the alumni and administration going back decades, because Judge, a conservative Catholic, had alleged that 'alcoholism was rampant' among the 'left-wing Jesuits' and claimed that the school had been a hotbed of 'rampant homosexuality.' Half of the faculty, he asserted, 'was gay.'\\" God and Man at Georgetown Prep received increased attention in 2018 during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, in the wake of statements by psychologist Christine Blasey Ford that implicated Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge in possible sexual assault. Judge wrote to the U.S. Senate to say he had \\"no memory\\" of the incident described by Ford. Judge said he did not wish to testify. God and Man at Georgetown Prep and the author's previous book about the same educational institution, Wasted, were highlighted in The Washington Post after the statements by Ford. Multiple U.S. Senators acquired copies of Judge's books on his time with Kavanuagh at Georgetown Preparatory School, to prepare for questioning of Kavanaugh and Ford before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Both the demand for Judge's work in light of the comments by Ford, in addition to the reporting by The Washington Post, drove renewed interest in works by the author about his time at Georgetown Preparatory School. Demand for God and Man at Georgetown Prep, drove the price of the book up to US$550 online. James Van Dyke, the president of Georgetown Preparatory School, released a public letter after reporting on Judge and Kavanaugh and the history of alcoholic drinking at the educational institution, stating he was attempting to change the culture at the school.

He began his football career with Liverpool South End, and was a member of the Rock Ferry team that beat Everton to win the 1897 Liverpool Senior Cup. He signed for New Brighton Tower in April 1897, but a commission ruled that the club had not observed correct procedure in affiliating to the Football Association and declared void all registration forms signed thus far. Hulse joined Blackburn Rovers instead, and soon became a first-team regular, scoring 22 goals from 85 First Division appearances. In 1900, he successfully signed for New Brighton Tower, by then playing in the Second Division. He scored 14 goals from 31 league matches before the club withdrew from the Football League at the end of the season and then disbanded. Hulse moved south to join Millwall Athletic, where he was converted from inside forward to centre forward and scored 35 goals from 60 Southern League matches. He captained the team as they reached the semifinal of the 1902‚Äì03 FA Cup.

After his father's death he worked in bookshop in ƒ∞stanbul Vezneciler and as a teacher and administrator in Menb√¢-i ƒ∞rf√¢n ƒ∞ptidiari School in Alaca district of √áorum. In 1922 he returned to Istanbul, where he completed his last year in the MFA. He graduated from Istanbul University, Faculty of Literature, Department of Turkish Language and Literature, under the supervision of K√∂pr√ºl√ºzade Mehmet Fuat Bey. His 1930 thesis was titled Mel√¢milik and Mel√¢miler.  Career  As a teacher of literature, he worked in Istanbul's Haydarpa≈üa High School, and with high schools in Konya, Kayseri, Balƒ±kesir and Kastamonu. He was a Persian language lecturer at Ankara University, on the faculty of Language, History and Geography. After earning his doctorate, he taught Islamic-Turkish Sufism history and literature at Istanbul University. In his Divan Literature Declaration (1945), he controversially criticised Divan literature using an ideological approach. \\"According to the book's argument, Divan literature was a bad imitation of Iranian literature; he was not interested in social problems. Later, he approached Divan poetry with a softer attitude and prepared it for publication from the structure like Fuzuli Divanƒ± (1948) and 'Nedim Divanƒ± (1951).\\" In 1945 he was arrested for allegedly violating Article 142 of the Turkish Criminal Code; after serving 10 months in prison, he was acquitted. In 1949 he voluntarily retired. He died 25 August 1982.  Selected publications  * Boratav, PN, & Golpinar, A. (1943). Pir Sultan Abdal.

Providing a solution, she maintained that \\"sustained Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) infrastructure and programs should be built around a set of core components which includes guidelines, training, surveillance, multimodal strategies for implementing IPC, monitoring and evaluation among others\\". Speaking during a session with the media, she explained that the solution to reducing the 58% unemployment rate was for Nigerian graduates to begin innovating ideas that will enhance human life. She also noted that knowledge in itself isn't sufficient, but its application in an appropriate manner to better mankind and enhance livelihood of others is what youths should be concerned about.

Evans & Company as a 419-page hardback book containing 440 quotations and sources. The book examines the history of fascism and, based on the growth of big business and big government, describes possible political scenarios for a future United States. According to a 1981 review in the journal Crime and Social Justice, the book is described as \\"timely\\" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that monopoly capitalism needs to be understood internationally since capitalism \\"is not a national mode of production\\". In 2016, the book prompted the following response right after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States: \\"The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they'll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show. [...] That's how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over\\".  Reactions  According to Jason Epstein, editor, publisher and book reviewer for The New York Review of Books, \\"Friendly Fascism [...] reflects what seems to be a widespread feeling among liberals as well as conservatives that democracy in America has played itself out: that soon Americans won‚Äôt be able to govern themselves\\". According to Gaddis Smith, professor emeritus of history at Yale University and an expert on American foreign relations, the book is an \\"insightful lament over the growth of centralized power by business and government in alliance under the direction of faceless managers who [...] are replacing democracy with a form of benevolent fascism\\". Writing on behalf of Eclectica Magazine, reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers \\"faint hope of averting neofascism\\", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by \\"setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority\\". Help may come from insiders since \\"bubbling upward from all levels of the Establishment are longings for fulfilling employment disconnected from consumer exploitation, environmental degradation, or militarism\\". Reviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the Australian Journal of Law & Society that Gross wrote Friendly Fascism before Ronald Reagan had become President of the United States, but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had \\"proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet . [...] The evidence for this [in the book] is stunning\\". According to a book review in the journal Crime and Social Justice by Gregory Shank of the Institute for the Study of Labor and Economic Crisis, \\"Friendly Fascism [...] is written to alert readers to a clear and present danger in the current trajectory of American politics\\". More recently in 2016, the book prompted the following response from Michael Moore right after Donald Trump was elected President: \\"The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they'll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show. [...] That's how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over\\".

Life Mary Barry O'Delaney was born Mary Barry Delany in 1862, adopting O'Delaney when she became a journalist. She left Ireland for Paris in 1883, making a living through her journalist, primarily religious in subject as she was a devout Catholic. All her life O'Delaney also wrote stories, including ghost stories, and poetry for newspapers. By the 1890s she was working for the Daily Irish Independent as the Paris correspondent. It was around this time that O'Delaney became friends with Maud Gonne, comparing her to Joan of Arc and hailing her as \\"our island's maiden queen\\" in a poem published in February 1898. Gonne and O'Delaney worked together for the rest of her life, as Gonne's researcher and companion, with a brief split in March 1899 following a quarrel after which Gonne wondered if O'Delaney was insane. Upon the foundation of the Paris Young Ireland Society in 1897, O'Delaney became its secretary. In this position she circulated reports of its work to Irish papers, whilst also being Gonne's assistant editor to the French language nationalist newspaper, L'Irlande Libre. O'Delaney suggested a special number of L'Irlande Libre to mark Queen Victoria's Irish visit in 1900, in which she was blamed for the Irish famine and other Irish misfortunes. The issue was banned by Dublin Castle authorities in Ireland. After the breakup of Gonne's marriage to John MacBride, O'Delaney lived with Gonne, helping her to raise her children. An incident in which McBride had exposed himself to O'Delaney when drunk was one of a number of such events that had led to the ending of the marriage. O'Delaney had a close relationship with Gonne's son, Se√°n MacBride, who she called her \\"glory boy\\". Upon his birth in 1904, O'Delaney had sent a telegram to Pope Pius X that the future King of Ireland had been born. She was not as close to Gonne's daughter, Iseult, who was irritated by her religious fervour. She acted as W. B. Yeats' secretary when he visited France. When Gonne returned to Ireland in 1918, O'Delaney went with her, looking after her affairs while Gonne was imprisoned. During the Irish War of Independence, O'Delaney's knee was shattered by a bullet. O'Delaney stood as godmother to Francis Stuart when he converted to Catholisim in advance of his marriage to Iseult. In later life, she lived at the Gonne‚ÄìMacBride residence, Roebuck House, Clonskeagh, County Dublin. She and Gonne continued their collaboration on political activities until her death in 1947. She signed her writings as \\"MD\\", \\"MB\\" and \\"M.O'D.\\" as well as a number of pen names such as \\"Joseph May\\".

History After the Franco-Prussian War, the German Army began to study replacements for its existing C/61 steel breech-loaded cannons. Although the C/61 had outclassed its bronze muzzle-loaded French rivals during the war its Wahrendorff breech was unpopular with gun crews. The new gun designated the C/73 retained the same ammunition as the C/61 and was assigned to the field artillery regiments of the Army. The German and Austro-Hungarian Army during that period rounded up to the nearest centimeter. In addition to the German Army, C/73s also armed the Ottoman Empire and a number of the Balkan states. The Balkan states either bought them from Germany, built them under license or inherited Ottoman guns after they left the region. Although largely replaced by the German Army before the First World War, a combination of higher than expected losses and insufficient ammunition production led to the C/73 being brought out of reserve and issued as replacements to field artillery regiments. Some C/73s are believed to have been used by Turkey as late as 1922. Once adequate numbers of new field guns such as the 7.7 cm FK 16 were being produced obsolete types such as the 9 cm Kanone C/73 and captured guns such as the 76 mm divisional gun M1902 and Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 were withdrawn from front- line service and issued to anti-aircraft units. At first, all of the combatants employed field guns on improvised anti-aircraft mounts, which were typically earthen embankments or scaffolds to get the muzzle pointed skyward. Later in the war, specialized anti-aircraft mounts were developed. In 1918 it was estimated that there were still 614 C/73s and C79s deployed in that role. Design Although made of steel like its predecessor, the C/73 was of built- up construction with a central rifled tube, a reinforcing hoop from the trunnions to the breech and a larger propellant chamber for higher muzzle velocities and greater range. The C/73 featured a new breech, known as a cylindro-prismatic breech, which was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block, and the gun used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The C/73 had a box trail carriage built from bolted steel plates instead of wood. The C/73 did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. For transport, the gun was attached to a limber for towing by a six-horse team. The limber also had seats for crew members plus ammunition and supplies. There were also seats attached to the axle of the gun carriage for the crew. In addition to the original steel barrel a hardened bronze barrel was introduced in 1879 and that gun was designated as the 9 cm Kanone C/79. A change from black powder to smokeless powder propellant was addressed during 1888 by adopting a new barrel with the designation C/73-88. Later, a new nickel-steel barrel was introduced in 1891 to address premature barrel explosions by shells filled with picric acid. These were given the designation C/73-91.

The process could be useful for fertility preservation, infertility treatment and may further develop the understanding of spermatogenesis at the cellular and molecular level. Spermatogenesis is a highly complex process and artificially rebuilding it in vitro is challenging. These include creating a similar microenvironment to that of the testis as well as supporting endocrine and paracrine signalling, and ensuring survival of the somatic and germ cells from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa. Different methods of culturing can be used in the process such as isolated cell cultures, fragment cultures and 3D cultures.  Culture techniques  = Isolated cell cultures = Cell cultures can include either monocultures, where one cell population is cultured, or co-culturing systems, where several cells lines (must be at least two) can be cultured together. Cells are initially isolated for culture by enzymatically digesting the testis tissue to separate out the different cells types for culture. The process of isolating cells can lead to cell damage. The main advantage of monoculture is that the effect of different influences on one specific cell population of cells can be investigated. Co-culture allows for the interactions between cell populations to be observed and experimented on, which is seen as an advantage over the monoculture model. Isolated cell culture, specifically co-culture of testis tissue, has been a useful technique for examining the influences of specific factors such as hormones or different feeder cells on the progression of spermatogenesis in vitro. For example, factors such as temperature, feeder cell influence and the role of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) have all been investigated using isolated cell culture techniques. Studies have concluded that different factors can influence the culture of germ cells e.g. media, growth factors, hormones and temperature. For example, when culturing immortalized mouse germ cells at temperatures of 35, 37 and 29‚ÑÉ, these cells proliferate most rapidly at the highest temperature and least rapidly at the lowest but there were varying levels of differentiation. At the highest temperature no differentiation were detected, some was seen at 37‚ÑÉ and some early spermatids appearing at 32‚ÑÉ. Investigations of appropriate feeder cells concluded that a variety of cells could encourage development of germ cells such as Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells but the most essential is Sertoli cells, but Leydig and peritubular myoid cells both contribute to the microenvironment that encourage stem cells to remain pluripotent and self renew in the testis. = Testes fragment cultures = This image shows the difference in process between organ culture and cell culture. In fragment cultures, the testis is removed and fragments of tissue are cultured in supplemental media containing different growth factors to induce spermatogenesis and form functional gametes. The development of this culture technique has taken place mainly with the use of animal models e.g. mice or rat testis tissue. The advantage of using this method is that it maintains the natural spatial arrangement of the seminiferous tubules. However, hypoxia is a recurring problem in these cultures where the low oxygen supply hinders the development and maturation of spermatids (significantly more in adult than immature testis tissues). Other challenges with this type of culture include maintaining the structure of the seminiferous tubules which makes it more difficult for longer-term cell cultures as the tissue structures can flatten out making it hard to work with. To resolve some of these issues, 3D cultures can be used. In 2012, mature spermatozoa capable of fertilization was isolated from in vitro culture of immature mouse testis tissue. = 3D cultures = 3D cultures use sponge, models or scaffolds that resemble the elements of the extracellular matrix to achieve a more natural spatial structure of the seminiferous tubules and to better represent the tissues and the interaction between different cell types in an ex vivo experiment. Different components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen, agar and calcium alginate are commonly used to form the gel or scaffold which can provide oxygen and nutrients. To propagate 3D cultures, testicular cell cultures are imbedded into the porous sponge/scaffold and allowed to colonise the structure which can then survive for several weeks to allow spermatogonia to differentiate and mature into spermatozoa. In addition, shaking 3D cultures during the seeding process allows for an increased oxygen supply which helps overcome the issue of hypoxia and so improves the lifespan of cells. In contrast to monocultures, fragment/3D cultures are able to establish in vitro conditions that can somewhat resemble the testicular microenvironment to allow a more accurate study of the testicular physiology and its associations with the in vitro development of sperm cells.  Future implications  = Scientific = The ability to recapitulate spermatogenesis In vitro provides a unique opportunity to study this biological process through oftentimes cheaper and faster method of research than in vivo work. Observation is often easier in vitro, as the targeted cells are mostly isolated and immobile. Another significant advantage of in vitro research is the ease with which environmental factors can be changed and monitored. There are also techniques which are not practical or feasible in vivo which can now be explored. In vitro work is not without its own challenges. For example, one loses the natural structure provided by the in vivo tissue, and thus cell connections which could be important to the function of the tissue. = Clinical = While rodent spermatogenesis is not identical to its human counterpart, especially due to the high evolution rate of the male reproductive tract, these techniques are a solid starting point for future human applications. Various categories of infertile men may benefit from advances in these techniques, especially those with a lack of viable gamete production. These men cannot benefit, for example, from sperm extraction techniques, and currently have little to no options for producing genetic descendants. Notably, males who have undergone chemo/radiotherapy prepubertally may benefit from in vitro spermatogenesis. These people did not have the option to cryopreserve viable sperm before their procedure, and thus the ability to generate genetically descended sperm later in life is invaluable. Possible methods that could be applied (to this and other groups) are induction of spermatogenesis in testis samples taken prepubertally, or, if these samples are not available/viable, new methods that manipulate stem cell differentiation could produce SSCs ‚Äòfrom scratch‚Äô, using adult stem cell samples. An alternative method is to graft preserved tissue back onto adult cancer survivors, however this comes with operational risks, as well as a risk of reintroducing malignant cells. Even if using this method however, in vitro spermatogenesis advances would allow for sample expansion and observation to better ensure quality and quantity of graft tissue. In those with healthy or preserved SSCs but without a cellular environment to support them, in vitro spermatogenesis could be used following transplant of the SSCs into healthy donor tissue. Another group that could be helped by in vitro spermatogenesis are those with any form of genetic impediment to sperm production. Those with no viable SSC development are an obvious target, but also those with varying levels of spermatogenic arrest; previously their underdeveloped germ cells have been injected into oocytes, however this has a success rate of only 3% in humans. Finally, in vitro spermatogenesis using animal or human cells can be used to assess the effects and toxicity of drugs before in vivo testing.

Early life  She was born at Clifton Hall, west of Edinburgh, the only child of Thomas McCalzean (Lord Cliftonhall), an eminent Edinburgh judge, future Provost of Edinburgh, and Senator of the College of Justice from 1570, who recognized Euphame legally as his daughter and heir in 1558. MacCalzean married Patrick Moscrop or Moscrope, who served as a Justice deputy, but the relative power of their families meant that Patrick took her father-in-law's surname of MacCalzean. This was normal practice where trying to preserve a family name where the sole heir was female. In 1586 Eufame and Patrick were involved in a dispute with Edinburgh town council. During an outbreak of plague, on Christmas Day 1585, the council had moved the quarantined and infected people from the Borough Muir, or modern Meadows, to her property at \\"Quhytehous\\", or Whitehouse, without permission or compensation. The Privy Council found in her favour.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, 1585‚Äì1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 45-6. Euphame and Patrick had at least five children.  North Berwick Witch Trials of 1590-1591  North Berwick witch trials The cause of the events that led to the North Berwick Witch Trials was the behavior of a maid named Geillis Duncan. Duncan had ostensibly cured illnesses, raising suspicions, in November 1590. Her employer became suspicious that she was deriving her powers from the Devil. Duncan confessed, possibly under duress, to witchcraft and she implicated others including John Cane and Euphame MacCalzean. MacCalzean, Agnes Sampson and several others were accused of witchcraft. It was alleged that they had killed the Earl of Angus by witchcraft,Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 497. and planned to murder the first king of England and Scotland, James VI. James was a king by divine right and he was seen as the chief defender against the Devil. James was convinced that magic was involved when Agnes Sampson recounted details of James' first night with his wife Anne of Denmark. The prosecutors cast MacCalzean as a controlling personality who used magic to bewitch her husband. She allegedly tried to cause the deaths of her husband, his father, and his extended family. The charges included the accusation that she had used her skills to relieve the God-ordained pain of women giving birth. Macalzean was said to have caused the death of her cousin and her nephew. She had argued with her uncle over the ownership of some land at Cliftonhall in Kirkliston and it was alleged that she had killed his son, her nephew, because of this dispute. MacCalzean was said to have attended an assembly of witches at Acheson's Haven where an image of James VI was given to the devil for the destruction of the king.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 530.

Education  Morton earned a BA in social sciences in 1976 and a Master of Public Administration at Louisiana State University in 1977, and a PhD in economics from Tulane University in 1984.  Career  Morton held positions as professor in multiple universities. She started as visiting assistant professor in the College of Business Administration at Tulane University 1983-1984, followed by a position as assistant professor in the Department of Economics and Finance 1984‚Äì1985 at the University of New Orleans. She worked in the Department of Economics and Finance at Nicholls State University from 1985 to 1991, becoming tenured as associate professor in 1990. In 1991 Morton moved officially into political science as an assistant professor at Texas A& M university in the Political Science department until 1993, when she started a position as associate professor in the Political Science department at the University of Iowa until 2000. From 2001 to 2020, she held a full professor position in the Department of Politics at New York University. She had a joint appointment between New York University New York and New York University Abu Dhabi. Morton founded the Winter Experimental Social Science Institute (WESSI) and has founded and directs the Social Sciences Experimental Laboratory (SSEL) at New York University Abu Dhabi.  Research  Morton's research contributed in three main areas in political science: (1) American Politics, (2) Political Economy, and (3) Experimental Political Science Methodology. In American Politics, Morton's work advanced understanding on how institutions and procedures affect voting outcomes. In her book, Learning by Voting: Sequence in Presidential Primaries and Other Elections (University of Michigan Press, 2001) and article \\"Information Asymmetries and Simultaneous versus Sequential Voting\\" (1999), co-authored with Kenneth Williams, they explore the effects of voting sequentially (such as presidential primaries in the United States or elections with mail-in and absentee voting) on the amount of information available to voters and the candidates that voters select. In her 2007 work with Marco Battaglini and Thomas Palfrey, \\"Efficiency, Equity, and Timing of Voting Mechanisms\\", they compare how different voting rules ‚Äì simultaneous and sequential voting ‚Äì affect information aggregation and the distribution of the costs of voting among voters. Morton's work also explores how different institutions of primaries (closed vs. open) affect the selection of ideologically extreme candidates in \\"Primary Election Systems and Representation\\" (1998) with Elizabeth Gerber and how multimember district elections with different voting rules ‚Äì straight and cumulative voting ‚Äì affect the representation of minority candidates \\"Minority Representation in Multimember Districts\\" (1998) with Elizabeth Gerber and Thomas Reitz and \\"Majority Requirements and Minority Representation\\" also coauthored with Reitz. Morton proposed the group-based theory of turnout to explain the \\"paradox of not voting\\", which refers to the fact that people turn out to vote even though the when expected benefit does not seem to outweigh the costs of engaging in the activity, given that an individual's vote has close to zero chances of affecting electoral outcomes. In a series of publications, she argues that positive turnout may be partially explained by incorporating the role of groups into the voter's calculation. Her theory posits that when the expected benefit of voting is calculated at the group level ‚Äì with the voter being a member of the group ‚Äì the rational individual has an incentive to turn out and vote. In the area of Political Economy, Morton was also a pioneer in advocating for empirical tests of the formal models in political economy. She made a noteworthy effort to bridge the gap between the formal mathematical models of voting and empirical methods, mainly through laboratory experiments, as stated in the Introductory Chapter of the Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science. In her book, Methods and Models: A Guide to the Empirical Analysis of Formal Models in Political Science (Cambridge University Press, 1999), Morton provides a detailed and thoughtful guideline for scholars who engage in empirical analysis with formal models. Morton's research used laboratory experiments to test various formal models of voting rules on electoral outcomes. Some noticeable examples were her work with Kenneth Williams on how simultaneous and sequential voting affect information asymmetry among voters; and how less informed voters delegate their decisions to more informed voters by abstaining, which is called the \\"swing voter's curse\\". She also questioned the conditions under which group versus individual decision-making can lead to better outcomes. Finally, Morton influenced the rapid growth of experiments in political science from the 1990s onward through multiple published works on experimental methodology in political science, co-founding and presiding over the American Political Science Association‚Äôs organized section on Experimental Research, co-founding and co-editing the Journal of Experimental Political Science, co-founding and directing the Social Science Experimental Laboratory at New York University Abu-Dhabi (one of few such laboratories in the Middle East), and founding the Winter Experimental Social Science Institute (WESSI). Her published works include the textbook Experimental Political Science and the Study of Causality: From Nature to the Lab coauthored with Kenneth Williams, which is frequently used as a textbook for political science graduate student courses in experimental methodology, and which won \\"Best Book\\" award from the American Political Science Association section on Experimental Research in 2011. In this book, she contrasts the Rubin Causal Model and the Formal Theory Approach to causality. Morton's substantive expertise in the application of experimental methods in political science revolved around using experiments to analyze the effect of electoral systems and voting, writing a coauthored chapter entitled \\"Electoral Systems and Strategic Voting (Laboratory Election Experiments)\\" in the Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science. Morton was considered to be one of an initial cohort of political scientists to advocate for the expansion of the use of experiments from the life sciences to political science, contributing the Chapter \\"Experimentation in Political Science\\" (2008) to the Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology.

It occurs in the Indo-Pacific region and is a bioeroding species, with various specialisations for living on and inside calcareous substrates such as massive corals and molluscs. Distribution and habitat C. orientalis is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from East Africa and Madagascar, through India and the Maldives, to northern Australia, the Philippines, and many island groups in the Western Pacific Ocean. Its depth range is down to about . Ecology Like other demosponges, C. orientalis is a filter feeder. Water is drawn in through fine pores, the nutritious particles are filtered out, and the water exits the sponge through the oscula. In addition, this sponge is able to extract nutrition from dissolved sugars in the water. It is a hermaphrodite; sperm are liberated into the water column and drawn into another individual via the water current, fertilisation being internal. The embryos are brooded within the sponge at first before being liberated through the oscula as parenchymella larva. These are planktonic, and when sufficiently developed, settle on a suitable substrate and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile sponges. This sponge is a bioeroder. On suitable calcareous substrates such as coralline rock, massive corals and mollusc shells, pieces of solid material are chipped away using chemicals produced by \\"etching cells\\" and the sponge tunnels into the material. The fluted giant clam Tridacna squamosa is attacked in this way, and corals attacked include Goniopora tenuidens, Porites sp., Astreopora listeri, Favites halicora, Dipsastraea pallida, Goniastrea retiformis and Cyphastrea serailia. In research designed to mimic the effects of rising sea surface temperatures, it was found that this sponge expelled its Symbiodinium when the temperature reached , becoming bleached, and showed little capacity to recover when the temperature was subsequently reduced.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.   Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of or more * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident- flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. * On January 1, an Enbridge pipeline that runs from Superior, Wisconsin to near Whitewater, Wisconsin failed, resulting in a spill of 1,500 barrels of crude oil onto farmland and into a drainage ditch. Incomplete fusion of a longitudinal weld at the pipe maker that failed as pressure cycled was established as the cause. * On February 2, a construction crew struck an Enbridge pipeline in Rusk County, Wisconsin with equipment, spilling of crude oil, of which only 2,066 barrels were recovered. Some of the oil filled a hole more than deep and was reported to have contaminated the local water table. * On February 17, in a rural area of Harris County, Texas, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline transmission pipeline was damaged, and later exploded and burned. Grass fires spread across a three-square mile rural area. The 31-inch natural gas pipeline leaked after a bulldozer hit it. Residents reported a loud explosion that shook houses enough to set off car alarms, as well as a rumbling sound and a bright orange fireball in the sky. Firefighters \\"backfilled\\" the break with nitrogen. PHMSA reported 1 person injured.TGP, Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov * On March 12, new pipeline construction equipment hit an existing natural gas transmission pipeline near Lake Weatherford, in Parker County, Texas. A massive fire followed, but there were no injuries. * On March 29, near Yutan, Nebraska, a pipeline was hit by construction equipment. About 1,697 barrels of natural gasoline were lost. * On April 27, a gas transmission pipeline failed near Pawnee, Illinois. The failure ejected a long section of pipe, and released of natural gas that ignited. The rupture and resulting fire resulted in the evacuation of a residence and the death of farm animals. The failure was due to external corrosion. * On May 4, a backhoe helping to lay a gas pipeline hit another gas pipeline in Weatherford, Texas. The gas ignited, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air. Vehicles, equipment, and power lines in the area were destroyed, but there were no injuries. * On May 16, about of gasoline spilled into an old stripping pit that covers a three-acre area in Coal Township, Pennsylvania. The Kerris and Helfrick company owns the property where the gas leak occurred, and the excavator, was working for the company when he accidentally ruptured the Sunoco Logistics 14-inch petroleum pipeline. The gasoline was mostly absorbed into areas of soil, fill and coal strippings at the site. Several residents made U.S. Rep. Christopher P. Carney aware of complaints about gasoline odors in residential basements. \\"Moreover, many residents are legitimately concerned about groundwater contamination as well as a host of future problems associated with the spill\\", Carney wrote to Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen McGinty. The pipeline was installed in 1964 by the Atlantic Richfield Co.(ARCO) and purchased in 1990 by Sunoco. On September 29, the PADEP Environmental Cleanup program finalized a consent order and agreement with Mallard Contracting, which included a $45,000 civil penalty covering both DEP's response costs and a fine for violations of the Pa. Solid Waste Management Act. * In August, a gas compressor turbine caught fire inside BP's Gathering Center 1 in Alaska, after an oil hose ruptured and spewed flammable liquid across the motor. A mechanic on patrol in the facility ‚Äî seeing smoke ‚Äî fled the room as the turbine burst into flames. Automatic fire and gas alarms were never triggered. A subsequent investigation by Alaska state authorities found that a ruptured hydraulic oil hose was Jerry-rigged in a position that chaffed against the turbine's hot engine. The investigation also found that the facility's fire and gas detectors were not powered on at the time. * On October 8, a gas pipeline at a gas storage facility in Salem, Michigan ruptured and caught fire. Siding was melted on nearby houses. * On October 18, an ethylene pipeline explosion early, was heard for miles around Port Arthur, Texas, waking residents. The following fire spread to a nearby butadiene pipeline, causing it to rupture and burn. Later, over 300 residents sued the pipeline's owners for health issues claimed to be caused from the chemicals released by the accident. External corrosion of the ethylene pipeline caused the first pipeline failure. * On November 1, a 12-inch propane pipeline exploded, killing two people, and injuring five others, near Carmichael in the southeast portion of Clarke County, Mississippi. The NTSB determined the probable cause was an LF-ERW seam failure. During hydrostatic testing of the pipeline after repair, another LF-ERW seam failed nearby. Inadequate education of residents near the pipeline about the existence of this pipeline, and how to respond to a pipeline accident, were also cited as a factors in the deaths. * On November 12, three teenaged boys drilled into an ammonia pipeline, in Tampa Bay, Florida, causing a major ammonia leak. They later claimed they did it due to stories of money being hidden inside that pipeline. The leak took two days to be capped. One of the teens had serious chemical burns from the ammonia. Residents within a half miles from the leak were evacuated. PHMSA later noted the pipeline company failed to adequately plan for emergencies with the local Fire Agency, as required by CFR 195.402(c)(12). * On November 13, Enbridge discovered a leak on their 34-inch Line 3, at Mile Post 912, near Clearbrook, Minnesota. Later, the pipeline exploded during repairs, on November 27, causing the deaths of two employees. DOT officials said that two Enbridge workers died in a crude oil explosion as they worked to make repairs on the former Lakehead system pipeline. Enbridge was cited for failing to safely and adequately perform maintenance and repair activities, clear the designated work area from possible sources of ignition, and hire properly trained and qualified workers. * On November 21, a 30-inch gas transmission pipeline failed, near Haven, Kansas. The gas ignited, resulting in road closures. * On December 14, two men were driving east in a pickup truck, on Interstate 20 near Delhi, Louisiana, when a 30-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded. One of the men were killed, and the other injured. External corrosion was later identified as the cause of the failure.

No injuries were reported however gasoline flowed into the stormwater system. According to Magellan Midstream Partners, the owner of the pipeline, a contractor the company hired accidentally struck and broke open the pipeline that runs from Rosemount to Minneapolis. * On January 10, a pipeline in Pearl City, Hawaii ruptured and leaked an estimated 500 gallons of fuel oil into two residents' yards. The state Department of Health says a small amount of oil entered the stream. * On January 14, a natural gas pipeline ruptured, leading to a fire in Geismar, Louisiana. No injuries or fatalities were reported. * On January 30, a crew using a boring drill hit a natural gas pipe, in Arlington, Texas. Escaping gas ignited, and burned for over 3 hours. There were no injuries. * On January 31, 2018, a portion of a pipeline experienced an in-service rupture, near the city of Summerfield, Ohio. The rupture of the 24-inch interstate pipeline resulted in the release of approximately 23,500 MCF of natural gas in a rural forested area. A root cause analysis concluded that the girth weld failure was caused by axial stress due to movement of the pipe that exceeded the cross-sectional tensile strength of the net section weld zone surrounding the crack initiation location. There were no injuries. * On February 18, a 16-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in Yukon, Oklahoma. Oil accumulated in a 7-acre private pond. About 84,000 gallons of crude were spilled. * On February 23, a house in a suburb of Dallas, Texas exploded, killing a girl, and injuring 4 others in her family. This followed a number of gas distribution line leaks in that area over the previous months. Atmos crew then started large scale replacement of gas lines in that area, resulting in at least 2,800 homes being without gas service for days to weeks. NTSB Investigators were sent to the area. * On March 3, a fallen electric wire from a utility pole caused a gas line to rupture and burn, in Wenham, Massachusetts. There were no injuries reported. * On March 21, a Marathon Petroleum pipeline spilled about 42,000 gallons of diesel fuel, near Solitude, Indiana. * On April 30, 2018, a pipeline failure occurred in a remote mountainous region of Marshall County, West Virginia, resulting in the release of 2,658 barrels of propane. The failure and subsequent release was caused by lateral movement of the 8-inch intrastate pipeline due to earth movement along the right-of-way. * On May 10, a crude oil pipeline ruptured in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, leaving a film of crude on a school playground, homes and automobiles. At least 630 gallons of crude were released. * On May 14, a tractor crashed into a valve on an NGL pipeline in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, releasing a cloud of a blend of propane, butane, ethane and natural gasoline. Residents and two schools were evacuated for several hours. There was no fire or explosion. * On May 23, a pipeline rupture and fire in Bienville Parish, Louisiana forced at least 30 nearby residents to evacuate. There were no injuries. * On June 7, a 36-inch natural gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned, near Wheeling, West Virginia. There were no injuries. The pipeline went into service in January 2018. Shifting land was identified as the cause. * On June 14, a gas pipeline in Tulsa, Oklahoma was ruptured by a tractor. A Firefighter and four Oklahoma Natural Gas workers were injured in the explosion and fire, that followed the rupture. An initial report said one of the injured was a bystander. * On June 15, A Southern Star Central Natural Gas pipeline exploded outside Hesston, Kansas, sending flames shooting 75 to 100 feet into the sky * On June 19, a Sunoco pipeline leaked more than 33,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PHMSA said it first learned of the spill on the evening of June 19 from a ‚Äúprivate citizen‚Äù who reported a petroleum odor at Darby Creek. About two-thirds of the spill was recovered. * July 10: After a gas explosion, later Court documents say a contractor failed to properly mark a natural gas line that was struck, and caused a deadly explosion, in downtown Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. A search warrant unsealed in Dane County Circuit Court says a utility marking employee failed to correctly mark the gas line in the street, and instead targeted a spot on a sidewalk, about 25 feet away. A Firefighter was killed, when a subcontractor placing a fiber communications lines underground ruptured a gas line, and triggered an explosion and fire. Another Firefighter was critically injured. The blast destroyed six businesses and one home. * On August 1, a series of gas pipeline explosions injured seven pipeline workers and firefighters in Midland County, Texas. One injured worker later died. They were responding to a leak report. * On September 6, a 6 inch Dominion Energy gas gathering pipeline burned, near Clarksburg, West Virginia. Lightning was suspected of hitting the pipeline. * On September 7, a Buckeye Partners pipeline ruptured in Decatur, Indiana, spilling about 8,000 gallons of jet fuel into the St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio). * On September 10, the 24 inch Revolution Pipeline of Energy Transfer Partners gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned, in Center Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. One home, 2 garages, and 6 steel high tension power line towers were destroyed, but no injuries were reported. The pipeline had been operating for 1 week before the failure. Earth movement was suspected as the cause. Later, the Pennsylvania state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued one of its largest-ever civil penalties in the wake of an investigation, that found Energy Transfer had violated numerous regulations during construction of the Revolution pipeline in western Pennsylvania.https://www.wtae.com/article/30-million-fine-pipeline-explosion- center-township-beaver-county-pennsylvania/30393468 * On September 13, the Massachusetts gas explosions destroyed 40 homes, killed one person, and 21 others were sent to the hospital. * On November 10, a pipeline ruptured and caught fire in Sutton County, Texas, injuring at two people.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pipeline-fire-texas/fire-on- pipeline-in-sutton-county-texas-injures-two-local-media-idUSKCN1NH0AH * On December 13, a Kinder Morgan pipeline ruptured, near Las Cruces, New Mexico. About 462,000 gallons of gasoline were spilled into an irrigation ditch, with some of it suspected of reaching ground water. Later, 3 nearby properties were bought by Kinder Morgan. The cause appeared to be external corrosion, resulting in a safety order from PHMSA.https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520185007S/520185007S_Safety%20Order_08082019_text.pdf  References  Category:Lists of pipeline accidents in the United States Category:2018 disasters in the United States ","title":"List of pipeline accidents in the United States in 2018"},{"id":"58527657","text":"Lavrio Indoor Hall, or Kleisto Gymnastirio Lavriou (Greek: ŒöŒªŒµŒπœÉœÑœå ŒìœÖŒºŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒø ŒõŒ±œÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ), is an indoor sporting arena that is located in the city of Lavrio, Greece.

Voters failed to pass the initiative during the General Election held on November 6, 2018; the proposition would have allowed a limited number of Idaho racetracks to operate historical racing gaming terminals. Proposition 1 was an effort to restore a law that previously allowed historical racing in Idaho. In the 2018 vote for Idaho Proposition 1; 278,212 (46.20%) voted to save historical horse racing while 323,924 (53.80%) voted against Idaho Proposition 1. 45,713 voters would have been needed in order to pass Idaho Proposition 1.  Proponents  Treasure Valley Racing is credited with authoring Proposition 1, and was also the primary contributor to the Committee to Save Idaho Horse Racing, Create Jobs, and Fund Public Schools political action committee.  Opponents  The Coeur d'Alene tribe was the primary contributor for two political action committees that opposed the measure. In 2018, the North Idaho Voter Project PAC was created by representatives of the Coeur d'Alene tribe. Representatives of the North Idaho Voter Project PAC were accused of following and harassing Proposition 1 canvassers (signature gatherers) who were attempting to acquire enough signatures to place the Prop 1 question on the 2018 ballot. The same PAC was also accused of attempting to bribe Proposition 1 canvassers to quit gathering signatures. The second opposition PAC is titled Idaho United Against Prop 1, and lists the chairman of the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Council, \\"Ernie\\" Stensgar, as the Treasurer.  History  The Idaho legislature voted to allow historical horse racing at horse race tracks in 2013. In 2015 horse races in Idaho brought in about $50 million in annual payroll, and sales. In 2015 a lobbyist for the Coeur d'Alene tribe introduced Senate Bill 1011 (2015) to the Idaho Senate State Affairs Committee. This repealed historical racing in Idaho. Later in 2015 a gubernatorial veto to protect historical horse racing was invalid due to the timing of the veto Tribal representatives testified during the 2015 legislative hearings for Senate Bill 1011 that they were worried historical racing terminals would negatively impact their own tribal casino revenues. This caused all horse race tracks to close and over 535 jobs were lost.  Funding  Chairman of the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Council, \\"Ernie\\" Stensgar reported on behalf of the Idaho United Against Prop 1 political action committee, that the Idaho United Against Prop 1 PAC had received $6.55 Million and spent $5.67 Million through October 31, 2018 to persuade voters against Prop 1. Bruce Newcomb, a former Speaker of the House for the Idaho House of Representatives, is listed as Chairman for the Committee to Save Idaho Horse Racing, Create Jobs, and Fund Public Schools political action committee. Through October 31, 2018, the Committee to Save Idaho Horse Racing PAC raised $5.94 Million and spent $4.59 Million in support of Prop 1.

A recommendation to formulate an organization around this concern grew out of the meeting with the creation of the Adelaide Sanford Institute to honor Adelaide Sanford. In 2012, the Adelaide L. Sanford Institute (ASI) started community-round table discussions in Central Brooklyn. The goal of the round-table discussions was to provide community based organizations, elected officials, parents, clergy, and community leaders with a forum for discussions and strategies around State Standards in New York City public schools.

The Bay is home to the most important commercial harbor on the Puerto Rico south coast and the second largest in Puerto Rico. The Cardona Island Light is located on the Bay to mark the way into the Bay from the nearby Caja de Muertos Light. Bah√≠a de Ponce is located in southern Puerto Rico, about midway on the southern coast. It has a width of , a length of 1.5 miles, its shore is about and its area is approximately . Typical bay depths are in the -to- range, but these dip to at the drenched piers. The Bay provides recreation, sightseeing and tourist attractions. It also provides for commercial and industrial activities. The Rafael Cordero Santiago Port of the Americas is located here as well as the La Guancha Recreational and Cultural Complex, the La Guancha Boardwalk, and Club N√°utico de Ponce. The annual Cruce a Nado Internacional swimming sports event is held at this Bay every September. History 1898 American invasion The history of the Bah√≠a de Ponce is closely tied to the history of Barrio Playa, the populated place that lines Bah√≠a de Ponce's shores. As the major means of external communication for the settlement at Ponce, barrio Playa has, in turn, a history that is as old as the history of the city of Ponce itself, dating to the 16th century, when Barrio Playa used to be called Montones.Eli D.

During the 1600s and 1700s, significant contraband took place near Ponce shores as well as attempts to attack, ransack, and invade the Playa settlement. A lookout post was set up in the El Vigia Hill, located immediately north of the city to warn the city of the need of help in the Playa harbor, a small port settlement at the time. Despite the threats, the Port of Ponce started operations at Bah√≠a de Ponce under Spanish sovereignty in February 1789 and in just a few years became Puerto Rico's most important port.Un operador busca transformar el Puerto de las Am√©ricas de Puerto Rico.

Hydrography Isla de Ratones vessel obstruction at Bah√≠a de Ponce (Photo taken from the north looking south, with the open Caribbean Sea in the background) The continental shelf at Bah√≠a de Ponce is over 5 miles wide, after which it dips steeply into the Venezuelan Basin. Maritime obstructions for vessels entering the Bay include seven features: Bajo Tasmanian, Bajo Cardona, Roca Ahogado, Las Hojitas, Cayo Viejo, Isla de Ratones and Cayo Arenas. Bajo Tasmanian is a mile-long bank to the east of the harbor entrance, with several points with shallow depths (16 to 18 feet deep). The part closes to the entrance channel has depths as shallow as about 20 feet. Bajo Cardona extends 600 yards east-southeast from Isla de Cardona; it has depths of 12 to 16 feet. With an east wind of 25 knots or more, the mud from the reef off Isla de Gatas discolors the water across the channel to Isla de Cardona and beyond making the channel off the piers at Punta Pe√±oncillo appear shoal. Roca Ahogado is a bare rock in the middle of Caleta de Cabullones, to the east of Bah√≠a de Ponce with shoal water of 4 to 18 feet extending up to 0.2-mile from it. Oriented in a northeast direction, Las Hojitas, northwest of Isla de Cardona, is 0.8-mile long and has a small patch awash near its southwest end. The reef has depths of 2 to 11 feet. Cayo Viejo, located 0.8-mile west of Isla de Cardona, is about 0.3-mile in diameter and awash at its shoalest point. Isla de Ratones, on the west entrance to the Bay and a mile offshore, is a low island with a reef that bares at low water extending a mile east-southeast of it. Cayo Arenas, located 0.5-mile east of Isla de Ratones, is surrounded by a reef and shoals that extend up to 200 yards from its shore. The principal entrance to the Bay is east of Isla de Cardona. There is a 600-foot-wide entrance channel which is 36 feet deep, then an inner channel 200-foot-wide 36 feet deep leading to an irregular shaped turning basin, with a 950-foot turning diameter adjacent to the municipal bulkhead. The entrance channel is marked by lights, and buoys. A 0.2-mile-wide channel between Isla de Cardona and Las Hojitas is available for use by small vessels.Bah√≠a de Ponce and Approaches.

There was an eleven-story circular tower added in 1971 that increased the total number of beds to 250. The hospital was founded by brothers William, Roy, Robert, and Howard Monsour who were all physicians. The hospital provided medical care to those in Westmoreland County. The hospital closed in 2006 after failing to renew its medical license and has since been demolished starting in 2014. Monsour Medical Center was once a state-of-the- art hospital in its time, but was always plagued with debt. Monsour Medical Center Hard times Monsour Medical Center filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1980, and remained in bankruptcy until 1989. The hospital also began having licensing problems in 2004, and then in 2006 ultimately closed its doors after failing to renew its medical license. The owners locked the doors and walked away from the building leaving behind medications, medical waste, patient files, and many more items that were left at the building. The building became a problem for the city of Jeanette and was plagued with vandals, arson fires, and multiple forms of hazardous waste. The hospital had been a public health concern for many years since its closure in 2006. Demolition The city of Jeannette never had the money to demolish the decaying building. The estimated cost of demolition was $250,000-$1 million and it was less money for the city to spend $25,000 per year to try and keep up with security and vandals. Finally, in 2014 a request was submitted for a state grant of $1 million to demolish the property. Demolition of the hospital, led by DORE construction out of Michigan, was completed in 2016. Cleanup was expensive and lasted several weeks after.

He discovered and introduced strontium-89 in medical therapeutic procedures in 1939. He was the first to report a possible therapeutic role for the beta emitting radionuclide strontium-89 in the palliation of bone pain associated with metastatic bone disease. His autoradiographies of animals or organs after administration of strontium-89 or phosphorus-32 started the development of bone scintigraphy. The groundbreaking work of Pecher was forgotten for decades due to the classification of information linked to the Manhattan project. The therapeutic use of 89Sr was only approved in 1993 for the palliative treatment of breast and prostate cancers metastatic to the bones for use in the US and became the first bone- seeking radiopharmaceutical that came into widespread use.  Biography  Born in Antwerp on 26 November 1913, Pecher was the son of the liberal politician √âdouard Pecher and Emilie Speth. After secondary studies at the Koninklijk Atheneum Antwerpen (1932), he continued with a university education in both physics and medicine. He became assistant of professor Pierre Rylant at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, where he specialized in biophysics. Pecher pioneered in fundamental neurophysiology through his evidence of random processes in the nervous system. He received his doctor's degree in 1939. His medical studies were awarded the Armand Kleefeld Prize and earned him a scholarship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation to continue his research in the United States. On 1 August 1939, Pecher married fellow researcher Jacqueline Van Halteren (31 May 1915 ‚Äì 16 September 2013) and the couple traveled to the US the following month. Pecher first worked at Harvard University with Edwin Cohn and George Kistiakowsky. In 1940, he was appointed Research Fellow in the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. After two intense years, Pecher became entangled in the Second World War. In 1940 the Belgian Government in exile decided to raise a military unit from pre-war Belgian √©migr√©s and soldiers rescued from Dunkirk and called up all Belgian nationals worldwide to join the Free Belgian Forces. A battalion was formed in Canada from Belgian √©migr√©s in the Americas. Pecher saw himself faced with a choice between his patriotic duty and his scientific calling, with the complicating factor of American pressure to remain in work in a domain whose military relevance was fully recognized, with all the secrecy that this entails. In the end, Pecher responded to his convocation for the Belgian army in the United Kingdom. In Joliette, where he was supposed to board for Europe, he died on 28 August 1941. A verdict of suicide was derived from the high dose of barbiturates in his body. His daughter Evelyne was born two months later.  Work  60-inch cyclotron at the University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, in August, 1939 Between 1938 and 1940, Ernest O. Lawrence and William M. Brobeck developed and built a 60-Inch cyclotron, which accelerated deuterons to 19 MeV, the first cyclotron capable of producing medically useful radioisotopes. It was housed in the Crocker Laboratory. In 1940, Pecher was appointed Research Fellow in the Radiation Laboratory of Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley, where he produced radioisotopes in the cyclotron under the supervision of John H. Lawrence and used them as radioactive tracers. The bones are largely composed of calcium and phosphorus in the form of tricalcium phosphate. W. Wesley Campbell and David M. Greenberg and later Pecher demonstrated using radioactive tracers that calcium is almost entirely stored in the bones with small traces being distributed in the soft tissues. For this reason, the metabolism of calcium attracted very early the interest of physicians looking for applying radioisotopes of calcium for therapeutic purposes. Pecher predicted and then demonstrated that strontium, which belongs to the same group in the periodic table, was absorbed by the human body in a manner similar to calcium. His work with strontium-89, a calcium analogue, eventually led to its administration to a terminal patient with osteoblastic metastases from a metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. A posthumously published autoradiography of an amputated leg with strontium-89 is the first human bone scintigraphy. It was the third medical radioisotope, after phosphorus-32 and iodine-131 introduced respectively by John H. Lawrence and Joseph G. Hamilton. Pecher demonstrated using two cows the Sr-89 transfer to milk. Pecher filed a patent in May 1941 for the synthesis of strontium-89 and yttrium-86 using cyclotrons and described the use of strontium for therapeutic uses . The groundbreaking work of Pecher was forgotten for decades due to the classification of information linked to the Manhattan project and the American nuclear weapons program. While 89Sr with a half-life of 50.6 days is used to treat bone cancer, 90Sr is an isotope of concern, with a half-life of 28.90 years, following a fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents as its a common fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. United States Atomic Energy Commission commissioned in 1949 an investigation, codenamed Project GABRIEL, to gauge the impact of radioactive fallout resulting from nuclear warfare. It surmised that the radioactive isotope strontium-90 (Sr-90) represented the most serious threat to human health from nuclear fallout. This resulted in the commissioning of Project SUNSHINE, which sought to examine the long-term effects of nuclear radiation on the biosphere due to repeated nuclear detonations of increasing yield. Project SUNSHINE sought to measure the global dispersion of Sr-90 by measuring its concentration in the tissues and bones of the dead. Of particular interest was tissue from the young, whose developing bones have the highest propensity to accumulate Sr-90 and thus the highest susceptibility to radiation damage. SUNSHINE elicited a great deal of controversy when it was revealed that many of the remains sampled were utilized without prior permission from the deceased or from relatives of the dead, which wasn't known until many years later.PROJECT SUNSHINE AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE Centre for Medical Education Dundee University Medical School Sue Rabbitt Roff The seminal contribution of Pecher on the therapeutic use of 89Sr was ‚Äúrediscovered‚Äù in the United States in 1976 by Marshall Brucer, former Chairman of the Medical Division of Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. In 1973, two German physicians Nosrat Firusian and Carl G. Schmidt rediscovered, independently from Pecher's work, the therapeutic use of 89Sr for the treatment of incurable pain in patients with neoplastic osseous infiltrations. Although not citing Pecher's work, Firusian and Schmidt referred to a 1950 article of John Lawrence and Robert H. Wasserman, in which they stated that \\"Radioactive strontium has been shown to behave similarly to calcium in the body\\" citing a 1941 paper of Pecher. This palliative treatment for breast and prostate cancers metastatic to the bones was only approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1993 for use in the US under the commercial name \\"Metastron\\", in the form of injectable Strontium Chloride, produced by Amersham International and became the first bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical that came into widespread use. Before leaving for Canada, Pecher filled a patent for a method of transmitting secret messages with radioactive invisible ink.  References   Further reading   A. A.

Founded in 1967 to serve the predominantly Black Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the majority of its staff were African- American. Freedom House Ambulance Service broke medical ground by training its personnel to previously unheard of standards of emergency medical care for patients en route to hospitals. The paramedic training and ambulance design standards pioneered in the Freedom House Ambulance Service would set the standard for emergency care nationally and even internationally. Despite its successes, the ambulance service was closed eight years after it began operating. Background Prior to the mid 1960s, ambulance service in the US was typically provided by either the fire department, the police, or a local funeral home. Such services provided, at most, basic first aid and rapid transportation to a hospital. In police-operated ambulances, the ambulance crew would typically load the patient into the back of a police van, where they would ride unaccompanied while the police ambulance crew rode in the front. The U.S. medical system had yet to incorporate advances in emergency care made in battlefield medicine. Suburbanization in the U.S. following World War II lead to more car accidents and more injuries far from hospitals, exacerbating this lack of medical care provided en route to hospitals. In 1966, the National Academy of Sciences published a white paper titled \\"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society.\\" The paper stated that up to 50,000 deaths each year were the result of inadequate ambulance crews and lack of suitable hospitals within range, drawing attention to the need for improved pre-hospital care. The severity of the situation in Pittsburgh was brought home when the former Governor of Pennsylvania and former mayor of Pittsburgh, David L. Lawrence, suffered a heart attack and was transported to a local hospital by police. Lawrence had no brain activity when he arrived at the hospital and died after being removed from life support, a death that could have been avoidable with adequate pre- hospital care, in the view of the physician who treated him, Peter Safar. In Pittsburgh, the city police handled ambulance service within the city, transporting patients via paddy wagon while funeral homes provided ambulance service in the suburbs. Wait times were often longer for service in predominantly Black neighborhoods, especially in the economically depressed Hill District. Additionally, tension between police and the community made many reluctant to call the police ambulance service. Inception The program received its initial funding from Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty and the Maurice Falk Fund. The Falk Fund was headed by Phil Hallen, a former ambulance driver, who was seeking to improve responses to medical emergencies as well as create employment opportunities for African-American men in Pittsburgh. Upon hearing that Hallen was working to improve ambulance service in Pittsburgh, Safar reached out to him. Safar's daughter had died of an asthma attack following transportation to the hospital without provision of care en route, and he had previously worked on emergency pre-hospital care, including the development of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advocating its use by laypeople. He offered his ideas on how a new standard of care could be provided by the new ambulance service. His ideas included intense paramedic training and improved ambulance design. Hallen contacted Freedom House Enterprises to help recruit paramedics for the new ambulance service. At that time, Freedom House Enterprises worked on civil rights projects including voter registration and organizing NAACP meetings as well as offering job training and assistance with job searches to Black Pittsburghers. Freedom House agreed to partner on the ambulance program. Recruitment and Training The first cohort of Freedom House Ambulance Service recruits consisted of 25 men recruited from The Hill, a low income, predominantly Black neighborhood. At the time, local media referred to residents of the neighborhood as the \\"unemployables,\\" and the recruits included men who had suffered long-term unemployment. Half of the recruits had not graduated high school. Some had criminal records, including felonies. The recruits also included veterans of the Vietnam War. Dr. Peter Safar designed and implemented the paramedics' training, a 32-week, 300 hour course that included anatomy, physiology, CPR, advanced first aid, nursing, and defensive driving. Those who had not completed high school were helped in completing their GEDs. Operation and Legacy The Freedom House Ambulance Service program began in 1967, and started officially operating in 1968 with two ambulances. Prior to receiving their own ambulances, the Freedom House paramedics were pressed into service to help people injured during the King assassination riots in 1968, riding along with police on ambulance duty. The city contracted with Freedom House Ambulance Service to handle emergency transportation in the downtown area and some predominantly black neighborhoods. They came to be known for the high standard of care they provided and were sometimes specifically requested by callers over the police ambulance service. Freedom House Ambulance Service responded to almost 5,800 in their first year, and transported more than 4,600 patients, primarily in African-American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. According to data collected by Dr. Safar, the paramedics saved 200 in their first year in operation. Where slow service to Black neighborhoods by the police ambulance service had been a point of tension, the Freedom House paramedics had a response time of less than ten minutes in nearly all cases. In 1975, Nancy Caroline became the medical director of Freedom House upon being recruited by Dr. Safar. She arranged ongoing training for the ambulance crews in such unprecedented areas as intubation, cardiac therapy, and I.V. drug therapy. The training Dr. Caroline provided would become the basis for the first paramedic curriculum, written by Caroline and adopted by the federal government in 1975. The data and studies conducted by Caroline shaped EMS practices for Magen David Adom. The Freedom House paramedics' relationships with the communities they served also aided in their effectiveness. According to one documentary maker to who chronicled their history: During a deadly surge in heroin use, the paramedics were able to contact local drug dealers and provide information on identifying signs of an overdose. The paramedics also notified them that they would provide medical assistance in case of emergencies without legal repercussions for those who sold or used the drugs. This effort was followed by a dramatic drop in fatal overdoses in the city. The Freedom House Ambulance Service became a model across the U.S. and internationally. Freedom House was awarded a major grant to develop the first national standards for paramedics. Miami, Los Angeles, and Jacksonville would all follow the Freedom House model. Additionally, the ambulance designed by Dr. Safar and proved through use by the Freedom House paramedics were adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the official standard. Despite these successes, the Freedom House paramedics faced racism from hospital staff and patients. The paramedics were sometimes assumed by hospital staff to be orderlies and were asked to mop the floor. White patients were often surprised by or resentful of black paramedics, and would sometimes refuse to be touched or helped by them. Conflict with Police When the Freedom House Ambulance Service was contracted to handle ambulance service in parts of Pittsburgh, some police felt that Freedom House had taken a job that was rightfully theirs. Police dispatchers would often refuse to contact Freedom House to dispatch them to emergencies that were within Freedom House's areas of responsibility. Freedom House staff began listening in on police radio frequencies to get news of emergencies within their own purview, then speed to the site of the incident, hoping to arrive before the police van. Sometimes the police would threaten to arrest the paramedics unless they turned response to an incident over to the police officers. Conflict with the Mayor Opponent of the Freedom House Ambulance Service, Peter F. Flaherty became Mayor in 1970. The mayor opposed public/private partnerships, believing services paid for by the city should be directly overseen by it. Phil Hallen of the Falk Fund stated that he believed racism was also a factor in Flaherty's opposition to the service. Op-eds printed at the time accused the mayor of trying to eliminate the ambulance service to pander to the police union. Dr. Safar echoed this view, stating ‚Äúracial prejudices with white police officers eager to maintain control of ambulances city-wide‚Äù were the cause of efforts to end Freedom House's ambulance services in the city. Freedom House Ambulance Service's request to expand their contract with the city to cover additional parts of the city was denied by the mayor, despite their strong record. This denied them the chance to serve more affluent neighborhoods in which they would likely have been more able to collect the fees they charged for ambulance service. During Flaherty's time as Mayor, the city began providing payment for the ambulance contract late, and cut its portion of the ambulance service's operating budget by 50%. The Mayor also signed an ordinance barring the use of ambulance sirens in the downtown area, with noise complaints given as the reason. This slowed the paramedics when transporting patients to hospitals as well as their response time, allowing the police to reach more calls before them. In 1974, the Mayor announced plans for a citywide ambulance system to be staffed by police officers trained as paramedics. Faced with resistance from city council member Eugene DePasquale, the mayor agreed to fund the Freedom House Ambulance Service contract for one more year. At the end of the year, the Mayor then announced the creation of a citywide ambulance service to be staffed by non-police paramedics and the end of the contract with Freedom House. Closure of Freedom House Ambulance Service The Freedom House Ambulance Service closed on Oct. 15, 1975. All of the paramedics initially hired to staff the new city ambulance service which succeeded it were white. Then the previous medical director of the Freedom House Ambulance Service accepted a position as medical director of the new city ambulance service on the conditions that the Freedom House paramedics and dispatchers also be hired and that Freedom House ambulance crews be kept together. While the Freedom House paramedics were hired, their crews were broken up, in violation of the agreement. Those with criminal records were fired. Pass/fail exams were instituted, covering materials the Freedom House paramedics had not been taught, resulting in the dismissal of many. Most of those remaining were reassigned to non-medical or non-essential work. Many were placed in positions overseen by white employees with less experience. Of the 26 Freedom House employees who joined the city ambulance service, only half remained a year later. Ultimately, only five remained with the city ambulance service, and only one was promoted into a leadership position. In the late 90s, 98% of Pittsburgh‚Äôs paramedic program were white.

The news of the incident went viral on social media and received widespread condemnation. Various justice campaigns and mass protests were organised throughout the country in the subsequent days and months to put pressure on the government and the police. On 20 August, Kanchanpur District Police Office had presented a suspect. However, locals refused to accept him as the culprit and demanded his release, accusing the police of framing him. Panta's body had been found stripped bare, and the autopsy concluded that she had been raped and cause of death cited as \\"throttling leading to asphyxia and death\\". The first investigation carried out by the local police and a team from the Crime Investigation Bureau (CIB) drew widespread criticism for its methods and conduct. Incident On Thursday, 26 July 2018, a ninth-grade school student, Nirmala Panta of Bhimdattanagar-2, left her home to study at her friend's (family name: Bam). MyRepublica reported that she went to Bam's, one and a half kilometres away from her home, at around 11a.m., and spent three hours there. She left at around 3p.m. but did not reach back home. Panta's family attempted to file a missing person's complaint at the local police station but were instructed to return the next morning. On Friday, 27 July 2018, Panta's dead body was found naked in a waterlogged sugarcane field in Nimbukheda, Bhimdattanagar-18, about 500metres from Bam's house. Investigation Panta's body was discovered after her bicycle was spotted in the sugarcane field by the side of the road. Based on preliminary investigation, the local police stated that she was murdered after being raped. The CIB (Crime Investigation Bureau) team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Angur G.C. began the investigation upon reaching Kanchanpur, four days after the incident. Kanchanpur Police and the CIB team named a 41-year-old local man, who had previously served a nine-year jail sentence for the murder of his brother-in-law, as the suspect. Police claimed that he had confessed to the crime multiple times under interrogation. He was released on 12 September after his DNA did not match samples from the victim. The locals, including Panta's family, launched violent protests alleging that he was innocent and maliciously framed by the police to protect the real culprits. The Bam sisters, Panta's friend and her sister, were arrested on 23 August 2018, based on protesters' demand; they were also released after legal consultation with District Attorney's Office. Panta's friend was released under the condition that she should present herself to the police upon demand while her sister was released under bail of Rs 30,000. Hari Prasad Mainali, Director General of Department of Prison Management, led a committee formed on 23 August 2018, by the Nepalese government to investigate the incident. Kanchanpur Police Chief, Superintendent of Police (SP) Dilli Raj Bista and Chief District Officer (CDO) Kumar Bahadur Khadka were summoned to Kathmandu, and were replaced by new officials. The incident also resulted in the suspension of DSPs Gyan Bahadur Sethi and Angur GC, Inspectors Ekendra Khadka and Jagadish Bhatta, and Assistant Sub-inspector (ASI) Ram Singh Dhami, by the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 17 September 2018, nine police officials were interrogated over their involvement in the investigation of the case, which included SP Dilli Raj Bista. However, Birendra K.C. quit the Home Ministry investigation panel citing threats from the group trying to undermine the investigation. As per the spokesperson of Nepal Police, SSP Shailesh Thapa Kshetri, DNA samples from SP Bista, his son, and the nephew of the mayor of Bhimdatta had been taken, together with the vaginal swab of the victim, for further investigation, but none of them matched. On 17 September 2018, a new investigative committee was set up by the Nepal Police under DIG (Deputy Inspector General of Police) Dhiru Basnyat to replace the former investigation committee led by SSP Uttam Subedi. On the same day, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli asserted that the local police had derailed the investigation. He speculated that either the police had faked the investigation or had committed mistakes in the investigation. The Panta family travelled 35 hours by bus to Kathmandu to draw the attention of the central government to the case. Oli assured the family that the perpetrator would be prosecuted and punished irrespective of his money, power, post, or influences. On 18 September 2018, the Kanchanpur police chief SP Kuber Kathayat admitted that there was no concrete evidence, and that the investigation was ongoing. The government had earlier set up an investigative panel due to the destruction of evidence by the local investigating police after the discovery of the body of the victim. DIG Dhiru Basnyat, who was appointed as the leading officer to a nine-member probe committee formed on 16 September 2018, for the new investigation, stated that the investigation would be begun anew. The Central Investigation Bureau, in December 2018, arrested one of Panta‚Äôs neighbours, from Kathmandu. One of his friends was also called to the bureau from Kanchanpur for interrogation. According to police sources, both Inspector General of Police Sarbendra Khanal and chief of the bureau Deputy Inspector General Niraj Bahadur Shahi personally interrogated both men. According to the police, they confessed to Panta‚Äôs rape and murder. However, neither of their DNAs matched the sample collected from Panta‚Äôs vaginal swab, and they were both released. They have since accused the police of torturing them, a charge the police has denied. DNA tests According to a report by the National Human Rights Commission, there were serious lapses in DNA collection, due to which a correct result could not be obtained. The DNA sample was collected into a test tube from three layers of a vaginal swab. But the commission report says that the extraction provided an insufficient sample of the DNA, which could also have been damaged. The report also found flaws in the scientific method applied to the DNA test. The commission recommended using methods of investigation other than DNA testing. Another technical committee to investigate DNA led by Jiwan Rijal also concluded that the said male component of sample taken from victim's body might be contaminated and may not be of the perpretator. It also questioned the validity of the lab's report that sperm was found in the sample. Reaction and protests The murder sparked public outrage on social media, and public demonstrations. Prime Minister Oli, in a meeting with the victim's parents and lawmakers of Sudurpashchim Pradesh, gave assurances that justice would be delivered. During public demonstrations in Bhimdattanagar, one boy died in clashes with police forces. =Public protests= * On Friday evening, 27 July 2018, the students of the Nepal Student Union demonstrated and shut down the Bazaar area of Bhimdatta, which resulted in a clash with security personnel. * On Saturday, 28 July 2018, the victim's family, together with local civilians, a women's rights organization, and sister organizations of the opposition party Nepali Congress, protested the failure of police to find the culprits and demanded security be established at the incident site.

She is the first woman to win at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) national event.  History  Cox was based in Whittier, California.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Carol Cox: NHRA's first class winner\\", written 4 May 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) \\"Women had been competing at local tracks for years -‚Äì often in a ‚ÄúPowder Puff\\" class\\", but never in a national event. At the time, of course, single women were denied credit cards, and all women were banned from jury duty. Cox followed her husband, Lloyd, an engineer who also raced Oldsmobile stockers (and got sponsorship from a car dealership in Whitier), into racing, encouraged by racer Peggy Hart after they met at the Santa Ana Drags. After switching to Pontiac in 1958, Lloyd had so many problems with the factory Hydramatic automatic transmission, he had to take night classes. In time, his skill at tuning them reached the point he opened his own shop, which helped finance Carol's racing. Her racing at Lions Dragstrip, which Mickey Thompson ran at the time, earned Lloyd a job working for him. Early in 1961, Lloyd bought a Ventura for the new season. The car was powered by a big-block V8 with Tri-Power, outfitted with headers from Lloyd's friend, Doug Thorley (later famous for building headers), and mounted Lakewood prototype shock absorbers in front. They spend months tuning the handling of the car before driving to Indianapolis to enter the U.S. Nationals. At the time, NHRA banned women from national events. Cox disagreed, as did a number of other women racers, notably Shirley Shahan, Roberta Leighton, Barbara Hamilton, and Paula Murphy (driver of the Miss STP Mustang FC.). Llyod drove the Ventura, instead. Cox responded by contacting the Los Angeles Herald Examiner (where her mother and father had once worked) and the Los Angeles Times, and her congressman. In 1962, under additional pressure from Peggy Hart (wife of track owner \\"Pappy\\" Hart) and Thompson, as well as fellow racers Shahan and Leighton, Cox was the first woman allowed to race at an NHRA national event. Cox drove the 1961 Ventura (which was not trailered) to Pomona for the Winternats. Cox won the title in S/SA (Super Stock, automatic transmission), making her the first woman ever to take a win at an NHRA national event; the 9 March 1962 issue of National Dragster recorded her as a \\"crowd favorite\\", with a winning pass of 13.06 seconds at , but says nothing about it being a first for a woman, dismissively calling her a \\"'powder puff' handler\\".Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Carol Cox: NHRA's first class winner\\", written 4 May 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018): text and photo. Ultimateracinghistory (retrieved 20 September 2018) credits Don Nicholson with the Stock Eliminator win. Some racers believe a class win is more difficult to achieve than a handicap (eliminator) win. The win attracted a lot of local media attention. Several months later, the family loaded the Ventura, and a Hayden Proffitt-built A/FX Pontiac Tempest (owned by Thompson), on their hauler and drove again to Indianapolis. Cox won S/SA again, at the Nationals, NHRA's most prestigious event. Lloyd also won, in A/FX. In subsequent competition, Cox was frequently accused of cheating.  Private life  Cox was married to Lloyd, and has a son, Steve, who has also been a successful racer, driving a '68 Camaro bracket racer capble of 10-second passes. Her granddaughter, Crista, also once raced in Jr. Dragster. In 2018, at age 90, Cox is suffering dementia.

The film stars Viola Davis, Mckenna Grace, Jim Gaffigan, Mike Epps, Charlie Shotwell, and Allison Janney. The film had its world premiere as the closing film of Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2019. It was released on January 17, 2020, by Amazon Studios. Plot In rural Wiggly, Georgia in 1977, a group of elementary-school misfits band together to form their own troop of Birdie Scouts. Led by spunky outcast Christmas Flint (Mckenna Grace), they infiltrate the Birdie Scout youth group in order to win a talent show. The winning Birdies will earn the right to have their voices included on the Voyager Golden Record, which Christmas believes will be heard by life in outer space, a connection her deceased mother nurtured. When they form the troop, the only number left unassigned in the state is zero; while the Birdie Troop leader Krystal Massey (Allison Janney) intends to assign \\"Troop Zero\\" to them as a slight, the girls, and one boy, take it as a good sign as it's the number representing infinity. Troop Zero requires a troop mother, and they find one in Christmas's father's secretary Rayleen (Viola Davis), who also has history with Mrs. Massey. To qualify to compete in the talent show, Troop Zero must first obtain one troop badge each. As they go about earning them, they learn more about themselves and each other. The troop enters the contest, performing an interpretive dance of David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpace Oddity\\". During the performance Christmas gets nervous and wets herself and the rest of the kids joins her to make her feel comfortable and the crowd laughs at them, but they carry on with their performance. In the end, they lose when the judges vote for the high-and-mighty Birdie Troop Five. Later that night, the representative from NASA joins the Troop Zero members during a meteor shower to record their voices to be transmitted into space as well. Hopeful and confident, Christmas wishes that the aliens are happy, that they're taking care of her mom, and that they have the same kind of friends she‚Äôs gained from the experience.

The minarets and the complex were built by Queen Gawhar Shad in 1417. Description The minarets are each 55 meters tall and resemble crooked chimneys of an old factory. The current minarets in Herat are the remains of 20 minarets of the former Musalla Complex. Nine towers survived the events of 1885, but the explosions had weakened them structurally, and they remained neglected over the next few years due to an unsettled political situation. No repairs or restorations were undertaken, and over time, four more towers collapsed due to structural weaknesses, earthquake and sheer decrepitude. Only five of the original twenty minarets survive today. History Musalla Minarets of Herat were built for the Musalla complex by Queen Gawhar Shad in 1417. The complex became an architectural masterpiece of the Islamic world. It was a huge spread of magnificent Islamic religious buildings consisting of a large mosque, Madrassa religious school and mausoleum buildings. The whole complex included 20 minarets which were adorned with tiled surfaces of beautiful intricate patterns and designs. In 1885, conflicting tensions between the British and Russian Empires has come to a head at the Panjdeh incident. During the incident, British engineers dynamited the complex to prevent the advancing Russians from using it for cover. Ultimately the crisis was resolved, and fighting never broke out, making the destruction unnecessary. Nine minarets and two mausoleums were spared destruction. However, an earthquake in 1931 destroyed two more minarets. Another minaret fell in another earthquake in 1951. The five ruined Musalla Minarets of Herat and 2 mausoleums are the only remnants today of a once magnificent architectural complex.

Prior to research on the work, Judge's background in Catholicism included education at Catholic schools Georgetown Preparatory School and Catholic University of America. Judge's previous books, including Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk and God and Man at Georgetown Prep chronicled his time at Catholic school. In A Tremor of Bliss Judge argues that the sexual revolution in 1960s United States resulted in a decline in American values which previously had been rooted in Christian theology. He criticizes abortion, birth control, pornography, and sexual liberation. Judge advocates a return to a religious morality to combat what he views as evils in society and inappropriate attitudes towards sexuality in the U.S. Judge's work received reviews in The Washington Times and First Things. Writing for The Washington Times, Jeremy Lott observed that A Tremor of Bliss served as a form of confessional about the author's personal life. First Things called the book, \\"An insightful history of the rise of contraception in the last century\\". Contents summary A Tremor of Bliss recounts the author's experiences in Catholic school during the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, he describes his time at Georgetown Preparatory School during his secondary education and how they approached sex education. Judge writes that his sex education teacher, Bernie Ward, went on to move to San Francisco and lead a talk show focusing on left-wing politics. noting that \\"Ward would also be arrested and convicted for sending pornographic images of children over the Internet.\\" Judge recalls that in the initial lecture about sex education Ward gave an assignment to read about feminism and sexual activity written by Betty Friedan. Judge criticized Ward for de-emphasizing virtuous religious values and embracing liberal ideas about sex and women's bodies. Judge argues that liberalism has encouraged a society embracing pornography, which he says is a danger to American culture. Judge cites his own Catholic school background to discuss the broader topic of sex education and its impact on him as a youth. He criticizes American sexual mores including hookup culture, abortion, and the sexual revolution in the United States. and criticizes baby boomers, an age group to which he belongs. Judge examines why, in his view, the sexual revolution in 1960s United States led to a decline in American values and an exodus from religious conservatism. He cites lyrics from contemporary rock and roll music to argue his point about the decrease in virtues in American society. Judge discusses the impact of musicians, including Louis Armstrong and Justin Timberlake, on American society. A Tremor of Bliss presents a chronology of birth control in the United States. He discusses the leadership roles in the birth control movement of Margaret Sanger, and sexual attitude changes in American society as furthered by the research of Alfred Kinsey. The author discusses the encyclical Humanae vitae written by Pope Paul VI and its attempts to argue a return to traditional Catholic values regarding sexuality. Judge recounts the history of moral theologian Charles Curran. Pope John Paul II is featured in a hagiographic fashion as a protagonist of the book. Judge recounts Theology of the Body by John Paul II, and argues that it is a model for how Catholic teachings can be incorporated into American societal views on sex. Judge also extols the views of some other Christian theological writers including Hans Urs von Balthasar and Dietrich von Hildebrand. Judge heavily criticizes the views of Catholic commentators Andrew Sullivan and E.J. Dionne. Judge subsequently states that he supports same-sex marriage in the United States. The author recounts intimate details from his own sexual history to illustrate his points in A Tremor of Bliss. He states that he engaged in frequent sexual activity, and describes a girlfriend whom he refers to as Ellen, and relates how Ellen discovered she was pregnant by the author, and had an abortion without first informing him. Judge discusses the impact of this on him. At first he says the impact was minimal, due to his liberal sex education as taught by Ward at Georgetown Preparatory School. This informed him that condom use was encouraged, and that the anti-abortion movements was akin to a form of fascism. He recounts that he cried when he heard about the abortion. He describes her choice as a disaster and a catastrophe tied to his narcissism and his sexual liberalism. A Tremor of Bliss argues for a counterrevolution rooted in Catholic beliefs to serve as a counter to the original sexual revolution in the United States. Judge criticizes what he views as a liberal attitude towards sexuality in the United States, and believes Catholic education can serve as a counter-balance to these. Composition and publication Prior to writing A Tremor of Bliss, Judge had worked as a journalist in his early twenties. He was a freelance writer in 1989 in the Washington, D.C. area. Judge received his bachelor of arts degree from Catholic University of America in 1990. By 1990 he had become a contributor to The Progressive, In These Times and Sojourners. Judge briefly taught at Georgetown University but left in the 1990s. Before publishing A Tremor of Bliss, Judge's previously published books included: Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, If It Ain't Got That Swing, Damn Senators, and God and Man at Georgetown Prep. By August 2008, Judge had contracted with Doubleday with plans to publish A Tremor of Bliss in 2009, under the planned title of A Tremor of Bliss: Sex and the American Catholic Church. A Tremor of Bliss was first released in a print format, in hardcover edition, in 2010. An eBook edition was released the same year. Judge led a discussion forum in 2010 on themes in A Tremor of Bliss, at the Catholic Information Center in Washington, D.C. By September 2010, A Tremor of Bliss had reached the \\"Catholic Bestsellers\\" printed in Publishers Weekly. Critical reception A Tremor of Bliss received a review from Jeremy Lott in The Washington Times, who said \\"Some authors try to separate themselves from their arguments. Mr. Judge's books tend toward the confessional.\\" Lott's review concluded, \\"Judge proposes a Catholic sexual counterrevolution, though he doesn't want to call it that. What he clearly does want is U.S. Catholic education to play a vital role in countering the current almost-anything-goes culture.\\" First Things contributor Matthew Kenefick wrote in his review of A Tremor of Bliss, \\"An insightful history of the rise of contraception in the last century provides the most valuable material in A Tremor of Bliss.\\" Kenefick recommended the book, concluding, \\"A Tremor of Bliss is a book well worth reading from an author unafraid of showing some 'attitude.'\\" References Further reading * Stephen J.

The book focuses on baseball players Judge and Walter Johnson, detailing how they took the Washington Senators to win the 1924 World Series. The book cites baseball statistics to argue that Judge was on a par with the skills of Mickey Mantle, and argues he should be included in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Damn Senators received a positive reception from multiple publications. Contents summary Damn Senators chronicles the Major League Baseball career of Joe Judge, grandfather of author Mark Gauvreau Judge. Judge played in the position of first baseman for the Washington Senators. He was with the team from 1915 through 1932. The author discusses how the baseball player was the inspiration for the character Joe from the novel by Douglass Wallop that was adapted into the play Damn Yankees. The title of the book is a reference to Damn Yankees. Joe Judge and his father at the 1924 World Series During his era, Judge was regarded as among both the top players for his position as first baseman, and also as a fielder. Judge had among the best fielding average in Major League Baseball. His batting average over a twenty- year career was .298, exactly the same numeric garnered by Mickey Mantle over his career of 18 years. The author cites these baseball statistics to argue that Judge should be included in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Walter Johnson is described in the book as an excellent baseball pitcher from Idaho who was respected for his genuine and good-natured qualities both on and off the baseball field. The author recounts the baseball pitcher's August 7, 1907 first game with the Washington Senators. They were matched by the Detroit Tigers, who claimed player Ty Cobb. Johnson was able to disguise his pitches so they appeared initially to be slower, when in actuality they surprised batters with their speed. The Detroit Tigers were impressed by Johnson's pitching skills in his first game as a rookie baseball pitcher. Cobb is described in the work as utilizing a tactic to injure other baseball players during the game. Cobb maintained a strategy of sharpening the cleats on his shoes and then sliding into bases at an angle such as to hurt the players on the opposing team. Prior to a match with the Washington Senators, Cobb is depicted in the book as marching over to their baseball dugout and prominently sharpening his cleats in front of the opposing players. The author writes that Judge noticed this provocation, and threatened Cobb with a baseball bat and a potential trip to the hospital, leading Cobb to cease his behavior. Damn Senators details the successful 1924 World Series win by the Washington Senators, assisted by Judge and Johnson. Earlier in the season, in September, President of the United States Calvin Coolidge had invited the Washington Senators to the White House and instructed them he hoped to be a spectator at the World Series in Washington, D.C. During the season the team would go on to beat Babe Ruth with the New York Yankees. The author recounts for the reader key moments in the World Series held at Griffith Stadium. Both the first and last games of the series lasted 12 innings long. The author describes Johnson's role helping to win the game during the seventh game of the series, in the 12th inning of the game. Bucky Harris played for the Washington Senators and made his solitary home run in his professional baseball experience. This home run caused the spectators to stand and cheer, including President Coolidge. The game was won by the Washington Senators against the New York Giants. After their defeat, the New York Giants were respectful to their opposing players. One player for the New York Giants remarked that divine intervention helped Johnson win the game, due to his reputation for kindness towards others. Johnson and Cobb would later go on to develop a friendship. Composition and publication Prior to writing Damn Senators, Judge had worked as a journalist in his early twenties. He was a freelance writer in 1989 in the Washington, D.C. area. Judge received his bachelor of arts degree from Catholic University of America in 1990. By 1990 he had become a contributor to The Progressive, In These Times and Sojourners. Judge briefly taught at Georgetown University but left in the 1990s. Before publishing Damn Senators, Judge had written prior books including: Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk (1997), and If It Ain't Got That Swing (2000). Judge's grandfather and the inspiration for Damn Senators died in 1963, the year prior to the author's birth. Judge recalls in a piece for The New York Times, being pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction by attendees at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium when his grandfather was added to the Hall of Stars for Washington, D.C. sportspeople on October 21, 1990. Damn Senators was first published in hardcover format in 2003. It was released in an eBook format the same year. The book was subsequently published in a paperback edition in 2004. An eBook was released for that edition as well. Judge subsequently published other books including God and Man at Georgetown Prep (2005), and A Tremor of Bliss: Sex, Catholicism, and Rock 'n' Roll (2010). Critical reception The Wall Street Journal wrote that Judge \\"so nicely captured\\" the \\"glory of Washington baseball\\" in Damn Senators. The Boston Globe journalist Michael Kranish was interviewed on Weekend Edition for NPR in 2004, and highlighted Judge's book Damn Senators among his favorite summer reading picks. He commented about his favorite portion of Judge's book, \\"My favorite part of Damn Senators was learning who Joe Judge was\\". Kranish explained further, \\"He's before my time but it gave me a peek into baseball and that time. I love to read a book that puts you in a time and place and this certainly did that.\\" The Boston Herald recommended the work among other similar sports-themed monographs to place on a \\"baseball bookshelf\\". The newspaper called it, \\"A slim but satisfying memoir of the author's grandfather, long-ago Washington Senators first baseman Joe Judge.\\" The Weekly Standard wrote of the author's description of 1924: \\"Mark Gauvreau Judge, has beautifully captured the excitement and intensity of that season in Damn Senators.\\" Human Events wrote of the book, \\"Any book that re- creates the glory days of the Washington Senators (there were so few), salutes the greatness of Walter Johnson and tells the overlooked story of the author's grandfather, first baseman Joe Judge, is worth writing about. In Damn Senators, Mark Gauvreau Judge accomplishes all three.\\" A book review in April 2003 in The Washington Times wrote, \\"Judge does a nice job recapturing the excitement of the World Series\\". The book review criticized Judge's work for poor research leading to a few minor inaccuracies. The review concluded, \\"This thin volume may be of some interest to historians studying the formerly woebegone Washington Senators drive to the franchise's only World Series championship in 1924.\\" A subsequent book review in November 2003 by The Washington Times called it an \\"evocative\\" work. The second book review by The Washington Times wrote, \\"Judge has an interesting story to tell, one he learned from his father, who presumably had it from his father, Joe Judge. It's not in any standard Cobb biography.\\" The book review commented of Judge's writing style, \\"Judge's main account, the 1924 World Series, is one of baseball's great stories.\\" References Further reading  * Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:American biographies Category:American non-fiction books Category:Baseball books Category:Books by Mark Judge Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) ","title":"Damn Senators"},{"id":"58528675","text":"The Beckenbach Book Prize, formerly known as the Mathematical Association of America Book Prize, is awarded to authors of distinguished, innovative books that have been published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA).

The front bumpers and rear body side were painted in red-white slanting stripes. Production of this light utility truck was flourishing until 1969, when company started retooling and introduction of new technologies. However, production of this model continued until 1976. Legacy Zastava 615 and Zastava 620 earned somewhat a cult status in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. This truck had significant appearance in the cult Yugoslav TV series Kamiond≈æije (Truckers).

An initial period of bipartisan support and praise for the selection of former FBI director Robert Mueller to lead the Special Counsel investigation gave way to some degree of partisan division over the scope of the investigation, the composition of the investigative teams, and the results achieved. While initially enjoying bipartisan support, the special counsel investigation became subject to criticism by Trump and his surrogates in the conservative media within months, with Sean Hannity eventually proposing a \\"deep state\\" conspiracy theory. Several allegations of investigators' misconduct have been raised and were almost immediately debunked, including supposed unlawful wire-tapping of Trump Tower during the campaign, unmasking of Trump associates on intelligence intercepts, FISA court alleged abuse against Carter Page detailed in the Nunes memo, the alleged installation of a mole in the Trump campaign, and the FBI being denied to forensically analyze the DNC servers.  Initial bipartisan support  Mueller's appointment to oversee the investigation immediately garnered widespread support from Democrats and from some Republicans in Congress. Senator Charles Schumer (D‚ÄìNY) said, \\"Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.\\" Senator Dianne Feinstein (D‚ÄìCA) stated, \\"Bob was a fine U.S. attorney, a great FBI director and there's no better person who could be asked to perform this function.\\" She added, \\"He is respected, he is talented and he has the knowledge and ability to do the right thing.\\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R‚ÄìUT) tweeted that \\"Mueller is a great selection. Impeccable credentials. Should be widely accepted.\\" Much Republican support in Congress was lukewarm: Rep. Peter T. King (R‚ÄìNY) said \\"It's fine. I just don't think there is any need for it.\\" Republican former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich tweeted that Mueller is a \\"superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity,\\" but less than a month later he tweeted \\"Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair.\\" Former United States Attorney Preet Bharara wrote of the team that \\"Bob Mueller is recruiting the smartest and most seasoned professionals who have a long track record of independence and excellence\\". Former special prosecutor Ken Starr, who had investigated Bill Clinton during the Clinton administration, said that the team was \\"a great, great team of complete professionals\\". Attorney George T. Conway III, husband of Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, wrote an article defending the constitutionality of the Mueller Investigation. = Conservative opposition = Some conservatives, including political commentators Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, stated that Mueller should be dismissed and the investigation closed. Christopher Ruddy, the founder of the right-leaning Newsmax, and a friend of Trump, stated that the president has considered firing Mueller. Conservatives, especially Trump himself, have promoted a counter-narrative claiming that, for example, members of Mueller's team were \\"all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton\\" (PolitiFact rated this \\"Mostly False\\"). and that the investigation was the work of the \\"deep state\\".  Opposition to the investigation  Throughout 2017 and 2018, Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have promulgated a series of false narratives to assert that the FBI, Justice Department and Mueller investigation have been engaged in an elaborate, corrupt conspiracy against Trump. Among other things, Trump has characterized the Mueller investigation as a \\"rigged Russia witch hunt,\\" while prominent Trump supporter Sean Hannity has described it as \\"the biggest corruption scandal in American history.\\" On May 29, 2018, Trump went so far as to assert that the Mueller investigation intended to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections, an accusation Hannity reinforced on his Fox News show that night, saying Mueller \\"wants to derail many pro-Trump Republicans in the midterms.\\" In a two-minute monologue that same day, Fox News anchorman Shepard Smith flatly debunked that assertion and a number of other Trump narratives, saying \\"you laugh at them because there's almost nothing else you can do.\\" Amid concerns that Trump might attempt to halt the investigation by having Mueller dismissed, some members of Congress have supported a bipartisan bill designed to protect Mueller. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on April 17, 2018, that such a bill was not necessary and he would not allow it to come to the Senate floor for a vote. Nevertheless, the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley announced on April 19, 2018, that his committee would vote on the measure the following week. The bill cleared the committee on April 26, with four Republicans joining all ten Democrats in a 14-7 vote, but McConnell repeated he would not bring the bill to the floor for a vote. = Administration actions against investigation = Trump reportedly asked White House Counsel Donald McGahn in April 2017 to call acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente‚Äîwho was supervising the Russia probe at the time, before Mueller's appointment‚Äîand get him to persuade Comey to announce that Trump was not personally under investigation. McGahn made the call but failed to convince Boente that Comey should make the statement. In June 2017, Trump reportedly tried to fire Mueller, according to several independent accounts published in January 2018. The reports said that Trump told McGahn to fire Mueller; that McGahn refused, saying that to do so would have a catastrophic effect on Trump's presidency; and that Trump then backed off. The New York Times reported that McGahn said he would resign rather than carry out the order, while CNN said McGahn did not directly threaten to resign, and Fox News said Trump was persuaded not to carry out the action by McGahn and other aides. The New York Times report said that Trump cited three conflicts of interest on Mueller's part to justify the dismissal: a years-old dispute over fees at Trump National Golf Club; the fact that Mueller had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and the fact that Mueller had been interviewed to return as FBI Director the day before he was appointed special counsel. According to CNN, another reason Trump wanted to fire Mueller was Trump's perception that Mueller was close friends with Comey, although others have described them as professional acquaintances from having simultaneously worked in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush presidency. In August 2017, Trump said he had never thought about firing Mueller, and by December 2017 he had denied it twice more; in that time period his lawyers and advisers also issued five similar denials. By January 2018, Trump and his surrogates had denied that he had considered firing Mueller a total of eight times. Trump dismissed the January 2018 The New York Times story as \\"fake news\\". McGahn was interviewed by Mueller's investigators on November 30, 2017. Also in June 2017, Trump reportedly instructed his aides to start a campaign for his administration and his Republican allies to discredit potential witnesses in the investigation, including FBI officials Andrew McCabe, Jim Rybicki, and James Baker. The three men had been identified by Comey as his confidants. The instruction was reported in January 2018 by Foreign Policy. Trump's lead attorney John Dowd disputed the accuracy of the report. In early December 2017 Trump sought to fire Mueller, according to an April 2018 report in The New York Times, but stopped after learning the news reports he based his decision on were incorrect. In January 2018, CNN reported that Trump was unhappy with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation. Trump reportedly talked about wanting to fire Rosenstein and proposed firing him, before being persuaded otherwise by his advisers. In April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump for the first time spoke openly about firing Mueller, saying that \\"many people\\" had advised him to do so and \\"We'll see what happens.\\" Under Department of Justice regulations, that authority can only be exercised by Rosenstein, the DOJ official in charge of the special counsel investigation, but White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believes he has the power to do it directly, although he is not currently acting to do so. According to a Washington Post tally, by August 21 Trump had fired or threatened over half of the officials with leadership roles in the investigation. Speaking to Reuters on that date he said,‚ÄúI can go in, and I could do whatever ‚Äî I could run it if I want. But I decided to stay out. I‚Äôm totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be. So far, I haven‚Äôt chosen to be involved.‚Äù = Donald Trump attacks on investigation = On March 17, 2018, Trump appeared to abandon his attorneys' advice to avoid directly criticizing the Mueller investigation, tweeting that the \\"Mueller probe should never have been started\\" and that it was a \\"WITCH HUNT!\\" He also claimed that \\"there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.\\" The next day, he questioned how \\"fair\\" it was that \\"the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans\\". Trump did not note that Mueller himself is a Republican, as is the man who appointed him, Rod Rosenstein‚Äîwho was appointed by Trump. This was the first time he had criticized Mueller by name, alarming many prominent Republicans, who cautioned Trump not to criticize Mueller or give any appearance that he was contemplating having Mueller dismissed; they warned of dire repercussions if he did. Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb later stated that the president \\"is not considering or discussing\\" firing Mueller. Trump also said that the \\"witch hunt\\" that began \\"right after I won the nomination\\" is \\"an attack on our country in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for.\\" In May 2018, Trump tweeted that the special counsel probe, led by \\"13 Angry Democrats\\", was investigating him on \\"obstruction for a made up, phony crime\\". He declared that there was no obstruction, only him \\"fighting back\\". He maintained the \\"witch hunt\\" narrative throughout the Mueller investigation and into the 2019 impeachment inquiry. = By Trump's lawyers and allies = On December 16, 2017, Kory Langhofer, a lawyer for Trump for America, sent a letter to Congress alleging that Mueller's team had unlawfully acquired, via the GSA, tens of thousands of emails sent and received by thirteen senior members of the Trump transition team. The communications derived from the official governmental presidential transition team domain, \\"ptt.gov\\". On the following day, GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt stated that Trump's transition team had been explicitly advised at the time of the transition that all material passing through government equipment would be subject to monitoring and auditing, and would not be held back from law enforcement officers. A spokesman for Mueller's investigation, Peter Carr, also rejected Langhofer's claims, stating that the Trump transition emails were acquired appropriately through the criminal investigation process. On March 17, 2018, Trump's personal attorney, John Dowd, urged Rod Rosenstein to follow the \\"courageous example\\" of Sessions in dismissing Andrew McCabe and \\"bring an end\\" to the Mueller investigation. Dowd originally told the Daily Beast that he was speaking on behalf of the president, but later told CNN he was speaking only for himself. A source told CNN that Trump had not authorized the statement, but two sources told The New York Times that Dowd was speaking at Trump's urging. During the week of March 19, 2018, Trump hired the law firm diGenova & Toensing, headed by Joseph diGenova and his wife and law partner Victoria Toensing. Both are longtime Republican activists, having appeared on Fox News on numerous occasions to criticize Democrats, most notably Bill and Hillary Clinton. In recent weeks diGenova has advanced the narrative that a \\"deep state\\" conspiracy is attempting to subvert Trump. In January 2018, diGenova said on Fox News, \\"There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime. Make no mistake about it: A group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\\" Fox News reported that Toensing had recently represented Trump associates Mark Corallo, Sam Clovis, and Erik Prince, and that Corallo, Clovis, and Trump signed waivers of any potential conflicts of interest. The White House announced later that week that diGenova and Toensing would not be hired as part of the special counsel legal team, but might assist Trump in other legal matters. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow cited conflicts of interest, while two sources told The New York Times that Trump hadn't established personal rapport with diGenova and Toensing. Several conservative sources sided with Trump to embrace and promote the Spygate conspiracy theory, including the Fox & Friends talk show and political commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity for Fox News, the website Breitbart, and also radio show host Rush Limbaugh. Meanwhile, Infowars host Alex Jones took credit for coining the \\"Spygate\\" term. Asked on whether the promotion of the conspiracy Spygate theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said on May 27 that the investigators \\"are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president ... it is for public opinion\\" on whether to \\"impeach or not impeach\\" Trump. The New York Times reported on July 12, 2018, that the White House had ordered that classified information about informant Stephan Halper be given to all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, beyond the tight access that had previously been granted to the Gang of Eight. The directors of national intelligence and the FBI both opposed the move. House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump ally, had requested the expanded access for weeks, while Democrats asserted it was an effort by Republicans to gain information they could use to undermine the Mueller investigation. It was reported in early September that Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said that the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege. According to Giuliani, Trump's personal legal team is already preparing a \\"counter-report\\" to refute the special counsel investigation's report. In a series of tweets on December 7, 2018, President Trump publicly announced and acknowledged that his legal team will be producing a counter report to Mueller's Investigation after they release their final report. Trump also elaborated in that same tweet by stating that an article produced by The Atlantic was fake news due to the article proclaiming that the Trump Administration did not have a response to the Mueller investigation's findings...\\"That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report.\\" Tt has been reported as early as July 2018 that a counter report was in the works. = By Congress = On July 26, 2017, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for a special counsel investigation into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy by James Comey, undue interference of Attorney General Loretta Lynch in that investigation, and the acquisition of Uranium One by the Russian state corporation Rosatom during Mueller's time as FBI director. Gaetz stated that he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of his alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and his allegedly close relationship with Comey, a probable person of interest in the proposed investigation. The resolution was referred to two House committees where it has remained as of February 21, 2018. On August 24, 2017, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Florida) added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would block funding from being used \\"for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015\\" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) immediately and terminated funding for the special counsel investigation 180 days after passage of the bill. Rep. DeSantis said that the DOJ order of May 17, 2017, \\"didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition.\\" House Republican leaders did not allow the amendment to proceed to the floor for a vote. On November 3, 2017, Gaetz introduced another resolution demanding Mueller's resignation as special counsel due to conflicts of interest, this resolution was co-sponsored by U.S. Representative from Arizona Andy Biggs and U.S. Representative from Texas Louie Gohmert; Arizona Representative Trent Franks co-sponsored the resolution on November 8, 2017. The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee where it has remained as of February 21, 2018. As a \\"sense of the House\\" resolution, its approval would not be legally binding upon Mueller. On February 2, 2018, the House Intelligence Committee with Trump's authorization released a memo written by committee chair Devin Nunes and staff. The Nunes memo, based on classified information, alleged that the FBI and Department of Justice \\"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\\" in October 2016 in seeking authorization for a wiretap on Carter Page, a former adviser to Trump's campaign. Before the memo's release, Trump told associates that it would discredit the investigation, and after its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo \\"totally vindicates\\" him. On February 24, 2018, the House Intelligence Committee with Trump's authorization released a redacted version of a memo from Adam Schiff, ranking Democratic member of the committee, as a response to the Nunes memo. The response contended the wiretaps were properly obtained and were warranted because Page had been assessed by intelligence agencies as \\"an agent of the Russian government,\\" adding that \\"Our extensive review of the initial FISA application and three subsequent renewals failed to uncover any evidence of illegal, unethical, or unprofessional behavior by law enforcement and instead revealed that both the FBI and DOJ made extensive showings to justify all four requests.\\" = By others = The New York Times reported on March 28, 2018, that the Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz would investigate accusations of wrongdoing surrounding the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, \\"amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel's investigation.\\" The announcement fell short of the demands of several Republican politicians and prominent Trump supporters such as Sean Hannity for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate. CNN reported on March 29, 2018, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had appointed John W. Huber, the United States Attorney for the District of Utah, to investigate this and other matters. In a letter to three Republican Congressional committee chairmen, Sessions said he would rely on Huber's findings to decide if a special counsel needed to be appointed. Huber had been investigating the matter for a time, but his involvement had not previously been disclosed. CNN reported that Huber is investigating \\"a cluster of Republican-driven accusations against the FBI,\\" which includes allegations that the FBI acted inappropriately in two matters involving Hillary Clinton, including her emails and the sale of Uranium One to a Russian-owned company. In Why Robert Mueller‚Äôs Appointment As Special Counsel Was Unlawful, Gary S. Lawson, the Philip S. Beck Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law, and Steven G. Calabresi, the Clayton J. and Henry R. Barber Professor of Law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, argue that Mueller's appointment was \\"unlawful\\" for three reasons: the Department of Justice is not authorized to appoint special counsels; the Attorney General is not authorized to appoint a special counsel; and the special counsel should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Support for the investigation A majority of American people and news media outlets have supported the investigation onto ties between Donald Trump and his associates with Russia and its affiliates. Media support from bipartisan, neutral and left-leaning outlets has maintained a consistent level of support for the investigation, even at times when it has been called into question, such as when opponents of the investigation accused it of bias when Peter Strzok was removed from Mueller's investigative team. Many existing media outlets have devoted considerable time to informing their readers and viewers on the realtime evolution of the investigation, including CNN, devoting an entire website to the investigation, and The Washington Post. Many late night show hosts have taken to defending the investigation through their comedy routines, including Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers and John Oliver. Due to the sheer volume and complexity of information and regularity of revelations being made public, coupled with public activity by the Trump White House, various podcasts have been set up to devote their focus on the investigation, including Mueller, She Wrote, Mueller Time and Gaslit Nation. Others have taken a now tangential or parallel approach, such as Slow Burn, which retells the impeachments of presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, and draws parallels to the prospect of impeaching Donald Trump, and Rachel Maddow's Bag Men, which retells the criminal activity of vice president Spiro Agnew, and the parallels between his attacks on the federal prosecutors investigating him while Nixon was being investigated for conspiracy relating to the Watergate scandal.  Post-report reactions  Following the release of Attorney General William Barr's summary of the findings of the completed special counsel investigation, Trump tweeted: \\"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION.\\" Barr had quoted the special counsel as writing that \\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him\\" on whether he had committed obstruction of justice. However, since the special counsel did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice, the decision moves up to the Attorney General. Barr concluded: \\"After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\\"  Polling  = 2017 = A May 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll showed that 81% of U.S. voters supported the special prosecutor's investigation. A June 2017 Associated Press‚ÄìNORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll asked U.S. adults whether the special counsel investigation could be fair and impartial: 26% were \\"extremely confident\\" or \\"very confident\\"; 36% were \\"moderately confident\\" and 36% were \\"not very confident\\" or \\"not at all confident.\\" The poll indicated that 68% of Americans were at least \\"moderately concerned\\" about inappropriate connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. A poll published in November 2017 by ABC News and The Washington Post found that 58% of Americans approved of Mueller's handling of his investigation, while 28% disapproved. It also indicated that half of Americans believed that President Trump was not co-operating with the investigation. A Quinnipiac poll published on November 15, 2017, suggested that 60% of Americans believed that Mueller's investigation was proceeding fairly, with 27% believing that it was not. The poll also found that 47% of respondents said that President Trump ought to be impeached if he were to dismiss Mueller. A December poll by Associated Press‚ÄìNORC indicated that four out of ten Americans believed that Trump had committed a crime in connection with Russia, with an additional three out of ten beyond that believing that he had acted unethically. It found that 62% of Democrats and 5% of Republicans believe that Trump acted illegally. It found that 68% of Americans believed that Trump was obstructing the investigation. 57% of respondents said that they were \\"extremely confident\\" or \\"moderately confident\\" that Mueller's investigation is fair. In another December poll from The Hill, 54% of respondents believe Mueller has a conflict of interest due to his relationship with James Comey. The poll also found 36% agreed Trump and his allies are getting harsher treatment from the special counsel than Clinton and her allies did during the FBI investigation into her handling of classified material.\\" The same poll found that 60 percent of voters say that \\"a comment to the FBI director that he should consider letting Flynn off the hook\\" is not enough to constitute obstruction of justice. = 2018 = A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released on February 26, 2018, showed that a 58% majority of registered voters say they have a lot or some trust in Mueller's investigation, while a 57% majority say they have little or no trust in Trump's denials. Further, 75% say they take the charges filed by Mueller seriously; most of them say they take them \\"very\\" seriously. That represents some shift in views over the past year. In a USA Today/Suffolk Poll in March 2017, 63% called it very or somewhat serious. A CBS poll released in May 2018 found that a majority of Americans, 53%, believe the investigation is politically motivated, although most agreed it should continue. The poll indicated most Republicans believe that Congress should take steps to end the investigation, while most independents and nearly all Democrats feel the investigation should be allowed to continue.

T. asteroides is a hyphal fungus with a characteristically yeast-like appearance due to the presence of slimy arthroconidia. Infections by this species usually respond to treatment with azoles and amphotericin B. History and taxonomy Trichosporon asteroides was isolated from lesion of male chin skin by Rinchin in Berne in 1926 and named in the genus, Parendomyces. T. asteroides was later reevaluated by Masao Ota and transferred to the genus Trichosporon as T. asteroides. Ota noted that its hyphae were more sparsely branched than other species in Trichosporon, and it lacked the ability to ferment glucose, maltose, sucrose and fructose. Molecular phylogenetic study has since supported the placement of T. asteroides in the genus Trichsporon. T. asteroides was determined to be conspecific with Fissuricella filamenta on the basis of DNA/DNA reassociation. Modern classifications support the affiliation of this species with the order Tremellales in the phylum Basidiomycota. Growth and morphology T. asteroides grows in a range of media including in the presence of the antifungal agent, cycloheximide. Colonies of T. asteroides grown on Sabouraud agar appear white in colour with a brain-like texture, reaching a diameter of 10 mm after 10 days growth at . Colonies have radially furrowed outer zone and matt appearance that is not powdery like the related species, T. asahii. Antibodies produced by infected patients can also be used to differentiate T. asahii and T. asteroides in disease. Weak growth is seen at but is absent at higher temperatures. T. asteroides can be distinguish with other relative species in the genus Trichosporon by its ability to utilize D-galactose, L-rhamnose, erythritol and L-arabinitol. Physiology and pathogenesis T. asteroides does not ferment glucose, maltose, sucrose or fructose, this is the common feature to all the species in Trichosporon. T. asteroides causes trichosporonosis, which mainly responsible for deep-seated, mucosa-associated, superficial, and systematic infections including blood. This species is one of the three most common Trichosporon species isolated in clinical settings. The fungus is sometimes recovered from specimens of blood, urine, and aspiration fluid, vaginal mucosa, male perigenital skin area, and catheters. The first record of this agent in a systemic infection involved a bloodstream infection. Some main types of latent infection can be raised are fungemia, urinary tract infections, peritonitis, endocarditis, arthritis, esophagitis, meningitis, brain abscess, splenic abscess, and uterine infections. Allergies and systemic infections can also be caused by this fungus particularly in immunosuppressed people. Recently, T. asteroides was implicated in a case of kerion celsi, a rare, highly inflammatory scalp infection seen mainly in children. This fungus is rarely encountered in zoonotic infections and has never been shown to cause disease un insects. However, T. asteroides was isolated from the multifocal, irregularly raised skin lesions on a female Bottle-Nosed Dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in Japan. In the absence of cultures and molecular biological analysis, the agent was initially suspected to be Paracoccidioides ceti, a worldwide causative agent of Paracoccidioidomycosis in dolphins. Treatment Azole antifungals are often used as a front-line therapy in trichosporonosis. Resistance to amphotericin, flucytosine, fluconazole, and itraconazole have been described. Echinocandins, as a group, are ineffective against Trichosporon species. Triazoles show better in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity than amphotericin B, while voriconazole also has excellent in vitro activity against Trichosporon asteroides. Combination therapy regimens such as voriconazole and amphotericin B are also effective in serious infections. Fluconazole has been used successfully in subcutaneous and deep infections.

The model is based on predictable pollution patterns to estimate concentrations in a particular area. This requires some linkage to the environmental characteristics of the area, especially characteristics that influence pollutant emission intensity and dispersion efficiency. LUR modeling is a useful approach for screening studies and can substitute for dispersion models given insufficient input data or dispersion models. Multiple regression equations are used to describe the relationship between sample locations and environmental variables, often relying on geographic information systems (GIS) to collect measurements. This results in an equation that can predict pollution concentrations at unmeasured locations based on data for the predictor variables in specific locations. A raster graphic image of the area is generated and intersected with area-level population data to formulate the exposure distribution. Application examples =Health impact assessments= LUR models were originally developed to assess the exposure resulting from air pollution as a result of vehicular traffic, but they have since been expanded to cover air pollution epidemiology. The EPA has an ongoing grant for these types of assessments, where they collect hourly updates across three major U.S. cities to study how pollution concentrations change over time and track health effects reported by those who live there.  Liaoning Province, China  A study incorporating annual satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations and five specific canyon indicators (building height, coverage ratio, shape coefficient, floor-area ration, and skyscraper-building ratio) was used to successfully enhance the LUR's modeling accuracy. The area picked for this study had been affected by rapid urbanization which resulted in serious environmental atmospheric pollution and measured a few key pollutants, in particular (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, NOx, CO, and O3).  Ontario, Canada  LUR was used to predict the concentration of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, and o-xylene (BTEX) concentrations in Ontario. 39 locations were monitored for 2 weeks to support LUR models to have predictor variables and best estimate BTEX concentrations.  Gothenburg, Sweden  A 20-year study examined urban pollution in Gothenburg (an urban area in Sweden) about the NO2 concentration. The results were accurate in the effects of altitude and traffic intensity on pollution in a certain region. The model was used to estimate outdoor concentrations in urban areas, but not accurate in less populated regions, such as islands or rural areas. Further development LUR can be expanded to encapsulate less studied areas with similar characteristics. = Mobile monitoring = Mobile monitoring is an alternative to traditional fixed-site measuring systems. Mobile monitoring enables good spatial coverage even with few monitoring devices. Mobile monitoring enables investigations given monetary constraints. = Additional prediction variables = Adding prediction variables can increase the acurracy and/or explanatory power of LUR models. Examples include holidays traffic variants and seasonal meteorological variations. = Geographically weighted models = The incorporation of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) into LURs involves applying a spatial weighting function to the spatial coordinates that divide a study area into various local neighborhoods. This can reduce the effects of spatial non-stationarity, a defect that occurs when variables form inconsistent relationships over large areas, misrepresenting data points as unchanging. Alternatives Alternatives to LUR include kriging, atmospheric dispersion modeling and Bayesian Maximum Entropy modeling.

It usually happens on the ground of a specific psychiatric condition. The term is derived from the action of Vincent van Gogh in 1888, cutting off his own ear, or a part of it, after a quarrel with fellow artist Paul Gauguin during one of his psychotic episodes. Sufferers may burn themselves, attempt to severely damage their genital organs (especially amputate their penis), castrate themselves, extract their own eyes, amputate their own hands, or commit suicide. Self-injury in children may be labeled with different diagnostic terms such as Lesch-Nyhan and Munchausen syndromes. Another medical condition for which the term is used, but only rarely, is when the vision turns yellow for a period of time as, for example, in digoxin toxicity. Van Gogh syndrome is, now, a synonym for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), where participants intentionally and repetitively inflict injuries on their bodies without suicidal intention and not social sanctioned. These injuries are not meant to cause lethal harm and range from biting, scratching, cutting to serious acts like mutilating reproductive parts. Self-injuring occurs quite commonly in children from 9‚Äì18 months, and is considered pathological in children beyond 3 years of age. NSSI is most prevalent in adolescents and patients with diagnosed psychological illnesses, however frequent incidents are also recorded among young adults. In the past, NSSI was thought of as symptoms that associated with many psychological conditions, not an entity by itself. With increasing reports of prevalence and causative origins, recently, NSSI has been classified as an independent syndrome that can co-occur with a variety of other mental conditions. The fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-5), published in 2013, has officially recognized NSSI as its own entity and updated diagnostic methods for patients with clinical symptoms for NSSI. NSSI patients usually use self-mutilation as a mean to relieve stress and negative feelings, often harbor thoughts of self-injure, repeat injuries, and experience satisfaction post-action. Although NSSI is often associated with suicidal attempts, there is a clear distinction between the two conditions. People who practice NSSI do not set death as their final goal. Severity of wounds may vary and some may end up needing medical attention, however, the purpose is never to cause lethal harm. Indeed, NSSI serves as several functioning outlets for participants, including negative and positive reinforcements.  Diagnostic  Because NSSI is associated with a wide range of psychological syndromes, like eating disorders, dissociative disorder, borderline personality, depressive disorders, and suicidal, it used to be regarded as manifesting symptoms of these conditions. Nevertheless, many cases have been reported where patients with NSSI were diagnosed without comorbidity of any other psychological dysfunctions. Thus, it is irrefutable that NSSI is a stand-alone syndrome with distinct symptoms and causes. The DSM-5 outlines 6 criteria that patients must qualify for diagnostic. # Criteria A: the person must be involved in at least 5 days of self-mutilation without suicidal intention in the past year. However, this number has been reported to be relatively low when compared to realistic rate for adolescents, which was 11 days in one year. # Criteria B: persons must commit self-injure behaviors due to interpersonal problems, whether it is to alleviate unpleasant feelings and stress from such problems, or to seek positive feelings and relief. Studies have shown that females tend to expect relief from negative feelings and stress more than males. # Criteria C: persons must be struggling from negative feelings and thoughts prior to NSSI, thoughts of NSSI are premeditated and constantly occupied in their minds. # Criteria D: self-injure behaviors must be not socially sanctioned or minor wounds. This means that tattoos, piercings, or scab-picking are not considered as NSSI. # Criteria E: NSSI-related emotional issues must be interfering with daily tasks like school/work relationships, or performances. # Criteria F: NSSI must not overlap other dysfunctional episodes from other mental conditions, like withdrawal symptoms from drug abuse or eating disorders, psychosis, delirium, or substance intoxication. This criteria serves to rule out any consequential characteristics of self-injury behaviors as result of these episodes.  Risk factors  Adolescents are the most prevalent age group for NSSI, the average age of onset is around 13‚Äì14 years old. Studies showed that adolescents are vulnerable to NSSI due to the sensitive transitional period in life that happens during adolescent years. NSSI is usually induced by stress and feelings of uncontrollable stress and anxiety, while adolescents and young adults face a wide range of challenging life events, different changes, along with limited mental control to protect them from self-harm decisions. Thus, a high percentage of NSSI participants admits to carrying out self-injure behaviors as a mean of coping mechanism. Adolescents also harbor external and internal factors that put them in the at- risk age group. External factors include childhood events, parenting condition, or peers. Children that went through childhood adversities are more prone to cognitive distortion that tend to permit NSSI behaviors. Severity of such adversities also play a major role in increasing risk for adolescents. Those who grew up with child maltreatment like physical/sexual or emotional abuse, household with drug-use problems, negligence, poverty, exposure to parental violence,... are more likely to develop psychopathology in later years. Women with NSSI tendency are shown to have experienced emotion negligence from both parents and insecure paternal bonding, while men with NSSI tendency are predicted to have gone through parental abandonment, mostly from father. Non physically abusive parenting can also place high susceptibility on adolescents. Parental control refers to when parents want to influence their child either by physical or emotional manipulation, while parental support implies behaviors that are encouraging, accepting, and supportive. Households with heavy use of parental control, and lack thereof of parental support, usually lead to high tendency of NSSI. Internal issues stem from emotional dysregulation and psychological distress also push individuals towards NSSI tendency. Inability to digest and process emotional situations can lead to improper or insufficient awareness and understanding of emotional responses. Misjudgment of emotional surroundings also result in outbursts that are beyond acceptable range of emotional response. Individuals that are under psychological distress also fall into the at-risk group due to constant heightened state of anxiety from demanding stressors and unregulated external stimuli. People with other existing psychological conditions like BPD, EDs, or other dissociative disorders may also develop NSSI. NSSI is often seen as a coping mechanism for patients that are suffering with stress and psychopathology.  Functions  An overwhelming amount of NSSI cases were reported in accordance to stress release intention. Most NSSI patients are associated with sadness, anxiety, depression, feeling of abandoned, and isolated, they often find themselves trapped in high amount of uncontrollable stress and emotional burden that are hard to endure; living quality is also negatively impacted. Inflicting physical wounds is an outlet to relieve unbearable distress, the act of cutting through skin is a mean to physically lesson the pain, and many have reported that feeling of satisfaction and goodness were perceived post-injury. Among other individuals, NSSI behaviors are also considered as a way to self-punish and self-directed anger. Other uses of NSSI include wanting to fit in, gaining attention, and alleviating emotional numbness. NSSI functions are classified into four sub-functions: automatic negative reinforcement, automatic positive reinforcement, social negative reinforcement, and social positive reinforcement. Automatic negative reinforcement aims to eliminate feeling of emotional numbness or negative feelings of emotional disturbances, automatic positive reinforcement seeks to gain any type of feelings, even pain, social negative reinforcement helps individuals get away from feeling peer pressure and being forced to do things against their wills, lastly, social positive reinforcement is done to attain attention, negative or positive. Overall, automatic negative reinforcement and automatic positive reinforcement prevail the other two methods, while automatic negative reinforcement is more common than automatic positive reinforcement. These findings correspond to popular utilization of NSSI as tool to alleviate negative stress. Individuals that participate in automatic positive reinforcement have higher risk for suicidal attempts. The desire to obtain certain feelings from self-mutilation tends to push those individuals towards higher frequency of self-harm repetition, along with desensitization to pain and elimination of fear towards suicidal thoughts.

Many accounts have shown that it has a global distribution, having been isolated in select soils as well as on feathers and other substrates with high keratin content. It has also been found in indoor dust of hospitals and houses in Kanpur, Northern India and as a common keratinophilic soil fungus in urban Berlin. This species has been associated with nail infections in humans as well as skin lesions and slower hair growth in guinea pigs. History and taxonomy Ctenomyces serratus was first discovered on a rotten, old feather by Eidam in 1880. When discovering it, Eidam observed different structures and assumed he was looking at different stages of growth of the fungus. However, in 1956 Benjamin revealed that Eidam's observations unintentionally included a species of Arthroderma. The fungus is a member of the family of Onygenaceae. The etymology of the species epithet \\"serratus\\" is derived from the Latin serra which means \\"saw\\" due to the saw-tooth appearance of peridial appendages. Structural appearance and physiology Its ascomata are orange-brown, rounded and measure approximately 100-350 Œºm in diameter, exclusive of its appendages. Its asci are hyaline and rounded, containing 8 lens-shaped, orange, ascospores, 7 Œºm in diameter. In addition, their peridial appendages are pale-orange and have a membranous inner layer with an outer layer of orange-brown, septate, thick-walled and prickly hyphae that form a highly ramified mesh-like peridium with anastamosing connections. With its teleomorphic stages being more commonly found, its anamorph state is absent or rare, having large amounts of arthroconidia. The conidial state has been treated in the form-genus, Chrysosporium. C. serratus is generally regarded to be heterothallic, only forming the sexual state when crossed with the compatible mating type; however, the possibility has been raised that it may in fact be homothallic. Notably, its appendages are roughened, tooth-like and between 100‚Äì150 Œºm in length with 5-11 cells. Growth is reliant on nitrogen sources that include the L configurations of the amino acids alanine, isoleucine, methionine, tyrosine and glycine. This species prefers neutral to slightly alkaline conditions. It can utilize fructose and is dependent on external sources of the B-vitamin, thiamine. One comparative study showed that its growth is only supported in amino acid mixtures and casein protein media. There has been suggestion that C. serratus may be able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Commonly used fungicides are active against this species, including: Benlate, Calix and Saprol. Habitat and distribution Ctenomyces serratus is world-wide in distribution and shows some degree of habitat overlap with other keratinophilic fungi in the families, Arthrodermataceae and Onygenaceae, due perhaps in part to its spread across political borders on feathered hosts. Literature reports document this species from 19 countries worldwide, with most specimens found in select soils, birds nests and animal excrements. A single case of its appearance in turkeys has been found as well. With most of its growth being on shed feathers due to its keratinophilic nature, this fungal species tends to grow wherever its host happens to lay shed feathers. Because of its strong association with migratory birds, its distribution includes a large variety of countries. For example, C. serratus has been found in hospitals and rooms in Northern India, in soil samples in Berlin and on hooves and horns in goats and sheep in Egypt. Human and animal health implications Ctenomyces serratus is not considered pathogenic to humans; however, skin lesions and inhibited hair growth have been found in guinea pigs while it can be an etiological agent in nail infections. In addition, a novel kappa opioid receptor binding inhibitor has been extracted from it. Its relevance to human health is based on Kappa opioid receptors, when highly activated, having negative effects that mimic those of depression, drug-seeking behaviour, and drug craving. As such, extracts of such inhibitory agents hold promise as potential sources of treatment for addressing drug-related dependence and addictions. This is mainly because these receptors are implicated in reward systems that lie at the root of addiction-related disorders.

It is one of the oldest churches in Kryvyi Rih.  History  = Foundation and early history = The church of the Nativity of the All-holy Theotokos in Kryvyi Rih was opened in 1886 by a local rural society as a prayer house. It was named for the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Saints Joachim and Anne. Celebration of this feast day on the 8th of September (the 21st of September in a new style) coincided in the folk calendar with the finishing of the main fieldworks and Harvest Thanksgiving. The street where the church was situated also was named after the Nativity of the Theotokos. The church belonged to the Shyroke deanery in the Kherson uyezd of the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire. A parish of the church included 250 houses in Kryvyi Rih and also 2 villages in the neighbouring Yekaterinoslav Governorate ‚Äì Shmakovo (Pokrovskoe) and Dubovaia Balka. It had nearly 2,700 people. The clergy of the church consisted of a priest and a cantor-reader. There were also a churchwarden and a parish guardianship (since 1893) that together helped to the clergy with economic business. One of the parsons ‚Äì priest Vladimir Babura ‚Äì was a famous homilist and publicist in the country. His articles and collections of sermons were published in Odessa, Kyiv, Moscow and St. Petersburg. Since 1897 there was a grammar school at the church that later received the status of a parochial school. There pupils studied Russian, calligraphy, arithmetic, religion, Slavonic reading and singing. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were 50 children studying at the school ‚Äì 30 boys and 20 girls. = Soviet period = With the beginning of the Russian Revolution, parson priest Mikhail Pukhalsky was killed together with his wife Maria after three hours of torture in his parsonage at the churchyard in March 1918. In 1922, Bolsheviks confiscated church items. During this period, the number of active parishioners was 540 persons in 1924. In 1929, the town executive committee received peasant's requests for turning the church into a rural club, and in 1930, the possibility of founding an antireligious university on its base was also considered. These plans failed, and the church was closed only in 1935. Later, it was refitted into a receiver-distributor for juvenile offenders and repressed parents‚Äô children. But even after the closing of the church, the Nativity of the Theotokos parish did not finish its existence. Services were held in a private's house on 18 Kirov Street until in 1938 all clergy was repressed by agencies of the NKVD (the Peoples‚Äô Commissariat for Internal Affairs in the Union of Soviet Socialistic Republics). Only at the time of the German occupation could the congregation renew its church life. In December 1941, the faithful people were given a building of a primary school on 45 Shyrokovska Street, and after the Second World War they bought a house on 60 Lenin Street where they equipped a complete prayer house. In this period, the parish had 4,000 members and was headed by archpriest Stefan Yanovsky, who was also the Dean of the Kryvyi Rih district of the Dnipropetrovs‚Äôk diocese. At this time the prayer house performed the function of the cathedral. It was in existence until Khrushchev's anti-religious campaign and was closed in 1961.  Present  The church was reopened on the 7th of February 1991 when the process of giving back the complex of buildings to its former owners began. At that time, the forming of a new architectural ensemble of the church began: a central dome was installed in 1995; a bell tower was erected in 1997-2000; a spiritual enlightenment centre was built in 2001-2004; a churchyard was arranged and a church gate was built in 2006-2008; the church was reconstructed and its interior was totally renewed in 2010-2011; and the second building of the spiritual enlightenment centre was started in 2014. With the restoration of the church, an active parish life began. Between 1991 and 2005, several parish activities were founded, such as a Sunday school, a church library, a parish newspaper, a charter of the Sisters of Mercy, a summer camp, an Orthodox youth brotherhood, and an annual festival of Ukrainian and church culture. The largest feature of the parish today is the church's Sunday school. About 150 children study the Bible and religion in six classes. In the spiritual enlightenment centre, there are youth and two children's choirs along with art studio which have become laureates of All-Ukrainian and international festivals and competitions (in Ukraine, Russia, Poland and Serbia). Active publishing activity is also carried out. Publications range from studies about churches in Kryvyi Rih, educational programmes and methodological recommendations for Sunday schools, and a musical collection with hymns and songs for a choir outside of the Liturgy. The architectural ensemble of the church became one of the \\"visiting cards\\" of the city for inhabitants and guests. Kryvyi Rih painters such as Ivan Avramenko, Dmytrii Grybok, Alexander Udovenko and Oksana Kolos found creative inspiration for their painting there. Archpriest Anatolii Ryzhenko has been the parson of the church since 1991. Since the moment the church was restored, twenty natives from the congregation have become clergymen (of which two are monks).

Named after educational psychologist Arthur Jensen, it was originally defined as \\"the theory that IQ is largely determined by the genes\\". The term was coined after Jensen published the article \\"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\\" in the Harvard Educational Review in 1969. It has since been included in several dictionaries.  Background  The gap of the IQ between white and black students was a subject of debate in the United States, particularly around the 1970s. One view, which is referred to among behavioral geneticists as the genetic position, holds that IQ is determined by hereditary factors - about 80 percent of the variability of intelligence while 20 percent is attributed to environmental factors. The gap, therefore, was associated with race. Jensenism was as one of the most notable theories to have emerged from this sector. It was based on Arthur Jensen's 1969 article that talked about the failure of compensatory education. He cited several evidence that demonstrated how IQ is inherited. For instance, he said that if one looks at studies of adopted children, \\"you find that their intelligence relates more closely to their natural parents.\\" He also proposed that the measured 15-point difference between American blacks and whites could never be entirely eliminated by education.  Reception  Many reactions to Jensen's article and the arguments it contained quickly ensued, some highly favorable and others relentlessly negative with some directly equating it with racism. Among the latter was a paper by behavioral geneticist Jerry Hirsch, who claimed that Jensenism was an \\"intellectual disgrace\\", while also criticizing some of Jensen's earlier critics: \\"Time and again the opposition to Jensenism has resorted to inarticulate and self-defeating hooliganism, so easily perceived as fascist interference with academic freedom and unfettered scientific inquiry.\\" In a 1970 article responding to Jensen, biologist Richard Lewontin argued that Jensenism was a more recent manifestation of the 17th-century Christian heresy Jansenism, referring to the former as a \\"doctrine\\" that is \\"as erroneous in the twentieth century as it was in the seventeenth.\\" Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould also criticized Jensenism, arguing that it rested \\"on a rotten edifice.\\" Jensen's ideas reportedly received a more favorable reception in the Nixon administration; Lewontin quoted then- United States ambassador to India Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1974 as saying, \\"The winds of Jensenism are blowing through Washington with gale force.\\" More recently, several favorable articles defending Jensen and his ideas have criticized the frequent negative use of the term \\"Jensenism\\".

Hauser John A. Hauser (October 4, 1907 ‚Äì April 14, 1983) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He served as president of the apple processing company, C. H. Musselman Company, from 1944 until his retirement in 1972. He also became vice president of Pet Incorporated, the multi-brand food products conglomerate, when the companies merged in 1961.  Career  Founded in 1907, Musselman was considered to be the largest apple processing company in the United States by 1944. When Hauser became president, he took Musselman products national. As an early canner of apple sauce, the company introduced the American public to one of the first ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù foods. Based in Biglerville, Pennsylvania, Musselman owned over 800 acres of land devoted primarily to orcharding. By 1938, they had added two more plants, one in nearby Gardeners, Pennsylvania; and another in Inwood, West Virginia. Hauser, a native of York, Pennsylvania, joined Musselman in August 1934 after studying at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Temple University. He spent a decade working his way up the ladder before becoming the company's second president in March 1944 after the death of founder Christian H. Musselman. During Hauser's 28-year tenure the company's land holdings expanded to over 6,000 acres including the purchase of orchards in West Virginia. In 1958 the company acquired Wolff Farm Supply Company in Biglerville, dealing in farm machinery and trucks. Soon after, they obtained Dwan's Home Canning Company with two plants in Michigan to meet the growing demand for products in the Midwest. In 1961, Musselman merged with Pet Milk Company (later Pet Inc.) based in St. Louis, Missouri. While continuing as president of the Musselman Division, he also became Pet's vice president and board member. A further consolidation with Pet's Winebrenner Division in Hanover, Pennsylvania, allowed for new product development such as ready-mix pie fillings, spiced apple rings, chunky apple sauces, as well as a wider range of food products such as cherries, berries, prunes, and eventually fruit juice drinks.  Philanthropy  Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower throws out the first game ball at the dedication of Gettysburg College's Musselman Stadium on September 25, 1965. At the podium is John A. Hauser, president of the Musselman Foundation, flanked by Lt. Gov. Raymond P. Shafer, College President Charles A. Hanson, and Athletic Director Henry T. Bream. Hauser oversaw the administration of two Musselman foundations that would ultimately provide over eight million dollars to assist the areas where the plants were located. Even after he retired, he remained president of the Musselman Foundation and chair of the advisory committee for the Emma G. Musselman Foundation. The Musselman Foundation was created in 1941 to provide scholarship and other assistance to higher and secondary education, and aid local charitable interests. Emma Musselman established her own charitable organization in 1955. The Emma G. Musselman Foundation concentrated its philanthropy on local hospitals, building funds, higher education, and mental health. Hauser helped direct these funds that went towards the building of a new high school in Inwood, a fully equipped industrial arts building, athletic field and gymnasium at Biglerville High School, and a Pennsylvania State University fruit research center in Biglerville. Two fully equipped wings were added to the Warner Hospital in Gettysburg, and assistance was provided for the Martinsburg (West Virginia) City Hospital and Brook Lane Psychiatric Center in Hagerstown, Maryland. Other major gifts allowed for the construction of a warehouse for the Adams County Rescue Mission and a facility for the Adams County YWCA. Major gifts also went to Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Funding allowed for the building of a football stadium, dormitory, and library as well as for scholarships and grants. The Hauser family also created a scholarship in his name that is still awarded annually to a management student, and a ‚ÄúBusinessperson-in-Residence‚Äù is funded to provide a lecture on business ethics, values about which Hauser felt strongly. Hauser served as a College trustee from 1967 to 1979, and then was elected as ‚Äúan honorary life trustee‚Äù for his distinguished service. In 1963 the College also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws. In November 1973, a new campus building was named for him. The John A. Hauser Field House contains an indoor track; tennis and basketball courts; cage areas for baseball and golf; and practice areas for soccer, football, and lacrosse. His work as a civic leader also included serving on the boards of Warner Hospital, Gettysburg National Bank, Adams County Library, and Gettysburg College. He also held leadership positions on national boards serving as president for International Apple Association, Pennsylvania Canners Association, and the Processed Apples Institute.

It produces both sexual (teleomorph) and asexual (anamorph) reproductive stages known as M. manginii and Scopulariopsis candida, respectively. Several synonyms appear in the literature because of taxonomic revisions and re- isolation of the species by different researchers. M. manginii is saprotrophic and commonly inhabits soil, indoor environments and decaying plant material. It is distinguishable from closely related species by its light colored and heart-shaped ascospores used for sexual reproduction. Scopulariopsis candida has been identified as the cause of some invasive infections, often in immunocompromised hosts, but is not considered a common human pathogen. There is concern about amphotericin B resistance in S. candida.  History and taxonomy  The anamorph was first documented, unintentionally, by Professor Fernand-Pierre-Joseph Gu√©guen in 1899 who mistook it for the species, Monilia candida, previously described in 1851 by Hermann Friedrich Bonorden. In 1911, Jean Paul Vuillemin determined that the two taxa were distinct, noting that the taxon described by Bonorden was a yeast whereas the strain that was the subject of Gu√©guen's studies was filamentous and produced true conidia. Vuillemin formally described the latter as S. candida. At the same time, he re-described Bonordeon's yeast taxon, Monilia candida, as Monilia bonordenii. Subsequent researchers described taxa that have since been reduced to synonymy with S. candida, including: S. alboflavescens in 1934, S. brevicaulis var. glabra in 1949, Chrysosporium keratinophilum var. denticola in 1969 and Basipetospora denticola in 1971. The teleomorph was discovered by Auguste Loubi√®re in 1923 and named Nephrospora manginii in honour of his mentor, Professor Louis Mangin. It was later transferred to the genus Microascus by Mario Curzi in 1931. Curzi did not provide an explanation for this transfer. S. candida and M. manginii are used in the literature to describe the same species. However, recent changes to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants have terminated the use of dual nomenclature for fungal species with multiple forms. It is not yet known which name will take priority for this fungus in the future.  Growth and morphology  = Sexual form = Colonies of M. manginii are pale, white and rapid growing. Growth is tolerant of cycloheximide and restricted at 37 ¬∞C. The vegetative hyphae are septate and appear glassy (hyaline). Ascomata are the sexual structures within which ascospores are produced in sacs called asci. The ascomata of M. manginii are spherical, smooth-walled, dark-brown to black and 100-175 ¬µm in size. These fruiting bodies are also called perithecia because of their flask-like shape wherein asci grow at the base and an opening allows for the release of mature ascospores. They are also papillate with short cone-shaped projections at the opening, sessile, and rich in carbon. Perithecia manifest as small black dots organized in concentric rings. An incubation period of over two weeks may be necessary for the production of perithecia. The asci are shaped similar to an upside-down egg where the apex is broad and thicker than the base. They are 11-16 √ó 8-13 ¬µm in size and contain 8 ascospores. Ascospores are nonseptate and smooth-walled. They are characteristically uniform in heart-shape and pale, straw-colored when mature - but appear reddish-brown as a mass. They each have a single inconspicuous germ pore, which is a predetermined spot in the spore cell wall where the germ tube emerges during germination. Ascospores are 5-6 √ó 4.5-5 ¬µm in size. M. manginii is a heterothallic species and as a result, generation of sexual spores requires mating between two compatible individuals. = Asexual form = S. candida is a hyaline mold with septate hyphae. The white and membranous morphology of S. candida colonies differentiates it from the more common species S. brevicaulis, which is characterized by a sand-coloured and granular colonial morphology. As the colony ages, it becomes slightly yellow. Conidiophores are specialized hyphal stalks that have conidiogenous cells which produce conidia for asexual reproduction. The Latin word for broom, scopula, was chosen as the basis of the generic name due to the broom-like appearance of the conidiophores of Scopulariopsis. In S. candida, these structures are 10-20 ¬µm in length. S. candida sporulates using specialized conidiogenous cells called annellide. The tip of the cell elongates and narrows each time a conidium is formed and results in a series of ring-like scars called annellations near the tip. The annelloconidia are formed in dry chains that eventually break off to allow the dispersal of spores by wind. They are one-celled, smooth- and thick- walled, and round but also broad-based. They resemble simple yeasts. Annelloconidia are hyaline and 6-8 √ó 5-6 ¬µm in size. The smooth hyaline annelloconidia can also distinguish S. candida from S. brevicaulis, which has conidia that are rough-walled, truncate and covered in tiny, thorny outgrowths. Isolates of S. candida can produce sterile perithecia-like structures.  Physiology  The optimal growth temperature range for S. candida is , with a minimum of 5 ¬∞C and maximum 37 ¬∞C. It is a keratinophilic species which may contribute to its role in nail infections. It grows well on protein-rich surfaces and is able to digest Œ±-keratins. In vitro study of antifungal susceptibilities reports S. candida as relatively more resistant to the antifungal drug amphotericin B, and susceptible to Itraconazole and miconazole.  Habitat and ecology  M. manginii is a saprobic fungus. It has a worldwide distribution. It is often isolated from decaying plant material, soil and indoor environments, but also human skin and nails, dust, chicken litter, atmosphere, book paper and cheese, among other locations. Contaminated dust, soil and air samples are often found in North America and Europe. In Portugal, S. candida was identified as the most prevalent fungal species contaminating the air of three poultry slaughterhouses in 2016. Contamination with fungal pathogens was found on equipment used in physiotherapy clinics in Brazil, specifically electrodes and ultrasound transducers, S. candida was found on several contact electrodes.  Pathogenicity  Invasive fungal infections are becoming increasingly common in patients who are immunocompromised. M. manginii and S. candida are not traditionally recognized as common human pathogens. However, they were identified as opportunistic human and plant pathogens in a few reported cases. Other Scopulariopsis species have been associated with nail infection and keratitis (S. brevicaulis), and brain abscess and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (S. brumptii). A case of disseminated infection caused by Scopulariopsis species in a 17-year old patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia was described in 1987. After receiving an allogenic bone marrow transplantation for cancer treatment, the patient complained of recurrent fever, nosebleeds, and abnormal sensations of the nose. Amphotericin B therapy was administered but symptoms persisted. Within two months of transplant, the patient experienced a short period of improvement followed by rapid deterioration and death. The autopsy discovered Scopulariopsis species in the lungs, blood, brain and nasal septum, and exhibited high resistance to amphotericin B in vitro. In 1989, the species responsible for the disseminated infection was identified as S. candida. S. candida was identified as the cause of invasive sinusitis in a 12-year old girl undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1992. This is the second reported case of invasive sinus disease caused by Scopulariopsis species and only reported case due to S. candida. The patient was immunocompromised at the time of fungal infection due to ongoing cancer treatment. The clinical presentation resembled an infection by fungi in the order Mucorales, and involved myalgia, cheek swelling and tenderness, a week- long fever, and extensive necrosis of maxillary sinuses. As a result, the presumed diagnosis was mucormycosis until further examination of patient specimens showed abundant growth of a powdery, tan mold that was distinguished as S. candida by several features (e.g., septate hyphae, round and smooth conidia, broom-shaped conidiophores). The patient immediately received surgical drainage and debridement of damaged tissue, and amphotericin B to treat the fungal infection. Subsequent identification of S. candida as the cause of disease prompted administration of additional antifungal medication, Itraconazole, to address potential amphotericin B resistance. The patient was cured of invasive sinusitis with no signs of progressive sinus disease. This marked the first successful treatment of an invasive infection caused by Scopulariopsis species in an immunocompromised host. Immunosuppression was suspected to play a role in the ability of S. candida to cause invasive infection. The most significant contributor to managing the disease was likely strengthening the patient's immune system by suspending chemotherapy and administrating granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. S. candida and M. manginii have been identified in cases of onychomycoses. They mainly cause tissue damage to the big toe and rarely other nails. Common symptoms include difficulty walking while wearing shoes, thickening and discolouration of nails, and deformation of nails. The infection often begins at the lateral edge of the nail instead of the proximal edge. Patients are typically middle- aged or older. The mechanism of these infections is not well-characterized. In addition, the published cases of onychomycoses caused by these species are not all reliable.

He was governor in turn of Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe and Saint- Domingue. Career =Early years (1640‚Äì83)= Charles Auger was born on Saint-Christophe around 1640. His parents were from Normandy, and had settled in Saint-Christophe in the 1630s. He entered the service of the Order of Malta, which owned the island, and became a knight of the order. He was appointed a surveyor on Saint Christophe and inspector of the island's fortifications. Auger married Louise d'Angennes, daughter of Louis d'Angennes, Marquis de Maintenon. She was the sister of Charles Fran√ßois d'Angennes, Marquis de Maintenon. Auger was captured by Barbary pirates from the port of Sal√©, Morocco. After being released he embarked at the beginning of 1681 as a lieutenant aboard the king's frigate La Sorci√®re, commanded by his brother-in- law, the Marquis de Maintenon. He spent two years cruising in the Antilles seas. =Marie-Galante (1683‚Äì92)= Auger was appointed king's lieutenant of Marie-Galante, just south of Guadeloupe, on 28 September 1683, and on 1 January 1686 became governor of Marie-Galante. He replaced the Marquis de Maintenon, who had spent only two months on the island during his three years in office. The Nine Years' War lasted from 1688 and 1697 and was fought by a coalition of states including the Dutch and English who were opposed to Louis XIV of France. Marie-Galante was abandoned in 1692 due to English raids, and Auger went to Martinique to help defend that island. =Guadeloupe (1695‚Äì1703)= On 21 August 1695 Auger was appointed governor of Guadeloupe. He succeeded Pierre Hincelin, who had died the previous year. In January 1696 a convoy of merchant vessels reached Martinique loaded with supplies and munition, escorted by three warships. In March 1696 Auger left Saint-Pierre, Martinique on one of these ships to take up his post in Guadeloupe. By early 1701 it was clear that another European war was imminent, since the Duke of Anjou had just become King Philip V of Spain, and the other powers of Europe would not allow one family to hold the crowns of France and Spain. In July 1701 the governor general of the French West Indies, Charles Desnotz, came to Guadeloupe to consult with Auger, and to urge him to immediately start preparations for war. He promised to give Auger all the assistance he needed. Desnotz died on 6 October 1701, and Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut became interim governor general. Charles-Fran√ßois de Machault de Belmont was appointed governor as of 1 July 1702. Machault finally presented his credentials to the sovereign council in Martinique on 24 March 1703. On 6 March 1703 a fleet of 45 vessels carrying 4,000 soldiers and militiamen under Christopher Codrington began the Siege of Guadeloupe. Auger, assisted by the friar and preacher Jean-Baptiste Labat, tried to organize the defense, but they were outnumbered. After two and a half weeks the English managed to take the fort in Basse-Terre. When he reached Martinique Machault found that the intendant Fran√ßois-Roger Robert was gathering reinforcements for Guadeloupe, which the English had invaded. 1,500 men volunteered, of whom 700 were chosen for the expedition. Nicolas de Gabaret, who was senior to Auger, was given overall command. fr) in Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe Nine barques, two ships and a brigantine (Trompeuse, Union, and Samaritaine) were used for transport, and left in the morning of 31 March 1703 escorted by two warships and a frigate that Machault had brought to the West Indies. Gabaret arrived in Guadeloupe on 3 April 1703. He pursued scorched earth tactics that proved effective in combination with the effect on the English of climate and drink. The English withdrew on 15 May 1703. Auger charged the Dominican Jean Baptiste Labat with building a defensive tower at Pointe-des-P√®res for the coastal battery to protect the town of Basse-Terre. It was built from volcanic rock in 1703 at the entrance to the town of Baillif. =Tortuga (1703‚Äì05)= Jean-Baptiste du Casse left Tortuga for France in 1700, where he was made squadron commander in the king's army. During his absence the sieur of Boissi Ram√© commanded the colony, but he died soon after and Joseph d'Honon de Gallifet was named acting governor in his place. A royal decree of 1 May 1703 made Auger governor of Tortuga and the Coast of Saint-Domingue in place of Ducasse, squadron commander of the naval armies of America. He took office in November 1703. The decree appointing him was received in the council of L√©og√¢ne on 16 November 1703 and of Le Cap on 3 December 1703. Bonnaventure-Fran√ßois de Boisferm√© was made acting governor of Guadeloupe. Auger organized the defenses of Saint Domingue against the English, but quarrelled with one of his subordinates, the king's lieutenant (and former acting governor) Joseph d'Honon de Galiffet. Auger died in L√©og√¢ne on 13 February 1705. He was replaced by Jean-Pierre de Charitte as acting governor of Saint-Domingue.

History  Initiated by the French animal rights organization L214, the first marches took place in Paris and Castres, in southern France on June 2, 2012. In Paris, the march commenced at the old Vaugirard Slaughterhouses, the site where Georges Franju filmed part of his documentary Le sang des b√™tes. According to the organizers, the event has grown into an international movement with 35 participating cities in 16 countries in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia in 2018; the Paris march of 2018 drew 3500 participants.  Aims and vision  The event aims to raise awareness of the suffering of animals in slaughterhouses and to engage the public in dialogue about the ethical, environmental, and human health concerns related to animal-based products, slaughterhouse work, and animal agriculture. Supporters of the cause argue that the ban of slaughterhouses is a legitimate political project, based on the arguments that the production of animal products is harmful directly or indirectly to humans and animals, animal products are unnecessary for human health and that many members of the general population oppose the unnecessary suffering and killing of sentient animals.  Locations  In 2018, the event was held in Canada, France, Australia, Argentina, Ireland, Turkey, Japan, and the United States.

Trost. The home was the W.W. Turney residence built for state legislator, lawyer, and rancher William Ward Turney in 1908. The International Museum of Art shares history with the El Paso Museum of Art, which occupied the Turney building until 1998. After it moved into its new building, the International Museum of Art reopened in 1999.  About  The International Museum of Art takes up around 14,000 square feet. The museum also has a 168-seat auditorium and space for art classes.  History  The El Paso International Museum Association began in 1924 and the group started collecting art at a rapid pace. Kate Moore Brown was a leader in helping to create the museum, which started with the purchase of several display cases for displaying the Percival Henderson collection. The museum's association planned to open a building in 1929, but were deterred because of the Great Depression. The group received a Texas state charter in 1930. The Women's Club of El Paso helped promote the idea of the museum. In 1941, they moved into former home of former State Senator William Ward Turney. The property was owned by the City of El Paso and the museum was leasing the W.W. Turney house on 1205 Montana Street. In 1944, the museum's board began to raise money to pay for the taxes owed on the house. The International Museum of Art formally opened its doors on May 2, 1947. The museum was planned to be expanded in the late 1950s at a cost of around $725,000 in funds from a bond issue. and The expansion would include two new art wings, an auditorium and a children's section. The renovations took place in 1960 with the architectural firm of Carrol and Daeuble and Associates. The Kress collection, donated by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, was installed in the building in May 1961. Around this time, the museum became known as the El Paso Museum of Art. The El Paso Museum of Art moved from the Turney home in 1998. The new location was in Downtown El Paso and initially, Mayor Carlos Ramirez wanted the Turney building to house offices for museum administration. In 1999, forty-two charter members made up the new El Paso International Museum of Art. The volunteers supporting the museum created an International Association for the Visual Arts and remained in the Turney building. The association began to lease the building from the City of El Paso. They also began an El Paso Artists Hall of Fame, which honored two artists a year.  Collection  The museum has over 450 paintings and 25 sculptures on display. The International Museum of Art obtained a kachina doll collection donated by Deane Miller in 2000. The collection was valued at $40,000.

It was founded in 1901 and now has over 600 students in 20 classes. Currently, the courses of Information technology, Cyber Security and Technical Lyceum are taught here. Students specialize in various sub-disciplines such as application development, virtual and augmented reality, Cyber Security, Multimedia, Internet of things, Robotics and Web applications.  History  SSPS was founded in 1901 by the city of Smichov which elected Ing. Emanuel Hertik as the first principal. Few years later, World War I struck the school as it was used for war purposes and in 1915 the school had department for war invalids. The school experienced prosperity during the First Czechoslovak Republic. In said period automobile construction course was opened and optical and mechanical departments were created. SSPS was also affected by World War II. Ferdinand Blavic, the school's principal was executed and many student's were forcibly taken to work in German companies such as Friesecke&H;√∂ppfner. In the nineties, SSPS was equipped with computational hardware for the first time and it even started to offer study programmes which ended with Matura.  Currently  Smichov Secondary Technical School offers three fields of education ‚Äì Information technology, one class of Technical Lyceum class and one Cyber Security class in pilot mode. In the school year 2019/2020, SSP≈† educates 644 students, the school is 99% full. Most students applied to the field of Information Technology, while the smallest double overhang was recorded in the Technical Lyceum field. Overall, SSP≈† had the most applications from all Prague secondary schools offering four-year graduation courses. According to Forbes magazine, the school was ranked among the eight most interesting Secondary schools in the Czech Republic in February 2018. Modern laboratories such as Physics Laboratory, Cybernetic Polygon, Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory, IoT Laboratory, Robotics Laboratory or Polytechnic Nest Classroom have been built at the school. At the same time, large-scale school projects, such as the Studio 301 and Preslova Media House, are being developed, involving dozens of students. Unique virtual tours of Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II concentration camps are created or the Terez√≠n fortress from 1800 in Studio 301. Since 2019, there has been a change in teaching in the field of Information Technology, where after the second year students can choose a school leaving examination (specialization), a second course specialized, a seminar and a topic of a student project in which all students have been creating since 2014 year-round work in the third year. Students can thus choose the subjects and the theme of their year-round work to adapt their teaching to the level of their talent and interest, which is subsequently identified by the Czech School Inspectorate as another strength of the school and as a correct achievement. Since 2019, the courses Presentation Skills, Entrepreneurship Education and IT in Practice have also been introduced. The appreciation of the activities and the introduction of new elements into school management can be taken as the head of the school, Radko S√°bl√≠k, was invited by Minister of Education in January 2019 to an eight-member expert team who is involved in creating a new vision of Czech education ‚Äì the Strategy 2030+. In addition, students and graduates from Preslova Media House collaborate with the Ministry of Education to promote this vision. SSP≈† is sought out by students mainly for many activities in which students can engage beyond the classroom, for the high involvement of students and graduates in school operation, for the creation of Student and Graduation projects or for the creation of Startups directly at school. Also for teaching the most modern areas of IT, such as cyber security, which the school began to teach as the first high school in the Czech Republic, Internet of Things, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Robotics. The Sm√≠chov Secondary School is unique in Czech secondary education in how many and to what extent students and graduates are involved in school operation. However, the school does not close itself, it organizes Workshops for primary school pupils and seniors, it trains Czech and European teachers within the framework of the ITEC SSP≈† project, where lecturers are both classical teachers and, above all, graduates and students. = Virtual school = A virtual school is a closed system that serves exclusively for staff and students at the school. The virtual school has internal information for teachers and students. Each class has its own electronic message board, where information from teachers is placed. They add more general information in the boards of their subject commissions or specific subjects. Supporting study materials are an important part of the virtual school. At present, support materials for practically all subjects taught at school are placed here. It serves both to support the teacher's, and especially for self-study to students. Students will find information about important tests or homework assignments. The system is also used directly for assigning tasks by the teacher and then hanging up their copies by students. A part of the virtual school is also an archive of graduation projects, which can be an inspiration in finding ideas for third year students, as well as in some cases an interesting study material. = Online textbook = In addition to the Virtual School, the school also provides publicly accessible individualized school Textbooks adapted to the teaching at school. Currently, the scripts provide learninh of the C# programming language, Hardware, and the React JavaScript library. = Graduates = In the school year 2019/2020 SSP≈† cooperates with 36 Graduates. They hold the positions of heads of IT, PR and Project Department, members of these departments, head of IoT Laboratory, Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory, Cybernetic Polygon and Polytechnic Nest. Graduates also work as consultants for Student and Graduation projects, which all students create as year-round work exclusively in groups in the third and fourth year respectively. Twelve graduates at school hold positions in IT, teaching Cyber Security, the Internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, Computer networks and programming. Being constantly educated, doing business or working in the field, they are able to pass on to their slightly younger colleagues the most up-to-date and practical knowledge in the field. In the school year 2019/2020, more than 120 school students participate very actively in the school, participate in Round Tables for school visions, participate in school promotion, represent the school in negotiations with social partners, conduct workshops for primary school pupils or seniors, they train Czech and European teachers in the IT field, conduct awareness-raising discussions on cyber security, they are members of Studio 301 or the Preslova Media House. Some students are also part-time employees of the school.  Specialized workplaces  = Cybernetic polygon = In 2017, a special polygon, a space with computers behind mobile walls, where Cyber Security is taught, was created in preparation for the newly taught Cyber Security course. The Authors are two former students of the school David S√Ωkora and Nathan Nƒõmec, now Teachers. = VR Laboratory = Since 2018, a virtual reality laboratory has been in the school. It is called Studio 301, which is derived from the classroom number in which the Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory is located. The laboratory of virtual and augmented reality was built by graduate and teacher Igor ≈Ωmajlo, it was established even before it was set up at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at ƒåVUT. With its 18 stationary and 5 portable workplaces, it was the largest in Central Europe at the time of its establishment. Within Studio 301, students work on many projects, whether school or personal ones, they create virtual tours of various locations or create computer games. However, there are also seminars in the laboratory; In them, the candidates, especially from lower grades, get acquainted with modeling and programming for creating specific applications. Members of Studio 301 are also involved in the education of teachers, both Czech and foreign. = IoT Laboratory = IoT Laboratory in SSP≈† is one of the first Internet of Things laboratories in the Czech Republic. The new laboratory, under the leadership of Jan Tesa≈ô, enables computer control of lighting, ventilation and other wiring with the help of sensors. The laboratory was established thanks to a grant from the municipality. The partner of the IoT project is the City Center of the Future of the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at ƒåVUT. = Preslova Media House = Since spring 2019, the Preslova Media House has been working with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports to promote the creation of a vision of the Czech education system called Strategy 2030+. As part of this, reports from some events, interviews with personalities were filmed. In November 2019 Preslova Media House organized a conference on Strategy 2030+, which took place in the New Town Hall in Prague. This project is open, not only all employees, graduates and students of SSP≈†, but also other Prague and non-Prague secondary schools and individuals can participate. Negotiations are ongoing with various organizations. The intention is to create a Media House, in which the reports will consist exclusively of high school students, who will primarily focus on Czech education, but also the use and possible misuse of modern technologies and social issues. The intention is also to organize regular debates on the Czech education system in the new Media Studio, inviting not only personalities from this field, academics, Politicians, but also teachers and students. The main goal is to communicate their views to the public.  Other school activities  Beyond regular education, the school provides a wide range of Certifications, whether in the field of computer networks from Cisco CCNA, the Office Microsoft Office Specialist, or the Autodesk Inventor design system. There is also a \\"Young Audience Club\\" at the school, which arranges visits to theatrical performances at Prague theaters for a bargain price. = Student Club = The school has a student club where students on high- performance computers can work on a variety of projects in professional development and graphics software. There is also a games room with a game console with various game titles. The Student Club also includes a study room which is separated from the rest of the club. = Student laboratory = The Student Laboratory was established by Petr ≈†tƒõp√°nek, a student of Sm√≠chov Secondary School, who still runs the laboratory in 2017. Students can meet here and research their projects, they can work on them, but they can also meet their colleagues from all over the Czech Republic. Students can also collaborate on Startups. = Audiovisual studio = The audiovisual studio has been in operation since October 2008. The studio is often modernized and provides students with a high-quality background for increasingly demanding audiovisual experiments. In the later afternoon and evening, students use the music rehearsal room. There is an equipment for musicians, a drum kit etc. The audio video studio premises are also used by students who create Internet news about the school. = Students and girls' association = There are also two clubs in the school. Student Association of SSP≈†, which develops further education of students by various Lectures and workshops. The Girls' Association of SSP≈† supports girls in the technical fields of study in the form of a Peer Program. The association organizes events for further education and knowledge in the fields, such as visiting a company or other organization, a trip abroad or participating in a public events.

It was installed in February 1952 at a site near the landing spot of the Denny Party, who named the first settlement there \\"New York Alki\\" before moving to modern-day Downtown Seattle. The site was near a location proposed for a \\"grand monument\\" in the 1911 city plan outlined by Virgil Bogue. The original statue was constructed using stamped copper sheets and was repeatedly damaged by vandals. The entire statue was knocked off its base by vandals in 1975, requiring $350 in repairs funded by the city's parks department. A miniature version of the statue, left inside the larger statue's pedestal base, was re-discovered with a ripped arm that mirrored the acts of an earlier vandal. It was the site of a temporary memorial after the September 11 attacks, with flowers and flags left around the statue. The statue was also used as the backdrop to several protests against the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War. The statue in 2005 The Northwest Programs for the Arts announced plans in 2004 to re-cast the entire sculpture in bronze and began soliciting donations to fund the project. The statue's crown was stolen during the campaign, which received a $15,000 grant from the city's neighborhoods department to complete the project. The old statue was removed in July 2006 and sent to a foundry in Tacoma to be re-cast in bronze and painted copper green. The $140,000 restoration project was completed the following year and the statue was re- installed at Alki Beach on September 11, 2007. The statue is tall, about 5 percent of the original's height, and faces north towards Elliott Bay. A new, pedestal was also designed for the statue, sitting in a new plaza built by the city's parks department and dedicated in September 2008.

She rose to prominence after the Six-Day War with her anti-war song \\"Mah Avarekh\\" (\\"With What Shall I Bless?\\"), set to music by Yair Rosenblum, and went on to write some of the \\"greatest classics\\" of Hebrew song. Her songs have been set to music by leading Israeli composers and performed by top Israeli artists. Early life Shapira was born in 1945 on Kibbutz Shefayim in central Israel. She began writing songs at age 12, putting her own lyrics on Hebrew and secular melodies. At the time, she did not have any aspirations to be a songwriter or poet, but she did send her songs to popular children's magazines to be published under a pseudonym. On her kibbutz, she worked as a special education teacher, specializing in reading problems and dyslexia. Songwriting career Shapira rose to national prominence with her 1967 anti- war song \\"Mah Avarekh\\" (\\"With What Shall I Bless?\\"), written in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. Shapira had written the song in memory of Eldad Kravek, a fellow member of her kibbutz who had fallen in that war at the age of 21. Originally titled \\"Eldad\\", the song was published by Shapira in a memorial booklet produced by her kibbutz. Yair Rosenblum, musical director of the Israel Navy, saw the booklet at the kibbutz guest house where he had come to recuperate after an automobile accident. Unbeknownst to Shapira, he set the song to music, retitled it \\"Mah Avarekh\\", and returned to the kibbutz with soloist Rivka Zohar to perform it for Shapira. The song was recorded on the Navy Ensemble's 1968 album The Third Day and performed around the country. While Israel had been victorious in the Six-Day War, the song encapsulated the nation's grief over its casualties and became a hit. Following this success, Shapira's other songs came to national attention. In 1971 Shapira released her first joint song with Israeli composer Moni Amarillo, \\"Tzipur Bageshem\\" (\\"Bird in the Rain\\"). Her song \\"U'matok Ha'or B'einayim\\" (\\"The Sweetest Light in the Eyes\\") was performed at the 1971 Israel Song Festival by Sassi Keshet, followed by \\"Hashir al Eretz Sinai\\" (\\"The Song About the Land of Sinai\\") performed by Shlomo Artzi at the 1972 Israel Song Festival, \\"Olam Katan\\" (\\"A Small World\\") performed by Chava Alberstein at the 1983 Children's Song Festival, and Karov Layam (\\"Near the Sea\\") performed by Yardena Arazi at the 1988 Pre-Eurovision. In 1978, Alberstein produced a complete album of Shapira's compositions under the title Hitbaharut (Brightening). Shapira's songs have been set to music by leading Israeli composers and performed by top Israeli artists. Performers include Israeli singers Ilanit, Ruhama Raz, Gali Atari, Yardena Arazi, Anat Atzmon, Riki Gal, Margalit Tzan'ani, and Dani Litani, and the ensembles Habibi, Orna and Moshe Datz, and Hofim. Musical style Shapira views her songs as \\"personal ballads\\" that have a strong connection to the Land of Israel. In an interview she explained: > I think I like personal ballads, songs of crisis that describe confrontation > with a group, especially ‚Äì but not only ‚Äì by a female character. There is a > constant movement between alienation and belonging; sometimes it's very > obvious and sometimes it's hidden, but someone who invests time will see it. > I have some kind of need for self-definition and the expression of anxieties > and fears. I don't write for what people call \\"to forget your problems\\". I > dissect myself, and in this sense, it's not pure entertainment, but > something else. Instead of escaping from daily hardships, my way is the > opposite: I want to create from within the hardship this beauty in art and > music, in songs that rhyme and in the human voice. She has also produced translated versions of Don McLean's \\"Genesis\\", sung by Gali Atari, Julie Gold's \\"From a Distance\\" (retitled \\"From Above\\"), performed by Ruhama Raz, and Sting's \\"Fields of Gold\\", sung by Dorit Farkash.

From 1907 to 1962, African-Americans were effectively barred from voting or running in state elections by poll taxes and literacy tests; until 1946, African-Americans were prohibited from participating in the white primaries ran by the Democratic Party of Georgia. However, the impact of the court cases King v. Chapman, Gray v. Sanders, and Wesberry v. Sanders as well as passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 had opened voter registration to blacks resulted in the election of Senator Johnson (1962) as well as the election of the first eight black House members since 1907 in 1965: six from Atlanta (William Alexander, Julian Bond, Benjamin Brown, Julius C. Daugherty, J. D. Grier, and Grace Towns Hamilton) and one each from Columbus (Albert Thompson) and Augusta (Richard Dent). By 1972, fourteen African-American members were serving in the General Assembly when Johnson began convening informal gatherings of the black legislators to discuss issues of importance to African-American members.

She also played a key role in the development of acyclovir, the first effective treatment for herpes simplex virus.  Early life and education  Janet Rideout was born Janet Litster January 6, 1939 in Bennington, Vermont. She received bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees in chemistry from Mount Holyoke College. She then earned a PhD in organic chemistry from State University of New York, Buffalo in 1968.  Research and career  Shortly before graduation from the State University of New York, Buffalo, Rideout was hired by chemist and future Nobel laureate Gertrude Elion to work at a small US subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome Company (now GlaxoSmithKline). Initially located in Tuckahoe (village), New York, the branch moved to Research Triangle, North Carolina in 1970. Rideout specialized in nucleoside chemistry. Nucelosides are chemical compounds consisting of a pentose sugar bound to a nitrogenous base. When phosphorylated, nucleosides become nucleotides, which are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). As such, they're needed for replication (copying of the genome before cells divide so that each gets a copy). Therefore, cells that replicate frequently, such as cancer cells and bacteria have a high demand for nucleosides. Recognizing this, teams of scientists, including a team at Burroughs Wellcome including Janet Rideout dedicated themselves to studying chemical analogs that could mimic natural nucleosides, inhibiting replication. = Arabinosides = One branch of Rideout's research involved the synthesis of purine arabinosides (similar in structure to the canonical nucleosides found in DNA and RNA, but containing the sugar arabinose instead of ribose or deoxyribose). Rideout synthesized the nucleoside analog diaminopurine arabinoside, which was found to be active against herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus and with a lower toxicity than similar compounds. In her Nobel lecture, Gertrude Elion credits this finding with initiating her group's \\"antiviral odyssey,\\" which would lead to the development of the HIV treatment AZT, the herpes treatment acyclovir, and other important antiretroviral compounds. The promising results from diaminopurine arabinoside led Rideout to synthesize additional purine arabinosides, in hopes of developing more effective antivirals. She worked with a team including virologists J. Bauer and P. Collins to study their pharmacological properties, discovering that aminopurine arabinosides had antiviral activity that was dependent on their amino group. This knowledge helped lead to the design of more potent antiviral medications including acyclovir, the first active selective drug against herpes viruses. = AZT = Rideout also studied nucleosides' antibacterial properties. One of the compounds that interested her was azidothymidine (AZT), identical to the canonical nucleoside thymidine found in DNA except for the 3' position, where AZT has an azide (N3) group instead of a hydroxyl (OH) group. That 3' OH is needed for linking nucleotides together, so AZT could potentially act as a chain terminator (it could be added to a growing nucleic acid chain, but additional nucleotides couldn't link to it). AZT was first synthesized in 1964 by a Michigan Cancer Foundation researcher, Jerome Horwitz, with hopes it could be used to treat leukemia, but it wasn't found to be effective and raised toxicity concerns so it was abandoned. There was limited research on it in the following years, including a report from a laboratory in showing it had activity against Friend virus, a murine virus that causes leukemia in mice, but retroviruses weren't thought to affect humans, and the paper drew little attention. Rideout was interested in AZT's other potential applications; she studied AZT as an antibacterial agent at the Burroughs Wellcome Company for several years. The compound was particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria. In addition to chemical characterization and optimization of its synthesis, their research included pharmacokinetic and safety testing in rats. This experience, and the data they collected showing that the drug was tolerated in rats placed them in a prime position to expedite the drug development process. In June 1984, Burroughs Wellcome initiated a program to identify chemical compounds that might be effective against HIV, and they put Rideout in charge of choosing which compounds to test. There was limited knowledge about HIV at the time, but Rideout's search was aided by the finding that HIV was a retrovirus, a type of virus that transfers between cells with its genome encoded in RNA but, once it infects a host cell, reverse transcribes its RNA genome into a DNA copy which it then inserts into the host cell's DNA, so that the cell and all its progeny are perpetually infected. Knowing that HIV was a retrovirus, Rideout searched for compounds with antiretroviral activity; the company didn't have the necessary set-up for studying live HIV, so they screened against animal retroviruses, with the screening carried out by virologist Martha (Marty) St. Clair. One of the compounds Rideout chose to test was AZT and by the end of 1984, Wellcome had shown that AZT was active against two animal retroviruses, Harvey sarcoma virus and Friend leukemia virus. To see if it was also active against HIV, they collaborated with scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), including Samuel Broder and Hiroaka Mitsuya, who had developed a method to grow the virus in immortalized human T4 cells (the type of immune cell HIV targets). NCI found AZT to be highly effective against HIV in these cells, and it went on to become the first FDA-approved treatment for HIV. In 1985, Rideout, along with four other BW scientists, applied for American and British patents for the use of AZT, given the chemical name zidovudine and the proprietary name Retrovir, for the treatment of HIV-1; they were approved in 1988, with Rideout is listed as the first co-inventor. Rideout's research on AZT didn't stop with its initial application to HIV. In the coming years at Burroughs Wellcome, she helped elucidate how AZT is processed in the body (administered as the cell membrane-permeable nucleoside, it is phosphorylated inside cells to the nucleotide form which is used in DNA synthesis) and how it selectively targets HIV's reverse transcriptase. She also continued to look into AZT's other potential uses, including against other viruses and bacteria. = Later career = In 1995, after working at Burroughs Wellcome for over 26 years, and rising to the rank of associate division director, Rideout joined Inspire Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Merck in 2011) as Director of Chemistry. She subsequently had a number of promotions within the company: to Senior Director of Discovery in June 1996, Vice President in January 1998, and Senior Vice President of Discovery in February 2000. At Inspire Pharmaceuticals, she continued researching nucelosides but now as activators (agonists) instead of inhibitors. In addition to their role in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, nucleotides can serve as important signaling molecules including through activating purinergic receptors. Rideout helped develop ways to synthesize a type of purinergic receptor agonist called dinucleoside polyphosphates (dinucleotides), which consist of two joined nucleosides with varying numbers of phosphate groups, so they can be further studied. Rideout retired in September 2000. Rideout holds over 40 U.S. patents. In addition to the patent for treating HIV with AZT, she holds patents for synthesis procedures of various nucleoside analogs as well as their specific therapeutic applications; this includes derivatives of AZT for use treating and preventing infection by certain retroviruses and gram- negative bacteria.

Career Della Negra studied mathematics and theoretical physics for his doctorate at the Laboratory of Nuclear Physics of the College de France in Paris, defending his thesis on the experimental study of proton-antiproton annihilation in 1967. In the 1970s, following post-doctoral work at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, he involved himself on high-energy physics projects at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where he worked initially as a member of the Intersecting Storage Rings group. In 1977 joined the team led by Carlo Rubbia and played an important role in the 1981 discovery of the W and Z bosons. Della Nigra and his colleague from Imperial College London, Tejinder Singh Virdee, were among the first to envisage a hermetic detector for the large hadron collider (LHC) based on a strong magnetic field, the compact muon solenoid (CMS), and was spokesman for the CMS from 1992 until 2006. Together with evidence from the A Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS), the CMS experiments were crucial to the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. As of 2018 he is physicist emeritus of the physics department of CERN, and CMS emeritus at Imperial College London.  Awards  Della Negra shared the 2013 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the discovery of the Higgs Boson with his pioneering colleagues Fabiola Gianotti and Peter Jenni from ATLAS, and Tejinder Singh Virdee, Guido Tonelli, Joe Incandela and Lyn Evans from CMS.. He also shared the 2012 Julius Wess Prize from the Karlsruher Institut f√ºr Technologie with Jenni, and the 2013 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize of the European Physical Society with Jenni, Virdee, and the CMS and Atlas consortia.

It was an important place in ancient times, on account of its excellent harbour and salubrious situation. It is situated at the extreme point of a rocky ridge, which runs into the sea, opposite the island Sapientza, one of the group called in ancient times Oenussae. Off the outer end of the town, is the little insulated rock which Pausanias calls Mothon, and which he describes as forming at once a narrow entrance and a shelter to the harbour of his time: in the 19th century, when visited by William Martin Leake, it was occupied by a tower and lantern, which is connected by a bridge with the fortification of modern Methoni. A mole branched from it, which ran parallel to the eastern wall of the town, and forms a harbour for small vessels, which to Leake seems to be exactly in the position of the ancient port, the entrance into which was probably where the bridge now stands.William Martin Leake, Morea, vol i. p. 429 et seq. According to the testimony of the ancient writers, Methone was the Homeric Pedasus, one of the seven cities which Agamemnon offered to Achilles. Homer gives to Pedasus the epithet ·ºÄŒºœÄŒµŒªœåŒµœÉœÉŒ± (vine-covered), and Methone seems to have been celebrated in antiquity for the cultivation of the vine. The eponymous heroine Methone, is called the daughter of Oeneus, the 'wineman'; and the same name occurs in the islands Oenussae, lying opposite the city. The name of Methone first occurs in the Messenian Wars. Methone and Pylus were the only two places which the Messenians continued to hold in the Second Messenian War, after they had retired to the mountain fortress of Ira., 4.23.1. At the end of the Second Messenian War, the Lacedaemonians gave Methone to the inhabitants of Nauplia, who had lately been expelled from their own city by the Argives., 4.35.2. The descendants of the Nauplians continued to inhabit Methone, and were allowed to remain there even after the restoration of the Messenian state by Epaminondas. In the first year of the Peloponnesian War, 431 BCE, the Athenians attempted to obtain possession of Methone, but were repulsed by Brasidas. Methone suffered greatly from an attack of some Illyrian privateers, who, under the pretext of purchasing wine, entered into discussions with the inhabitants and carried off a great number of them., 7. Shortly before the Battle of Actium, Methone, which had been strongly fortified by Mark Antony, was besieged and taken by Agrippa, who found there Bogud, king of Mauretania, whom he put to death.Dio Cassius 1. 11; Oros. 6.19; Methone was favoured by Trajan, who made it a free city. Pausanias found at Methone a temple of Athena Anemotis, the 'storm-stiller,' and one of Artemis. He also mentions a well of bituminous water, similar both in smell and colour to the ointment of Cyzicus. It is also mentioned by Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Ptolemy, and Hierocles. Its site is located near the modern Methoni.

One of two military units raised at roughly the same time in the Philadelphia area during the fall of 1862, the 157th Pennsylvania was stationed initially at Fort Delaware, beginning in December 1862, and remained there on garrison duty until it was reassigned to the defense of Washington, D.C. during the early winter of 1863. It was then assigned to the Army of the Potomac during the spring of 1864, and sent to the front lines of the war's Eastern Theater, where it remained for the duration of the war.

History Raised in response to the continuing need for additional soldiers to support the Union Army during the American Civil War, the 156th and 157th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry regiments began their respective recruiting drives in the Philadelphia area during the fall of 1862. Neither drive went well, however; as a result, by December 1862, the partially-staffed 157th Pennsylvania was assigned to garrison duty at Fort Delaware. With recruitment still proceeding slowly for both regiments after the New Year of 1863, the men who had been recruited for the 156th Pennsylvania, who numbered roughly the size of just one company, were transferred to the 157th Pennsylvania Infantry, thereby forming a battalion composed of four companies. The commissioned officers appointed to lead this new iteration of the 157th Pennsylvania were: Edmund T. Tiers, lieutenant colonel, and Thomas H. Addicks, major.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5; Prepared in Compliance with Acts of the Legislature, Vol. IV: ‚ÄúOne Hundred and Fifty- Seventh Regiment‚Äù, p. 833.\\"157th Regiment, Pennsylvania Infantry\\", in \\"Battle Unit Details\\", in \\"The Civil War\\", U.S. National Park Service.

Life and career Moorhouse was born in London and went to New Zealand in his boyhood. He was usually known as \\"Harry\\". A middle-order batsman who often kept wicket and sometimes bowled, Moorhouse began playing for Addington in the Christchurch senior competition in the 1883-84 season. In the 1884-85 season he was Addington's only batsman to make a fifty. He played one first-class match for Canterbury at Lancaster Park in April 1884. During the second day of the match, play was suspended while a game of rugby was played on the ground between East Christchurch and South Canterbury. Moorhouse played in the rugby match as well, for East Christchurch. He moved to Wellington in 1886 and joined the Phoenix club, which he captained to its three most successful seasons. He played several matches for Wellington. His excellent fielding at point was one of the few positive aspects of Wellington's showing against the touring Australian team in 1886-87. Against Nelson in 1888-89, after Nelson had been dismissed for 60 and Wellington were 17 for 3 in reply, Moorhouse went to the wicket and hit 63, \\"a fine dashing innings\\" which included nine fours and one five. Wellington went on to win by an innings. In his last match for Wellington, in 1890-91, he made the highest score of the match against Canterbury when he guided Wellington to an eight- wicket victory with 37 not out. In February 1891 the columnist \\"Slip\\" in the Otago Witness said that Moorhouse's batting that season \\"entitles him to be regarded as one of the finest batsmen ‚Äì probably the finest batsman ‚Äì in the colony\\". Moorhouse also played rugby for Poneke during their dominant years in the Wellington competition, and represented Wellington. He returned to England in 1891, playing club cricket in Surrey and Kent. He worked as a commercial traveller for a flour mill in Surrey. In 1907 he returned to New Zealand, living in Christchurch again. In 1907-08 he scored 42 and 86 (the top score in the match) when Canterbury defeated Otago. He moved back to the North Island in 1908, to Masterton in the Wairarapa region, and represented Wairarapa in cricket several times. He captained them in the first match of the inaugural season of the Hawke Cup in December 1910, making their top score of 35 in the second innings. Playing for Masterton, he was the leading batsman in the Wairarapa competition in 1909-10. In February 1912, when Moorhouse and his wife returned to England, where he had accepted a \\"lucrative appointment\\", the secretary of the Masterton Cricket Club wrote: \\"In Mr. Moorhouse this Club loses its Mentor, and the district its greatest cricketer.\\" References External links  Category:1866 births Category:1955 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Wellington cricketers Category:Wellington rugby union players Category:People from Hackney Central ","title":"Malcolm Moorhouse"},{"id":"58530553","text":"The Dimitrovsky Bridge or The Dimitrov Bridge (, Dimitrovsky Most) is an automobile bridge over the Ob River, connecting the Zheleznodorozhny and Leninsky districts of Novosibirsk, Russia.

The band's current lineup consists of Warren Frank (vocals), Luke Shauf (bass), Freddy Kwon (guitar), and Tanner Par√© (drums). They have released three EPs: 2014's Locals, 2016's Waking, and 2017's Within Waves. The band describe their sound as \\"indie pop in the vein of...Foster The People, Young the Giant and The Arkells.\\" They have toured with and opened for other Canadian acts such as The Sheepdogs and The Strumbellas and have been featured on curated playlists on Spotify and Apple Music.  History  Frank, Kwon, and Shauf were students at I. E. Weldon Secondary School and were brought together through a group assignment in their Grade 11 music class in which they had to cover various songs. After realizing their shared musical chemistry, the trio, alongside drummer Nathan Truax, decided to form a band, which they originally named Luke and the Good Men. In 2012, they changed their name to The Kents, a reference to the name of Lindsay's main street, Kent Street. The band first gained attention through playing local shows and community events in the Kawartha Lakes area before going on hiatus in order for each member to pursue their respective educations, though they still recorded and self-released the Locals EP when they regrouped in the summer of 2014. After finishing their studies, they reunited once more in 2016 to record a new EP, Waking. By this point, Truax had parted ways with the band and had been replaced by Peterborough drummer Tanner Par√©. Waking's first single, \\"The Stakes\\", received significant airplay on CBC Radio and garnered over 100,000 streams on Spotify before the EP was released. The Waking was released on July 1, 2016 and was covered in regional and national music publications, like Canadian Beats and Exclaim!, the latter of which writing that the EP \\"bristles with high-energy power-pop from the get-go\\". Its songs have collectively been streamed over 2,000,000 times on Spotify. In 2017, the Kents released the single \\"Is There Anyone?\\" ahead of their second EP, Within Waves. The EP's second single, \\"Distant\\", was released September 18, 2017 and was \\"[inspired by] a trip to Canada's East Coast\\", according to Frank. \\"Distant\\" was played on FM and satellite radio stations, like BOB FM, Toronto's Indie88, and Sirius XM. The EP itself was released on October 13, 2017 and garnered similar attention from media outlets as Waking. Matt Yuyitung of Exclaim! gave EP an 8/10 rating, noting that the band's \\"sound palette has grown considerably [since Waking]‚Äîand so have their songwriting capabilities and confidence as a band\\". He particularly praised Frank's vocals on the EP, calling him \\"one of the band's biggest assets on the record\\". The band performed at Peterborough Musicfest in 2017 and were a part of the 2018 edition of Canadian Music Week. In January 2020, the Kents changed their name to \\"Heaps\\" as announced via their official band webpage.

Built in 1790, it is one of Hamden's oldest houses, and was home to the economically important Ives family, from whom the Ivesville area takes its name. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Elam Ives House is located in central eastern Hamden, on the south side of Ives Street (Connecticut Route 22) just west of the Mill River. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and shingled exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows on either side of the central entrance. The entrance is simply framed, with a four-light transom window above. The interior is said to be relatively unaltered from its period of construction about 1790. The house was built in 1790 by Elam Ives Sr., who farmed the land and engaged in other business pursuits. Ives' sons became active in industrializing the area, taking advantage of the failure of the Farmington Canal to convert its water power to productive business uses. The area became known as Ivesville through the extensive business activities of James Ives; other sons were also involved in the carriage making industry that became important in Hamden and New Haven. The house was acquired in 1912 by the local water authority, due to its location in a sensitive watershed area. It has owned the property since, occasionally renting it out.

A. kalrae is considered a weak pathogen of animals including human restricted to the outermost keratinized layers of tissue. Infections caused by this species are normally responsive to commonly used antifungal drugs with only very rare exceptions. History and taxonomy Arthrographis kalrae was first discovered from a lesion on nails of a male patient and classified as A. langeronii by Cochet in France in 1938 although a Latin diagnosis was not provided. It was next reported from a lung specimen taken from a patient in India in 1963 by Tewari and Macpherson who, unaware of Cochet's earlier work, treated it in the genus Oidiodendron as O. kalrae. Sigler and Carmichael re-evaluated these records in 1976 and validated Cochet's generic thereby establishing the taxon as A. kalrae where it has since remained. Conidiogenesis and morphology Arthrographis kalrae is primarily known as an asexual fungus, producing single-celled arthroconidia with thin, smooth walls. The fungus grows relatively slowly culture with colonies initially yellowish-white in colour and yeast-like, varying from yellowish-brown to tan in color and powdery at maturity. Most sporogenous hyphae are irregularly branched in a tree-like pattern at the apex. Diversity in colonial morphology does not appear to correlate with genotypic diversity. Some strains develop globose cleistothecia may develop. DNA sequencing and PCR-based methods are useful in confirming the identity of this species. Ecology and physiology Arthrographis kalrae is widely distributed in air, soil, compost, sputum and skin lesions. A. kalrae infections have been reported from various continents. A. kalrae is saprotrophic and theromotolerant with a range of growth tolerance between . A. kalrae can resist antifungal agents such as cycloheximide and cadmium. This species actively degrades keratin and can invade mammalian hair shafts by the formation of solitary, penetrating hyphae. Moderate antifungal activity is observed with itraconazole and ketoconazole. Terbinafine is associated with strong antifungal activity followed by posaconazole, amphotericin B and echinocandins. Pathogenicity Arthrographis kalrae is capable of pathogenicity in animals (including humans) but not in plants. Most human isolates of A. kalrae originate from eyes, ears, toes and skin; occasionally, pulmonary infections have been reported; severe infections have been encountered in immunocompromised individuals such as people with chronic diseases, those receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy as well as recipients of allogeneic tissue transplantation. A. kalrae secretes antigens with haemolytic and cytotoxic activity. Additionally, scientists use mice as animal model to study the cellular and humeral responses triggered by A. kalrae. Within the mouse model, brain and kidney lesions have been observed. By analyzing the immune response in the mouse, it appears that lesions arise through inflammatory processes involving elevated IgG and IL-4. T helper cells likely also play an essential role in the promotion of this inflammatory response. Laboratory diagnosis is usually by isolation from diseased tissues (skin scrapes, hair and nails), fluids collected from body (blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine) and bodily secretions (e.g., pus from lesions and airway secretions). Epidemiology Strains isolated from clinical specimens have been recorded from Morocco, Australia, North America, Asia and Europe. A. kalrae is mainly distributed in soil, therefore, frequent contact with soil is thought to be a risk factor for infection in addition to abrogation of the cellular immune system. Hospitalization increases the chance of infection by this species. Prevention of infection is strictly by avoidance of inoculum and restoration of normal host resistance, since no vaccine is currently available. For the patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, antifungal prophylaxis is useful to prevent infection by this species. This species is considered a pathogen of emerging importance. Based on the statistics, the number of immunocompromised individuals and the incidence of fungal infection outbreaks increases rapidly.

Founded in 2012 by John Goscha, the company makes energy-efficient light bulbs that use induction technology and are being offered as a substitute for incandescents and LEDs.  History  The Finally Light Bulb Company was founded in 2012 by John Goscha, who as an undergraduate at Babson College, founded IdeaPaint. Goscha enlisted Victor Roberts, a former General Electric engineer, Walter Lapatovich from Osram Sylvania, and engineers from Philips for technical expertise in lighting technology. With Roberts and Lapatovich, Goscha was able to adapt induction lighting technology, previously only used in commercial light fixtures, and miniaturize it for home use. The light bulb was officially launched and began sales in May 2014, with $19 million in initial funding from several investors including Babson College professors. The company was founded in Woburn, Massachusetts, but later moved to Boston, Massachusetts. The company's business model is focused on the 2020 phase-out of incandescent light bulbs in the United States mandated by federal law. In January 2017, the company received an additional $15 million in funding from investors. As of July 2017, the Finally reported a total of $38 million in funding and employed 32 employees. In August 2018, Scott Almquist became CEO and President, and Goscha became Chairman. Almquist previously led four private equity-backed companies as CEO, President, or Chief Customer Officer, having spent the first twenty years of his career at Procter & Gamble. At the time, Finally light bulbs were available at Staples, Ace Hardware, Amazon, Wayfair, and Walmart's online store. In March 2018, a new round of funding of $50 million brought the company's total funding to $93 million. The company announced that its products were added to The Home Depot and Costco stores, bringing the total number of stores where the products are available to almost 3,000.  Product  The company claims that Finally light bulbs create a light similar to incandescents and better than LED light bulbs. Based on technology developed by Nikola Tesla, the bulb utilizes induction technology to create omnidirectional light in a traditionally-shaped light bulb. The tungsten filament in incandescent light bulbs is replaced by an induction coil. An electronic driver, and the three-inch antenna with a copper coil excite a mixture of argon gas and mercury vapor in the bulb to produce ultraviolet light which excites the phosphor coating on the inside of the glass to create visible light. They are \\"75 percent more efficient and last 15 times longer than incandescents.\\" The current generation of LED lamps on the market have surpassed this by a substantial margin however and Finally is one of the few manufactures still marketing induction lamps.

War crimes by German combat divisions in Italy were committed by the Waffen-SS and the Wehrmacht, with its sub-branches, the army, Luftwaffe (air force) and Kriegsmarine (navy). Historically, the view existed that the Wehrmacht fought a clean campaign there and the atrocities and war crimes were committed only by the SS, and in the latter case predominantly by the Einsatzgruppen and concentration camp guards, not by the Waffen-SS. This view has been refuted by modern research, which found that the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS were equally involved in war crimes.Gentile, p. 1 Background Research in 2016 funded by the German government found the number of victims of Nazi war crimes in Italy to be 22,000, double the previously estimated figure. The victims were primarily Italian civilians, sometimes in retaliation for partisan attacks under the doctrine of Bandenbek√§mpfung (\\"bandit fighting\\"), and Italian Jews. The killing of Italian civilians by front-line units of the Wehrmacht and SS has sometimes been seen as stemming from a sense of betrayal the Germans felt by the Italians switching sides, but historians have argued that the reasons for atrocities and the brutal behaviour were more complex, often resulting from the military crisis caused by the German retreats and the fear of ambushes. Only very few soldiers of German divisions accused of war crimes ever stood trial and even fewer served time in jail after their conviction. Notable exceptions include Eduard Crasemann, commander of the 26th Panzer Division, which was involved in the Padule di Fucecchio massacre, and who was found guilty of war crimes by an Allied military tribunal and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, dying in jail in 1950, and Walter Reder, sentenced to life in prison by an Italian military court for his role in the Marzabotto massacre as the commander of the SS- Panzer-Aufkl√§rungsabteilung 16 of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, who was released in 1985. The 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann G√∂ring and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsf√ºhrer-SS were disproportionally involved in massacres of the civilian population during the war in Italy, the two divisions accounting for approximately one third of all civilians killed in war crimes in the country.Gentile, pp. 4 & 5 List Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS divisions that committed war crimes in Italy: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" -

Held at London's Grafton Galleries between April and September 1898, it featured 371 artworks made in Australia by 114 artists, and was the first major exhibition of Australian art to occur internationally. The exhibition focused almost exclusively on art from the previous ten years, a time of intense patriotic feeling in Britain's Australian colonies, which were then on the cusp of federating to form the Commonwealth of Australia. By staging the exhibition in London, the capital of the British Empire, the organisers sought to promote the idea of an emerging Australian tradition in Western art, and to depict the maturity of Australia as an embryonic nation. Some Australians also felt that local artists, compared to local writers, had hitherto been overlooked in Britain, and, as the Grafton Galleries catalogue highlighted, it was time to showcase a collection of works \\"for the judgement of connoisseurs outside of Australia.\\" In order to build a \\"representative\\" collection, the AGNSW trustees sought submissions from artists throughout the colonies. However, the final selection of works received criticism for evidencing a bias toward New South Wales artists, and several organisers, including Ashton, himself a prominent artist and taste-maker, were accused of self-promotion. Despite these controversies, the exhibition won considerable, if unanticipated, critical acclaim in Britain, and such was the show's popularity that Grafton Galleries kept it open for four months past the original closing date. It remains the largest exhibition of Australian art in Britain, and is also notable for its near equal representation of women artists, a far higher percentage than any other show of its kind. History Portrait of Julian Ashton by John Longstaff (1898) The main sponsor of the exhibition was Sydney philanthropist Eadith Walker, whose father, merchant banker and property developer Thomas Walker, left her with a sizeable inheritance in 1886. Taught that wealth \\"brought responsibilities and obligations\\", Eadith considered it her patriotic duty to support the development of Australian culture, in particular contemporary Australian art, as she was noted for her patronage of Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and other members of the impressionist Heidelberg School, acquiring many of their works. Upon appeal of the AGNSW trustees, Walker donated ¬£740 for the staging of the London exhibition, or three quarters of its total budget. Although she expressly wished to leave the exhibition's curation \\"in the hands of those immediately involved with the movement\\", Walker loaned four works to the show, among them Purple, Green and Gold by Streeton and his own View of Sydney Harbour. Apart from Walker, there were nine additional private lenders of art to the show. Conversely, \\"there was no shortage of supply for works offered by individual artists.\\" Tasked with selecting works for the show, the AGNSW trustees created committees from Adelaide, Brisbane, and Melbourne to suggest works from their respective colonies. The trustees arrived at their final decision under the advice of members of the Art Society and Society of Artists, both based in Sydney. One of the trustees, influential artist, teacher and president of the Society of Artists, Julian Ashton, had nineteen of his works selected, the most of any artist. For this, Ashton was accused of abusing his power, and in early 1898, the Minister's Department was presented a petition asking for Ashton to resign as a trustee. However, he was not the only organiser who received preferential treatment. Albert Henry Fullwood, vice president of the Society of Artists, would have seventeen works included. Similarly, William Lister Lister included fourteen of his canvases after the trustees chose him to oversee the selection of works from the Art Society, for which he served as vice president. Nepotism seemed to extend beyond New South Wales to Queensland with two paintings by Godfrey Rivers, the Queensland Art Gallery's secretary of trustees and curator, being the only ones selected from the museum's batch of submitted works. Despite \\"clear displays of favouritism\\", the final selection of works received praise for it uniting many professional and amateur artists of different styles. Although artists born and living in Australia contributed the majority of works, the show was not limited to this group, as had been reported by some uninformed British journalists. Provided the works submitted were created in Australia and \\"typical of the country\\",The Telegraph (21 April 1898), \\"Australian Exhibits En Route to London\\". p. 5. native-born artists residing overseas, such as Streeton, as well as migrant artists, such as Charles Conder, were welcome to apply. In total, forty-five works by Australian artists based in Europe were included in the exhibition. Another well-represented group were women artists, who, regarding the selection of works, almost equalled men. No other \\"major survey\\" of Australian art in London has come close to reaching this level of female representation. In their search for an appropriate London venue to stage the exhibition, the trustees required one that was \\"large enough for almost 400 exhibits, modern by repute to suit the nature of the work, and available in the busy spring exhibition season of art events\\". Grafton Galleries, situated on London's Bond Street and renowned as one of the city's \\"most modern\\" commercial venues, turned out to be a \\"perfect match\\". The exhibition opened on 2 April. Critical reception Robert Stevenson, one of London's leading art critics, found the show to be \\"bounding in virtuosity\\", and compared it favourably to the Australian art he had seen on display at the 1886 Colonial Exhibition, much of which he reviewed poorly at the time. \\"Now, from every wall of the Grafton accomplishment stares at you\\", he wrote. \\"I have been so much astonished at the rapid growth of Australian art that I feel any criticism of the work must savour of impertinence and ungraciousness.\\"\\"Australian Pictures in England\\". Leader (Melbourne). 21 May 1898. p. 8. The Westminster Gazette reported that the Australian artists \\"show a vigorous independence in many respects, and who, though not absolutely in the first rank, show an extremely interesting point of view and a graphic power which is really admirable.\\" The exhibition's plein airists, particularly Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts‚Äîregarded as leaders of the Heidelberg School movement‚Äîwere often singled out for praise. In reviewing Streeton's large square canvas, ‚ÄòThe purple noon's transparent might‚Äô (1896), The Studio declared that it \\"would hold its own in any London gallery.\\"\\"Australian Art in London\\". The Argus (Melbourne). 18 June 1898. p. 4. The Artist, too, listed the painting as a highlight of the show, and said that in Golden Summer, Eaglemont (1889), Streeton was also at his best.Reeves, William (1898). \\"Australian Art at the Grafton\\". The Artist and Journal of Home Culture (22), p. 105. Robert Stevenson commended the works of Heidelberg School artist Walter Withers, opining that they were perhaps the most beautiful on display. Many critics noted with surprise the degree to which modern French art had influenced Australian tendencies. Reviewing the collection as whole, Thomas Humphry Ward observed that, \\"the broad, summary treatment, the firm and yet careful drawing, and the manner of laying on paint are in origin French.\\" While The Westminster Gazette took \\"the greatest pleasure\\" in the \\"agreeable air of 'un- Britishness'\\" that pervaded the collection,\\"Australian Pictures in London\\". The Daily Telegraph (Sydney). 21 May 1898. p. 4. the critics for The Globe and The Architect lamented the clear influence of progressive French art on the Australians. The Architect's critic stated that, barring one or two exceptions, \\"there is nothing to suggest any tie between the colony and England, nor any work which is reminiscent of an English scene.\\" These two reviews‚Äîthe only mostly negative one to appear in the English press‚Äîpointed to a sense of \\"cultural or familial betrayal\\", and rather than criticise specific works, they \\"exposed the cultural, political and historical antagonism between the French and English, one which was being fought equally in the galleries as in contemporary newspapers.\\" British critics disagreed over whether the show demonstrated that a distinctive \\"Australian School\\" of art had emerged. In a mixed review, London's The Star concluded that the art of Australia \\"has no special distinction of its own\\", citing the strong French influence. On the other hand, The Times said that the techniques of French art, \\"by transplantation\\" to Australia, had \\"become, in a measure, transformed\\".\\"Australian Pictures in London\\". The Daily Telegraph (Sydney). 12 May 1898. p. 6. A London correspondent for Australia's The Age wrote: \\"The critics seem quite puzzled how to criticise. Their usual standards of comparison are useless.\\" He continued, saying that while some Australian artists drew on French influences, this did not sufficiently explain the difference between Australian and British art: Sales In the lead-up to the exhibition, Ashton, in a letter to Walker, predicted that the venture would generate ¬£1,000 through sales. His estimate was ultimately exceeded by ¬£131, with 49 works being purchased by 25 individual buyers. Given the organisers' expectations, and considering that approximately one third of the show's works were on loan and not available for sale, this proved to be a satisfactory rate of acquisition. Henry Bishop, Secretary of the Grafton Galleries, was the principal buyer at the exhibition, spending ¬£302 on eight pieces, including three major landscapes by Tasmanian Romanticist painter William Piguenit, the exhibition's most commercially successful artist. Charles Sedelmeyer, a leading art dealer based in Paris, purchased five works by four artists, notably Tudor St George Tucker's Sunset. Despite attracting rave reviews from English critics, the exhibited works of the Heidelberg School painters received little commercial success. David Davies' A Bush Home (1896), purchased by English artist Alfred East, was the only Heidelberg School painting to sell. In an article for Australia's Daily Telegraph, Piguenit highlighted the discrepancy between critical opinion and public taste in England: \\"The English people are not guided very largely by what they see in the papers about pictures. ... their purchase will be guided by fancy, not by critics.\\" Apart from Piguenit's sublime wilderness paintings and other traditional landscapes by the likes of William Lister Lister, buyers were also interested in the drawings and watercolours of the exhibition's women artists, especially their Australian floral subjects, which comprised almost half of sales. According to Petrit Abazi, the sales \\"indicate that art characterised by conventional, exotic and academic principles, and not the plein air or School of Paris adopted by the Australian van guard, was best received on the English market.\\" List of artists * Elizabeth Caroline Armstrong * Julian Ashton * Arthur Merric Boyd * Emma Minnie Boyd * R.

Since 1898, a number of exhibitions of Australian art with a national focus have been staged in London, most recently the Royal Academy's 2013 Australia show. None of these have matched the 1898 show in terms of volume of work on display or number of artists represented. Despite its seminal position as the first major exhibition of Australian art to be held overseas, the 1898 show has received little attention from scholars. It is often only a footnote in the major histories of Australian art, including William Moore's The Story of Australian Art (1934) and Bernard Smith's Australian Painting, 1788‚Äì1960 (1962), or not mentioned at all, as in the case of Robert Hughes' Art of Australia (1966). Instead, most scholarship on the display and reception of Australian art in London has focused on the 1950s and 1960s, a period when Australian artists enjoyed unprecedented levels of commercial and critical success internationally.

Cullman (January 7, 1918 ‚Äì August 28, 2011) was an American businessman who served as President and CEO of General Cigar Company and is credited with transforming the image of cigars. Biography Edgar Meyer Cullman was born to a Jewish family on January 7, 1918, the son of the son of Francis Nathan Wolff and Joseph Cullman Jr. He comes from a family that was deeply involved in the tobacco business. His great-grandfather was the wine and tobacco merchant Ferdinand Kullman who emigrated to the United States in 1848. His grandfather and uncle, Joseph and Jacob, founded the tobacco brokerage house Cullman Brothers in 1892. His father owned farmland in the Connecticut River Valley that grew the tobacco used for cigar wrappers. In 1929, his father purchased the Webster Tobacco Company after the 1929 stock market collapse and in 1941, his father and uncle, Howard S. Cullman, founded the investment company Cullman Brothers Incorporated to purchase Benson & Hedges. He had two brothers: Joseph Frederick Cullman III, who served as chairman and CEO of Philip Morris; and Lewis B. Cullman (married to Dorothy Cullman), known as the \\"father of the leveraged buyout.\\" In 1940, Cullman earned a B.A. in economics from Yale University in 1940. After school, his father secured him an entry-level job hand-rolling cigars at H. Anton Bock in Manhattan. In 1961, Cullman and a group of investors bought for $25 million a controlling interest in then the 2nd-largest cigar producer in the United States, New-York-based General Cigar Company which owned the brands White Owl, Tiparillo, Tijuana Smalls, and Macanudo. In 1962, he was elected president and CEO of General Cigar; he grew sales at the company from $70 million and 11% market share in 1963 to $220 million in 1967. General Cigar benefited from the switch of many tobacco consumers from cigarettes to cigars propelled by a 1964 surgeon general's report that demonstrated a link between cigarette smoking and cancer; and introduced smaller and milder cigars to attract cigarette smokers and the young market. In 1976, the company's name was changed to Culbro Corporation and he diversified the company into snack foods, Ex-Lax, packaging, real estate, and in 1996, opened the cigar club Club Macanudo in Manhattan. In 1981, he retired as president but remained as CEO until 2005 when the company was sold to Swedish Match. He died on August 28, 2011 in Stamford, Connecticut, aged 93. Personal life In 1938, he married Louise Bloomingdale (1919‚Äì2014), granddaughter of Lyman Bloomingdale; they had three children, Edgar Cullman Jr., Lucy Cullman Danziger, and Susan Cullman Kirby (married to attorney John Kirby).Hochstein, p. 351 References Category:1918 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:American tobacco industry executives Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Place of birth missing Category:Jewish American philanthropists Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:Cullman family ","title":"Edgar M.

It is currently observed in Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova on 28 May - the day of the anniversary of the formation of the Soviet Border Troops in 1918. Background The first Border Guards Day celebrations were marked on May 28, 1919, the first anniversary since the Border Troops were created as a directly reporting agency under the Cheka of Felix Dzerzhinsky, which was the one of the pioneer border protection forces in the modern world (together with the Polish Stra≈º Graniczna and the Italian Guardia di Finanza, among others), in the midst of the Russian Civil War, the first celebrations were low key owing to the duties of the border guards in the conflict. Celebrations around the world Although Border Guards Day is mainly celebrated in Russia, a number of former republics in the former USSR, have preserved and continue to celebrate this holiday on May 28. A number of other countries still celebrate the holiday on different dates. =Abkhazia= Abkhazia has recognized 28 May as Border Guards Day since its independence in 1991 and celebrates the holiday similarly to Russia. =Belarus= Belarus has recognized 28 May as Border Guards Day since its independence in 1991 and celebrates the holiday similarly to Russia.

The holiday was established as a professional holiday in 1958, by order of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Following the fall of the Fall of the Soviet Union, the status of the holiday was unclear due to the lack effort in the Russian government to make in an official holiday in the Russian Federation. President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree in 1994 officially making Border Guards Day a professional day off for the servicemen of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, which was founded 2 years earlier.–î–µ–Ω—å –ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –≤ 2018 –≥–æ–¥—É: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∑–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ Today, it is a celebration of more than 4 centuries of border protection and control in Russia, dating back to Prince Mikhail Ivanovich Vorotynsky's Zasechnaya cherta in the 16th century, an early prototype to the border checkpoints in operation today nationwide. =Tajikistan= Tajikistan has recognized 28 May as Border Guards Day since its independence in 1991 and celebrates the holiday similarly to Russia. 2014 celebrated the 20th anniversary since the establishment of the Tajik Border Troops.

Career  Suzuki earned his doctorate from Tohoku University in 1974, supervised by Masatoshi Koshiba. In 1982 he was appointed to the faculty of the T≈çky≈ç University. In 1993, he took concurrent positions as professor at the High Energy Physics Laboratory of Tohoku University and professor at the Institute of Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) of T≈çky≈ç University. Having taken part in the Kamiokande-II and Super-Kamiokande neutrino detection experiments, Suzuki was appointed Director of the Research Center for Neutrino Science in 1998 and led the KamLAND neutrino detection experiments. From 2006 until 2015 he was Director General of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) Accelerator Laboratory.  Scientific achievements  The Kamiokande-II experiment detected a burst of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A, the first observation of this kind, winning the research team the Asahi and Bruno Rossi prizes. Observations from the Super-Kamiokande experiment measured the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation (and hence neutrino mass) with unprecedented accuracy, thereby resolving the solar neutrino problem. For this accomplishment, the project was awarded the 1998 Asahi Prize. The KamLAND experiment was the first to detect geoneutrinos generated by the decay of radionuclides deep inside Earth. These observations provided the first direct measurements of the abundance of geoneutrino-producing elements and their spatial distribution in Earth's interior, marking the start of a new field of neutrino geoscience.  Awards  Suzuki received the Japanese Medal of Honor with purple ribbon in 2005, the Bruno Pontecorvo Prize in 2006, and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2016, shared with investigators from the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande, K2K / T2K, Daya Bay, and Sudbury neutrino observation consortia. He was elected a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2011.

The television series was created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and it is based on the 1973 film of the same name, written and directed by Michael Crichton. The third season stars an ensemble cast led by Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Tessa Thompson, newcomer Aaron Paul, and Ed Harris. Vincent Cassel is introduced as the main antagonist. The third season initially received positive reviews from critics, though reception became mixed during the second half. Reviews praised the performances, visuals and change in tone from the first two seasons, but criticized the story, dialogue and pacing, as well as the perceived lack of thematic depth. Plot summary The third season takes place three months after the events of the second season, with Dolores having escaped Westworld along with a few processing cores (\\"pearls\\"), including Bernard's. Taking residence in neo-Los Angeles in 2058, Dolores develops a relationship with Caleb, and comes to learn how artificial beings and lower- class humans are treated in the real world. Meanwhile, Maeve finds herself in another part of the Delos park, one based on Fascist Italy during World War II. William, who also left Westworld at the end of the second season, is now haunted by visions of his daughter Emily and Dolores.

A third season of the series was announced on May 1, 2018. Production began on April 13, 2019. Parts of filming took place in Downtown Los Angeles and Singapore during June 14, 2019. Additional filming took place over a ten-day period in Singapore around July 2019, which was used to present a version of Los Angeles about 40 years out from the time of the production of the show. Showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy had considered how they would introduce the \\"real world\\" outside of the park in the early days of developing Westworld. They wanted to go in the opposite dystopian direction that the 1982 film Blade Runner had gone and instead show a more optimistic view. The two had seen how Spike Jonze had filmed Her in Shanghai as a future Los Angeles, and took inspiration from many of Shanghai's designs. Joy, who had been suggested to shoot in Singapore by her friend and architect Bjarke Ingels, said the city was apt for the show as \\"It's the ways in which nature entangle with modernity here\\". The show's main cast, including Wood, Newton, Wright, and Paul had been spotted at several Singapore locations during the shooting period across Pulau Ubin, Chinatown and the Central Business District (CBD) within the city, and included specific landmarks such as the National Gallery Singapore, Esplanade Park, School of the Arts, the Helix Bridge, Marina One, the Parkroyal Hotel, LASALLE College of the Arts, and the Oasia Hotel Downtown. Additional filming took place at the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, Spain. Filming also took place in Los Angeles, using computer- generated imagery to fill in actual buildings from Shanghai, futuristic buildings inspired by those from Shanghai, as well as those from Ingels' unused portfolio. The production team collaborated with Jon Favreau who led the advances in the special effects filming for The Mandalorian on how they combined full exterior filming with on-set filming and digital post-production to create virtually expandable sets at these sites as needed. When filming interior shots that took place in Los Angeles, the production team had a mandate to try to show as much of the city skyline as possible through windows or other features. Much of the city's brutalist architecture was also features given how frequently these buildings were repurposed from their original function. Some filming took place at La F√°brica near Barcelona. While they had been able to film in the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Millard House in Pasadena, as Arnold's home in the second season as it was available on the market, by the time they started filming season three, the home had been sold and they could not arrange filming rights. Instead, they opted to rebuild the home on set for this season. With Ingels' help to negotiation with Ricardo Bofill's son, they were also able to obtain rights to film one day at Bofill's La F√°brica near Barcelona, which stood in for Serac's laboratories and home, though they had to later build additional sets with the building's design principles for later filming. According to production designer Howard Cummings, they wanted to focus on concrete buildings that could look like the result of 3D printing. The structure of the third season is more linear than past seasons, which Variety Adam B. Vary said was a \\"sleek, fleet, Heat-style- crime-thriller-with-robots\\" rather than a \\"time-twisting structure\\" from the second season. Nolan and Joy stated that season 3 would have a much more comprehensible story line, with Nolan stating \\"This season is a little less of a guessing game and more of an experience with the hosts finally getting to meet their makers.\\" However, they also said that they were able to take a more direct narrative approach as, according to Nolan, \\"We're very lucky in that we're at a place with HBO where they let us make the show we want to make\\" without having to \\"dumb the show down\\". =Music= Ramin Djawadi returned as the series composer. An orchestral cover of Guns N' Roses' \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" was featured in the main trailer and released as a single on February 21, 2020. An orchestral version of Moses Sumney's \\"Doomed\\" was featured at the end of the episode \\"The Absence of Field\\", alongside the original song. An orchestral version of The Weeknd's \\"Wicked Games\\", featured in the episode \\"The Mother of Exiles\\", was released as a single on April 5, 2020. The soundtrack album for season 3 was released on May 4, 2020. An orchestral version of \\"Brain Damage\\" from Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon was featured at the end of \\"Crisis Theory\\", alongside the original song; the song was also used in the first trailer for the season. =Marketing= A first teaser trailer was presented at the 2019 San Diego Comic Con on July 20, 2019. A teaser for season 3 was released on November 9, 2019, presented as a video advertisement for the fictional company Incite, Inc. At the Consumer Electronics Show on January 9, 2020, HBO held a special event hosted by Incite, with \\"hosts\\" attending the invited guests' needs. The premiere date for the third season was announced on January 12, 2020, alongside a teaser trailer for the season. The full season's trailer was released on February 20, 2020. Additional teaser videos were found through an alternate reality game via the Incite website that was updated on February 22, 2020. Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 75% for the season based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.05/10; the average episode score is 76%. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Westworld succeeds in rebooting itself by broadening its scope beyond its titular amusement park while tightening its storytelling clarity ‚Äì although some may feel that the soul has been stripped from this machine in the process.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Reviews became increasingly mixed as the season progressed, with the episodes \\"Genre\\", \\"Passed Pawn\\" and \\"Crisis Theory\\" receiving the lowest Rotten Tomatoes approval ratings for the series to date. Reviewers criticized the season for its dialogue, thin characterization, and depiction of the real world, which was said to lack the vastness and depth of the park. CNNs Brian Lowry wrote that \\"the show has become increasingly incomprehensible, at least for anyone not willing to put in the work trying to remember all the assorted connections, further complicated by the fact that dying in Westworld is often not a permanent state of affairs, amid the questions about who's truly human and who actually isn't.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kristen Baldwin gave the series a \\"B‚Äì\\" and said: \\"After spending three seasons struggling through maddeningly complicated time-loops, it's time the writers let Dolores, Maeve, and Bernard control-alt-delete themselves\\" while Darren Franich wrote that series had \\"lost its way\\" and gave the season a \\"C\\". Reviewing the season finale for IndieWire, Ben Travers said: \\"Season 3 made a point of stripping away the rest of Westworlds building blocks: The park? Left behind. The maze? Gone. But the moral questions meant to keep you invested in the characters largely disappear, too. Season 3 doesn't bother developing its characters because it refuses to let them question the nature of their own reality.\\" =Ratings= =Accolades= For the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Thandie Newton was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Jeffrey Wright was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. The series received nine additional nominations in creative and technical categories.

Started in September 1983, it is the oldest running publication for bisexual women. Bi Women Quarterly is published four times each year, and accepts a variety of submission types including fiction writing, nonfiction writing, poetry, news articles, book reviews, letters to the editor, and visual art. The publication is \\"staffed entirely by volunteers,\\" and is stationed in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood in the city of Boston. The goal of the publication is to amplify the voices of women who fall under the bisexual+ umbrella. Bi Women Quarterly uses the term bisexual+, coined by GLAAD, in order to encompass identities including but not limited to bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, omnisexual, fluid, and queer. BWQ's definition of womanhood includes transgender women, nonbinary/genderqueer individuals, cisgender women, and other woman-aligned identities. Bisexual activist Robyn Ochs is the publication's editor.  Publication History  The Boston Bisexual Women's Network website includes archived issues of Bi Women's Quarterly dating back to 2009. Current editor Robyn Ochs donated \\"the only complete collection\\" of BWQ to Harvard University's Schlesinger Library in order to ensure the preservation and digitization of the publication. This digitized collection holds every iteration of BWQ from 1983 to 2010 in an online format. Earlier publications of BWQ oftentimes include sections with redacted names and contact information, in order to protect the privacy of individuals. Thus many of the publication's original contributors and editors' names are not known. This group of individuals, originally eight in number, connected through a meeting on bisexuality conducted at the Cambridge Women's Center. Ranging in age from 23 to 36, these women labeled themselves the BiVocals, and took pride in the diversity of lifestyle and experience among them. Members of the BiVocals teamed up with other bisexual, lesbian, and women's groups, in order to create the Boston Bisexual Women's Network. The purpose of this network was to synthesize the already existing resources for bisexual women in the area; the BBWN as an organization helped to cultivate support groups, consciousness- raising meetings, educational resources, and resources for political action. The first goal of this group was to create a visible space for bisexuals in Boston's Lesbian/Gay Pride March 1983. Publication and content  Each issue of Bi Women Quarterly is curated from a selection of submissions based on previously released prompts. These prompts serve as points of inspiration for writers, artists, and creatives that identify as women under the bisexual+ umbrella. Examples of prompts include coming out stories, bisexuality and disability, mental health, and visibility. Many of these prompts serve as a call to action for bisexual+ women from a variety of backgrounds, in order to display the diverse and intersectional experiences and opinions that exist within the bisexual+ community. = Advice Column = Bi Women Quarterly includes an advice column, currently authored by a woman who goes by the pseudonym of A. Rose Bi. She is a self-described reader of BWQ, with experience in LGBTQ+ specialization for fields such as Cognitive Science, sexual assault advocacy, feminism, and media representation. Prior to the introduction of A. Rose Bi, author Tiggy Upland ran a column entitled Ask Tiggy. = Calendar = At the end of each issue, BWQ includes a Calendar section. This section is dedicated to advertising upcoming events in the Metro-Boston area that are relevant to the experiences of bisexual+ women. Included in this section are the meeting times for a number of monthly groups, including those created for bisexual+ or questioning individuals who are in heterosexual relationships, bisexual+ youth, and bisexual+ individuals in general. Also included in this section are dates for different pride events, such as Boston Pride, the Boston Dyke March, and AIDS Walk Boston. = News Briefs = The semi-regular News Briefs section of BWQ is currently written by Robyn Ochs. It is a space dedicated to sharing news related to the bisexual+ community. Examples of this content include bisexual representation on television, in politics, and other public platforms. The publication's Spring 2015 issue covered the election of Kate Brown, the United States' first openly bisexual governor. News Briefs also covers news of bisexual representation in the media, including Grey's Anatomy's openly bisexual Callie Torres, and openly bisexual+ celebrities such as Lady Gaga. =Research corner= Included in many issues of BWQ, the Research Corner is a space to include important research related to bisexuality and bisexual+ identities. It is currently supervised by scholars Renate Baumgarner and Soudeh Rad. Subscription and cost  Readers of Bi Women Quarterly are strongly encouraged to donate to the Boston Bisexual Women's Network. Subscribers are not required to pay for the publication, but donation suggestions are outlined on the BBWN website. Donors acquire different titles depending on their contributions; the average reader's suggested donation range is $20‚Äì30 USD. Those who donate $30‚Äì99 per issue are labeled supporters, while those who donate $100 or more are labeled Goddess/Sustainer. According to the publication's website, each print issue of the magazine costs approximately $2000 to produce and send out.

History According to a note in the Liber Originum by abbot Caspar Molitoris, the monastery was founded by Guta, a nun of the Sitzenkirch Monastery, with money from an inheritance, in the year 1181. The first building was likely right on the bank of the river Rhine, but was later rebuilt closer to the village of Auggen. In 1260 nons from Sitzenkirch joined Gutnau, though without permission from the abbot of Saint Blaise Abbey, Black Forest, and were made to return to Sitzenkirch in 1261. In 1423 the monastery burned down to its foundation, and was restored only provisionally. By 1492 the monastery was so impoverished that it could no longer sustain itself, and became subordinated to Saint Blaise. By 1630 its possessions had fallen to B√ºrgeln, and by 1657 to Krozingen. The monastery's buildings were destroyed by the French in August 1675; in 1780 the last remaining property rights were sold. There are no remains of the buildings.

It was established in 1855 by a group of farmers. Regular distillation was discontinued in 2000, but trial runs were later carried out. In 2012, the distillery was added to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage list of priority technical and industrial cultural heritage, after which NOK 7 million was allocated to restore the distillery to its former condition. An additional NOK 4.7 million was allocated for the distillery in 2017. It has been owned by the company Atlungstad Brenneri AS since 2011. In October 2013, the owners signed a cooperation agreement with the Arcus company that they would restart regular production of akvavit at the Atlungstad Distillery. The distillery is open for tours in the summer. History The Atlungstad Distillery was established in 1855, when a number of farmers gathered together in a cooperative society, and it replaced several smaller distilleries in the area. Because water was important for many of the distillery processes, it was built at the mouth of Fjetre Creek (Fjetrebekken), where it empties into Mj√∏sa. The buildings were built of red brick, which is typical of the industrial architecture of the late 1800s, and it was also equipped with a smithy and a barn. Characteristic features of the structure are its high column still and the high factory chimney. The buildings contain potato bins, alcohol and distillation equipment, and akvavit storage. The distillery burned in 1864, but it was rebuilt two years later within the same walls. It was expanded in 1911, and in 1954 a new seed- cleaning facility was built. In 1920, the company Atlungstad Finspritfabrik (Atlungstad Neutral Spirits) was dissolved, and the stocks of distillates were distributed to the shareholders. A new company, Stange Brandenderi (Stange Distilling), was established a few days later. In 1925, the retailer Vinmonopolet took over distillation of neutral spirits, and a year later the distilling company was given the name Stange Br√¶nderi & Fr√∏forretning (Stange Distilling & Seed Company). A year later it was merged with the distilleries in Tangen and Romedal to form Hedmark Fr√∏forretning og Brenneri (Hedmark Seed Company and Distillery). In 1995 this company was purchased by HOFF Norske Potetindustrier. Regular distillation at the Atlungstad Distillery was discontinued in 2000, and it was converted into a reserve distillery that operated on an as-needed basis. This activity was also discontinued in 2008. In 2011, the distillery was acquired by Atlungstad Brenneri AS, which started test distillation that fall. In 2013, the company signed an agreement with Arcus to once again produce akvavit on a regular basis.

Its founder, Robin Zirwanda, the band's percussionist and lead singer, writes and sings the songs in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic. The name of the band Azadoota (pronounced ah-zah-doota) means 'freedom' in the Assyrian language.Azadoota musicians Represented by traditional costumes worn in the ancient Assyrian royal court, Azadoota is one of the few professional bands in the world that performs in the Assyrian language, and is the only Assyrian act to target their presentations specifically to mainstream audiences. The band performs original Assyrian music which the members describe as \\"contemporary Assyrian dance-rock worldbeat\\". The employment of styles derived from popular music in combination with the Assyrian lore provides the band's music a quality where listeners can relate to. History Azadoota's lead singer and founder, Robin Haider Zirwanda, was born in Dora, Baghdad in 1954. In his childhood, Zirwanda stated ‚ÄúI used to find the key to the music room and play all the instruments. But the drums were for me‚Äù. He migrated to Australia unaccompanied in 1971 when he was 17 years old with a guitar and a suitcase, not knowing a word in English. After his family arrived, they settled in Arnhem Land in the town of Nhulunbuy. Zirwanda then joined a band and formed a close bond with the indigenous community there. After relocating to Sydney in the 1980s, he worked as a percussionist in the cabaret scene and also with original bands on the pub circuit. In 1986, Zirwanda played with American folk singer Don McLean as his percussionist in McLean's 3-month Australian tour. In the early 1990s, the rising prominent of world music inspired Robin to create his own music in his native Aramaic language. Even though Zirwanda wrote lyrics in Assyrian, his music was strongly influenced by the styles he'd been performing as a percussionist earlier in his career, and this became the foundation for Azadoota. In 1996, the band was formed, containing members from the Netherlands to Argentina, combining Latin American music and harmony spanning across musical genres and global cultures, to project and preserve the Assyrian identity in the modern-day world, with its first gig being held in Byron Bay.Azadoota - Triple J Regarding the name of the band, Zirwanda states, ‚ÄúAzadoota is Assyrian for 'freedom', and our music celebrates of the freedom we have in this country [Australia] to express ourselves through music.‚Äù They released the album ‚ÄúPlanetarian‚Äù in 2008 and ‚ÄúBeyond Bridges‚Äù in 2011. Their recent songs ‚ÄúLishana (Jesus Spoke My Language)‚Äù, ‚ÄúMazreta‚Äù (Spinning Top) and ‚ÄúUnity‚Äù are a plea for Assyrians in the western world to protect their heritage in order to secure their future. ‚ÄúLishana‚Äù (\\"language\\"), which came out in 2015, became a moderate success among the Assyrians in the diaspora.Picatic - Azadoota Concerts Azadoota performing in Toronto, Canada. The band has regularly performed at a diverse range of venues, from the smallest bush halls and pubs to the most well-known festivals. Azadoota has most notably performed at WOMADelaide in 2014 and Woodford Folk Festival in 2016, which drew in unsuspecting listeners due to the band's ethnic rhythms, theatrical musicality, and the sounds of the ancient language. The band regularly performs at the Assyrian new year festival in Fairfield Showground in Sydney each April, which typically draws 10,000 revellers.Community Radio‚Äôs Australian Music Catalogue and Distribution Service In August 2018, the band toured North America for the first time. Regarding foreigners listening to Azadoota's music, Zirwanda states ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable; the Aussies buy your CDs, come to your gigs, and pay to see you sing in Assyrian.‚ÄùAzadoota blends traditional Assyrian rhythms with contemporary music On performing at concerts and festivals, Zirwanda states: > Performing at festivals is a big deal for us, because we represent such a > little known-nation. We are the only band in the world performing Assyrian > music on the mainstream stage, so we carry a great responsibility to spread > awareness of culture and the issues facing our people in the global > community. Festivals offer us a valuable opportunity to do this. Compared to > 20 years ago, I think the audiences now are much more receptive to global > music.Interview with Robin Zirwanda by Bellbottom Arts & Culture, January > 2018 Musical style The band makes use of a horn section, rhythm guitar, brass instruments, guira and tambourine. The band may also use rhythms of Assyrian folk music (each associated with folk-dance moves), whilst presenting them in contemporary arrangements. A merengue groove may also be used. Robin Zirwanda fronts the band with timbales and doumbek, usually switching casually from Cuban rhythms to those of his ethnicity. Azadoota's music spans genres and generations, with diverse music styles ‚Äì from percussive-heavy dance tunes inspired by Caribbean music genres, funk, folk rock, jazz fusion and reggae, to sentimental ballads. According to the band's lead singer, the horn section indicates a revival of Assyrian culture and a resistance of the destruction occurring in their ancestral lands. Azadoota performs in attire inspired by their ancient royal ancestors, such as Ashurbanipal, Ashurnasirpal I and Nebuchadnezzar ‚Äì which would showcase a flamboyant sight and also inspires discussion on themes of Assyrian heritage, musical history and cultural continuity. About the band's style, Zirwanda states: > We use contemporary instrumentation with traditional Assyrian rhythms and > song-forms, but because I'm a percussionist by trade I find there's a fair > bit of Latin and Afro-Cuban influence in my songwriting...I sing about my > homeland Iraq, about belonging to a nation without a land, about family and > of course about love. Most [of our] songs are upbeat and danceable, with a > positive message. Regarding his skills, Zirwanda states, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in percussion, you learn all the rhythms: congo, rumba. I‚Äôd be tapping on the kitchen table, then I‚Äôd start singing a song, and I‚Äôd write it that way.‚Äù The band's front man Zirwanda cites Youssou N'Dour, Salif Keita and Santana as his influence, and as well as his father Awimalk Haider, who had made jazz music in the 1960s in Iraq, blending it with Assyrian folk. Triple J likens their musical style to Shakira and The Cat Empire. Zirwanda has oftentimes been assisted by his father Awimalk Haider with the songwriting because of his talent as a lyricist and knowledge in the Assyrian language.Two of us: Robin Zirwanda and Awimalk Haider by Sydney Morning Herald, Nina Karnikowski, 25 August 2012 Although the band has gotten positive reception from Assyrians, some have found that its method is concealing the true Assyrian identity and suppressing its integrity. In response to this, Zirwanda says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get our name [as Assyrians] out there in the world, in the bigger picture. Why not expose yourself so the world knows about you?‚Äù.

It is displayed in the church of Santa Caterina in Pisa, a church once belonging to the Dominican order.National Gallery of Art, short biography of Lippo Memmi. Description The painting is a complex arrangement exalting the role of Thomas Aquinas as a scholar of religious knowledge, his placement among the Four Evangelists and philosophers. In the center of the panel, the largest figure is the seated tonsured monk St Thomas Aquinas, below a Christ inside a mandorla. Linear rays tie his work to the Four Evangelists and Moses and St Paul above the gilded circle. Flanking him are Aristotle and Plato. Averroes and figures in lower register A guide from 1867, while erroneously attributing the painting to Taddeo Gaddi, describes some of the contents including the quote from Proverbs 8:7, which Aquinas used to introduce his Summa contra gentilesHandbook of Florence and Its Environs, by John Murray (Firm), London 1867, page 47.The Jew in the Art of the Italian Renaissance, by Dana E. Katz, page 65. > \\"Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God, and > the Spirit of Wisdom came to me. I preferred her before sceptres and > thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.\\" Below the feet of Aquinas is a dejected Averroes, horizontal and looks away with book inverted. The guide provides a long elaboration of the lower figures, but careful examination fails to identify many of the attributes described. The figures likely represent monks and nuns of the Catholic orders, inspired by the words of Aquinas.

Nishikawa's most notable achievements were as founder and leader of the K2K and T2K experiments. K2K, which ran from 1999 until 2005, used the Super Kamiokande detector in Kamioka to measure a controlled beam of neutrinos emitted by the KEK proton synchrotron. The K2K team verified with greater accuracy the neutrino oscillations observed in atmospheric neutrinos by the Super Kamiokande experiment. The T2K experiment, which began in 2010 as a successor to K2K, used neutrino beams from the J-PARC proton accelerator with the Super Kamiokande detector to observe neutrino oscillations with specific start and end flavors, thereby measuring the parameters of this flavor-switching behavior. In 2016, Nishikawa and the K2K and T2K groups received the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics together with other neutrino research collaborations. He was awarded the Nishina Memorial Prize in 2005, and the Bruno Pontecorvo Prize in 2016.

There are more than 1,500 known rock cut structures in India, out of which about 1000 were made by Buddhists (mainly between 200 BCE and 600 CE), 300 by Hindus (from 600 CE to 1200 CE), and 200 by Jains (from 900 CE to 1200 CE). Many of these structures contain works of art of global importance, and many later caves from the Mahayana period are adorned with exquisite stone carvings. These ancient and medieval structures represent significant achievements of structural engineering and craftsmanship. In India, caves have long been regarded as places of sanctity. Caves that were enlarged or entirely man-made were felt to hold the same sanctity as natural caves. In fact, the sanctuary in all Indian religious structures, even free-standing ones, retains the same cave-like feeling of sacredness, being small and dark without natural light. The oldest rock-cut architecture in India is found in the Barabar caves, Bihar built around the 3rd century BCE. Of these caves, mostly build by Emperor Ashoka and his grandson Dasaratha for the ascetic sect of the Ajivikas, two caves are thought to have been dedicated to the Buddhist: Karan Chaupar cave, and possibly the Lomas Rishi cave. Most other Buddhist caves are then found in the western Deccan, consisting in shrines and monasteries, dating between 100 BCE and 170 CE. Originally, they were probably accompanied by wooden structures, which would have deteriorated over time. Historically, rock-cut temples have retained a wood-like theme in adornment; skilled craftsmen learned to mimic timber texture, grain, and structure. The earliest cave temples include the Bhaja Caves, the Karla Caves, the Bedse Caves, the Kanheri Caves, and some of the Ajanta Caves. Relics found in these caves suggest a connection between the religious and the commercial, as Buddhist missionaries often accompanied traders on the busy international trading routes through India. Some of the more sumptuous cave temples, commissioned by wealthy traders, included pillars, arches, and elaborate facades during the time maritime trade boomed between the Roman Empire and south-east Asia. Although free standing structural temples were also being built, such as the Bairat Temple (3rd century BCE) and the various free-standing apsidal temples in Sanchi, Taxila or Ter, rock-cut cave temples continued to be built in parallel. Later rock- cut cave architecture became more sophisticated as in the Ajanta Caves, belonging to a second, and last, wave of Buddhist cave building. The last Buddhist caves were built around the 6th century CE. Architecture  Architectural elements are borrowed from: * Indian rock-cut architecture * Buddhist temple architecture * Buddhist architecture Early natural caves Saptaparni Cave, a retreat of the Buddha. The earliest caves employed by humans were natural caves used by local inhabitants for a variety of purposes, such as shrines and shelters. Evidence suggests that the caves were first occupied and slightly altered during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods, up to about 6000 BC, though the changes do not really amount to architecture. Early examples included overhanging rock decorated with rock-cut designs. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, a World Heritage Site, are located on the edge of the Deccan Plateau, where dramatic erosion has left massive sandstone outcrops. The area's many caves and grottos have yielded primitive tools and decorative rock paintings. During the time of the Buddha (c. 563/480 or c. 483/400 BCE), Buddhist monks were also in the habit of using natural caves, such as the Saptaparni Cave, southwest from Rajgir, Bihar. Many believe it to be the site in which Buddha spent some time before his death,Digha Nikaya 16, Maha-Parinibbana Sutta, Last Days of the Buddha, Buddhist Publication Society and where the first Buddhist council was held after the Buddha died (paranirvana). The Buddha himself had also used the Indrasala Cave for meditation, starting a tradition of using caves, natural or man-made, as religious retreats, that would last for over a millennium.Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.97-99 File:Meditation area, Griddhakuta Hill, Rajgir.jpgA natural cave for meditation in Vulture Peak, one of the favourite abodes of the Buddha.

Natural caves continued to be used for a long time, and over a rather wide area, as shown by the Saru Maru caves (also known as Pangoraria or Budhani caves) in Madhya Pradesh. More than 45 rock shelters were found in the Pangaroria area, which is a Buddhist site with multiple stupas and dwellings. Ashoka came here as a young prince when he was governor of the northwest, based in Vidisha, as shown by a commemorative inscription in one of the two natural caves. He later also had his Minor Rock Edict in the second cave at Saru Maru.Gupta, The Origins of Indian Art, p.202Archaeological Survey of India According to Gupta, the Saru Maru caves also display a certain level of man-made improvements, such as the creation of rock-cut steps and benches for monks. This possibly is a preliminary step before the advent, under Ashoka, of full-fledged artificial caves, such as those of Barabar. The Saru-Maru caves may present an evolutionary step between fully natural Buddhist caves of east India, and the highly sophisticated fully artificial, rock-cut, caves that appeared at Barabar circa 250 BCE.Gupta, The Origins of Indian Art, p.196 Alternatively, it has been suggested that the next stage of artificial caves building at Barabar was such a remarkable feat of engineering, with the use of large-scale polishing techniques without precedents in the history of India, that they were probably due to foreign influence, and derived from the stone-working techniques of the Achaemenids, having spread to India after the destruction of the empire by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE and the displacement of Persian and Perso-Greek artists and technicians.Maharashtra, Marg Publications, 1985, Pdf \\"The surface of the walls are polished to a mirror-like finish, an exclusive feature of Mauryan architecture and sculpture, first derived through the media of Achamenid art after the disintegration of the Persian Empire in AD 330 and the dispersal of skilled Persian and Perso-Greek artisans \\" Artificial caves of Eastern India (3rd-2nd centuries BCE) In the 3rd century BCE Indian rock-cut architecture began to develop, starting with the already highly sophisticated and state- sponsored Barabar caves in Bihar, personally dedicated by Ashoka to the ascetic sect of the Ajivikas circa 250 BCE.Chandra, Pramod (2008), South Asian arts, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The precise identity of the Ajivikas is not well known, and it is even unclear if they were a divergent sect of the Buddhists or the Jains. These artificial caves exhibit an amazing level of technical proficiency, the extremely hard granite rock being cut in geometrical fashion and polished to a mirror-like finish. There is another cave with the structure and polishing qualities of the Barabar caves, but without any inscription. This is the Sitamarhi Cave, 20 km from Rajgir, 10 km south-west of Hisua, also dated of the Maurya empire. It is smaller than the Barabar caves, measuring only 4.91x3.43m, with a ceiling height of 2.01m. The entrance is also trapezoidal, as for the Barabar caves.Gupta, The roots of Indian Art, p.194- The caves were carved out of granite, an extremely hard rock, then finished with a very nice polishing of the inner surface, giving a mirror effect of a great regularity, as well as an echo effect.Ashoka in Ancient India by Nayanjot Lahiri This large-scale polish is reminiscent of polishing on smaller surfaces of the Maurya statuary, particularly visible on the pillars and capitals of the Ashoka pillars. Commenting of Mauryan sculpture, John Marshall once wrote about the \\"extraordinary precision and accuracy which characterizes all Mauryan works, and which has never, we venture to say, been surpassed even by the finest workmanship on Athenian buildings\\".The Early History of India by Vincent A. SmithAnnual report 1906-07 p.89 This know-how seems to have disappeared again after the Maurya period, none of the later caves such as the Ajanta caves having this characteristic of polished surfaces.Indian History The very act of digging artificial caves in the rock, of which the Barabar caves represent the oldest case in India, was probably inspired by the caves dug in the rock of the Achaemenids, as is the case in Naqsh-e Rostam.\\"But it is also likely that the predilection towards a cave and rock-cut tradition was stimulated by an Achaemenid model, such as the royal tombs at Naksh-i-Rustam. Thus, like other aspects of Maurya culture, the cave excavations may have been the result of both indigenous and foreign elements.\\" in \\"The Art of Ancient India: Buddhist, Hindu, Susan L. Huntington Jain, Weatherhill, 1985, File:Karan Chaupar cave.jpgKaran Chaupar, volume plan (10.2x4.27m) File:Inscription of Karna Chaupar cave.jpgDedicatory inscription by Ashoka to the Ajivikas, in Karan Chaupar, Barabar caves.Photos File:Karna Chopar cave inside view.jpgPolished interior of Karan Chaupar =Imperial sponsorship= Emperor sponsored the Barabar caves, as revealed by his dedicatory inscriptions. These remarkable caves were conceived under the Imperial sponsorship of Ashoka and his grandson Dasaratha Maurya. The cost involved in the rock-cutting and the refined polishing work was probably enormous, and was never replicated again in subsequent caves. Ashoka dedicated the caves of Sudama and Visvakarma to the Ajivikas in the 12th year of his reign, when his religious evolution towards Buddhism was not yet fully completed. Later, Ashoka built the caves of Lomas Rishi (without dated inscription, but posterior to Sudama on architectural grounds) and Karna Chopar (19th year of his reign), at a time when he had become a firm advocate of Buddhism, as known from the Edicts of Ashoka. Therefore, he may naturally have offered the last two caves of Lomas Rishi and Karna Chopar to the Buddhists, although the former has no inscription and the latter has an inscription which only indirectly suggests that. Ashoka's inscription from Karna Chopar Cave does not mention the Ajivikas, and seems rather to refer to the Buddhist practice of retirement () during the rainy season. In addition, the inverted swastika with upward arrow at the end of the inscription would be more of a Buddhist character. It is therefore probable that this cave was planned for Buddhist monks.Buddhist Architecture par Huu Phuoc Le p.102 The affiliation of the last two caves to Buddhism would be coherent with the fact that the architecture of the gate of Lomas Rishi became a reference for the development of the Chaitya arch in Buddhist cave architecture for the following centuries, whereas the Hindus or the Jains caves essentially did not follow this architectural example. This would also mean that the decorated gate of Lomas Rishi was a Buddhist invention, which was emulated in Buddhist architecture in the following centuries. Artificial caves of Western India After the Barabar caves, the earliest known rock-cut Buddhist monasteries date to the 1st century BCE in the Western Ghats in western India. Huge efforts were made at building religious caves in Western India until the 6th century CE. However, the polishing of cave walls was abandoned, never to be revived. Such grandiose caves as Karla Caves (1st century CE) or the Ajanta Caves (5th century CE) do not have any polishing either. This may be due to the fact that Mauryan caves where dedicated and sponsored by the Mauryan Imperial government, allowing for huge resources and efforts to be spent, whereas later caves were essentially the result of donations by commoners, who could not afford as high a level of spending.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist architecture, p.99 =First wave of construction (2nd century BCE- 2nd century CE)= Probably owing to the 2nd century BCE fall of the Mauryan Empire and the subsequent persecutions of Buddhism under Pushyamitra Sunga, it is thought that many Buddhists relocated to the Deccan under the protection of the Andhra dynasty, thus shifting the cave-building effort to western India: an enormous effort at creating religious caves (usually Buddhist or Jain) continued there until the 2nd century CE, culminating with the Karla Caves or the Pandavleni Caves. These caves generally followed an apsidal plan with a stupa in the back for the chaityas, and a rectangular plan with surrounding cells for the viharas. When Buddhist missionaries arrived, they naturally gravitated to caves for use as temples and abodes, in accord with their religious ideas of asceticism and the monastic life. The Western Ghats topography, with its flat-topped basalt hills, deep ravines, and sharp cliffs, was suited to their cultural inclinations. First western artificial vihara caves (100-70 BCE) Several simple viharas started to be cut in the rock, such as Cave 19 of the Nasik Caves. It is a small Vihara, 14 feet 3 inches square, with six cells, two on each side; their doors are surmounted by the Chaitya-arch ornament connected by a frieze of \\"rail pattern\\" in some places wavy. In the front wall are two lattice windows, and in the veranda two slender square pillars, the middle portion of the shaft being chamfered to an octagonal shape.The cave temples of India, Fergusson, James, W.H. Allen &Co; p.274ff (Public domain text) The cave is exceedingly plain in style, and the remarkable rectangularity of all its parts, agree perfectly with what might be expected in a Vihara of the first or second century BCE. Its close family likeness to Cave No.12 at Ajanta and others at Bhaja and Kondane, all of the earliest age, suggest about the same date. The earliest of the Kanheri Caves were excavated in the 1st and 2nd centuries B.C., as were those at Ajanta, which were occupied continuously by Buddhist monks from 200 BCE to 650 AD. As the Buddhist ideology encouraged involvement in trade, monasteries often became stopovers for inland traders and provided lodging houses along trade routes. Cave No.19 at the Nasik Caves has one inscription of king Krishna of the Satavahanas, which is the oldest known Satavahana inscription, dated to 100-70 BCEEpigraphia Indica p.93 Inscription No.22 File:094_Cave_12,_Vihara_Cells_(34123037202).jpgCave 12 in Ajanta, another early vihara with monk cells.

Rock-cut chaityas halls Facades were added to the exteriors while the interiors became designated for specific uses, such as monasteries (viharas) and worship halls (chaityas). Over the centuries, simple caves began to resemble free-standing buildings, needing to be formally designed and requiring highly skilled artisans and craftsmen to complete. These artisans had not forgotten their timber roots and imitated the nuances of a wooden structure and the wood grain in working with stone. The earliest rock-cut chaityas, similar to free-standing ones, consisted of an inner circular chamber with pillars to create a circular path around the stupa and an outer rectangular hall for the congregation of the devotees. Over the course of time, the wall separating the stupa from the hall was removed to create an apsidal hall with a colonnade around the nave and the stupa.Dehejia, V. (1972). Early Buddhist Rock Temples. Thames and Hudson: London. . The chaitya at Bhaja Caves is perhaps the earliest surviving chaitya hall, constructed in the second century BCE. It consists of an apsidal hall with stupa. The columns slope inwards in the imitation of wooden columns that would have been structurally necessary to keep a roof up. The ceiling is barrel vaulted with ancient wooden ribs set into them. The walls are polished in the Mauryan style. It was faced by a substantial wooden facade, now entirely lost. A large horseshoe-shaped window, the chaitya-window, was set above the arched doorway and the whole portico-area was carved to imitate a multi-storeyed building with balconies and windows and sculptured men and women who observed the scene below. This created the appearance of an ancient Indian mansion.ASI, \\"Bhaja Caves\\" ; Michell, 352 This, like a similar facade at the Bedse Caves is an early example of what James Fergusson noted in the nineteenth century: \\"Everywhere ... in India architectural decoration is made up of small models of large buildings\\".Quoted in Hardy, 18 ;Maturity The Great Chaitya in the Karla Caves, Maharashtra, India, 1st century CE. As mercantile and royal endowments grew, cave interiors became more elaborate, with interior walls decorated in paintings, reliefs, and intricate carvings. Numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donatory inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials, and even foreigners such as Yavanas (Greeks) representing about 8% of all inscriptions.Buddhist architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.98-99 The Indo-Scythian dynasty of the Western Satraps too sponsored numerous Buddhist caves, as seen from their dedications at Karla Caves, Manmodi Caves or Nasik Caves.Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992 p.150World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1  ªAlƒ´ JƒÅvƒ´d, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, 2008 p.42 The Great Chaitya of the Karla Caves, the largest in South Asia, was constructed and dedicated in 120 CE by the Western Satraps ruler Nahapana.Southern India: A Guide to Monuments Sites & Museums, by George Michell, Roli Books Private Limited, 1 mai 2013 p.72\\"This hall is assigned to the brief period of Kshatrapas rule in the western Deccan during the 1st century.\\" in Guide to Monuments of India 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu - by George Michell, Philip H. Davies, Viking - 1989 Page 374 When the Satavahanas recovered lost territory from the Western Satraps, they again pursued construction efforts as seen in Nasik Caves and Kanheri Caves. Although many temples, monasteries and stupas have been destroyed, by contrast cave temples are very well preserved as they are both less visible and therefore less vulnerable to vandalism as well as made of more durable material than wood and masonry. There are around 1200 cave temples still in existence, most of which are Buddhist. The residences of monks were called Viharas and the cave shrines, called Chaityas, were for congregational worship. The earliest rock-cut garbhagriha, similar to free- standing ones later, had an inner circular chamber with pillars to create a circumambulatory path (pradakshina) around the stupa and an outer rectangular hall for the congregation of the devotees. 010 Cave 3, Exterior (33156264563).jpgGautamiputra vihara at Pandavleni Caves built in the 2nd century CE by the Satavahana dynasty.

File:Nasik Cave 18.jpgChaitya facade at Pandavleni Caves. =Second wave of cave construction (5th-6th century CE)= Cave 26 in Ajanta, circa 480 CE. The construction of caves would wane after the 2nd century CE, possibly due to the rise of Mahayana Buddhism and the associated intense architectural and artistic production in Gandhara and Amaravati. The building of rock-cut caves would revive briefly in the 6th century CE, with the magnificent achievements of Ajanta and Ellora, before finally subsiding as Hinduism replaced Buddhism in the sub-continent, and stand-alone temples became more prevalent. The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra, a World Heritage Site, are 30 rock-cut cave Buddhist temples carved into the sheer vertical side of a gorge near a waterfall-fed pool located in the hills of the Sahyadri mountains. Like all the locations of Buddhist caves, this one is located near main trade routes and spans six centuries beginning in the 2nd or 1st century B.C. A period of intense building activity at this site occurred under the Vakataka king Harisena between 460 and 478 A profuse variety of decorative sculpture, intricately carved columns and carved reliefs are found, including exquisitely carved cornices and pilaster. Skilled artisans crafted living rock to imitate timbered wood (such as lintels) in construction and grain and intricate decorative carving, although such architectural elements were ornamental and not functional in the classical sense. Later many Hindu kings from southern India patronize many cave temples dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses. One such prominent example of cave temple architecture are the Badami Cave Temples at Badami, the early Chalukya capital, carved out in the 6th century. There are four cave temples hewn from the sides of cliffs, three Hindu and one Jain, that contain carved architectural elements such as decorative pillars and brackets as well as finely carved sculpture and richly etched ceiling panels. Nearby are many small Buddhist cave shrines. Cave 26, Ajanta.jpgThe Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.

The fire took the Metropolitan Fire Brigade several days to fully control and emitted a large plume of toxic black smoke, visible across Melbourne. Background The warehouse where the fire occurred is owned by Danbol Pty Ltd; the sole director and shareholder of which is Christopher James Baldwin, an accountant based in Shepparton. Fire Emergency services were first called to the factory in Somerville Road, West Footscray around 5am on 30 August 2018, arriving six minutes after the first call. The 100m x 200m warehouse was fully alight. 80 firefighters and 20 fire-fighting appliances initially responded, with the number of firefighters eventually rising to more than 140. Firefighters' ability to reach the centre of the fire was hampered by walls of shipping containers and 44 gallon drums stacked up within the warehouse. A week after the fire started, hotspots remained. Investigations Initial investigations in the aftermath of the fire indicated the cause was suspicious. Detectives from the Victoria Police Arson and Explosive Squad assumed responsibility for the investigation into the exact cause of the fire. WorkSafe Victoria announced after the fire that the warehouse was not registered to store dangerous chemicals. As a result of community concern, Worksafe inspected other industrial properties within the area, and \\"found dozens ... that also failed to comply with the [Dangerous Goods] act\\". The Environment Protection Authority also investigated links between the owner of the site, the lessee, and other properties in the north of Melbourne, where industrial chemicals were found to be stored illegally. At the request of the firefighters' union and Metropolitan Fire Brigade, a coronial investigation was opened into the incident. Health effects In the hours after the fire began, authorities issued a \\"community advice warning\\" for Brooklyn, Kingsville, Tottenham, West Footscray, Altona North, Braybrook, Footscray, South Kingsville, Spotswood, Sunshine, and Yarraville, with residents being warned to close windows and doors. Residents were still reporting health issues three weeks after the fire. Firefighters were also concerned about the longterm effects of exposure to toxic chemicals. Environmental effects Within hours of the fire, dead fish, eels, birds and other wildlife were washing up dead on the banks of Stony Creek. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) warned people not to eat fish from Stony Creek or the lower Yarra River, and not to enter, put their hands into or allow dogs into the creek. As of March 2019, the EPA continues to monitor the water and sediment of Stony Creek for pollutants including phenol, BTEX, PFAS, acetone and butanone.

It was first published posthumously in Portuguese in 1925 following revisions to the text by E√ßa‚Äôs son. The first English version, translated by John Vetch, was published by Carcanet Press in 1997. The novel tells the story of a young man from the Portuguese provinces who dreams of literary fame in the capital, Lisbon, and his experiences in unsuccessfully trying to achieve that fame.  Background  E√ßa died in 1900. Several of his novels were published posthumously, partly because they were considered too scandalous for the sensibility of the Portuguese of the late 1800s. To the Capital was published after editing and rewriting by his son, also named Jos√© Maria. In general, reviewers have not thought highly of the quality of the editing of his father‚Äôs books and his work in the case of To the Capital is no exception.  The novel  To the Capital is the story of Artur Corvelo, a young man who has literary ambitions and has a desire to be known by intellectuals and by the society of Lisbon. He is sent to the historic University of Coimbra, but spends most of his time there dreaming of becoming a poet, and moving in literary circles where he is accepted for his devotion to culture rather than for his talent. After the death of both of his parents and after failing his courses, he finds himself left with a small sum of money and venereal disease. Every submission of poetry to a magazine meets with failure. After some time he inherits enough money from his godfather to go to Lisbon. There he succeeds in publishing the poems but they are not well received, and a play he has written goes unproduced. He also experiences a number of misadventures. Eventually, he has to return to the provinces to live off his aunts.  Reviews  The Complete Review sees the novel as an entertaining satire of small-time literary life in Portugal, with a ‚Äúnice mix of engaging characters‚Äù. However, it notes that the story advances somewhat fitfully and is not truly gripping, possibly the result of the poor editing by the author‚Äôs son. Ana Paula de Ara√∫jo notes that, while narrating the disappointments of Arthur, the book criticizes the society of Lisbon and its Romantic education, ‚Äúemphasizing vices that the author recognized in that society‚Äù. She feels that the social types identified can still be found in Lisbon‚Äôs society today. Paulo Neves da Silva considers E√ßa‚Äôs description of Artur‚Äôs time in Lisbon to be ‚Äúhilarious and sarcastic‚Äù, leading to an ‚Äúunforgettable novel‚Äù. He sees To the Capital to be magnificent portrayal of the society of the time, achieved through a detailed description of the customs and the motivations of the characters portrayed, with their petty personalities and hypocritical social circles.

She was of the C4-S-A3 design type. Construction Marine Lynx, approved 18 April 1944, was laid down by Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Vancouver, Washington, 9 December 1944, as MC Hull no. 2363; launched 17 July 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Brockrick; and delivered to her operator, Moore-McCormack Lines, 22 October 1945. Service history Following the end of World War II, Marine Lynx steamed throughout the Pacific to carry occupation troops to the Far East and to return veterans of the Pacific campaigns to the United States. Departing Portland, Oregon, 3 December, she carried troops to Japan and returned to the west coast 4 January 1946. During February and March she cruised out of San Francisco, to the Marianas and back; and, after transferring to Matson Navigation Co., 17 April, she departed 23 April, on a troop run in the South Pacific. She touched at ports in the Fiji Islands and in Australia; returned to the west coast in June; and in 1947, entered the Maritime Commission Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Following the outbreak of Communist aggression In South Korea, Marine Lynx was acquired by the US Navy from the Maritime Commission 23 July 1950; placed in service; and assigned to duty with Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). Manned by a civil service crew, she served throughout the years of the Korean conflict carrying US troops to Japan and the war‚Äëtorn Korean peninsula. Between mid‚ÄëDecember 1950 and 20 August 1954, she deployed to the Far East out of Seattle, Washington, 22 times. She debarked combat‚Äëready troops at Yokohama and Sasebo, Japan, and at Pusan and Inchon, South Korea. After the establishment of the uneasy truce 27 July 1953, she cruised primarily to return veterans of the U.N. police action in Korea to the United States. On 25 August 1954, Marine Lynx sailed once more for the turbulent waters of the Far East. Steaming via Yokosuka, Japan, she reached Haiphong, French Indochina, 13 September, and began duty in the US Navy's Operation \\"Passage‚Äëto‚ÄëFreedom\\". As part of the mighty peacekeeping force of US seapower in that troubled area of the world, she continued to support the forces for freedom in the incessant struggle against the menace of Asian communism. After embarking Vietnamese refugees who were fleeing the tyranny and oppression of the Communist dominated north, she departed Haiphong, 18 September, and carried her passengers to Saigon, where they could begin a new life of freedom in Southeast Asia. During the next 2 months she completed six round trips between northern and southern Vietnam, while carrying refugees, French troops, and military supplies to Saigon, Tourane, and Nha Trang. She completed her duty 23 November; sailed to Japan, 30 November; and returned to Seattle, 4 to 16 December. Fate Marine Lynx remained at Seattle, and was placed in reduced operational status from 11 May 1955 to 4 June 1956. Resuming her Far East service, she departed Seattle, 14 June 1956, and arrived Inchon, 28 June. There she embarked US peacekeeping troops and between 29 June and 15 July, carried them to San Francisco. She returned to Seattle, 16 to 18 July, and returned to reserve operational status 25 July. On 1 May 1958, she transferred permanently to the Maritime Administration and was berthed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Astoria, Oregon. Her name was struck from the Navy list the same day. Marine Lynx was sold to Hudson Waterways Corp., 4 August 1967, converted to a cargo ship, and renamed Transcolumbia. From 3 October 1968 to 25 August 1985, Transcolumbia was chartered to the Military Sealift Command. In June 1988, Transcolumbia was sold for scrapping. Awards Marine Lynx received seven battle stars for Korean service.

The ensamble put out two albums with Enbar (\\"Oy Division\\" and \\"The Internazional\\", 2008) and performed at festivals worldwide. = Music for Film and Theatre = Between 2007 and 2016 Enbar collaborated with the director Avi Mugrabi on three films: \\"z32\\" (Venice Film Festival 2008) which tells the real life story of a soldier sent to act out a revenge. \\"Once I entered a Garden\\" (Rome Film Festival 2012) which tells the story of the teacher Ali Al-Azhari from the village Sepphoris. \\"Between Fences\\" (Berlin Film Festival 2016) which is about a theatre workshop that was held in joint with asylum seekers from Eritrea and Sudan while being held at the detention camp \\"Holot\\" in southern Israel. Enbar composed the music for the films and took part in the production and script writing. Enbar's collaboration with Mugrabi also brought \\"The Details\\", a sound-video exhibition. The work was put up as part of the debut at the Berlin Film Festival in 2012 and later at the \\"White Nights\\" in Paris in 2013 and at the Open City Doc Fest in London in 2014. In 2017 at the Berlinale Forum Expanded Enbar presented his work \\"Pana Hageshem\\" (\\"The Rain is Gone\\"). This structured-improvisatory composition devised by Enbar was performed in collaboration with the workshop participants from \\"Between Fences\\". It takes a famous Israeli agricultural song, associated with the Kibbutz movement, turning it into an expressive polyphonic chant. Enbar took part in two pieces for stage art with the poet and playwright Yonatan Levi: \\"The general and the Sea\\" (2014), a momentous piece for a choir and single actor which tells the story of Rafael Eitan, and \\"Giants (Ne'filim)\\" (Israel Festival 2016), a grim trilogy spanning three decades of Israeli cultural history. = Choral Music and Performance = In 2012 Enbar put on the show \\"Sleep Inducement\\" (\\"Hardama\\") at the Israel Museum. Audience members where reclined on mattresses and lulled with dream-inducing surreal songs in Hebrew, Arabic, Yiddish, Polish, English and Armenian. \\"Sleep Inducement\\" was premiered in 2012 at the Israeli Museum, followed by the 2013 \\"Home Festival\\", Jerusalem. In 2014 as part of the Jerusalem Season of Culture Enbar put on the show \\"Psychomysticism!\\" together with Guitarist Adam Shaflan and Drummer Ariel Armoni. In \\"Psychomysticism!\\" Enbar melded psychedelic rock and classic Jewish Hazanut music. He especially incorporated pieces by Pierre Pinchik. In 2015, together with director Nir Shauluf, Enbar produced \\"GHOM! A Gibberish Cantata\\" at Techtonics Festival in Tel Aviv. \\"GHOM! A Gibberish Cantata\\" is a liturgic piece for six singers and an 11-year-old solo singer. The gibberish texts were put together by the poet Yonatan Levi. In 2015 Enbar founded \\"The Great Gehenna Choir\\", dedicated to experimenting with egalitarian, democratic forms of artistic practice, as joined decision-making and changing conductors from within the choir itself. The choir put together singers from different backgrounds. Enbar composed the music for the choir from texts by poets such as Lewis Carroll, Aharon Shabtai, and Yonatan Levi. After two years of performing the choir became a cooperative collective. In 2017 Enbar opened his solo exhibition \\"Preaching to the Choir\\" (\\"Sharim BaKikar\\") at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The exhibition showed for six months and contained works for singers and participatory events. In this project Enbar also cooperated with Eurovision Song Contest winner Netta Barzilai. In 2017, Enbar put on his piece \\"Ra'am\\" for ensemble of drummers commissioned by Basis Academy of the Arts, Herzliya. This was a site specific, durational piece, created in collaboration with light-designer Omer Shezaf, embedding itself in the tower-like architecture of Basis Academy. In 2018 and 2019, Enbar's piece for a large choir \\"Blindshigt\\" (\\"Atzum\\") was presented at Mekudeshet festival in Jerusalem.

It was written by new head writer and executive producer Chris Chibnall, directed by Jamie Childs, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 7 October 2018. It stars Jodie Whittaker in her first full appearance as the Thirteenth Doctor, and introduces the Doctor's new companions ‚Äì Bradley Walsh as Graham O'Brien, Tosin Cole as Ryan Sinclair, and Mandip Gill as Yasmin Khan. The episode also guest stars Sharon D. Clarke, Johnny Dixon, and Samuel Oatley. The story focuses on a group of people who come across a new alien threat together within Sheffield, and find themselves banding together with the recently regenerated Doctor, who has been separated from her time machine the TARDIS since the events of \\"Twice Upon a Time\\". As the group seek to understand the threat, they find themselves in danger as well, and discover that the recently arrived aliens are planning a hunt upon a single human, leading the Doctor to co-ordinate an attempt to save everyone from danger. It is the first episode to be led by Chibnall, alongside executive producers Matt Strevens and Sam Hoyle, after Steven Moffat and Brian Minchin stepped down at the conclusion of the tenth series, and marks the third era of production in the revived series, following Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer from 2005‚Äì2010, and Moffat's from 2010‚Äì2017. It is both the first regular episode of the revived era to be broadcast on Sunday, instead of Saturday, alongside subsequent episodes in the series, and the first episode not to feature any opening titles or credits. Since its first broadcast in the UK, the episode has received positive reviews from critics, as well as a rating of 10.96 million viewers, the highest series premiere for a Doctor in the history of the programme, and the highest consolidated ratings since \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013).  Plot  Ryan Sinclair, a dyspraxic youth, calls the police after causing a blue pod to appear while retrieving his practice bike. After showing the pod to PC Yasmin Khan, his old school friend, Ryan receives a call from his grandmother, Grace, learning that she and her husband Graham O'Brien, are trapped on board their train by a floating orb of electric tentacles, alongside a crane operator, Karl. Ryan and Yasmin reach the train just as the newly-regenerated Doctor falls through the carriage ceiling. The orb departs, shortly after zapping the group with an energy bolt. Karl leaves while the others remain with the Doctor, suffering partial post-regeneration amnesia while discovering they have all been implanted with DNA-destroying bombs. The search for the orb brings the group to a warehouse whose owner acquired the pod, linking it to his sister's disappearance, arriving just after the man was killed by an alien that emerged from the pod. The Doctor, assuming the two aliens are mortal enemies, tinkers with the pod and builds a replacement sonic screwdriver from spare parts before the group finds and subdues the orb. The orb is revealed as a mass of biological data-gathering coils with data on Karl. The second alien soon appears, introducing himself as Tzim-Sha of the warlike Stenza who came to Earth for a ritualistic hunt for leadership. Though a furious Doctor (addressing him as \\"Tim Shaw\\") demands Tzim-Sha and his people leave Earth alone, he downloads the coils' data before teleporting to Karl's location at a construction yard. After the group are unsuccessful in preventing Tzim-Sha capturing him, the Doctor fully recalls her identity and confronts him. Ordering Tzim-Sha to release the human, she threatens to destroy his recall device and strand the Stenza on Earth upon his refusal. Tzim-Sha responds by detonating the DNA bombs, but the Doctor reveals she transferred them back into the coils, which the Stenza unknowingly self- implanted while downloading its data. As the Doctor throws the recall device at Tzim-Sha to return him to his planet, Grace dies as the result of falling from the crane while successfully destroying the coils. Following Grace's funeral and a change of clothing, the Doctor builds a teleporter to reach the TARDIS. She bids the others farewell, only to inadvertently bring them with her into deep space.  Production  = Development = It was announced in January 2016 that the tenth series would be Steven Moffat's final series as executive producer and head writer, after seven years as showrunner, for which he was replaced in the role by Chris Chibnall in 2018. Matt Strevens serves as executive producer alongside Chibnall, as well as Sam Hoyle. A new logo was unveiled at the BBC Worldwide showcase on 20 February 2018. This logo was designed by the creative agency Little Hawk, who also created a stylized insignia of the word \\"who\\" enclosed in a circle with an intersecting line, typically used for social media accounts. Murray Gold announced in February 2018 that he would step down as the programme's composer, having served as the musical director since 2005, and that he would not be composing the music for the eleventh series. On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for the eleventh series would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola. = Casting = Whittaker at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, where she promoted her first full series. The episode introduces Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor. Her predecessor Peter Capaldi departed from his role as the Twelfth Doctor after the tenth series, having played the role for three series. His final appearance was in the 2017 Christmas special, \\"Twice Upon a Time\\". Moffat stated in February 2017 that Chibnall tried to persuade the actor to continue into the eleventh series, but despite this, Capaldi still decided to depart. The search for the actor to portray the Thirteenth Doctor, led by Chibnall, began later in 2017, after he completed work on the third series of the ITV series Broadchurch, for which he is also the head writer and executive producer. Chibnall had the final say on the actor, although the decision also involved Charlotte Moore and Piers Wenger, the director of content and head of drama for the BBC respectively. Media reports and bookmakers speculated as to who would replace Capaldi as the Thirteenth Doctor, with Ben Whishaw and Kris Marshall among the most popular predictions. On 16 July 2017, it was announced after the 2017 Wimbledon Championships men's finals that Whittaker would portray the thirteenth incarnation of the Doctor. The episode introduces a new set of companions, including Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, and Mandip Gill as Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. Actress Sharon D. Clarke appears as Ryan's grandmother and Graham's wife, Grace. The episode also guest-stars Johnny Dixon and Samuel Oatley. = Filming = Jamie Childs directed the first and ninth episode of the series in the opening production block, having directed Whittaker's introduction video as the Thirteenth Doctor. Pre-production for the eleventh series began in late October 2017. After filming for the series was expected to begin in late 2017, it officially began with the first episode on 30 October 2017. The eleventh series was shot using Cooke and Ang√©nieux anamorphic lenses for the first time in the series' history, a creative decision made in order to make the show look more cinematic. Filming of the train cab scenes was on one of the four Class 489 preserved (Unit 9110) at the Barry Tourist Railway in Barry. = Promotion = The first teaser for the series was released during the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 15 July 2018, almost exactly a year after the announcement of Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor. Whittaker, Gill, Cole, Chibnall and Strevens promoted the show with a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on 19 July 2018, where the first trailer was released.  Broadcast and reception  = Television = As \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" was the premiere episode of the eleventh series, it was aired for an extended broadcast length, like previous series' premieres, for a total of 64 minutes, with a broadcast both in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and United States on BBC America. The episode length was described by the BBC as \\"feature-length\\". The premiere episode of the eleventh series featured neither opening titles or credits, and is the only episode of the \\"revived\\" era to begin without either of these ‚Äì while episodes such as \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013) and \\"Sleep No More\\" (2015) were created with a similar lack of these, they featured either a modified title sequence or opening credit sequence. = Cinemas = The premiere of the new series was held at Light Cinema in Sheffield on 24 September 2018, as part of a red carpet event for the episode and eleventh series. \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" was released in the Brazilian cinemas on 7 October 2018, in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani cinemas on 7‚Äì8 October, in select Australian cinemas on 8 October, and in the United States on 10‚Äì11 October. = Ratings = The episode was watched by 8.20 million viewers overnight, accounting for an audience share of 40.1% during its first broadcast, and making it the highest overnight viewership since \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013), which received 8.30 million overnight viewers. Additionally, it marked the highest overnight figure for a series premiere since the opening episode of the fourth series \\"Partners in Crime\\" (2008), which achieved 8.40 million viewers. \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" received a total of 10.96 million viewers, making it the highest series premiere for a Doctor in the history of the programme, and the highest consolidated ratings since \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013). The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 83. In December 2018, the BBC released details for the top ten requested episodes on iPlayer for the month of October, with \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" ranking second with 2.96 million requests. In the United States, the original broadcast on BBC America, part of a worldwide simulcast, was watched by 1.37 million viewers, combining for a total of 1.88 million viewers. The episode received 480,000 viewers upon its Australian premiere. = Critical response = The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating for the episode, based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 8.13/10. The site's consensus reads \\"Jodie Whittaker easily embodies the best of the titular time traveler in 'The Woman Who Fell to Earth' and proves that change can be a very, very good thing.\\"  References   External links   * Category:2018 British television episodes Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth Category:Television episodes written by Chris Chibnall Category:Television episodes set in Sheffield Category:Thirteenth Doctor episodes ","title":"The Woman Who Fell to Earth"},{"id":"58532976","text":"Jayanta Sagatpam Singh (born 12 October 1992) is an Indian cricketer.

She was of the C4-S-A3 design type. Construction Marine Phoenix, approved 18 April 1944, was laid down by Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Vancouver, Washington, 16 December 1944, as MC Hull no. 2365; launched 9 August 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas M. Robins; and delivered to her operator, Moore-McCormack Lines, 9 November 1945. Service history In early December Marine Phoenix steamed to Seattle, Washington, where she embarked occupation troops and sailed for Japan, 12 December. She carried her passengers to Nagoya, embarked homeward‚Äëbound veterans of the Pacific campaigns, and returned to Seattle, 4 to 16 January 1946. During the next five months she continued trooplift runs out of Seattle, to Japan, Korea, China, the Marianas, and the Hawaiian Islands. In 1947, she entered the Maritime Commission Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, where she remained for 3 years. Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korean Communists, Marine Phoenix was acquired by the US Navy from the Maritime Commission 21 July 1950; placed in service August 1950; and assigned to duty with Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). Manned by a civil service crew, she began trooplifts to the Far East later in August, and reached Korean waters 2 September. During the next 3 years she bolstered the free world's stand to repel Communist aggression in Korea, and completed 19 round trips to the western Pacific and back. Operating out of Seattle and San Francisco, she carried troops and supplies to Japanese and Korean ports including Sasebo, Yokohama, Pusan, and Inchon. In addition during February 1952, she shuttled troops to Kojedo Island in response to mounting unrest among POW-s through Communist agitators. Following the uneasy armistice which ended hostilities in Korea, she returned veterans to the United States. After reaching Seattle, from Inchon, 5 December 1953, she was placed in reduced operational status until 30 April 1954. Marine Phoenix, then resumed transport service in the Far East, and during the remainder of the year she made six runs to the western Pacific out of west coast ports including Seattle and San Diego. Returning to Seattle, 3 January 1955, she resumed reduced operational status until 4 December; she sailed for South Korea, 9 December.

Spinoza lives in this world, with a vast network of simple and sociable friendships and correspondences. But for certain determinate strata of the bourgeoisie the sweetness of the cultured and sedate life is accompanied, without any contradiction, by an association with a capitalist power ('potestas'), expressed in very mature terms. This is the condition of a Dutch bourgeois man. We could say the same thing for the other genius of that age, Rembrandt van Rijn. On his canvases the power of light is concentrated with intensity on the figures of a bourgeois world in terrific expansion. It is a prosaic but very powerful society, which makes poetry without knowing it because it has the force to do so.\\" cultural history, history of ideas, education, humanities, aesthetics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, literary studies, anatomy, medicine, religious studies, theology, Jewish studies,Nadler, Steven: Rembrandt's Jews.

The field of Rembrandt studies (study of Rembrandt's life and work, including works by his pupils and followers) ‚Äî as an academic field in its own right with many noted Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars ‚Äî has been one of the most dynamic research areas of Netherlandish art (or art of the pre-1830 Low Countries) history.Slive, Seymour: Rembrandt and his Critics, 1630‚Äì1730.

Her research area is the behaviour and cultural evolution of animal communication, especially bird song in southern hemisphere species such as the New Zealand bellbird.  Academic career  Brunton grew up in Henderson, and wanted to be a vet from an early age. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Auckland, and for her MSc studied the calls of southern black-backed gulls (Larus dominicanus). In 1981 she embarked on a PhD at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, intending to study the behaviour of semi-social wasps ‚Äì until the departmental colony died. She switched to the killdeer plover (Charadrius vociferus) and graduated in 1987. Brunton did a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Yale, occupying the office of the recently-retired Charles Sibley. In 1991 she returned to New Zealand to take up a lectureship as a biostatistician at the University of Auckland. She joined the faculty of Massey University in December 2004, and founded the university's Ecology and Conservation Group. In 2008 she received a Claude McCarthy Fellowship by Massey for her reptile and bird research. In 2018, in recognition of the 14 PhD and 18 Master's students she had supervised since joining Massey she was awarded a Individual University Supervisor Medal by the university. At that time she had published over 120 scientific papers and received two Marsden grants. Since 2016 Brunton has been head of the Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at Massey, based at the Albany campus in Auckland. Brunton is an advocate for eliminating introduced mammalian predators from New Zealand as part of the Predator-Free 2050 initiative. She was also a vocal opponent of Massey University's proposal to move most science faculty and courses to the Palmerston North campus.  Research  bellbird song at Tawharanui Regional Park Much of Brunton's research is concerned with the sexual selection and song of southern hemisphere songbirds; in Australasian and tropical songbird species both sexes commonly sing and maintain territories, but in the northern hemisphere, where most behavioural research has been done, usually only males sing. One study examined the mating behaviour of New Zealand bellbirds (Anthornis melanura), and how females distinguished between the friendly and hostile songs of other females. In 2002 Brunton was the first to quantify the song and singing behaviour of bellbirds; she discovered that both male and female birds have distinctive dialects, and that female bellbirds are the sex that disperses to find new territories. Her testing of the \\"dear enemy\\" hypothesis with bellbirds ‚Äì the first time a female songbird had been tested ‚Äì revealed they were more aggressive to neighbouring females than to strangers, the opposite of what the hypothesis predicted. She also examines the cultural evolution of bird song: how diversity and dialects arise and are maintained, how song memes spread, and the effect of birds dispersing to new habitats. One of her field sites is the predator-free island sanctuary Tiritiri Matangi, off the coast of Auckland, where with her student Michelle Roper she studied the ecological niche partitioning of bellbirds and hihi (Notiomystis cincta). Another site is Tawharanui Regional Park, north of Auckland, where she discovered by song dialect that the bellbirds which colonised the park had come from Little Barrier Island, not Tiritiri Matangi. In 2013 Brunton received an $820,000 Marsden grant entitled Untangling genes and culture: sex-based song traditions in New Zealand bellbirds, to study male and female dialects; it also supported other projects, including research into the song dialects of grey warblers (Gerygone igata) in Tawharanui. Her other research interests and collaborations with PhD and MSc students include the welfare of lizard species after conservation translocation, analysing the chemical composition of kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç feathers to determine how diet has changed over time, foraging ecology of little penguins (Eudyptula minor), and song dialects in the saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus).

Hasher bin Maktoum died without leaving a clear line of succession, causing a rift in the family with two contenders for the title being put forward: Sheikh Maktoum bin Hasher, Hasher's eldest son and Sheikh Rashid bin Maktoum, Hasher's brother. Sheikh Rashid gained the support of the majority of the family and tribal leaders and acceded in 1886, continuing the policies of open trade and conciliation established by Hasher. He was an influential ruler and when he was approached by Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi for assistance during a conflict over Buraimi in 1891, he was able to muster a considerable force of 300 camel riders and 30 horsemen in Zayed's support. Rashid inherited the ongoing conflict with the Rulers of the emirates to the North and conflict was rarely absent from the coast, with raids and ruptures an almost constant occurrence, particularly in 1889 and 1890. In 1891, some 400 men of the Marar tribe, considering themselves ill-treated by Rashid, ended the pearling season by sailing their boats to Sharjah. This action led to three years of bitter negotiations, arbitrated by the British Resident, settling financial claims and counter claims which led to a number of conflicts on land.  Exclusive Agreement  In 1892, Rashid was signatory to the 'Exclusive Agreement', which bound the Trucial Rulers not to enter into 'any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government' and that without British assent, they would not 'consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other government' and that they would not 'cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government.Exclusive Agreement, signed between March 5 and March 8, 1892 Also in 1892, in March, a number of Dubai subjects ejected a number of Al Qasimi dependents from Sir Bu Nair Island - resulting in a censure from the British Agent, requiring the aggressors to withdraw and return the arms they captured, as well as Rashid having to undertake his subjects would not in future travel to Sir Bu Nair without permission from the Sheikh of Sharjah. In September 1892, Rashid married into the Al Bu Shamis subsection of the Na'im tribe in Buraimi. He died on 7 April 1894 during a major cholera outbreak in Dubai, although the cause of his death was described as a 'paralytic seizure'.

The Marmoul offensives included operations to seize fortified areas, fortification complexes and logistical bases (Alburs, Agarsai, Bayramshah, Shorcha), and to destroy the infrastructure of rebel bases. Other objectives included blocking the supply channels for weapons and ammunition and neutralizing members of the armed formations of the Mujahideen. They consisted in a series of joint or independent, ground and air combat operations on a broad front with the involvement of considerable forces and means.  Military-political situation in the region  The situation on the Soviet-Afghan border has significantly worsened. Cases of violation of the state border, provocation against border units and local population of the Soviet Central Asian republics living on the border with Afghanistan, attacks on transport columns carrying cargo, from the USSR into the DRA, had increased significantly. The predominant part of the local population was on the side of a large group of insurgents operating in the region, almost in every village there were members of local opposition groups and foreign militant groups. A quarter of the total number of members of armed groups in Afghanistan, reaching in 1982 up to 45 thousand, and by 1987 up to 82,3 thousand, were active in the northern regions of the country. By the end of 1981, as a result of operations in northern Afghanistan, the plans of the Mujahideen to seize the territory of one of the northern provinces and to establish an anti-government regime were foiled. The threat of seizure by opposition groups of a number of areas adjacent to the Afghan- Soviet border was prevented. However, by 1982 the situation was significantly complicated. The outbreak of armed protests against the Kabul Government became more widespread. More than 40% of the districts of the northern provinces of the DRA were under the control of the armed opposition. The activities of the provincial and local administrative centers were paralyzed, and the main axes of communication by road were blocked.  Field Commander Mohammad Zabiullah  Mohammad Zabiullah (real name Abdul Kader, nom de guerre Mohammad Zabiullah) was the Mujahideen commander from 1980 until 1984 in the Marmoul area. At the initial stage of the war he was a field commander under Ahmad Shah Massoud in the Panjshir valley. In 1980 Massoud sent him to Balkh province to organize the armed struggle in the region. Before the war, he was a religious teacher in Mazar-i-Sharif. According to the description of a western journalist in 1982, Zabiullah was short, round-faced with a thick beard - a charismatic young man, more than twenty years old, possessing the qualities of a leader and organizer, and was distinguished by restraint. At the initial stage of the guerrilla struggle, Zabiullah personally led the actions of his detachments in the attack on Soviet troops and government forces in the province of Balkh and in the vicinity of the city of Mazar-i- Sharif. By 1983, most of the fighting in the province of Balkh was conducted under his direct leadership. An excellent organizer, he divided the region into 73 controlled military districts, each of them had a commander leading one or several partisan groups. Most of these groups were intentionally small, with 10, 20 and not more than 30 fighters. All of them were under the general command of Zabiullah. Like Massoud in Panjshir, Zabiullah did not neglect civil initiatives. He created schools and classes in literacy, Islamic studies, and the foundations of guerrilla warfare. The government of Kabul unsuccessfully tried to bribe Zabiullah, he was twice approached with a proposal to pay money or grant status, in exchange for guarantees that his partisan detachments would not attack the Soviet and Afghan government columns in the Marmoul gorge. Zabiullah was killed in the Balkh province on December 14, 1984, when the vehicle in which he was traveling was blown up by a land mine allegedly laid by a rival partisan detachment.  The history of the Marmoul offensives  In accordance with Soviet military custom, the operation was named after its principal geographic objective. During the Afghan War (1979-1989) in the northern Balkh province, the districts of the Marmoul, Tangimarmoul, Shadian, and Tashkurgan canyons, a series of different in scale, goals, tasks, forces and means - combined arms operations of units of the 201st Motorized Infantry Division 40th Army, units of the Border Guards of the KSAPO of the KGB of the USSR, special forces of the GRU of the USSR Ministry of Defense, with the participation of parts of the government forces of the DRA armed forces were undertaken against the armed formations of Afghan mujahideen of the Islamic Society of Afghanistan of Burhanuddin Rabbani, operating under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud whose field commanders were Mohammad Zabiullah (killed in a mine explosion on December 14, 1986) and Atta Muhammad Nur.  Marmoul gorge and base area  The region of Marmoul, a highland in the west of the Hindu Kush mountain system, is located on a pedestal raised above 1000 meters, combining mountain ranges and massifs alternating with wide flat hollows, intermontane depressions, plateaus and valleys. The height of the crest above the foot of the mountain range varies from 1400 to 2200 meters in different places. The Marmoul gorge is located in a mountain range 17 kilometers south of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Stretching for 400 kilometers from west to east (200 kilometers), and further to the south (200 kilometers), it forms a deep canyon, orange-brown in colour, with sheer rockfaces on either side. In the western and central parts of the Marmoul gorge, the Shadian and Tangimarmoul gorges proceed from it perpendicularly to the south, reaching, at the final stage, the valleys and villages of Shadian and Marmoul, respectively. In the eastern sector, the Marmoul gorge itself bends strictly southward, and expanding within the canyon boundaries, already extends in the province of Samangan towards the district town of Aibak. Throughout the length of the Marmoul gorge the height of the opposite slopes and the width of the winding canyon vary considerably. At the western entrance to the gorge through a neck cut in the rocks, the narrowest point does not exceed 3.6 meters. Because of the characteristic orange-brown color of the rock, it was known among Soviet servicemen as the gorge of ¬´red rocks¬ª. Marmoul, a remote mountainous region well equipped according to the laws of engineering thought and military science, was a fortified complex with a multi-level echeloned fire control system. It was designed to act in a sustainable defense and to allow a small isolated force to inflict maximum damage on a much superior attacking force. The permanent firing points of the Marmoul district were located in caves cut out of rock formations in steep cliffs at different altitudes and were connected by communication routes and provided with various communication means. The plateau was surrounded by mountains, rising 800 meters above it. In the center of the plateau was a hill. The road ran along the narrow Tangimarmoul passage in the intermontane area. To prevent the passage of Soviet troops, the rebels mined this passage. In addition to the mines on the road, where armored vehicles of the 40th Army were being damaged, explosive charges from aerial bombs were laid on the mountain slopes. The charges were wired together into a single network capable of causing landslides on the Soviet and Afghan units. On the heights, where the firing points of the rebels were located, during the operation in Marmoul, powerful aviation and artillery strikes were employed, after which groups of assault rifle units and assault groups landed along the entire circumference of the plateau. Following them in the district were units of motorized maneuver groups, which completed the rout of the base area. During operations in the caves of Marmoul, a large number of warehouses with weapons and ammunition were seized, the entrance to them was mined. In one of the caves a prison was found.  The Marmoul operation in February 1983, the causes and course of the operation  The Soviet Union provided its Afghan ally with a large-scale assistance in the industrialization of the country. The construction and operation of many plants and factories in many cities of Afghanistan such as Kabul, Herat, Puli Khumri and other cities of Afghanistan was carried out by Soviet civilian experts. On January 2, 1983, sixteen Soviet civilian specialists, who were contracted to build a bakery near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, were abducted while returning from a working shift. A group of armed men blocked their bus on the road, took the Soviet citizens captive and led them to the Marmoul area. Marshal of the Soviet Union S.L. Sokolov, who was in Kabul at the time, ordered an army operation to search for the missing Soviet citizens and the liquidation of the armed formation that had organized their abduction. According to Soviet intelligence, the Mujahideen field commanders of the northern front, could mobilize more than 1,300 militants from local villages. According to the plan of the headquarters of the 40th Army, the military operation was to be carried out by air landing groups to block the way out of the gorge, with the further elimination of the enemy's manpower and the seizure of his material assets. The plan for the Marmoul operation in 1983 was developed promptly. However, the command did not have precise information about the strength of Zabiullah's group. The collected intelligence indicated a good defensive capability of the base area. In the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, an operational group was formed to search for the abducted Soviets. For this purpose it was given control of part of the 201st motorized rifle division. The search lasted for a whole month. During this period, all military operations were stopped in the area. Adverse weather conditions made the search difficult. In the first days, on January 3, the corpse of one of the plant adjusters was discovered in the channel of a mountain stream, not far from the village of Marmoul. The others could not be found. On the orders of the commander of the 40th Army, General VF Ermakov launched the operation. On January 30, in the mountainous area near the village of Marmoul, landing groups were set up to conduct reconnaissance and search operations. The search group captured a 16-year-old local boy, who told them that he had seen a group of captured Soviet specialists in the village of Wardak, in the house of the local mullah. A team of 50 Afghan KhAD troops was flown to Wardak urgently. The operation was conducted by 20 Mi-8 transport helicopters and the same number of Mi-24 attack helicopters. During the landing of the landing groups from the second pair of Mi-8, a heavy machine gun fire was opened from the mullah's house. Landing of the paratroopers from the Mi-8 covered the combat helicopters Mi-24. Shooting at the Soviets, in a hurry, not finishing off the wounded, so as not to get involved in the fight, the rebels quickly retreated into the mountains. During the fleeting battle several Soviet soldiers were wounded. According to the survivors, the released wounded specialists, their kidnapping and public execution had both a propagandistic and intimidating purpose. The execution was carried out after a sermon in front of the local population. The field commander presented the captured Soviets as military pilots who bombed Afghan villages and called upon the population of Marmoul to wage a ruthless war on the infidels. The reconnaissance, motorized rifle, antiaircraft artillery units of the units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division, the special purpose of the GRU GSh, were involved in the operation; 40 combat helicopters (MI-8 and MI-24). Parts of the 18th and 20th Infantry Division of the DRA Armed Forces, a separate commando brigade and the operational regiment of sarandoy were drawn from Afghan government forces. The fighting took place in difficult climatic conditions. There was a strong squally wind, it was raining with snow. Active fighting in the area of the Marmoul gorge lasted nine days, of which a week the Soviet troops advanced under the continuous fire of the enemy. A week later, the head of the operation, the deputy chief of staff of the 40th Army, Major-General SN. Shevchenko ordered the landing of tactical airborne assault forces in the area of combat operations on the routes to exit the canyon. The capture of mountain peaks, passes, approaches and gorges and the blocking of the base area was carried out by tactical air assault forces, while other units, left the base area in various directions and destroyed the enemy group. During the capture of the base area in the Marmoul gorge in 1983, similar to operations: Smerch, Maneuvre, Zapadnya, Uragan, in the Black Mountains, air cover was used. The rebel group was blocked in an isolated mountainous area and with the further approach of the main forces, it was defeated. During the operation conducted in harsh winter conditions of the high mountains (2500 meters above sea level), the skillful actions of the reconnaissance and landing company of the 783rd separate reconnaissance battalion of the 201st motorized rifle division, under the command of Senior Lieutenant I.N. Ploskonos, enabled the unit to hold their position and block the rebels' escape from encirclement. For the successful actions of the unit entrusted to him, and for the courage and heroism manifested at the same time, I.N. Ploskonos was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. During the earlier stages of the operation, a large number of long-term firing positions were established by the insurgents on the dominant heights. The entrances to the caves were carefully disguised, with natural plantations. In the caves, connected by long tunnels, weapon storage, ammunition, medicines and foodstuffs were located. In the mountain labyrinths, the Soviet divisions found two prisons, with special means for interrogation. In the same place, bodies of captured Afghan soldiers were found, with signs of heavy torture. In the gorge, an active rolling stock was discovered including trucks and off- road vehicles.  The Marmoul operation of 1984  The Marmoul operation in 1984 was the only military operation of the Red Banner Central Asia Border District (KSAPO) of the KGB in the history of the Afghan war (1979-1989), conducted under the directive of the Minister of Defense of the USSR, Marshal of the Soviet Union D.F. Ustinov. The plan of the operation was approved by the Chairman of the KGB Yuri Andropov and Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergey Sokolov, the commander of the operation was Major-General G.A. Zgersky. The command of the 40th Army was tasked with liquidating the rebel mountain bases in the Marmoul gorge. In the operation conducted in January‚ÄìFebruary 1984, 3 motorized maneuver groups, 4 assault landing groups, 30 helicopters, 9 Afghan infantry battalions, 1 combined artillery battalion of the 201st motorized rifle division and 1 fighter regiment were involved. The grouping formed the starting position of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Headquarters of the operation was organized here. The operation was conducted on the basis of operational data. In the course of military operations, the blocking of the rebel forces was carried out by the disembarkation of ten groups of tactical airborne assault. The units of the Armed Forces of the DRA, acting as part of two detouring detachments from the east and west, blocked the Marmoul depression. At the initial positions, the search groups of Afghan servicemen were inserted by Mi-8 helicopters and operated under their cover fire. The large-scale actions of Soviet troops along a broad front were preceded by powerful artillery and aviation preparation, during which anti-aircraft fire weapons were suppressed, minefields and controlled landmines were undermined. Unable to withstand the onslaught, the rebels left the base, leaving in the caves a huge amount of weapons and ammunition.  Preceding events and scheduling an operation  From the Marmoul district, detachments and rebel groups constantly made sorties to attack targets in Mazar-i-Sharif, and the plans of the Soviet military representatives in Kabul planned operation in the Marmoul Gorge were given great importance. The presence of an active Mujahideen base area in close proximity to the capital of northern Afghanistan, Mazar-i-Sharif, was deemed inadmissible by the command of the 40th Army. Established in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the border troops of the USSR made it possible to significantly intensify their activities. There were private and joint combat operations with units of the 40th Army. Interaction was carried out with the units of the army of the armed forces of the DRA, units of the border troops, Tsarandoya (Ministry of Internal Affairs) and Khad of the Ministry of State Security of Afghanistan. In January 1984, the chief of the main command and control of the troops of KSAPO, Major-General G.A. Zgersky was ordered to arrive at the Marshal of the Soviet Union Sokolov Sokolov. with a preliminary operation plan, in Kabul. At a meeting in Kabul, the Marshals of the Soviet Union - Sokolov SL. and Akhromeev, listened attentively to the report of Major-General G.A. Zgersky, compared the available reconnaissance data on the enemy's forces, the geography of the area and, having approved the plan of the operation, promised the general every support. The preliminary plan for the operation was also discussed with the Commander of the Turkestan Military District (TurkVO), General of the Army Yu.P. Maksimov. By the decision of the Marshals of the Soviet Union, the command of the operation was entrusted to Major-General G.A. Zgersky. The weather in the area of the Marmoul gorge in early January 1984 was changing. At the beginning of the operation, the troops were alerted for four days. With the arrival of General Zagersky GA in Mazar- i-Sharif from Kabul. A positive weather forecast was obtained - for several days ahead and the operation began. Given the difficult conditions of the mountainous region, the presence of powerful strong points with echeloned and multi-tiered defense, extensive areas of mine-explosive obstacles, significant forces and resources were invested in the operation. According to the command directive of the 40th Army, aviation support during the operation to the troops of the KSAPO was provided by the Air Force from 24 airplanes of fighter-bombers. There were also 30 helicopters of KSAPO troops, personnel of 5 (five) -MMG and ShMGG (maneuverable and assault-assault groups) of KSAPO (about two thousand servicemen). By decision of the commander of Turkmenistan, the KSAPO troops were assigned a combined artillery battalion of the 122-mm howitzers of the motor rifle regiment of the 201st MSD, the 40th Army fighter regiment regiments that played an important role in the operation, the battalions of the 18th and 20th infantry divisions of the DRA aircraft. The idea of the operation of 1984 - with the words of the head of the operation, Major-General Zgersky GA. consisted of the following actions: covering the entrance to the canyon by MMG forces and batteries of 122 mm-howitzers, to strike aviation and artillery strikes against the base area, all Mujahideen strongholds equipped on the peaks surrounding the Marmoul depression, then simultaneously landing 10 assault groups, 70 men each, to destroy the enemy in strong points equipped around Marmoul and to organize the defense of this area by two bypassing detachments of the 18th Infantry Division of the Armed Forces of the DRA under the command of the Major's Advisor, Major V.N. Vahreneva on converging directions along the tops of the ridge to complete the rout of the retreating enemy and prevent a reinforcement approach to him. In the future, methodical fire raids destroy the minefields on the approaches and inside the canyon. After completing the demining of the area with the help of road engineering equipment, to expand the narrowness in the canyon, to make a colonial path, ensuring the advancement of the technique of moto-maneuvering groups to the Marmoul depression. The border guards got the task to liquidate the mountain bases of the rebels. One of the first such was Marmoul operations, conducted in January‚ÄìFebruary 1984. Three moto-groups, four assault maneuvering groups, 30 helicopters, 9 Afghan infantry battalions, 1 combined artillery battalion of the 201st Motorized Infantry Division and 1 Fighter Aviation Regiment participated in it. The operation was headed by the Chief of the Sapo Army, Major-General G.A. Zgersky. The grouping formed the initial position on the Afghan territory - in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. From here, the operation was managed. The operation was conducted without military intelligence on the basis of operational data. The only way to enter the Marmoul gorge remained a powerful fire defending the defenders from the front with simultaneous active actions of landing groups outside the ridge. In the course of military operations, rebel forces were blocked by ten simultaneously landed border guard units. The units of the Afghan army, acting as part of two detachments from the east and west, blocked the Marmoul depression. Under the fire cover of helicopters, the groups of Afghan servicemen landed from them were thrown to the initial positions and carried out search operations. Actions on a broad front with considerable forces were preceded by powerful artillery and aviation preparation, during which the enemy's air defense weapons were reliably suppressed, minefields and controlled landmines were cleared. Unable to resist the onslaught of troops, the rebels left the base, leaving a huge amount of weapons and ammunition in the caves. The operation began with air and artillery strikes against strong points and rebel firing positions, holding the dominant heights of the single mountain pass and access to the main base in Marmoul. An artillery battery of 122 mm howitzers was placed in front of the canyon at a distance of 5‚Äì6 km. Before it, the defense was occupied by units of the troops of KSAPO, who carried out an order to cover the artillery battery, and made ready to move into the canyon. The detachments completed the liquidation of the strong points and combed the terrain. A great deal of work was done by deminers to clear the area and the colonial tracks in the area of the operation. Before the entrance to the canyon, large-scale charges of incendiary aerial bombs and landmines were mounted into the rock, with remotely controlled mines laid on them. Mine barriers were consolidated into a single network. Undermining the charges and the collapse of the rock, leading to blockages on the roads, the rebels planned to block the way to the armored vehicles of the Soviet troops. The narrow passage to the ravine, in the future, was planned to be used by the enemy to draw equipment and troops into the depths, where by ruptures of landmines and firing into the rear, to defeat, not allowing reinforcements to come up. Head of Operation Lieutenant-General G.A. Zgersky wrote in his memoirs that Marmoul, a village located in a basin surrounded on all sides by high mountains, their peaks defended the rebel firing points. The only road from the flat part of the foothills to the Marmoul depression, suitable for the movement of horse transport, passed along a deep canyon with sheer rocks, 3.5 km long, whose width in the narrowest part was 3.6 meters. In the rocks on the walls of the canyon caves were made, where warehouses were located. The entrance to the canyon, as well as the road, were mined. The management of minefields was remote. The entrance to the canyon is blocked by landmines consisting of an incendiary aerial bomb with mines imposed on it, controlled remotely. Established in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the grouping of border troops led to a significant activation of the actions of the opposition forces. In the Marmoul area, further private, border troops and joint operations were conducted with units of the 40th Army. Interaction was carried out with the units of the army of the Armed Forces and the border troops of the DRA, the battalions of Tsarandoy and the Ministry of State Security of Afghanistan. The stages of the operation in the Marmoul gorge in a sequential order consisted of: massive artillery preparation, powerful air strikes against the rebel strongholds, subsequent landing on the dominant heights, the MMG and DPMG landing groups. In the future, after the reconnaissance actions of the area and its demining, the main forces of the troops were introduced into the region. The completion of the operation was to destroy the base area and capture rebels in the warehouses: weapons, ammunition, medicines.  Results of the Marmoul operation in 1984  Upon completion of the defeat of the enemy and his base, in Marmoul was left Moto- maneuvering group, which was there before the withdrawal of troops from the DRA. It was not possible to restore the mutually beneficial military base in all respects to the rebels. The operation lasted 12 days. 8 rebel strongholds were destroyed. Partially destroyed and captured warehouses with weapons, ammunition and other military assets of the enemy; destroyed about 500 rebels, including field commander Mohammad Zabibullo  The Marmoul operation in 1985  The ¬´Marmoul Operation of 1985 was¬ª conducted in three stages. To the jump sites, the units got on their armored vehicles. After loading into the Mi-8 helicopters, tactical air assault groups were landed in the mountains. During the landing, the enemy did not manage to seriously resist, most of it was destroyed, and the rest surrendered. Caves with a large quantity of weapons and ammunition were captured. In one of the caves was found a hospital with modern medical equipment, a large number of medicines and food. The operating room, the hospital room, rest rooms were provided with energy from alternative power sources, powerful diesel generators and dimensional storage batteries. Among the medical staff of the hospital were Afghans and several female doctors from France. As it became known later, Ahmad Shah Massoud closely interacted with French official representatives.

Career  Undy was born on 2 November 1938 in Nottingham into a Labour-supporting, non-conformist, working-class family who were often trade unionists; his father Harold was a fitter and his mother Harriet (n√©e Holmes) was a housewife. Undy failed the Eleven-plus examination and attended Huntingdon Street secondary modern school before leaving aged 15 to become an apprentice fitter. He worked at the Boots factory in Nottingham from 1954, where he was an active trade unionist (with the Amalgamated Engineering Union), and completed City and Guilds and production engineering qualifications with the support of his employer. He successfully applied for a Trades Union Congress scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, and completed a two-year diploma in social studies there in 1969. He then spent three years at Wadham College, Oxford, as an undergraduate, and left with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and economics in 1972. He then joined the Oxford Centre for Management Studies as a research associate and in 1975 became a research fellow; he was then a fellow in industrial relations from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1983 onward (having been a senior tutor for three years), at the same time that the centre became Templeton College, Oxford. He subsequently served as Dean (1988‚Äì91), Vice-President and Acting President (the latter for the 1991‚Äì92 year) of the college. In 1994, he was also appointed a University Lecturer at the Sa√Ød Business School, where he subsequently became a reader in management studies.Ann Evory and Hal May, Contemporary Authors: A Bio- Bibliographical Guide to Current Writers (Gale, 1985), p. 457.The Times Guide to the House of Commons (The Times, 1974), p. 70.\\"Roger Undy\\", Sa√Ød Business School.

She was the first woman to lead the race, and did so for over a week, before lost time due to a wrong turn left her in a sixth place finish. A few months later, she won the inaugural Race to the Rock, a 3,000 kilometer ultra endurance race from Adelaide, Australia to Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock). She was the only female participant, and was in the lead at William Creek. When she became aware of the conditions ahead at Oodnadatta, she continued through the night without sleep.

Other publishing companies in the collective publishing house are Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag, Bokf√∂rlaget Max Str√∂m, Bonnier Audio, Bonnier Carlsen, Bonnier Fakta, Bonnier Pocket, M√•npocket, Kartago, Resef√∂rlaget and Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand. Forum publishes around seventy titles annually.  History  = Adam Helms and Forum = The early 1940s saw the entrance of Adam Helms on the Swedish book market. Originally from Haslev, Denmark, Helms was a trained bookseller with experience in working in publishing and a well-known profile in the book business. Helms moved to Sweden in 1939 to take up employment as the manager of the Danish-Norwegian department of Importbokhandeln; a position he left in 1944 to found Bokf√∂rlaget Forum on commission of Bonniers. Forum was originally not intended to publish Swedish authors, but focus on translating foreign literature. The base of the publishing company was to be a series of classics, something no other publisher had dared to in Sweden thus far, complemented with popular non-fiction and other translated literature.  The Forum Library  The series of classics was christened Forumbiblioteket, the Forum Library. When the series was launched, one of the insufficiencies of Swedish publishing was the absence of a series of classics, not as a singular instance but rather a permanent institution. Many of the most significant titles throughout history were simply not available in Swedish. Helms ambition with the Forum Library was to make the classics available not only to the book-reading elite, but rather to educate the masses. Models for the series were the German publisher Insel-B√ºcherei, English Everyman's Library and American Modern Library. The first title published by Forumbiblioteket and Bokf√∂rlaget Forum was Ernest Hemingway's Klockan kl√§mtar f√∂r dig (original title For Whom the Bell Tolls) translated by Thorsten Jonsson, and gave Forum a massive start. The vividly discussed screen adaptation of the novel screened in Swedish cinemas at the same time as the book was released. Other titles during Forum's first year were Hjalmar Bergman's Chefen Fru Ingeborg, Alexis Carrel's Den ok√§nda m√§nniskan (Man, The Unknown), E. M. Forster's En f√§rd till Indien (A Passage to India), The Travels of Marco Polo, Strindberg‚Äôs R√∂da Rummet (The Red Room), Voltaire‚Äôs Candide och Steinbeck‚Äôs Riddarna kring Dannys bord (Tortilla Flat). Subsequent titles in the Forum Library are, among others, Strindberg‚Äôs R√∂da rummet, Austen‚Äôs Stolthet och f√∂rdom (Pride and Prejudice), Swift's Gullivers resor (Gulliver‚Äôs Travels), Cervantes‚Äô Don Quijote av la Mancha (The Ingenious Nobleman Sir Quixote of La Mancha), Goethe's Faust, Tolstoy's Krig och fred (War and Peace), etc. Today, the Forum Library and its many titles have contributed to the obliteration of gaps in the publishing of classics in Swedish.  N√§r Var Hur  In the 1930s, Harald Gyllstoff, a publisher from Schleswig-Holstein, persuaded the Danish publishing company Politiken to publish an illustrated annual of facts and events. The first edition was published in 1933 and was called Hvem Hvad Hvor (literally translates to When What How). N√§r Var Hur 1945, the Swedish version on the same idea, was published at the end of 1944 by √Öhl√©n & √Ökerlund and was an immediate commercial success. In 1948, the publishing rights of the Swedish title was passed over to Forum. N√§r Var Hur was a long-lived annual and spawned a vast number of non-fiction titles on variety subjects. Adam Helms wanted to create a non-fiction backlist for Forum to secure revenue and not entirely financially lean on the fiction titles published. Examples of handbooks published from this backlist are, among others, Carl A. Andersson's books on wine ‚Äì Slottstappning (Castle Drafting), Ving√•rdsvandring (Vineyard Walking), Vin och andra drycker (Wine and Other Beverages) and Einar Wallquist's medical book V√•ra sjukdomar (Our Diseases).  Kon-Tiki  In 1947, Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl made and sailed a raft of balsa wood, called Kon- Tiki, from Peru to the Polynesian Islands. The purpose of the trip was to prove that the Polynesian inhabitants originated from America rather than Asia. In the academic world, most people thought Heyerdal a fanatic and questionable scientist. In 1948, Norsk Gyldendal published Heyerdahl's story, which then was sent to Bonniers for consideration, Helms managed to persuade Kaj Bonnier to have it transferred to Forum. Expedition Kon-Tiki (The Kon-Tiki Expedition) was a best seller and an overwhelming success which gave Forum international recognition.  Sigma  In the 1950s, the mathematical cultural history title The World of Mathematics had become a best seller in the US, tempting Adam Helms to undertake a similar project. The result was the classic title Sigma - En matematikens kulturhistoria (Sigma ‚Äì A Cultural History of Mathematics). All the contributions were translated from the original language instead of the English original title, university fact checkers scrutinized the contributions and the printing was done at the small quality printer Victor Pettersson. One of the premier artists in the country at the time, Lennart Rohde, was chosen and given free hands to create the layout of the titles, including a cartridge. There were even revival meetings held for book sellers, where the Sigma message was preached.  Doris Lessing and The Golden Notebook  Albert Bonniers typically received the most as well as the best manuscripts, but the books they rejected would often end up at Forum. Solveig Nellinge at Forum once received a thumbed stack of a manuscript from Bonniers, a novel by an English author of whom she had never heard. The novel was Doris Lessing's Den femte sanningen (The Golden Notebook) and was quickly published as well as followed by several more of Lessing's titles published by Forum. = Forum after Adam Helms = Adam Helms retired from Forum in April 1971. Helms wanted Solveig Nellinge as his successor but Bonnierledningen chose Kjell Petersson, an economist who had worked centrally at Bonniers since the early 1960s, as the new CEO of the publishing company. Solveig Nellinge and Adam Helms subsequently started the publishing company Bokf√∂rlaget Trevi in the fall of 1971. Doris Lessing and Edna O‚ÄôBrien are two of the authors that transferred to Trevi. Under Kjell Petersson Forum started publishing crime novels and thrillers by Swedish authors, which had previously not been done at the publishing house. Authors such as Olov Svedelid, Ulf Durling, Olle H√∂gstrand, Sven S√∂rmark, among others, were instantly successful. However, the publishing house still focused on literary, translated titles, with authors such as Julian Barnes, Jayne Anne Phillips, Claudio Magris and Virginia Woolf. = Bokf√∂rlaget Trevi = The publishing house Bokf√∂rlaget Trevi was founded in 1971 by Adam Helms and Solveig Nellinge, and mainly focused on the publication of female authors such as Karen Blixen, Marie Cardinal, Margaret Drabble, Gis√®le Halimi, Doris Lessing, Ana√Øs Nin, Edna O'Brien and Sylvia Plath. In 1980 Nellinge took full ownership of the publishing company and subsequently sold it to Bonniers in 1991. However, she stayed on as the manager until 1997, when the company was merged with Forum.  The Guinness Book of Records  At the end of the 1950s Forum started publishing Guinness Rekordbok (The Guinness Book of Records), a publication which continued for 30 years.  Imprints within Forum  Over the years, Forum has acquired several publishing companies. In 2000, the publisher Bokf√∂rlaget DN became an imprint under Forum, in 2004 the popular science- focused publishing Fahrenheit was made an imprint and the same year the publishing company Bokf√∂rlaget Fitness was acquired. Bokf√∂rlaget Minotaur was a Swedish publishing company publishing translated crime novels, with their first publication made in 1999. In 2003 it became an imprint under Forum. Minotaur authors include Mark Billingham, Stephen Booth, Reginald Hill, Denise Mina, Peter Robinson and Ian Rankin. As of 2015, the imprint has been completely absorbed into Forum's publishing. In 2016 the imprint Yourlife Books was started; however, it was abandoned the same year. In 2017 the boutique-imprint Lovereads, publishing contemporary romance in Swedish, was started.

He committed a series of brutal murders, committing one of the crimes with accomplices.  Biography  Chizhov was born in a prosperous family, and graduated with honors from a mathematical school. He served his military service in the Airborne forces, as part of the GSFG, then studied at a pedagogical institute. He opened up his own business, becoming the owner of an automobile repair shop. In 1994, Chizhov married and two years later had a daughter, but the family later split up, with the wife filing for divorce and taking the child. During the investigation she explained that the reason for the divorce was the fact that her husband constantly cheated on her, often drank, and also beat her and their daughter. After the divorce, Chizhov began to dislike women. The first offense was committed in March 2006. Rudik Minibaev (b. 1986) and his friend Roman Mindibayev (b. 1984), who worked in the auto shop, brought to Chizhov, as a \\"birthday present\\", a girl named Tatiana Kuznetsova, whom the three of them raped, and after a while the half-dressed girl was thrown out in the forest, where she died from hypothermia. The body was found a month later. In May, Minibaev and Mindibayev fell under suspicion, and a minor acquaintance, who was an eyewitness to the crime, testified against them. Both of them were taken into custody, and Minibaev confessed to the crime, but nobody gave away Chizhov. There was information that the examination did not give evidence against the suspects. Minibaev and his acquaintance declined their testimony, saying that they were tortured by the police. The story was publicized widely, with law enforcement agencies being accused of arbitrariness by the mass media. Minibaev and Mindibayev were released, and received a compensation of 100,000 rubles through the court. From April 2006 to July 2007, Chizhov committed 4 more rapes and 4 murders associated with rape in Birsk and the Mishkinsky District. All the victims were choked to death, three of them buried in a forest near Birsk, and the last one drowned in the Belaya River. To commit the crimes, Chizhov used his clients' cars, where he abducted girls from the streets of Birsk, or picked them up at hitchhiking spots. One of the surviving victims filed a rape application against him, but initially she was refused a criminal case. It is suggested that the reason for the refusal that among some of Chizhov's regular customers were police officers. In July 2007, Chizhov committed his last crime. The killer picked up a girl who hitchhiked on the road, took her to a deserted place, raped and tried to strangle her. But a casual witness frightened him away and the victim remained alive. She remembered the number of the car, but did not recognize the rapist. Through the registration number the detectives came to Chizhov, who by that time had moved to Tolyatti, and was arrested in August. After receiving the results of the examination, which gave evidence against Chizhov, including the first crime for which he was not suspected, the criminal agreed to cooperate. He gave confessions and showed the locations where he buried the bodies. Mindibayev and Minibaev, his accomplices on the first crime, were again arrested. In May 2009, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan found Chizhov guilty of 4 murders associated with raped and 5 rapes. The first crime, despite the death of the victim, was not qualified as a murder, but as \\"criminal endagerment\\". According to the totality of crimes, Chizhov was sentenced to 22.5 years of imprisonment in a strict-regime colony. Mindibayev and Minibaev received 8.5 years of imprisonment and were obliged to return the compensation amount paid after their first arrest. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without charges. It was suggested that Mindibayev and Minibaev were not acquainted with Chizhov and were not involved in the crime. The question of its reliability remained open. On March 29, 2012, the head of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Bashkortosan, Aleksei Kasyanov, denied the claims of torture against both of them, and said that it was just an attempt to discredit the investigation. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"A trip to the cost of life\\" from the series \\"Criminal Chronicles\\" * Documentary film \\"The Birsky Maniac\\" from the series \\"Honest Detective\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Two years of horror.

Although catalyzed by the hiring of cost-cutting water consultancy Veolia in 2012, and an unauthorized change of anti-erosion chemicals in 2014, this spike in lead concentration has roots in decades of lead pipe erosion. Since the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) first failed its water quality test in 2016, it has exceeded the federal lead threshold of 15 ppb by almost 1.5 times. This level of lead contamination poses serious health risks to residents, particularly children and pregnant women. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the PWSA has begun removing lead pipes from the city's water lines and has decided to introduce orthophosphate to the water supply.  Lead contamination  While the Pittsburgh water supply has suffered from a variety of contaminants, the most persistent contaminant has been lead from the aging lead piping infrastructure throughout the city. = Causes = Pittsburgh's water lines include a significant number of lead pipes which have inevitably eroded to a certain degree within the past few decades. In 2014, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) broke state law by switching from soda ash to caustic soda as an anti-corrosion treatment without first receiving the necessary approval and permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) as required by Pennsylvania. This unauthorized switch sparked an increase in erosion levels that made the water's lead levels spike beyond the federal limit of 15 ppm. = Risks = Lead is a neurotoxin and of particular concern for children and pregnant women. In children, lead poisoning can contribute to developmental delays and learning disabilities as well as other varied symptoms including but not limited to irritability, weight loss, abdominal pain, and hearing loss. Newborns with lead poisoning are prone to premature death, lower birth weight, and delayed growth. If women get lead poisoning while pregnant, they are at a higher risk for miscarriage. With prolonged exposure, lead poisoning can lead to damage in the brain, kidneys, and nervous system in people of all ages, especially children. Although the federal lead threshold is 15 ppm, any concentration of lead in water is potentially dangerous to consumers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a set reference level of 5 micrograms per deciliter (¬µg/dL) to identify children with elevated blood lead levels.  Public response  About a quarter of PWSA customers receive their water supply through lead pipes, thus putting a significant portion of the Pittsburgh population at risk for lead consumption. Pittsburgh residents have complained about rising water prices alongside contaminated water. Many unknowingly consumed lead-contaminated water, which can have long-term negative health effects. Since the solutions PWSA have proposed have yet to be fully implemented, some Pittsburgh residents have taken matters into their own hands by submitting personal water samples to laboratories for lead testing as well as installing filters into their water systems.  Connections to Flint, Michigan  Flint, Michigan had a highly publicized and controversial lead crisis shortly before Pittsburgh. = Veolia = Both the Flint and Pittsburgh lead crises were triggered by the misuse of chemicals to treat their water supplies. In both cases, the private water company Veolia was involved. Flint hired Veolia in 2015 to help manage the lead crises, while Pittsburgh hired Veolia in 2012 before the lead crises emerged as a serious issue. However, in both cases, the cities complained of the lead problems worsening after hiring Veolia. Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette filed a lawsuit against Veolia in 2016 for professional negligence. The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority similarly tried to press charges, but Veolia struck back with claims that PWSA is responsible for the chemical change that sparked the Pittsburgh lead crises. Ultimately, the charges from both parties were dropped in Pittsburgh, and while the charges in Flint were not dropped, Veolia has not taken responsibility for the lead crisis, particularly since the decision to switch Flint's water source happened prior to the city's contract with Veolia. = Publicity = In 2017, Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, who helped reveal the Flint lead crisis, pointed out that Pittsburgh's lead levels were higher than Flint's. Although the Pittsburgh lead crisis has been of comparable magnitude to Flint's, it has been significantly less publicized as officials have seemingly downplayed the issue. Elected official Chelsa Wagner, controller of Allegheny County which includes Pittsburgh, criticized the Pittsburgh health department for failing to acknowledge the full extent of lead exposure in the area.  Solutions  The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority has proposed both a long term and short term solution to alleviate the water supply's lead contamination. = Long term = After a lead test revealed Pittsburgh's water supply was exceeding the federal limit in 2016, the PWSA was ordered to replace public lead service lines. However, as the PWSA embarked on this task, an unexpected obstacle interfered with the progress of the lead pipe removal. Since they were only required to replace public water lines, private lead lines were left behind. This actually leaves the possibility of exacerbating the lead contamination since construction on the public lines physically disturbs the private lines, thus breaking up the lining within the pipes meant to prevent lead erosion. Because of this risk, the practice of removing only public service lines was discontinued mid-2017. A couple of months after the city ceased removing lead lines, legislation was passed that allowed the PWSA to use Pittsburgh's public safety powers to remove both public and private lines. The best, long-term solution is to remove all of the lead service lines in the city, but despite the legislation allowing for this to happen, it is still a lengthy and expensive endeavor that is unlikely to be fulfilled within the next ten years and could cost close to $400 million. = Short term = While the pipe removal process is underway, the PWSA has decided to add orthophosphate to the water as a means of reducing lead corrosion. Since orthophosphates are attracted to the lining of metal pipes, they serve as a protective coating that prevents lead from leaching out of the pipes. In a study comparing orthophosphate to soda ash, the PWSA and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) came to the conclusion that orthophosphate would be more effective as an anti-corrosive mechanism. While the orthophosphate solution has yet to be implemented, the PWSA anticipates that it will prevent the lead contamination from worsening until all of the city's lead piping can be removed.

He was described as one of the pioneer film personalities of 1960's Telugu Film Industry. Doondi produced and directed about 29 films in Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi. In 2005, he also served as the Nandi Awards Committee Chairman. Early life Doondeswara was born into an affluent family, the son of Pothina Srinivasa Rao and his wife Achchaayyamma. His father had built Maruthi Talkies, which was the very first cinema theatre to open in the territory which is now the state of Andhra Pradesh. Doondi's elder brother, Surendranath Benarjee, who was incidentally a classmate of NTR, used to look after the family's movie business (Maruthi Talkies & Srinivasa Mahal). He also kept close relations with film personalities in Madras through his Maruti Talkies connections. Doondi attended the Rishi Valley School and Chennai Christian College, where he was known for his keen interest in films. Film career In 1955, Doondi visited the famous Vauhini Studios in Chennai. Following the advice of B. Nagi Reddy of Vauhini Studios, Doondi successfully dubbed a Tamil film into Telugu, and the Telugu version was released as Kondaveeti Donga in 1958. This movie was an unprecedented hit and remains a much-loved classic to this day. Following this initial success, Doondi was offered a business partnership with Sunderlal Nahata, the father of film producer Srikant Nahata and father-in-law of actress Jayaprada Nahata. Doondi co-produced Jayam Manade with N. T. Rama Rao in 1956. He later made the story of the Super hit Film, Shanti Nivasam in 1960 with ANR, based on the Hindi film \\"Aaina\\".

These films include Bhale Dongalu, Dongala Veta and \\"Marapurani Katha\\" He was considered a leader in adapting south Indian movies for Hindi audiences. Along with Sundarlal Nahata, he produced Farz in 1967, introducing Ravikant Nagaich as a director and served as a stepping stone to success for Jeetendra. This was again a remake of the Super Hit Telugu Film, Gudachari 116. This film was a significant box office success and supposedly made Jeetendra a popular Hero. Doondi produced Pyar Ki Kahani in 1971 https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/its-flashback-time- for-amitabh-bachchan/date=5 May 2015 which gave breakthrough to Amithab bachan, a remake of the Tamil Film, Kai Koduttha Dheivam, starring Sivaji Ganesan and Savitri (actress) In 1969.

Frankfort, Ky. : State Board of Education, 1974. Its headquarters are located in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1848, Kentucky citizens voted for a law that allowed taxation to support schools. In 1938, a new law was passed allowing vocational-technical schools to be formed. In 1956, vocational-technical schools were expanded to help those who were blind, with a focus on providing training and jobs for the visually impaired. The vocational schools became controlled, like other public schools in the state, by the Department of Education in 1962.

Kentucky Board of Education  The Kentucky Board of Education was established 1838. The Board consisted ex officio members with limited ability to function effectively as the members had other responsibilities within the state. The Board's powers, at that time, included creating laws, establishing a course of study and choosing course texts, and control of funds and property. The Board of Education is responsible for granting certificates for high school graduates and teacher training. The Kentucky Board of Education consists of 11 members. The Governor appoints the members and they are confirmed by both the state House of Representatives and the Senate. The Board members political affiliation is not considered in appointments. Board members must be at least 30 years old, have an associates degree or higher, and lived in Kentucky for at least 3 years. Each member serves for 4 years. Today the Board's primary purpose is to make and adopt regulations and policies. The state Board of Education has power over all of the schools in the state. Local boards of education have power over each of the schools located within its district. Each district board deals with issues that are of interest to the district. There have been conflicts between the Board of Education and the Department of Education. The Kentucky Department of Education has jurisdiction over county boards. In November 2015 the Knox County Board of Education was investigated by the Kentucky Department of Education for violating Kentucky laws such as including personal matters in district rules that disrupt operations and providing free resources to independent schools.Smith, Kristina. ‚ÄúKentucky Law, Board Policy Violations by Knox Board of Education Uncovered in State Report.‚Äù Times- Tribune, The (Corbin, KY), 28 Nov. 2015.

Positions  = Superintendent = The 1838 law that established a Board of Education in Kentucky also called for the governor to select a superintendent to serve for a two-years term. A law passed in 1850 allowed the superintendent to serve for 4 years and be elected by the people. An 1891 law prohibits the re-election of superintendents. The superintendent approves the building of new schools, monitors spending, and ensures school administrations follow laws passed by the Board of Education. In 1893 the power of selecting books was given to the superintendent. Superintendents are required to work full-time in an office in Frankfort. Notable superintendents include John Cabell Breckinridge, the superintendent in 1849, and Lyman V. Ginger, the superintendent in 1974. The current superintendent is Wayne Lewis. = Other = Other positions include a Deputy Superintendent and Secretary.

The Kentucky FFA Association is home to 144 high school chapters and 12 middle school chapters as of the year 2017. History The Kentucky FFA Association was founded on April 16, 1930 at The Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1937, the Kentucky FFA Leadership Training Center was founded in Hardinsburg, Kentucky; where the Kentucky FFA Association archives are located and it still remains the location of Kentucky FFA Camp today. In 1957, Howard Downing (of Jessamine County) became the first National FFA President from Kentucky. Kenneth Kennedy (of Trigg County) became the next National FFA president from Kentucky in 1964. In 1977, 12 years after the New Farmers of America and the Future Farmers of America merged to create one organization, The Kentucky FFA Association had its first African American state president Steve Washington (of Adairville). In 1979, Pam Brinkley was elected the first female State FFA Officer in Kentucky. In 1984, Kentucky had its third National FFA President Steve Merideth (of Hardin County). In 1987, The Kentucky FFA Foundation, which raises and manages funds for the organization, was formed.

The Annual Kentucky FFA State Convention is where students who have won competitions on the regional level come to compete at the state level. It is also where the State FFA Degree is awarded to members and where the State Stars in Agriculture are named. Each chapter submits forms to be ranked by their accomplishments and work done throughout the school year‚Äîchapters can receive a gold, silver, or bronze star ranking. It is also where the new Kentucky FFA State Officer team is interviewed and elected by the Nominating Committee. Kentucky FFA Camp is where students from every FFA chapter in Kentucky are invited to spend the week learning leadership skills, preparing for the school year ahead, and participating in athletic competitions. During Kentucky FFA Camp, a Camp Council is elected to serve as an Officer Team for the respective week of camp. Camp council is responsible for raising and lowering the American flag each day and for delivering reports during each session. Students can also take classes to learn trade skills (e.g. welding, tractor driving, electrical safety, etc.). The Rising Sun Conference is open to two officers from every chapter of the Kentucky FFA Association and serves as a way to unify beliefs and share ideas across the state of Kentucky. The members spend a weekend with counterparts from across the state comparing programs of activities and ideas to incorporate into their chapters. The conference also serves as a time where the Kentucky FFA State Officer team can express their goals for the coming year and challenge the officers at the chapter level to help carry them out. The Blue and Gold Gala is hosted by the Kentucky FFA Foundation and serves as a fundraiser for the organization. Anyone is invited to event where funds are raised through ticket sales, donations, silent auction items, and live auction items.

The Miss Kentucky Teen America competition is a beauty pageant that selects the representative for the state of Kentucky in the Miss Teen America pageant. The current titleholder is Gena Blair. The Miss Kentucky Teen America Princess and Kentucky's Beautiful Baby Contest are offered for participants under the age of 13 to represent the state of Kentucky. The Miss Kentucky Teen America pageant is held in Danville, Kentucky.Harvey, Alyssa.  Eligibility  The participant must be a single, legally recognized female between the age of 13-18 years old. Specifically, the contestant has to be under 19 years old before August 1st of the upcoming pageant year. Also, the applicant must have never been married or given birth to a child. The teen entrant must not have attended college on a full-time basis prior to both the state and national pageant. Each year, the winner of the Miss Kentucky Teen America pageant competes for the Miss Teen America title, commonly held during the summer months.  Criteria  Similar to national and international pageants, this state pageant consists of an interview, fashion modeling, active wear, and evening gown competition. Specific to the teen division, the active wear competition replaces the swimsuit competition. In addition, a fun fashion modeling competition is added. There is no talent competition. Experience is not necessary, although, it may be beneficial for a contestant. Some contestants grow up competing, while others do not. Either way, experience does not contribute to the crowning of Miss Kentucky Teen America.Harvey, Alyssa. To begin the interview with judges, the contestant is expected to give a 30 second introduction. From there, questions are proposed by the judges from the contestant's resume. The judges look for effective communication and valid reasoning for the contestant's opinion on current issues from a local and global perspective. During the fun fashion modeling competition, the teen selects a modest outfit of choice that reflects her personality and follows the length guidelines for shorts, skirts, and dresses. The active wear competition emphasizes the importance of health, energy, and fitness. The teens are expected to wear a sports bra, tank (optional), and shorts. During the final competition, the teen selects a floor-length gown of her choice.  Prizes and Awards  Many young women pursue pageantry for the purpose of scholarship money. \\"Miss Kentucky speaks out\\". The Courier-Journal. 1995-08-09. p. 35. Retrieved 2018-11-18.

Today, the state scholarships are determined by the national organization. At the national level, the contestant crowned as Miss Teen America can earn up to a 10,000 scholarship. In the past, a teen pageant winner has received over 14,000 dollars worth of prizes.\\"Senior wins Miss Kentucky Teen\\". The Advocate-Messenger. 1988-05-12. p. 9. Retrieved 2018-11-27. Today, the winner of Miss Kentucky Teen America receives a paid entree fee for the national pageant, Miss Teen America.

The winner's prizes include a state crown, rhinestone embroidered satin sash, trophy, flowers, rhinestone crown pendant, rhinestone earrings, custom tote with gifts, autograph cards, personal planner, apparel, and cosmetics. All contestants are given a State Finalist Award and portfolio of photos.  Current Director  Since 2006, Jessica Glasscock has served as the director of the Miss Kentucky Teen America Organization. Jessica is a graduate of the University of Kentucky with a degree in Integrated Strategic Communications. Besides her role as a director, she is a current boutique owner. In 2001, she held the title of Miss Kentucky Teen America.  Other Hosted Events  = Princess Pageants = The Kentucky Princess Pageants are offered for girls between the ages of 3 and 13 years old, who are interested in competing. This competition does not advance to a national level like Miss Kentucky Teen America does, meaning it does not require a contract and the girls are free to compete in other pageants within the state. The princess pageant winners work with the Miss Kentucky Teen America titleholder. Every year, this division is commonly hosted at the end of March.\\"Miss Kentucky Princess Pageants are March 30\\". The Case County News. 2013-03-20. p. 6. Retrieved 2018-10-24. The Princess Pageant titleholder must attend a minimum of six public appearances throughout the year, have a social media platform, and participate in community service and photoshoots through the organization. There are four divisions: Kentucky's Tiny Miss (ages 3-5), Kentucky's Little Miss (ages 6-8), Kentucky's Young Miss (ages 9-11), and Kentucky's Junior Miss (ages 12-13). For the Princess Pageant, there are four categories, similar to the teen division, which are fun fashion, on-stage production, formal wear modeling, and an on-stage interview. Each of the four competitions makes up 25% of the contestant's total score. During the phase one competition, the princess will choose an outfit of her choice and give a 30 second introduction. For phase two, contestants will choose an appropriate dress of choice. The judges' scores are based on the style and fit of the dress, as well as the on-stage interview. It is a one question interview that exemplifies the young girl's personality. For example, a child may be asked to tell the audience what her favorite color is. Each princess contestant is entered in separate contests, Superlative Title Optionals, for competing in the pageant. Superlative titles for the contest include categories such as \\"prettiest smile\\" and \\"best dressed\\" that do not affect the results of the beauty pageant itself. = Beautiful Baby Contest = In addition, the organization offers a Kentucky's Beautiful Baby Contest. In 2013, the relatively new contest began for three age divisions. The competition ages are from newborn to 11 months old, one years old, and two years old. This is a fast pace pageant where the baby or toddler dresses up in church attire or a pageant dress that is judged on color, fit, and style. The judges attention deviates towards the \\"happiest\\" baby. Similar to the Princess Pageants, there are Superlative Title Optionals that the baby or toddler is entered in. For an additional charge of $25, the contestant can be entered in a \\"most photogenic\\" contest.  Optional Contests  For all of the teen division and some of the princess and baby divisions, there are additional contests. The contests include most photogenic, most promising model, academic achievement, community service, and an essay contest.
