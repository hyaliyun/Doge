From 1859, she was commissioned for numerous royal portraits by Queen Victoria.  Biography  Dixon was the eldest daughter of seven children (two sons, five daughters) born to a corn chandler in Horncastle, Lincolnshire. She began working with water-colour by the mid-19th century, and completed portraits in Horncastle. She was instructed by Magdalene Dalton (n√©e Ross), sister of portrait painter William Charles Ross. Despite this instruction, Dixon did not spend much time studying art, copying pictures, or pursuing further education. Princess Beatrice Dixon worked in Hull, on the Isle of Wight, and in London until the end of the 19th century. From 1844 to 1893, Dixon displayed 222 portraits at the Royal Academy. In 1859, Dixon received her first Royal commission from Queen Victoria, to paint a miniature of Princess Blanche d'Orl√©ans (1857-1932) at Claremont. A number of her portraits remain in the Royal Collection. The royal favour she received from Queen Victoria allowed Dixon to earn further commissions from nobility. Her works are noted for having characteristics of using warm flesh tones (especially in the forehead) and yellow in the sky. Dixon occasionally used gilded backgrounds in her work. Her skill at capturing likenesses meant that she had a successful career during a time when many portraitists were facing competition from the advent of photography. Dixon died on 15 February 1901 at the age of 83 and was buried in Horncastle cemetery.

It follows the valleys of Zwickauer Mulde and Mulde from Glauchau via Rochlitz and Grimma to Wurzen and is hence also known as Muldentalbahn (Mulde valley railway). Regular traffic on the line ended in the early 2000s. The section between Glauchau and Gro√übothen has been leased by Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn since 2005 and has been protected as a cultural monument since 2016, the remainder has been decommissioned.  History  Already in 1860, a committee formed in Penig with the aim of constructing a railway from Glauchau to Wurzen. In 1864 the Saxon parliament permitted the construction of a railway from Leipzig along the Mulde valley to Chemnitz. Since no private entrepreneur could be found for this project, permission was granted instead in 1868 for a railway from Glauchau via Wurzen to the border with Prussia. The private Muldenthal- Eisenbahngesellschaft was awarded the concession for the construction and operation of a railway between Glauchau and Wurzen on 29 April 1872. No concession was granted for the line to the border, because a continuation in Prussia could not be guaranteed. While the right of way was intended for double-track operation which was taken into account in the construction of the Rochsburg tunnel and several bridges, due to the lack of a northern continuation the traffic never reached the levels that would have justified doubling of the line. Nevertheless the line was built to mainline standards. It was put into operation in several stages: * from Glauchau to Penig on 10 May 1875, * from Rochlitz to Gro√übothen on 9 December 1875, * from Penig to Rochlitz on 29 May 1876, and * from Gro√übothen to Wurzen on 30 June 1877. On 1 August 1878 the Muldenthal-Eisenbahngesellschaft was taken over by the Saxon state, the line and the rolling stock passed into the hands of the Royal Saxon State Railways. The separate station in Wurzen was closed, and the station of the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway became the terminus of the Muldentalbahn. The Rabenstein bridge near Grimma was strengthened in 1931 which was possible without interrupting the traffic, because the line and the bridge had been prepared for double-tracked operation. Last remaining span of the Rabenstein bridge near Grimma, repaired after World War II, but unused (1977) On 15 April 1945 the Rabenstein bridge across the Mulde river was destroyed, and the line remained interrupted between Gro√übothen and Grimma unterer Bahnhof. Tracks on this section were lifted for war reparations, and despite repairs to the bridge they were never relaid. Passenger traffic between Grimma unterer Bahnhof and Nerchau ceased on 28 May 1967, but was partly reopened with trains between Golzern and Wurzen on 24 September 1967, before ceasing on this section completely on 31 May 1969. The Wurzen-Golzern section remained in operation for freight traffic as an extended siding of Wurzen station, and tracks were renewed between Nerchau and Golzern in the 1970s. The right of way near Dorna-D√∂ben station was used for a widening of the parallel road. A connecting curve between this line and the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway was built south of Gro√übothen in the mid-1970s. It was mainly intended for strategic reasons and was only used for regular traffic for a short time in 1995 while a bridge in Gro√übothen was renewed. Preparations had been made for deploying a temporary bridge across the River Mulde between Neichen and Trebsen, the terminus of the line from Beucha. For this purpose, a track had been laid from Trebsen station to the left bank of the river. Freight traffic between Wurzen and Golzern ended on 2 June 1996. Only a short section between Wurzen and a silicate factory in nearby Dehnitz remains in operation, the remainder of the Wurzen‚ÄìGrimma section has been transformed into a cycle trail. Faulty trackwork caused the passenger trains between Colditz and Rochlitz to be replaced by buses from 6 December 1999, and freight traffic between Gro√übothen and Wechselburg officially ceased on 5 December 1999. Passenger traffic between Rochlitz and Gro√übothen ceased on 27 May 2000, freight traffic between Glauchau and Wechselburg on 2 July 2000, and passenger traffic between Wechselburg and Rochlitz on 9 June 2001. Operations on the last section between Glauchau and Wechselburg ceased on 13 August 2002 in the course of the 2002 European floods which caused widespread damage in the area, and because of the poor state of the line and several engineering works along it. Track motor car in Amerika halt (2013) Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn (DRE) leased the Glauchau-Gro√übothen line and the Rochlitz‚ÄìNarsdorf section of the Rochlitz‚ÄìPenig railway in 2005 with the intention of preserving the infrastructure and resuming the traffic in stages. Lack of finances, damages to the embankment following the construction of a motorway, and damages to bridges due to vehicle collisions have delayed the resumption of operations, so that the first DRE train between Glauchau and Wolkenburg could only run in October 2010. After some sections of track had been cleared of vegetation, a regional support association in cooperation with a major Saxon railway club have conducted several touristic operations with a track motor car. When the grounds and the infrastructure of the line were sold by Deutsche Bahn to a private company in Chemnitz in late 2015, fears of a dismantlement of the line were countered by a successful petition for the line being granted the status of a protected monument. This was awarded in early 2016.  Description of the line  From Glauchau to Sermuth the line follows the river Zwickauer Mulde, from there to Wurzen the joint Mulde river. Motorway bridge across river, railway, and road near Penig The Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen line branches off the Dresden‚ÄìWerdau railway at the eastern end of Glauchau station. Near Remse station, it runs parallel to today's Bundesstra√üe 175, but on the other side of the river. Between Wolkenburg and Thierbach-Zinnberg stations it changes from the right to the left bank of Zwickauer Mulde. Between Thierbach-Zinnberg and Penig it crosses over state road S57 on a bridge, just metres before the latter crosses the river on another bridge. A third bridge leads the motorway A 72, opened in 2011, across river, road, and railway. Railway bridge near Rochlitz castle In Penig station the line from Narsdorf which had been opened in 1872 joined from the north. After Rochsburg station the railway passes a tunnel and then a bridge across the river, and after Lunzenau station it passes under the G√∂hren Viaduct, which leads the Neukieritzsch‚ÄìChemnitz railway across the valley of Zwickauer Mulde. About 500 m on, immediately after the bridge across the Chemnitz, the Wechselburg‚ÄìK√ºchwald railway approached from the right and ran parallel to the Mulde valley line until Wechselburg station where the two lines joined. Between Steudten halt and Rochlitz station, the line crosses to the left bank of the river on a lattice girder bridge near Rochlitz castle. Rochlitz station was the junction with the Rochlitz‚ÄìPenig railway and the Waldheim‚ÄìRochlitz railway. North of Rochlitz the Mulde valley line crosses to the right bank of the river, passing Lastau station and crossing to the left bank again before reaching Colditz, running parallel to today's Bundesstra√üe 107. Before reaching Gro√übothen station, the terminus of the southern section of the line since its interruption in 1945, it crosses over the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway. The tracks of the Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway are north of the Gro√übothen station building. North of Gro√übothen the line passed Kloster Nimbschen halt and crossed on Rabenstein bridge on the right bank of the Mulde. It followed the bends of the river, passing under motorway A 14 north of Golzern station, until Neichen which was the junction of the narrow gauge line from M√ºgeln. There the railway left the immediate vicinity of the river and ran in a mostly straight line until Wurzen station where it joined the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway from the southeast at signal box 2.

She was unbeaten in three starts as a two-year-old in 2012 including the Listed Washington Singer Stakes and the Group Two Rockfel Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the 1000 Guineas before winning the Irish 1000 Guineas and finishing third in the Coronation Stakes. As a four-year-old she produced her best form in North America where she won the E. P. Taylor Stakes as well as being placed in the Beverly D. Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. After being sold for a record price of 4.5 million guineas at the end of 2014 she was beaten on her only start as a five-year-old and was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Background Just The Judge is a bay or brown mare with a white star and a white sock on her left foreleg bred in Ireland by Joan Keaney Dempsey. As a yearling in September 2011 the filly was offered for sale at the Goffs Orby sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨50,000 by the bloodstock agency BBA Ireland and the trainer Charles Hills. She entered the ownership of the Sangster family and Matthew Green and was taken into training by Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire. She is from the second crop of foals sired by Lawman who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix Jean Prat in 2006. His other progeny have included Most Improved, Marcel and Harbour Law. Just The Judge's dam Faraday Light showed absolutely no racing ability, finishing tailed-off in both of her races. She was, however, a descendant of the influential Irish broodmare Mesopotamia (foaled 1961), who was the ancestor of many major winners including Halling, Mastery, Balla Cove and Cherokee Rose. Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= Just The Judge was ridden in all three of her races by her trainer's brother Michael Hills. On her racecourse debut she started the 11/4 joint-favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 26 June. After being restrained towards the rear of the nine-runner field she began to make progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Pompeia. On 18 August the filly was moved up in class and matched against male opposition for the Listed Washington Singer Stakes over the same course and distance. Starting at odds of 3/1 she was held up by Hills in the early stages she made \\"smooth headway\\" to join the leaders a furlong out and then accelerated to win by a length from the colt Excess Knowledge. After the race a half-share in the filly was bought by Sheikh Fahad Al Thani's Qatar Racing. After an eight-week break Just The Judge returned in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 13 October and started at odds of 6/1 in an eleven-runner field. The Irish-trained Gift From Heaven started favourite started favourite whilst the other runners included Melody of Love (Firth of Clyde Stakes) and Scintillula (runner-up in the Moyglare Stud Stakes). After racing just behind the front-runners she accelerated into the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by one and three quarter lengths from the Luca Cumani-trained Nargys. Charles Hills commented \\"She won like a nice filly and Michael said she still had another gear. She has gone away again when she hit the rising ground. She has gone in her coat and had a bad scope following her last run and we had thought of not running today, but I am delighted we decided to give it one more go\\". =2013: three-year-old season= Jamie Spencer took over as Just The Judge's jockey in 2013 and rode her in all but one of her subsequent races. On her three-year-old debut, Just The Judge was one of fifteen fillies to contest the 200th edition of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 5 May. Starting the 7/1 third favourite she tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten half a length into second place by Sky Lantern. Three weeks after her run at Newmarket, the filly was sent to Ireland and started the 2/1 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Her fourteen opponents included Big Break (Killavullan Stakes), Maureen (Princess Margaret Stakes, Fred Darling Stakes), Harasiya (Silver Flash Stakes), Just Pretending (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial) and Rehn's Nest (Park Express Stakes). After settling behind the leaders Just The Judge began to make progress in the last quarter mile, overtook Just Pretending 150 yards from the finish and \\"stayed on well\\" to win by one and a half lengths from Rehn's Nest. After the race Hills said \\"I'm feeling relieved at the moment, but I'm sure I'll wake up in the middle of the night and think it's great. Jamie never really had to pick the stick up and he gave her a beautiful ride\\". Just The Judge faced a rematch with Sky Lantern in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 21 June. She took the lead approaching the final furlong but was no match for Sky Lantern who accelerated past her to win by four lengths, with Just The Judge losing second place to the French-trained Kenhope in the final strides. She was moved up in distance for the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 3 August but made no impact and finished unplaced behind Winsili. On er final run of the year, in Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket on 28 September she led the field for most of the way before fading badly and finishing sixth of the seven runners. =2014: four- year-old season= On her debut as a four-year-old Just The Judge was matched against male opposition in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket on 17 April and finished fifth behind the eight-year-old gelding Mull of Killough. She returned to female competition and started favourite for the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom in early but was beaten into third place by the six- year-old Thistle Bird and Odeliz. She faced Thistle Bird again in the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh later that month but again proved no match for the older mare and finished third of the eight runners. For the remainder of the season Just The Judge was campaigned in North America. IN the Grade I Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington Park on 16 August she had some trouble obtaining a clear run before finishing strongly and taking a close third behind Euro Charline and Stephanie's Kitten. On 19 October at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto Just The Judge started 1.6/1 favourite for the E. P. Taylor Stakes over one and a quarter miles with the best-fancied of her seven opponents being Deceptive Vision (Canadian Stakes) and Odeliz. After being restrained at the rear of the field she began to make progress three furlongs out before being having to be switched to the right hampering a rival in the process, to make space for her challenge. She took the lea a furlong out and despite hanging left and right in the final strides she stayed on to win by half a length from Odeliz. Spencer commented \\"the race was very unsatisfactory... it was very, very tight where I was. Then she had to make a little bit of room for herself early in the stretch. I was trying to not give her too hard of a race because obviously this is basically a stepping stone to the Breeders' Cup. So the plan was just to win here and ship on down. She's won but I'd prefer if it had gone a little bit smoother.\\" Two weeks after her win in Canada, Just The Judge was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park. She stayed on in the straight without being able to reach the lead and finished third behind Dayatthespa and Stephanie's Kitten with the favourite Dank in fourth. In December Just The Judge was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 4.5 million guineas by Qatar Racing & China Horse Club. The price was a record for a filly sold at public auction in Britain. As Qatar Racing had previously been partners in the ownership, the sale effectively saw the China Horse Club buying the Sangster Family's share. =2015: five-year-old season= On her first and only start for her new owners Just The Judge started a 28/1 outsider for the Sheema Classic over 2400 metres at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai on 28 March. Ridden by Andrea Atzeni she led the field into the straight before fading and finishing sixth of the nine runners behind Dolniya. After she suffered a tendon injury Just The Judge was retired from racing in July 2015. Hills said \\"All good things come to an end, but I'm very proud of Just The Judge's achievements. She's been a tremendously sound filly, and with three months' rest could have raced on, but she had nothing else to prove on the racecourse\\". Breeding record Just The Judge produced three foals. She died in April 2019 after undergoing surgery for colic.

It has received attention for articles on Donald Trump's presidency.  Background  The blog was started in September 2010 by Benjamin Wittes (a former editorial writer for The Washington Post), Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith, and University of Texas at Austin law professor Robert Chesney. Goldsmith was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the George W. Bush administration's Justice Department, and Chesney served on a detention-policy task force in the Obama administration. Its writers include law professors, law students, and former George W. Bush and Barack Obama administration officials.  Donald Trump  Lawfare's coverage of intelligence and legal matters related to the Trump administration has brought the blog significant increases in readership and national attention. In January 2017, the website's traffic was up by 1,101% from 12 months before. = Executive Order 13769 = The blog came to prominence in January 2017 when President Donald Trump tweeted \\"LAWFARE\\" and quoted a line from one of its blog posts that criticized the reasoning in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that blocked Trump's first refugee-and- travel ban. Trump reportedly tweeted the excerpt minutes after the line was quoted on Morning Joe. Wittes, who supported the court ruling, criticized Trump harshly for the tweet, asserting that Trump distorted the argument presented in the article. Wittes also wrote that it was disturbing that Trump, among other things, cited the line \\"with apparently no idea who the author was or what the publication was, and indeed without reading the rest of the article\\", and that no one in the White House vetted the tweet. = Dismissal of FBI Director James Comey = On May 18, 2017, Lawfare's editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes was the principal source of an extensive New York Times report about President Trump's interactions with FBI Director James Comey, and how those interactions related to Comey's subsequent firing. Wittes also provided a 25-minute interview to PBS NewsHour on the same subject. Comey had reportedly been \\"disgusted\\" with Trump's attempts to publicly ingratiate himself with Comey saw as calculated attempts to compromise him by agitating Democrats. Comey had also reportedly found that people in the Trump administration were \\"not honorable\\". Wittes elaborated on this shortly thereafter in a post on Lawfare. = Trump's disclosure of classified intelligence = In a widely read column, several Lawfare contributors argued that Trump's reported disclosure of classified intelligence to Russia in mid- May 2017 was \\"perhaps the gravest allegation of presidential misconduct in the scandal-ridden four months of the Trump administration.\\" The column further alleged that Trump's reported actions \\"may well be a violation of the President's oath of office.\\"  Reception  Journalist David Ignatius described Lawfare as \\"one of the most fair-minded chroniclers of national security issues.\\" According to Daniel W. Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Lawfare is an example of \\"outside intellectuals\\" who \\"exercised real influence in the Trump era.\\" The blog has been criticized by attorney and journalist Glenn Greenwald. Writing in The New York Times he said the blog has a \\"courtier Beltway mentality\\" devoted to \\"serving, venerating and justifying the acts of those in power.\\" References External links * American political blogs National security of the United States Publications established in 2010 Internet properties established in 2010 American legal websites Donald Trump ","title":"Lawfare (blog)"},{"id":"53481281","text":"Anthony Berenstein (born 2 March 1997) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a winger for Eerste Divisie club SC Telstar.Berenstein vertrekt per direct bij Magreb‚Äô90: ‚ÄòIk kan op deze manier niet spelen‚Äô‚Äö voetbal247.nl, 30 December 2017 Club career He made his professional debut in the Eerste Divisie for FC Dordrecht on 5 August 2016 in a game against FC Oss.

During the conflict, he served as second lieutenant abroad . In 1745, an unprepared Anglesea was attacked and captured by a French warship. Phillips was court-martialed and executed for surrendering his ship while in command, his superiors having fallen to French fire. His court-martial was widely criticised and led to an amendment of the British Articles of War.  Naval service  On 28 March 1745, Anglesea sailed out of Kingsale, having landed her first Lieutenant, among others, due to illness and proceeded to the mouth of the English Channel. The warship was under the command of Captain Jacob Elton, and was tasked with patrolling the Channel for French shipping. On the afternoon of 29 March, a large sail was spotted windward (upwind) of Anglesea, with the vessel heading in the direction of the British warship. Believing the oncoming ship to be HMS Augusta, Captain Elton retired below deck to take his dinner. The ship quickly approached Anglesea, with it eventually being discovered that the ship flew French colours on her quarter. This was the 50-gun Apollon, which closed and prepared for action with the seemingly idle British warship. In the confusion aboard the British ship, Captain Elton ordered Anglesea's foresail raised in preparation for a retreat. The effect of this action was to blow the ship to one side and flood the lower gun decks. Apollon laid down a withering fire onto Anglesea, with the first broadside killing both Captain Elton and the master of the ship, leaving Second Lieutenant Baker Phillips in command. Several more minutes saw 60 men killed or wounded by French fire. Apollon was able to engage the crippled Anglesea from its leeward side, granting the French ship an advantage in manoeuvrability. With Anglesea unable to fight and with the ship taking on water, Phillips ordered the colours struck and surrendered the vessel.  Court-martial  Under the British Articles of War, Phillips was charged with the dishonourable surrendering of a vessel under his command to the enemy. Under Article 10, the military court sentenced Phillips to death for failing to put the ship in order for battle, for failing to encourage the officers and men of the vessel to fight courageously, for failing to do his utmost to command the vessel after the death of his superior officer, and for yielding his ship to an enemy. The court recommend that Philips should be treated mercifully on account of his youth and inexperience, writing: > ... was unanimously of opinion that Captain Elton, deceased, did not give > timely directions for getting his ship clear or in a proper posture of > defence, nor did be afterwards behave like an officer or a seaman, which was > the cause of the ship being left to Lieutenant Phillips in such distress and > confusion. And that Lieutenant Baker Phillips, late second lieutenant of the > said ship, by not endeavouring to the utmost of his power after Captain > Elton's death to put the ship in order of fighting, not encouraging the > inferior officers and common men to fight courageously, and by yielding to > the enemy, falls under part of the tenth article. They do sentence him to > death, to be shot by a platoon of musqueteers on the forecastle, ... but ... > having regard to the distress and confusion the ship was in when he came to > the command, and being a young man and unexperienced, they beg leave to > recommend him for mercy. An appeal against the sentence of death was refused, and Phillips was executed by firing squad on the forecastle of HMS Princess Royal at 11 am on 19 July 1745. The execution of Lieutenant Phillips was controversial. Many in Parliament believed that a captain or other high-ranking officer caught in his position would not have been executed. The incident led to the Articles of War being amended to ensure one law for all, with that law recommending the death penalty for any officer of any rank who did not do his utmost against the enemy in battle or pursuit.Hannay, David (1911). \\"Byng, John\\". In Chisholm, Hugh. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 4 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press The consensus within the Royal Navy was not that Phillips should have been spared execution, but rather that any commander, including high-ranking officers, should be executed if they surrendered or showed incompetence. Parliament on the other hand believed that Phillips was used as a scapegoat to cover the failures of a higher-ranking Royal Navy officer. The new laws enacted in the aftermath of Phillips' execution were cited as being the cause of the execution of British admiral John Byng in 1757.Laughton, John Knox (1887). Studies in Naval History.

Having grown up in Mumbai and living in Bengaluru, Parthasarathy is known for creating the webcomic Royal Existentials and writing for the webcomic Urbanlore. Parthasarathy became part of feminist art collective Kadak in March 2016, where she has collaborated to create Personal (Cyber) Space and Aloe Vera and The Void. Early life Having grown up in Mumbai, Aarthi Parthasarathy graduated in communication design at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bengaluru and went on to become a writer and filmmaker. As a child, Parthasarathy read comics such as Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha, the Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, and Calvin & Hobbes. Career Parthasarthy has described her aim when creating webcomics as being to \\"bring out historical and contemporary angst using vintage art.\\" She contrasts the historical imagery she uses with social or philosophical dialogue on contemporary issues. Parthasarthy finds herself unwilling to merchandise her work, and therefore does not sell any prints of her webcomics. =Royal Existentials= Inspired by David Malki's Wondermark, Parthasarathy started the webcomic Royal Existentials in November 2014. By overlaying Mughal miniature paintings with unique dialogue, Parthasarathy used this webcomic to comment upon various social and political events. She described her webcomic as a sort of \\"diary of thoughts\\", as she uses it to describe how she feels about whatever is keeping her mind occupied at the moment. =Urbanlore= In 2015, Parthasarathy started to collaborate with her friend Kaveri Gopalakrishnan in order to create Urbanlore, which captures the life in urban Indian cities, such as Bengaluru, by focusing on the history and culture of the people who live there. The two form a writer-artist duo in order to create Urbanlore, Parthasarathy writing the prose of the webcomic while Gopalakrishnan does the black-and-white drawings. The two also started an extension for the series, titled Urbanshorts, which comments on India's political affairs. Kadak Together with eight other South-Asian artists, Parthasarathy became part of online feminist art collective Kadak in March 2016. Describing the representation of female characters in older comics, such as Archie, as \\"problematic\\", Parthasarathy notes that there has been a cultural shift in how female characters are presented in comics. Animator and journalist Aindri Chakraborty found that an art collective made up entirely out of women of color could address the lack of diversity at Comic Cons and art festivals. Kadak creates gender-related pieces to present both online, on the website Medium, and in the physical world, through a kind of traveling library dubbed the \\"Reading Room\\". As part of Kadak, Parthasarathy collaborated with various other cartoonists to create short-form webcomics. In August 2016, she collaborated with Mira Malhotra to write Personal (Cyber) Space, a short webcomic that features a woman scrolling through her online news feed, coming across headlines about sexism, rape, as well as stories about a possible female president and women at the Olympics. The webcomic further comments upon the daily cycle of such news stories and how mass opinions have been turned into statistics. In September that same year, Parthasarathy collaborated with Renuka Rajiv to write Aloe Vera and The Void, which is presented as series of conversations about belief, God, and social exclusion. To write Aloe Vera and The Void, Parthasarathy held multiple interviews with people from the Indian transgender community, which she worked into its script. In an interview, Parthasarathy stated that she was curious how someone's belief systems are impacted when they are excluded from many social norms and customs.

The children's album was written with multiple members of her immediate family, and was released through Amazon Prime on September 30, 2016. Videos for each song have been released via Amazon Video, with the animated music video for \\"Dream Too Much\\" being inspired by her two- year-old son, Jack Lion Hartzler.  Background  Lee revealed that she had initially thought that she would not have enough time to work on music as a mother, but noticed that motherhood gave her \\"a showering of inspiration and fuel\\". Thus, Lee revealed that except for the everyday errands, she still had time to be creative and record music for Dream Too Much. Lee said the album was going to feature only four or five songs as a sixtieth birthday present for her father, John Lee. However, her manager was approached by Amazon to do a full children's album, and she accepted it. Aside from the original songs written for the album, Lee also covered Ben King's \\"Stand By Me\\" (1961) and \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" (1967) by The Beatles.

He took his PhD at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1989, called to full Professor 1997 and has since 2005 been Professor of Mathematics.  Research  The work of Munthe-Kaas is centred on applications of differential geometry and Lie group techniques in geometric integration and structure preserving algorithms for numerical integration of differential equations. A central aspect is the analysis of structure preservation by algebraic and combinatorial techniques (B-series and Lie‚ÄìButcher series). In the mid-1990s Munthe-Kaas developed what are now known as Runge‚ÄìKutta‚ÄìMunthe-Kaas methods, a generalisation of Runge‚ÄìKutta methods to integration of differential equations evolving on Lie groups. The analysis of numerical Lie group integrators leads to the study of new types of formal power series for flows on manifolds (Lie‚ÄìButcher series). Lie‚ÄìButcher theory combines classical B-series with Lie- series. Algebraically, B-series are based on pre-Lie algebras, whereas the generalised Lie‚ÄìButcher series are based on the concept of post-Lie algebras. Applications in numerical integration on manifolds has led to fundamental research in the structure of post-Lie algebras and their relations to differential geometry, with ramifications in many different areas of applications.  Honors and awards  Munthe-Kaas received Exxon Mobil Award for best PhD at NTNU, 1989, and the Carl-Erik Fr≈çberg Prize in Numerical Mathematics 1996 for the paper \\"Lie‚ÄìButcher theory for Runge‚ÄìKutta Methods\\". Munthe-Kaas is elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences. Munthe-Kaas is the chair of the international Abel prize committee (2018-2022), he is President of the Scientific Council of Centre International de Math√©matiques Pures et Appliqu√©es (CIMPA) (2017‚Äìpresent) and he is Editor-in-Chief of Journal Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2017‚Äìpresent). Munthe-Kaas was secretary of Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2005‚Äì2011) and member of the Board of the Abel Prize in Mathematics (2010‚Äì2018).

It is endemic to southern Western Ghats in India. The species is named monticola (mountain dweller) considering the natural habitat where the species was discovered. The genus Protosticta has fifteen species reported from India, of which twelve are known from Western Ghats. This species was first found in 2014 in high altitudes (above 1600m) of the Anaimalai Hills of Idukki district, Kerala, southern Western Ghats. The study found the presence of this species in highland shola forest ecosystems of Kambilipparachola and Nagamalachola of Marayur forest division and Mathikettan Shola National Park. The males were found away from the forest streams, in shaded areas among the shola forest undergrowth at Kambilipparachola. A few females and males were also found frequenting the sides of streams covered with forest canopy near Nagamalachola in Marayur forests. A few female specimens were found in a forest stream inside the shola forest. Other species observed with them were Euphaea cardinalis and Esme cyaneovittata. This is the only species found within the high altitude shola forests of the southern Western Ghats. This is one of the small-sized Protosticta like Protosticta hearseyi. This species can be distinguished from other Protosticta species based on the completely black dorsal surface of its abdomen, 7th and 8th abdominal segments without yellow or blue color dorsally, and its distinct anal appendages.

Dees sought permission to use the lyrics, but was refused; subsequently, he used 38 bars of the song under the fair use doctrine. In 1986, composers Marvin Fisher and Jack Segal sued Dees for copyright violation and defamation in U.S. District Court for Los Angeles. At the request of the parties involved, the district court issued a summary judgment, finding for Dees.http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1980-1989/Pages/fisherdees.html Fisher appealed the case to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th District, in Pasadena, California.

The street runs west-to-east from the Battery Park City Esplanade along the Hudson River to Greenwich Street, passing through South End Avenue and West Street on the way. The street has a walkway connection to the Rector Street Bridge which crosses West Street.  History  According to maps drawn by David Valentine, the street did not exist before 1782. By 1789, it was a small extension of Thames Street. In 1797, the first pier on the west side of the island was built. The pier was used as the dock for the ferry between New York and Albany, hence the street leading to the pier was named \\"Albany Street\\". In the early 1850s, it was proposed that the street be extended through the yard next to Trinity Church in order to connect the street to Broadway. The proposition became the center of a heated debate between the Municipal Corporation of New York and the Religious Corporation of Trinity Church. When Battery Park City was built on landfill in the Hudson River in the 1980s, the street was extended west of West Street into the new development. 130 Cedar Street (left) and 90 West Street Buildings The Deutsche Bank Building was located on the north side of the street, but was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Alliance for Downtown New York and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in 2014 redeveloped part of that site into a new public open space, the Albany Street Plaza. Buildings on Albany Street include the 90 West Street (1907), also known as the West Street Building, a New York City designated landmark designed by Cass Gilbert, and 130 Cedar Street, formerly the 12-story Green Exchange Building, designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Guard and completed in 1931.

The Nettleton Hollow Road had been cut through the area, serving travelers between Hartford and Cornwall, where connections to the Albany, New York could be made. The presence of local cross roads presented the opportunity to establish taverns. One, the Rising Sun Tavern at 6 Romford Road, was established in 1748 and enlarged in the early 19th century, while a second (at 20 Nettleton Hollow Road) was established c. 1790.

Everipedia says the blockchain model does not have centralized servers, therefore eliminating the cost of servers. As Everipedia is decentralized via blockchain, Forselius claims that it is not possible for governments to censor Everipedia by its assigned server IP addresses.  Content and users  , the majority of pages on Everipedia were copies of Wikipedia articles. Everipedia reportedly utilized a live Internet bot to monitor Wikipedia for changes, synchronizing such changes but giving preference to local edits on Everipedia. However, as of October 2017, articles were reportedly not updated as regularly as Wikipedia, and , most or all Everipedia articles originating as Wikipedia articles, including those never edited on Everipedia, had not had updated Wikipedia content applied since 2016. Everipedia allows for a larger range of articles than Wikipedia, as the English Wikipedia's notability guidelines are stricter than Everipedia's. Everipedia does not allow censorship on any topic for sourced articles. In March 2016, Everipedia had 200,000 published pages. Everipedia is ranked 29,017 globally (and 8,730 in the United States) for web traffic according to Alexa Internet, . There are communities in Brazil, China, Germany, and India. The company said in 2017 that Everipedia has 17,000 registered editors and 2,000 active editors as well as 3 million monthly users. In 2019, Kazemian said there were 7,000 active editors. Several dozen vandals have been banned from Everipedia. In a 2017 interview with Boing Boing, Kazemian claimed that the Everipedia community normally identifies a vandal in 5 minutes. The company has a group of editors who review the activity on the site and delete content that they consider suspicious. The site frequently focuses on trending topics, with the few articles created by users of the site mostly being about sensational topics such as YouTubers, memes, activists, white supremacists, and police shooting victims. The site has been criticized for initially presenting false information in wiki pages on breaking news topics. The incidents were identifying the wrong people in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and the United Express Flight 3411 incident. Jeff John Roberts of The Outline raised concerns about the privacy ramifications of Everipedia, which developed many of its articles by gathering content from social media, creating publicly visible entries on non-notable individuals.

A youth product of NEC, S√ºrmeli experienced his breakthrough as part of the Achilles '29 team competing in the second-tier Eerste Divisie. He later played for clubs in Turkey and Belgium. Club career =Early years= Starting his career as a youth player at SV Hatert and Quick 1888, S√ºrmeli moved the youth academy of NEC in 2008. After failing to make the cut, he moved to NEC's amateur branch. A few months later, he signed a contract, which made him a regular part of NEC Amateurs. =Achilles '29= On 18 June 2013, S√ºrmeli joined Eerste Divisie club Achilles '29 in June 2013, and made his professional debut on 24 August 2013 in a game against Almere City FC in the absence of team captain Twan Smits who was serving a suspension. More than a month later, he appeared in an away game against FC Den Bosch (0‚Äì2 win) in the final minutes coming on for Levi Raja Boean. A week later he came in as a substitute for Kay Thomassen and scored the equaliser against Jong PSV with a strike from distance. The match was eventually won 3‚Äì2. Two weeks later, against Willem II, he replaced Smits again, this time because he suffered hamstring injury. S√ºrmeli also started as a defensive midfielder against Fortuna Sittard and in a KNVB Cup match against AZ. In the winter break, head coach Fran√ßois Gesthuizen decided to a system which facilitated two defensive midfielders instead of one, opening up a spot for S√ºrmeli in the starting eleven. The first league match of 2014 featured S√ºrmeli and Jop van Steen as central defensive midfielders was won 2‚Äì1 against Almere City. Due to an injury, he missed the upcoming away match against FC Dordrecht (4‚Äì2) and was only used as a substitute at home against FC Emmen (0‚Äì0). After a month without appearances, he made six appearances in a row, where he was used as a substitute in five of them. S√ºrmeli played the last four games of the season as a starter. In the first ten matches of the following season, S√ºrmeli was a starter eight times and a used substitute once. On 28 September 2014, he scored two goals in the 0‚Äì4 away win at RKC Waalwijk and played the full 90 minutes: he scored the 0‚Äì1 and the 0‚Äì3 goals. Against MVV, he lost his starting spot due to an injury and he was benched for the next eight matches, although he came in as a substitute in seven of them. One of these matches, on 12 December, in the home game against VVV-Venlo (3‚Äì0), he scored the last goal as a substitute. After the winter break, he began as a starter on right midfield. On 2 March 2015, S√ºrmeli scored his fifth goal for Achilles, and his fourth of the season, in a match against Telstar with a long distance strike. Two and a half weeks later, he headed in the 2‚Äì1 lead against Almere City from a cross by Twan Smits, in a match that ended 3‚Äì1. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, he suffered relegation from the Eerste Divisie with Achilles '29, after which he left as a free agent. After turning down offers from Italian Serie B club Carpi, and Turkish clubs Adanaspor and Adana Demirspor, he decided to stay with Achilles '29 in August. =Adanaspor and Lienden= In early January 2018, S√ºrmeli triggered a release clause to leave Achilles '29 in the winter break, after the club had filed for bankruptcy, and join Turkish TFF First League club Adanaspor. After making no appearances for the side he had his contract terminated at the end of the month, and he joined Dutch Tweede Divisie club FC Lienden on 31 January. =Giresunspor and Winkel Sport= From the 2018‚Äì19 season, S√ºrmeli had an agreement to join De Treffers. At the end of July 2018, he left De Treffers before the start of the competition and signed a two-year contract with Giresunspor of the TFF First League. At the beginning of January 2019, he had his contract terminated as he had not received his salary. Afterwards, he had a deal with Osmanlƒ±spor, but due to an injury the club refused to formalise the agreement and S√ºrmeli was leaved as a free agent. On 12 July 2019, S√ºrmeli joined Winkel Sport, a team competing in the third-tier Belgian First Amateur Division. =Dordrecht= On 20 August 2020, S√ºrmeli returned to the Netherlands where he signed a one-year contract with FC Dordrecht.

Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1951), vol. ii, part iii, p. 154. he trained in astronomy under John Couch Adams at a local observatory. In 1866, he was invited to oversee the construction of the Great Melbourne Telescope at the Grubb factory in Dublin. Le Sueur wrote that he felt he had little \\"special knowledge\\" in the field of astronomy, but would endeavour to prove himself capable to his clients. In the meantime, he was coached in celestial photography by Warren de la Rue and immersed himself in the intricacies of building the telescope.R. Gillespie, The Great Melbourne Telescope (Victoria Museums Publishing, ebook, 2011). In 1868, he supervised its transportation to and erection in Melbourne; despite being a talented astronomer, drawer and photographer, he clashed with Robert Ellery, the telescope's director, and returned home in 1870.

Background  = Definition = Net metering refers to the interconnection of a renewable energy system to the power grid. It allows consumers who have their own renewable generation power systems to connect to the power grid with an electric meter that spins both forwards and backwards, depending on whether the consumer is adding energy to the grid or using energy from the grid. At the end of the month, the customer‚Äôs bill is based on the net amount of power that is drawn from the grid, minus the credits for excess power put into the grid. In New Mexico, customers who have systems that produce up to 80 MW of electricity are able to sign up for net metering. This is the highest power rating eligible for net metering in the United States. The three main utilities in New Mexico are PNM, Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric. = Benefits of net metering = One benefit of net metering is that power is never wasted. When someone uses an isolated system that uses batteries that become fully charged while the system is still generating power, that excess power is wasted. Customer-generators, businesses and industrial operations can qualify for net metering. Customer-generators have the added benefit of selling renewable energy credits (REC) back to their utility. (A customer- generator is a small producer‚Äîthat is not an electric utility‚Äîof electricity which is net metered and connected to the electric grid. An example would be a homeowner who puts solar panels on his rooftop.http://www.puc.state.pa.us/general/consumer_ed/pdf/Home_Alt_Energy_FS.pdf) = Utility-scale solar vs. residential solar = A utility-scale solar facility is a large facility that generates solar power and moves that power into the electric grid. Almost every utility-scale solar facility has what is known as a power purchase agreement with the utility. The agreement guarantees a market for the utility-scale solar facility‚Äôs energy for a fixed term of time. (Residential solar systems are not considered utility-scale). The size of a utility-scale facility can vary. For example, some utility-scale facilities provide only enough power per megawatt to power a few hundred average homes. Others offer a lot more energy. Factors that play into this are location, the type of technology used, and the availability of sunlight. For example, although not located in New Mexico, Recurrent Energies‚Äô ‚ÄúSunset Reservoir‚Äù project in San Francisco produces 5 megawatts of solar energy. It is built on top of enclosed reservoir in the middle of San Francisco. It is considered a utility-scale solar facility.  How it works  = Net excess generation = For customers with solar systems that can generate 10 kilowatts or less, the utility company has a choice in how they compensate that customer for net excess generation. The utility can give the customer a credit on their next bill equal to the utility‚Äôs energy rate (the costs that the utility pays for its own electricity), or crediting the customer for the kilowatt hours of electricity that they have supplied back to utility through the grid. = Technical = In New Mexico, a few technical requirements exist in order for a net metering system to be connected to the grid. First, the net metering system should have a visible means of disconnection allowing the utility to disconnect to system from the grid. Second, a net meter is required and should cost no more than $20. Third, there needs to be an inverter that disconnects when the grid goes down. The system capacity limit is 80 megawatts. = Eligibility = In New Mexico the types of renewable technologies eligible for net metering are the following: * Combined Heat & Power * Fuel cells using Non-Renewable Fuels * Fuel cells using Renewable Fuels * Geothermal Electric * Hydroelectric * Hydroelectric (Small) * Landfill gas * Microturbines * Municipal solid waste * Solar photovoltaics * Solar thermal electric * Wind (All), Biomass * Wind (Small) Sectors that can use net metering include commercial, industrial, local government, nonprofits, residential homes, schools, state and federal government, agricultural, and institutional. The types of utilities that can participate in net metering are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. Utilities that can participate are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. When a customer leaves the utility, the utility must pay the customer for any unused credits. = Availability and jurisdiction = According to DSIRE, ‚ÄúNet metering is available to all \\"qualifying facilities\\" (QFs), as defined by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), which pertains to renewable energy systems and combined heat and power systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) in capacity. There is no statewide cap on the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems.‚Äù Additionally, all utilities that are subject regulation under the Public Regulation Commission‚Äôs (PRC) jurisdiction must offer net metering. Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PRC, are exempt.  Solar in New Mexico  = Growth = In New Mexico, the decrease in prices for solar systems is driving the market for it. Many homeowners and commercial companies are purchasing solar systems to help offset the increase in electric utility bills. More financing options are available today in New Mexico, more solar companies are competing, and this is leading to an increase in market penetration. The growth is predicted at 20% per year. As of early 2016, the market in the United States for solar systems had reached 1 million solar installations. This is equivalent to generating enough electricity to power 5.4 million homes, according to the national Solar Energy Industry Association. According to the Albuquerque Journal, ‚ÄúNew Mexico ranks 8th in the nation today in terms of installed solar capacity per capita.‚Äù It is estimated that the solar market in New Mexico has only experienced approximately 10% of market penetration. = Solar capacity and statistics = According to the Albuquerque Journal, ‚ÄúAs of year-end 2015, New Mexico had about 400 megawatts of installed capacity. That includes 85 MW of residential and commercial systems, and 316 MW of utility-scale generation scattered throughout the service territories of New Mexico‚Äôs public utilities and electric cooperatives.‚Äù For all the installed solar capacity in the New Mexico, the Public Service Company of New Mexico accounts for around 41% of that. Their facilities include fifteen different projects with a total of 107 MW of capacity, which according to the company, provides enough power 140,000 average homes. New Mexico requires public utilities to get 15% of their electric generation from renewable sources. That number will increase to 20% by the year 2020. Within the state, sixty different contracting and installation companies operate. These firms include national companies like SolarCity and ZingSolar.  Consumer incentives  = State tax credit = Up until the end of 2016, New Mexico offered a 10% state tax credit for solar installations. The tax credit began in 2008. Solar companies operating in New Mexico say they are okay to absorb the loss of the state tax credit, meaning that they don't believe it will affect their business. However, in addition to the loss of the tax credit, renewable energy payments from utilities to customers is also declining. = Federal tax credit = In addition to the state tax credit, which is over, the U.S. government gives a 30 percent tax credit for solar installations. In December 2015, Congress extended the program through the end of 2019. = Payments from utilities = PNM and El Paso Electric Co. in southern New Mexico paid customers for each kilowatt hour of electricity they produced from their solar systems. These payments help customers and businesses offset the costs of installing their solar systems. In addition to the payments, those companies offer net metering. Under net metering, people with solar systems can sell their excess electricity back to the utility company at a price equal to what the utility pays for its own electricity. Note that net metering is a separate system of payments from the renewable payments that utilities offer back to customers. For example, 7,100 customers have signed up for the renewable payments from the utility PNM. In 2014, that number was only 4,400 customers. Payments from utilities back to customers decreased from $.13 per kilowatt hour in 2009 to $.025 by the end of 2015. As of the middle of 2016, PNM stopped accepting new applications because the number of people seeking the credits was more than the money available in the program. According to DSIRE, a program operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, ‚ÄúIf a customer has NEG [net energy generation] totaling less than $50 during a monthly billing period, the excess is carried over to the customer‚Äôs next monthly bill. If NEG exceeds $50 during a monthly billing period, the utility will pay the customer the following month for the excess. ‚ÄúThe energy rate to be paid for the energy supplied by the QF [qualifying facility] in any month shall be the respective month's rate from the utility's current schedule on file with the PRC. Each utility shall file with the PRC its schedule containing monthly energy rates that will be applicable to the next twelve-month period.‚Äù  Price of solar installation  According to a study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, prices for the installation of residential and utility-scale solar generation plants went down by more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2014. In 2015, prices fell another 17 percent. As of 2017, an average New Mexico residential system producing 4.4 kilowatts costs approximately $17,000 before tax credits and other incentives. After credits and incentives, the system would cost approximately $11,900. In 2009, that same system had cost $30,000. If a consumer chose to finance the system, they could pay around $99 a month.  Regulatory rules  In New Mexico there are two primary rules that govern the interconnection of a solar system to the utility grid: * NMPRC Rule 570 (general interconnection of qualifying facilities‚Äîlarger solar-producing facilities) * NMPRC Rule 571 (net metering for small renewable energy systems) According to the New Mexico Solar Energy Association, ‚ÄúThese rules apply wherever electricity service is regulated by the PRC. This includes the areas serviced by New Mexico's four investor owned utilities (IOUs) (which encompasses Santa Fe and Albuquerque for example), and the areas services by electric coops. It does not include municipal utilities (such as Los Alamos and Farmington), which are self- regulated.‚Äù Additionally, ‚ÄúIf the net-metered facility uses more power than it produces over a billing period, the utility may bill the customer for the net power used according to the rate structure that would apply to the customer if they had not connected as a net-metering facility.‚Äù  Future of net metering in New Mexico  The solar industry in New Mexico is facing hurdles. Most utilities want to reduce incentives like net metering and charge customers more who have solar systems. The reason they want to do this is because the utilities maintain that their role in generating plants, transmitting and distributing electricity through distribution lines, and other fixed costs remain unchanged. They argue that solar customers are not financially contributing to those fixed costs.

The confrontation was between an ill- planned English punitive expedition led by Major-General Sir George Cathcart and the native forces of the Sotho chief Moshoeshoe and resulted in the English forces being repulsed. Prelude Moshoeshoe I Following the defeat of an ill-armed and inadequate punitive force at Viervoet the previous year by the Sotho tribe of Basutoland under their leader Moshoeshoe, the British Major-General Cathcart gathered together at Platberg in the Free State an overpowering force of over 2,000 men. The force consisted of infantry detachments of the 2nd (The Queen's Royal) Regiment of Foot, the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot, the 73rd (Highland) Regiment of Foot Regiment, the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade supported by cavalry and artillery. Believing that such a force would totally overawe the Sotho tribe, Cathcart demanded reprisals of 10,000 cattle and 1000 horses within 3 days, threatening to march into Moshoeshoe's heartland and collect any unpaid debt by force. Only 3000 cattle were delivered in the time allowed and Cathcart therefore organised the threatened invasion. He opted to take only half his available strength, about 1000 men, leaving behind the 2nd Foot, most of the 74th Foot, some of his cavalry and his smaller artillery. No spare ammunition for the infantry would be taken. Invasion Major-Gen. Sir George Cathcart Moshoeshoe had established his headquarters on the steep-sided Berea plateau at Thaba Bosiu in the Phuthiatsana valley. Cathcart's tactics were to advance on Thaba Bosiu in three widely separated columns and link up at midday in front of the stronghold. Any available cattle were to be rounded up and driven back to base. The left column of 233 cavalry under Lieutenant-Colonel G.T.C. Napier of the Cape Mounted Rifles, made up of elements of the 12th Royal Lancers and the Cape Mounted Rifles, were to circumnavigate the Berea plateau to the east. The main column under Sir William Eyre were to cross the reamohetse sello‚Ä≤s plateau and the right column under Cathcart would skirt the plateau to the west. In the event Napier's column, accompanied by captured cattle, were ambushed and forced to return to base. Eyre's column was also so engrossed in rounding up cattle that they were hours late arriving at the rendezvous, having also been harried by Moshoeshoe's cavalry. Cathcart's column arrived safely at Thaba Bosiu to find themselves surrounded at a safe distance by thousands of Sotho mounted cavalry. He was later joined by Eyre's troops and retreated to a safe place to make camp for the night. The following day they made their way back to the border. Aftermath Cathcart had lost the use of his cavalry, had a significant number of men killed and had limited ammunition. He could not have been sure of defeating the enemy. Moshoeshoe had lost some 5000 cattle but would have realised that had he attacked in numbers and defeated the British force he would inevitably have been subsequently overpowered by a larger one. However Moshoeshoe was also under threat from other tribes and from Boer encroachment and decided to sue for peace with the British, ultimately requesting the protection of the British Crown.

He was a prolific author on a range of Biblical topics and church history. Campbell died in January 2017, and it subsequently emerged that he killed himself amid allegations of multiple extra-marital affairs. Biography Iain Donald Campbell was born on 20 September 1963 on the Isle of Lewis to John Norman Campbell and his wife Lily Maciver (n√©e Mackenzie). Campbell had two sisters, Margaret and Alma.https://freechurch.org/news/funeral-arrangements-and- obituary-for-rev-dr-iain-d-campbell Campbell attended the Nicolson Institute, a school on Lewis, before studying at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with First Class Honours in Arts in 1985. He then pursued theological studies at the Free Church College and the University of London, again graduating with First Class Honours as a Bachelor of Divinity. He studied for a PhD at the University of Edinburgh and was awarded his doctorate in 2001. A version of his thesis, on George Adam Smith, was subsequently published in book form. Campbell married Anne Macsween Davidson, born in 1962 and also from the Isle of Lewis, in 1984 in Stornoway. They had three children together: Iain, Stephen, and Emily. His first pastoral position was at Snizort Free Church on Skye, which he commenced in 1988. In 1995, he moved to the Free Church at Back on the Isle of Lewis. Finally, in 2009, he became minister of Point Free Church, also on Lewis. In 2012, he served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. Campbell wrote about 17 books on topics related to Christianity, including Bible studies and doctrinal teaching, mostly published through Christian Focus Publications and Day One Publications. He also contributed to Tabletalk magazine published by Ligonier Ministries. At the time of his death, in addition to his ministerial role, he was vice-chairman of the board of Edinburgh Theological Seminary, editor of The Record, the monthly magazine of the Free Church of Scotland, and an associate editor of Foundations, a theological journal published by Affinity. He was also an Adjunct Professor of Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary, helping to deliver their London-based courses. Death Campbell died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 53, by suicide. An early obituary, written by long-standing Free Church minister Donald Macleod, and published two days after Campbell's death, suggested Campbell was experiencing pain which may have affected the balance of his mind, but did not elaborate further. An early report stated that Campbell's wife, Anne, had discovered emails on his computer and accused him of having several extra-marital affairs with members of his congregation. Two later stories in the Sunday Times, on 12 March 2017, presented a slightly different version of events. They stated that the initial reports were not correct and that Campbell had confessed his infidelity to his wife before taking his own life. She then found the emails on Campbell's computer.

Mitchell (1977) uses \\"Solanki style\\", while Harle is reluctant to tie the style to a specific name. is a style of north Indian temple architecture that originated in Gujarat and Rajasthan from the 11th to 13th centuries, under the Chaulukya dynasty (or Sola·πÖkƒ´ dynasty).Mitchell (1977), 123; Hegewald Although originating as a regional style in Hindu temple architecture, it became especially popular in Jain temples and, mainly under Jain patronage, later spread across India and to diaspora communities around the world.Hegewald On the exteriors, the style is distinguished from other north Indian temple styles of the period in \\"that the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of moldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and kƒ´rttimukhas. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.\\" The main shikhara tower usually has many urushringa subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples.Hegewald Mandapa ceiling in the Ranakpur Jain Temple Interiors are if anything even more lavishly decorated, with elaborate carving on most surfaces. In particular, Jain temples often have small low domes carved on the inside with a highly intricate rosette design. Another distinctive feature is \\"flying\\" arch-like elements between pillars, touching the horizontal beam above in the centre, and elaborately carved. These have no structural function, and are purely decorative. The style developed large pillared halls, many open at the sides, with Jain temples often having one closed and two pillared halls in sequence on the main axis leading to the shrine.Hegewald; Harle, 219‚Äì220 Devotions in the Swaminarayan temple in Houston, Texas (2004) The style mostly fell from use in Hindu temples in its original regions by the 13th century, especially as the area had fallen to the Muslim Delhi Sultanate by 1298. But, unusually for an Indian temple style, it continued to be used by Jains there and elsewhere, with a notable \\"revival\\" in the 15th century.Harle, 239‚Äì240; Hegewald Since then it has continued in use in Jain and some Hindu temples, and from the 20th century has spread to temples built outside India by the Jain diaspora, such as the Jain temple, Antwerp, Belgium (completed 2010), and temples in Potters Bar and Leicester in England.Hegewald Origin of the name The name of the MƒÅru-Gurjara style is a 20th-century invention; previously, and still by many, it is called the \\"Solanki style\\".Hegewald, note 3 The ancient name of Rajasthan was Marudesh while Gujarat was called Gurjaratra. The term \\"MƒÅru- Gurjara\\" was coined by art and architectural historian Madhusudan Dhaky, who also coined the terms \\"SurƒÅ·π£·π≠ra\\", \\"MahƒÅ-MƒÅru\\", and \\"MahƒÅ-Gurjara\\" to describe other historical styles of Western Indian architecture. The MƒÅru-Gurjara style is a synthesis of the MahƒÅ-MƒÅru style of Marwar region in Rajasthan and the MahƒÅ-Gurjara style of Gujarat. However, Hegewald suggests \\"This change in terminology appears to have been suggested first by A. Ghosh during a symposium in Delhi in 1967\\".Hegewald, note 3, citing \\"Pramod Chandra \\"The Study of Indian Tempe Architecture\\", in Studies in Indian Temple Architecture, ed. Pramod Chandra (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1975), 36\\" She notes that the change was an \\"attempt to avoid dynastic terms\\", and that both \\"MƒÅru-Gurjara\\" and \\"Maru-Gurjara\\" are used by different writers, and that the Jain community mostly continues to call the style \\"Solanki\\".Hegewald, note 3 Development Bands of relief on the base wall of the Jagdish Temple, Udaipur, built by Maharana Jagat Singh I in 1651 The style developed from that of the dynasties preceding the Solankis, mainly the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, and the local dynasties under it. The most famous monuments of this period are the Khajuraho Group of Monuments built under the Chandela dynasty between 950 and 1050. These are famous for their erotic reliefs. Many of the broad features of this earlier style are continued in the MƒÅru-Gurjara style. The beginnings of the new style can be seen in the small Ambika Mata temple in Jagat, Rajasthan. The earliest inscription here records a repair in 961 (well before the Solankis came to power).Harle, 220‚Äì221; Mitchell (1990), 288 For George Mitchell, in the Jagat temple (and others he names) \\"the Pratihara style was fully evolved in its Western Indian expression\\".Mitchell (1990), 263 =Early Hindu temples= The Somnath temple, dedicated to Shiva, was the most famous in Gujarat, but was very largely destroyed by the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud in a raid in 1024‚Äì1025 CE. It was then rebuilt, but sacked again when the Delhi Sultanate conquered the area at the end of the 13th century.Rowland, 293‚Äì294 The ruins have recently been restored and rebuilt in what is intended as the Solanki style. The Sun Temple, Modhera, Gujarat, was built in 1026‚Äì27 CE, just after Mahmud's raid. The shikhara is now missing, but the lower levels are well-preserved, and there is a large stepwell tank of the same period in front of the temple. There is a large detached mandapa between the main sanctuary building and the tank, which is slightly later. The carving of all parts is \\"extremely luxuriant and exquisitely refined in the rendering of detail\\".Rowland, 294‚Äì296, 296 quoted; Michell (1990), 299‚Äì300; Harle, 223‚Äì227 The Rudra Mahalaya Temple was a large complex in Siddhpur Gujarat, mostly destroyed under Muslim rule. The main temple was surrounded by a screen of subsidiary shrines (partly surviving as a mosque), and the porches, parts of which remain, and a stand-alone torana were exceptionally grand. The mandapa had three storeys. It was completed in 1140, ending a long period of construction.Michell (1990), 300; Harle, 227‚Äì228 Two groups of smaller ruined temples of similar date are the two Rama Lakshamana temples, Baradia and the five Kiradu temples; both have their lowest storeys fairly intact, and some of the Kiradu group retain part of their shikharas.Michell (1990), 295‚Äì296 (Kiradu, which he sees as mostly \\"late Pratihara\\"; Harle, 223‚Äì227 The famous Rani ki vav (\\"Queen's Stepwell\\", probably 1063‚Äì83) is a very grand stepwell in Patan, Gujarat, once the Solanki capital. With a very different architectural form and function, \\"throughout, the ornamentation of the architectural elements is sumptuous\\" in the contemporary temple style, including very many Hindu figures. Another non-temple is the 80 foot Kirti Stambha tower in Chittor Fort, Rajasthan, built for a Jain merchant, mostly in the early 13th century, with the pavilion at the top a 15th-century restoration.Michell (1990), 283; Harle, 227‚Äì228 File:Jagat 22-76 (cropped).jpgAmbika Mata temple in Jagat, Rajasthan, by 960 File:Ambika-Tempel (Jagat)3.jpgDurga on the Jagat temple File:Sun Temple, Modhera Gudhamandapa with annotation of exterior mouldings.jpgWall below the shikhara, Sun Temple, Modhera, 1020s File:‡™∞‡´Ç‡™¶‡´ç‡™∞‡™Æ‡™π‡™≤.jpgOutside face of screen shrines at Rudra Mahalaya Temple, by 1140 File:The Kiradu Temples in perspective (cropped).jpgKiradu temples File:Rani ki vav1.jpgRani ki vav, Patan, Gujarat, 11th century =Early Jain temples= Detail of the Jain Kirti Stambha tower, Chittor Fort Ajitanatha Temple, Taranga Jain temples, 1161 Bhadreshwar Jain Temple, 1248, rebuilt 2010 The five Dilwara Temples on Mount Abu are among the most famous Jain temples. The Vimal Vasahi is much the earliest, constructed by 1031, with the Luna Vasahi by 1230, and the others at intervals between 1459 and 1582. All are in a very white marble that adds greatly to their effect, and remain in use. The oldest and largest two have large amounts of intricate carving even by the standards of the style, reaching a peak in the Luna Vasahi temple. The main buildings of the first three named are surrounded by \\"cloister\\" screens of devakulikƒÅ shrines, and are fairly plain on the outer walls of these; in the case of the Vimal Vasahi this screen was a later addition, around the time of the second temple. These three have an axis from the sanctuary through a closed, then an open mandapa to an open rangamandapa, or larger hall for dance or drama.Michell (1990), 274‚Äì276; Harle, 226‚Äì227 Surrounding the main temple with a curtain of shrines was to become a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples.Harle, 228 The Ajitanatha Temple, the largest and earliest of the cluster of Taranga Jain temples, was constructed in 1161, and is a fine example of the style, which remains largely intact, and in religious use. The shikhara and the much lower superstructure over the mandapa are both among the \\"most complicated\\" in the style. The former begins with three rows of bhumija-style miniature towers in clusters, before turning to the sekhari style higher up, where the miniature towers are of varying lengths, and overlap. Over the mandapa, the lowest level continues the regular miniature tower clusters over the sanctuary, above which shallow pitched planes of roof are studded with miniature towers, with rows of beasts and urns along the edges of the planes. The surfaces are heavily decorated with figures and \\"honeycomb\\" gavaksha decoration, the figures \\"characterized by lively poses and sharply cut faces and costumes\\".Michell (1990), 310‚Äì311, 311 quoted The Ajitanatha Temple was built under, and very probably by, King Kumarapala (r. 1143 ‚Äì 1172 CE) of the Solanki/Chaulukya dynasty, who was the most favourable towards Jains of the dynasty. According to Jain sources he converted to Jainism towards the end of his life; at the least he was influenced by the religion. His reign marked the height of Jain power and influence; his son Ajayapala, something of a villain in Jain chronicles, was much less favourable, although there continued to be Jain ministers.Hegewald Kumbharia Jain temples is a complex of five Jain temples in Kumbhariya, Banaskantha district built between 1062 - 1231 CE. The five temples are famous for their elaborate architecture. The Jain temples, Kumbhariya along with Dilwara temples, Girnar Jain temples and Taranga Jain temple are considered excellent examples of Chaulukyan architecture. Mahavira, Shantinatha, and Parshvanatha temples are some of the most renowned temples in India. These five marble temples vary in size and architecture details, but every temple is surrounded by a protective walled courtyard with elaborate arched gateways. The Bhadreshwar Jain Temple, mostly constructed for a merchant in 1248, just at the end of the Solanki dynasty, is surrounded by the high walls of a curtain of subsidiary shrines, each with a shikhara in sekhari style, except for a much later two-storey porch at the entrance, which has elements from Indo-Islamic architecture in the domes and arches. The main temple, in a courtyard considerably above ground level, is comparable to the earlier examples described above.Michell (1990), 280; Hegewald The clustered group of Girnar Jain temples, with a magnificent mountain-top position, are mostly in the style, with the major temples ranging in date (of basic construction) from 1128, 1231, 1453 and another 15th century example.Michell (1990), 294; Hegewald Other temples, like the large example at the Rajgadhi Timbo (\\"mound\\"), have been completely destroyed. =Later temples= Ranakpur Jain temple, 15th century The Solanki dynasty finally fell around 1244, replaced by the Hindu Vaghela dynasty for some decades before the Muslim Delhi Sultanate conquered the region. Temple building then largely ceased in the original areas of the style for a considerable time, although a trickle of repairs and additions to existing temples are recorded, and some small new buildings. However, Solanki rule came to be seen by Jains as something of a \\"golden age\\", and the MƒÅru-Gurjara style evidently became something of a standard for Jains, specifically the ≈övetƒÅmbara wing of the religion. The style began to re-appear in Jain temples in the same area in the 15th century, and then spread elsewhere in India, initially moving eastwards.Hegewald Ranakpur Jain temple, 15th century The Adinatha Ranakpur Jain temple in Rajasthan is a major construction for a merchant, built between 1439 and 1458 or 1496. It is a thorough-going, but not strict, revival of MƒÅru-Gurjara style, on the same broad model as Bhadreshwar, with a high outside wall of the back of shrines, but also a number of Islamic-style corbelled domes. There are four three-storey porches, already up two flights of steps. The interior of the temple is \\"unsurpassed for its spatial complexity\\", with the sanctuary at the centre of the compound surrounded by many mandapas of two or three storeys, with all levels very open between the supporting columns allowing views in several directions inside the compound. Even the shikhara has balconies at three levels. The carving on the interior is in most areas as lavish as ever.Michell (1990), 305‚Äì306; Hegewald The large group of Palitana temples on the Shatrunjaya hills in Gujarat are another very important Jain pilgrimage site, with temples numbering into the hundreds (most very small, and all but one Svetambara). Though many were founded much earlier, the site was so thoroughly destroyed by Muslim armies, starting in 1311, that there is little surviving that dates back before the 16th century. The temples are packed tightly together in a number of high-walled compounds called \\"tuks\\" or \\"tonks\\". Michell calls them \\"characteristic of the final phase of Western Indian temple architecture\\", with traditional shikharas, double storey porches, often on three or four sides, and miniature-urn roofs to the main mandapas. But there are influences from Indo-Islamic architecture in the domes, often fluted, over porches and second mandapas, \\"arches with petalled fringes, parapets of merlons\\", and other features.Michell (1990), 308‚Äì310, 308 quoted The Polo Forest in Gujarat has groups of Hindu and Jain ruined temples of various dates, but mostly 15th century.Michell (1990), 273 The Jagdish Temple, Udaipur (completed 1651) is an example of a Hindu temple using the style at a late date; in this case a commission of Jagat Singh I, ruler of Mewar.Michell (1990), 311; Hegewald File:Jain temples on Girnar mountain aerial view.jpgSeven of the Girnar Jain temples, 12th-15th centuries File:Balabhai Tonk.jpgView across the Palitana temples File:Jagdish mandir 1.jpgThe Hindu Jagdish Temple, Udaipur (completed 1651) 19th century Hutheesing Jain Temple (1848) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat There was a considerable number of new Jain temples in the 19th century, as the Jain community continued to grow and prosper. By now temples were built by wealthy Jains, often individually, or by community trusts. The large Hutheesing Jain Temple (1848) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, was built by the Hutheesing family. It uses the MƒÅru-Gurjara style, with many similarities to Bhadreshwar and Ranakpur. There is a good deal of \\"sharply sculpted\\" decoration, \\"but figures appear only at the brackets\\". There are three sanctuaries in a row, and so three shikharas, but the porch and the outer mandapa each have three domes.Michell (1990), 278 (quoted); Hegewald But the style is not invariably used: the large Ajmer Jain temple (1864‚Äì1895) in Rajasthan uses a kind of Neo-Mughal style. This is a Digambar foundation, and the Digambar wing of Jainism always favoured the MƒÅru-Gurjara style rather less, at least in India itself. The large Anandji Kalyanji Trust, which devotes itself to temple-building and renovation, has played a role in promoting the MƒÅru-Gurjara style, at Palitana in particular.Hegewald 20th century The 20th and 21st centuries, especially from about 1950, have seen increasing Jain diaspora communities in many parts of the world. In India there has been much construction of large temples and complexes, and the smaller diaspora communities have constructed buildings on a somewhat smaller scale. In both cases use of the MƒÅru-Gurjara style is very common, although the thoroughness with which it is adopted varies greatly. Some buildings mix MƒÅru-Gurjara elements with those of local temple styles and modern international ones. Generally, where there is elaborate carving, often still done by craftsmen from Gujarat or Rajasthan, this has more ornamental and decorative work than small figures. A similar mix is seen in many modern Hindu temples in India and abroad, for example those of the Swaminarayan sect, or the Prem Mandir, Vrindavan near Mathura (built 2001-2011). Sometimes the MƒÅru-Gurjara influence is limited to the \\"flying arches\\" and mandapa ceiling rosettes, and a preference for white marble.Hegewald File:Jain Temple, Kakinada.jpgEntrance fronting an essentially modern Jain temple building, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh File:Bonter Jinalaya, Koday - panoramio.jpgThe Bounter Jinalaya (or \\"72 Jinalaya\\") Jain temple at Mandvi, Kutch, Gujarat, begun 1982 File:Templejaindanvers.jpgThe Jain temple, Antwerp, Belgium, completed 2010 File:The Jain Centre on Oxford Street - geograph.org.uk - 1034296.jpgThe Jain Centre, Leicester, England.

Background The MƒÅru-Gurjara style did not represent a radical break with earlier styles. The previous styles in north-west India are mentioned above, and the group of Jain temples of Khajuraho, forming part of the famous Khajuraho Group of Monuments are very largely in the same style as their Hindu companions, which were mostly built between 950 and 1050. They share many features with the MƒÅru-Gurjara style: high plinths with many decorated bands on the walls, lavish figurative and decorative carving, balconies looking out on multiple sides, ceiling rosettes, and others, but at Khajuraho the great height of the shikharas is given more emphasis. There are similarities with the contemporary Hoysala architecture from much further south. In both of these styles architecture is treated sculpturally.The legacy of G.S.

DiBisceglie had been under contract with the professional team from Philadelphia through March 2019.  Career  = Youth = Prior to college, DiBisceglie trained with US Olympic Development men's soccer team at IMG Academy under Jeff Tipping in Bradenton, FL during the summers of 2009-11. Tipping named DiBisceglie team captain in 2011. His selection to represent the Princeton Soccer Association at IMG was made through the USL's Super Y-League as part of the Jersey United soccer club. In the winter and spring of 2009‚Äì10 New York Red Bulls Academy's director Bob Montgomery had DiBisceglie train with the Red Bulls U16 squad under head coach Rob Elliott. During the high school soccer fall seasons, DiBisceglie was a four-year starter in the midfield and a two-year captain for the Gill St Bernard Knights in Gladstone, NJ. He completed his career as the Knight's 8th all-time scorer in the school's history with 101 points (20g/61a) and was All- State, All-Conference, All-Area, All-County, All-Prep and All-Non Public. In back-to-back seasons (2011 & 2012), DiBisceglie was the leader of all Somerset County high school soccer players in assists at any level, Public and Non- Public, male or female. On November 17, 2009, Gill St. Bernard's won their first state team boys championship of any kind in the school's history with a 3‚Äì0 victory over St. Rose HS of Belmar, NJ. As a freshman starter, DiBisceglie scored two points in the title match with assists on the game-winning goal and the final goal. = College = After being recruited by twenty-one college soccer programs, most notably, Holy Cross, Iona and Rutgers University, DiBisceglie chose to attend the University of Scranton, where he was a four- year starter as a defensive center midfielder for the Royals. Scoring eight goals in 73 appearances, while also recording 11 assists, he was named to the NSCAA's All-Landmark Conference First Team in 2015 and was All-Conference again in 2016. On November 7, 2015, the Scranton Royals came from behind to defeat the #6 nationally ranked Elizabethtown Blue Jays 3‚Äì2 for the school's first conference men's soccer championship in 30 years. DiBisceglie assisted on Scranton's initial goal that changed the game in the upset victory. One year later, almost exactly to the day, on November 5, 2016, the Royals once again travelled to Elizabethtown to meet in the Landmark Championship re- match. Like he did in 2015, DiBisceglie found his way onto the score sheet again in 2016 to give Scranton a ‚Äì victory in the title rematch over the Blue Jays. To date, DiBisceglie is the only player in Landmark Conference history to register assists in back-to-back Men's Soccer Championship victories. The 2016 Landmark Championship sent the Royals to the NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament where on November 12, 2016, Scranton defeated Penn St Behrend, 2‚Äì1 to advance to the NCAA tournament's second round. On November 13, 2016, the Royals lost to 13th ranked SUNY Cortland 1‚Äì2 in the Round of 32. Despite playing in just the two tournament matches, DiBisceglie finished the NCAA competition ranked seventh in America amongst all players for most shots per game. = Semi- Professional= While in college, DiBisceglie doubled as a semi-professional central midfielder for the Electric City Shock SC in the National Premier Soccer League playing 21 matches during the Shock's 2015 and 2016 campaigns. On March 14, 2015, DiBisceglie signed a contract with Electric City and opened his account that same evening with a goal against the Trenton Rebels in his first match with the Shock. On May 22, 2016, DiBisceglie scored a goal and had two assists in the come-from-behind 4‚Äì3 overtime victory for Electric City over NPSL powerhouse, Junior Lonestar FC. In that match, his second assist at the 90th minute won the match for Electric City, while his 52nd-minute bending goal around the Lonestar keeper from 24 yards away was recognized as the Shock's 2016 Goal of the Year. At the conclusion of the 2016 season, DiBisceglie finished tied for second on the team in goals scored and second in assists. As a result, he was nominated by Electric City to represent the NPSL's Northeastern Conference at the Los Angeles NPSL combine in January 2017. The nomination was made even though DiBisceglie missed the last three games of the NPSL season due to his transfer from the Shock in July to play professionally for FK V√≠tkovice in the Czech Republic National Football League. = Professional = Europe DiBisceglie's first professional soccer experience occurred in Scotland as a trialist with Kilmarnock FC in the Scottish Premier League in 2011. Arranged by former Welsh footballer and Swansea player, Glan Letheren, the trial became a success when Killie manager, Alan Robertson looked to sign DiBisceglie to a multi-year contract. Unfortunately the American was not able to obtain the required UK work-visa before the start of a Scottish Premier League season. But during the pre- season trial, DiBisceglie did get to play centre back for Kilmarnock, subbing on in the 35th minute of a match at Everton F.C. in England on August 6, 2011. On August 11, 2011 DiBisceglie also anchored Killie's back four for the full 90 minutes in their 2‚Äì0 win over Grange. On August 15, 2011 he travelled with Kilmarnock for a match at Rangers F.C. before having to return to the US. On July 4, 2016, DiBisceglie was offered a two-year professional contract from FK V√≠tkovice of the Czech Republic's National Football League. The team owner's offer was communicated through Glan Letheren and was based on DiBisceglie's CV. The 22-year-old flew to Vitkovice for training the next day. On July 9, 2016, he started and played the full match at centre back in V√≠tkovice's 2‚Äì0 win at Sigma Olomouc. After difficult deliberations with Vitkovice manager (Roman West), DiBisceglie chose not to sign the Vitkovice contract in order to pursue other professional opportunities in the United States. Roman West had become the manager of Vitkovice on July 1, 2016, just four days before DiBisceglie arrived. West was sacked 64 days later by the Vitkovice owners on September 4, 2016. America On March 21, 2017, DiBisceglie signed a two-year professional soccer contract to play center back for the Philadelphia Atoms of the American Soccer League. DiBisceglie debuted on April 9, 2017 when he started and played the full ASL match vs Mass United FC. On June 10, 2017, DiBisceglie was awarded Veritas Man of the Match for his efforts v SGFC Maryland. On September 23, 2017, the Philadelphia Atoms set a team record with six goals in a single match in a 6‚Äì1 win over AFC Lancaster. The old team record was set when the Atoms defeated the Washington Diplomats 5‚Äì1 in the NASL on May 4, 1974. DiBisceglie's opened his professional account with the first professional goal of his career. This goal was also Philadelphia's record-breaking sixth goal in the 63rd minute of the match. Earlier in that same match, he also notched his first professional assist on the Atoms' opening goal in the 5th minute. On October 12, 2017, DiBisceglie was elevated to player/Assistant Coach for Philadelphia by the Atoms' General Manager, Ike Onyeador. On November 4, 2017, Philadelphia concluded their inaugural season in Boston where DiBisceglie set the team record with 1,440 minutes played for the Atoms. Team owner, Matt Driver, suspended operations of the Philadelphia Atoms in late 2018 due to financial difficulties. Driver subsequently folded the ASL in 2019, making DiBisceglie a free-agent.  Personal life  Tim was born in Denville, New Jersey to Bruce & Kathy DiBisceglie. His maternal grandfather, Joseph is of Irish descent, while his paternal grandfather, Domdi is Italian. The rest of his paternal ancestry is Austrian & Costa Rican (aka: \\"Austarican\\") and his remaining maternal ancestry is Swiss, German and French. DiBisceglie was raised in Mine Hill Township, New Jersey with his elder sister Elizabeth. His father, mother and sister are all former soccer players. Tim is also nephew of harness racing driver Carl LeCause and cousin to New York Giants Super Bowl XXI offensive lineman Brad Benson. Off the pitch, DiBisceglie coaches children with special needs and is a certified USSF referee. = Coaching = At the University of Scranton Tim majored in Early and Primary Childhood Education and minored in Coaching. In his off-season, DiBisceglie is a Special Education teacher and varsity soccer and basketball coach at Newmark High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. On March 6, 2018, DiBisceglie was named head coach of the Gill St Bernard's boys JV soccer team and assistant coach for the boys varsity team, reuniting him with NJSIAA Hall of Fame coach, Tony Bednarsky. On November 11, 2018, Gill St Bernard's defeated Rutgers Prep 7‚Äì0 for the New Jersey State Boys Soccer Championship with DiBisceglie on Bednarsky's staff as his assistant coach. DiBisceglie is the first athlete in history to win a NJSIAA state championship for Gill St Bernard's as a player (2009) and a coach (2018, 2019). In 2019, with DiBisceglie as Assistant Coach for Bednarsky, Gill St Bernard began their pre- season in Portugal (3W-1D-1L), and then went on to win five championships titles: NJSIAA States, NJSIAA Sectionals, Somerset County (first in school history), Prep-B, and the Skyland-Raritan regular season Division. The Knights finished the 2019 campaign ranked #5 in all of NJ boys HS soccer with a 20-3 record and the five titles.

This project was cancelled in 2018 due to funding. Description The Framework building was designed by architect Thomas Robinson. The timber material planned for the building was cross laminated timber (CLT) utilizing Pres-Lam rocking walls for lateral resistance. The architecture firm had planned to use CLT from D.R. Johnson Lumber Company from Riddle, Oregon. The building's number of stories had been given both as 12 and as 11. Construction is expected to begin in fall 2017. The mixed-use building would have provided office space on floors two through six, and affordable housing may have been placed on floors seven through eleven. History The project team won a $1.5 million grant from the USDA in September 2015 for participating in the Tall Wood Building Prize Competition. The design phase included extensive fire, structural and acoustic testing. Building assemblies tested during this phase met the requirements of the Oregon Building Codes Division.

In 1717, she married David Tanqueray, her father's apprentice; they had two sons. Her husband established a workshop, and it is likely that Tanqueray created items bearing her husband's mark. Upon her husband's death, after 1724, she took over his business and she entered two marks (Sterling and New Standard) in the register at Goldsmiths' Hall. Her marks appeared alongside her husband's original 1713 mark, with his name being struck through and hers written above, as opposed to a new entry, which was custom for a widow. This appears to be the only instance in which this happened. As a female silversmith in the 18th century, Tanqueray would have had the opportunity to produce her own work and oversee skilled journeymen. Tanqueray's workshop was noted for its high level of excellence and in 1729 it became Subordinate Goldsmith to the King. Tanqueray died in 1733 and was buried in Tingrith on 25 July that year.

Wealth inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean refers to economic discrepancies among people of the region. Wealth inequality remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‚ÄòDeclines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour- saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.‚Äô In addition, the report noted that ‚Äòhighly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so. According to the ECLAC, Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. Inequality is undermining the region's economic potential and the well-being of its population, since it increases poverty and reduces the impact of economic development on poverty reduction.Francisco H. Ferreira, David de Ferranti et al. An example of the policies introduced to combat the poverty and inequality was the import substitution industrialization economic policy. This policy sought to grow national industry and offer protection from foreign competition as a means to reduce external dependencies and improve local economies. \\"Inequality in Latin America:Breaking with History?\\", The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 Children in Latin America are often forced to seek work on the streets when their families can no longer afford to support them, leading to a substantial population of street children in Latin America. According to some estimates, there are 40 million street children in Latin America. Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta systemSee Passing (racial identity) for a discussion of a related phenomenon, although in a later and very different cultural and legal context. instituted in Latin America in colonial times that have been difficult to eradicate since the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest's social mobility, thus making poverty to be transmitted from generation to generation, becoming a vicious cycle. High inequality is rooted in the deepest exclusionary institutions of the Casta system that have been perpetuated ever since colonial times and that have survived different political and economic regimes. Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision making process, and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure.Fracisco H. Ferreira et al. Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits. Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race, ethnicity, rurality and gender. Because inequality in gender and location are near universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in the unequal discriminatory practices in Latin America. These differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing. In 2008, According to UNICEF, Latin America and the Caribbean region had the highest combined income inequality in the world with a measured net Gini coefficient of 48.3, an unweighted average which is considerably higher than the world's Gini coefficient average of 39.7. Gini is the statistical measurement used to measure income distribution across entire nations and their populations and their income inequality. The other regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and high-income nations (30.9). There are quite many different approaches for measuring inequality. In one of the studies by Baten and Fraunholz (2004), the authors chose an anthropometric approach, namely height inequality in order to see if inequality itself is a threat to globalization and whether openness increases the inequality by using the coefficient of height variation. \\"This measure covers not only wage recipients (as some other inequality indices do), but also the self-employed, the unemployed, housewives, children, and other groups who may not be participating in a market economy. In addition, this variable has the advantage to be an outcome indicator, whereas real income is an input to human utility.\\" According to a study by the World Bank,the richest decile of the population of Latin America earnFrancisco H. Ferreira et al. Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?, The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 2004 48% of the total income, while the poorest 10% of the population earn only 1.6% of the income. In contrast, in developed countries, the top decile receives 29% of the total income, while the bottom decile earns 2.5%. The countries with the highest inequality in the region (as measured with the Gini index in the UN Development Report) in 2007 were Haiti (59.5), Colombia (58.5), Bolivia (58.2), Honduras (55.3), Brazil (55.0), and Panama (54.9), while the countries with the lowest inequality in the region were Venezuela (43.4), Uruguay (46.4) and Costa Rica (47.2). Trends on income inequality 1998‚Äì2010 in 7 Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela). Source of the data: World Bank. According to the World Bank, the poorest countries in the region were (as of 2008): Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras. Undernourishment affects 47% of Haitians, 27% of Nicaraguans, 23% of Bolivians and 22% of Hondurans. Many countries in Latin America have responded to high levels of poverty by implementing new, or altering old, social assistance programs such as conditional cash transfers. These include Mexico's , Brazil's Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Familia, Panama's Red de and Chile's Chile Solidario.Barrientos, A. and Claudio Santibanez. (2009). \\"New Forms of Social Assistance and the Evolution of Social Protection in Latin America\\". Journal of Latin American Studies. Cambridge University Press 41, 1‚Äì26. In general, these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children's human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by explicitly targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments.Benedicte de la Bri√®re and Laura B. Rawlings, \\"Examining Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: A Role for Increased Social Inclusion?\\", Social Safety Net Primary Papers, The World Bank, 2006, p.4 These programs have helped to increase school enrollment and attendance and they also have shown improvements in children's health conditions. Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP. In some countries e.g. in Peru decentralisation is hoped to help address social justice and poverty better. NGOs which addressed those problems on the local level before could help with that.

History  Greenhouse in la bassa (Pond) Pool Carles Pau Square, Botanic Garden of Valencia Greenhouse and ferns, Botanical Garden of Valencia Medicinal plants section in the Botanical Garden of Valencia =Origins= There are documented records of plots for growing medicinal plants since the 16th century, closely related to medical education in the university, practised since 1462. The earliest reference dates from 1499, when a professorship in ‚Äúsimples\\" or \\"herbs‚Äù was being planned, and teachers were appointed to it in 1501. The plant collection had always been related to medicine, cultivating herbs for medicinal use. In 1548 a chair of medical practice was created, and a short time later (1560) teaching of ‚Äúsimples\\" or herbs was separated from that of anatomy, with independent departments. In 1567 the Jurats (municipal government) of the City of Valencia appointed Joan Pla√ßa as doctor of medicine with the task of botanizing - collecting species - and gave him ‚Äúa garden where those plants needed for teaching will be planted‚Äù. Later, in 1631, there were several reports concerning these gardens, their location, and the doctors and professors in charge, but there does not appear to have been any assurance that the gardens would continue in being. In 1733 the University considered the possibility of an enclosure to be provided by the city, but not until 1757 did rector Lores directly propose a comprehensive botanical garden, complete with orchard, museum, teaching and conference space, and ancillary services, in a location near the Albereda avenue. In 1778 the city endorsed this proposal, but it would be another twenty years before it was realised. It is clear that this broader and more systematic concept of a botanical garden derived from the 18th-century development of the study of Botany as a science separate from Medicine. This development was inspired by Enlightenment thought, with a new interest in natural resources and agricultural improvements. In 1767 Gregori Maians called for the creation of a garden, to be run by the University's department of botany, to include the cultivation of plants of interest to medicine. In 1786, the University agreed to change the curriculum, separating the Professorship of Botany from the Professorship of Medicine, which made a Botanical Garden more of a necessity. The Valencian Economic Society (Reial Societat Econ√≤mica d‚ÄôAmics del Pa√≠s de Val√®ncia),An institution established in the context of European enlightened reformism. It was a study and debate club focussed on national affairs and economic development on the basis of Enlightenment ideas. interested in crop improvements, was also seeking at this time to work with the city government to provide land for such a scientific facility, together with a public promenade (Albereda). The society envisaged that the scheme would have scientific, instructional and recreational value. =Establishment= But this combination would not be so easy, because each party sought to emphasize its own priorities. The University's scientific and teaching interest looked for a systematic botanical collection representing the botanical sphere, while the Society aimed to maximise its utility for agriculture. The city finally yielded the promised ground to the University in 1798, but planting was soon suspended, apparently due to the poor quality of the soil and the inconveniences caused to the adjacent promenade of the Albereda. In 1802 the city offered a new and definitive site, which could be irrigated in the traditional way, by border irrigation, directly from the Rovella irrigation channel. It was called the Tramoieres and it was located in calle Quart, in front of the San Sebastian Minima convent and close to the T√∫ria. This marked the origin of the present Botanical Garden. The University placed the famous botanist Vicente Alfonso Lorente in charge of the new facility and provided him with the means to develop it. The trapezoidal site of about four hectares accommodated planting plots on a checkerboard system, known as the Linnaeus system, and also provided for herbaria, premises for the professor of Botany, buildings for the gardeners and other outbuildings. The successful completion of the garden quickly brought it renown among leading botanists, and relations were established particularly with the botanical garden in Madrid. This promising start would soon suffer the blow of the Napoleonic invasion, which was especially destructive in the Quart suburb. Lorente was also affected by these events: he was imprisoned and sentenced to death, and was saved only by the intervention of the French botanist L√©on Dufour. =19th-century development= After the war and the death of Lorente in 1813, the garden did not recover until the long term of leadership of Professor of Medicine Josep Pizcueta between 1829 and 1867. He undertook reforms and established it as the leading botanical garden in Spain. In response to a request by the Economic Society, experiments were carried out on acclimatization of plants native to America. At the same time, the chair of Agriculture was set up, directed by Joaqu√≠n Carrascosa. Also, in a process of convergence sanctioned by the Royal Order of 1834, teaching in agriculture and botany were brought together at the Botanical Garden, leading to an enlargement of the garden. In 1843, Pizcueta, assisted by F√©lix Robillard, replaced the Linnaeus organization by the natural method of Endlicher. After a reform of the study programme in 1845, he received substantial resources for plantations and also for acclimatization installations, such as a large wooden greenhouse designed by the architect Timoteu Calvo, a conservatory and small heated spaces that, together, would accelerate dramatically the success and growth of the specimens. In 1856, the catalogue of the garden was published, with over 6,000 living species and the herbarium. This phase of development bore lasting fruit in the construction of the iron and glass conservatory between 1860 and 1862. It was designed in 1859 by the well-known architect Sebasti√† Monle√≥n. It is considered a building ahead of its time in regard of the materials used in its construction. The project was challenging in technological, financial and practical terms. It measures 24m long, 8.25m inner diameter and 9m high, and its glazed surface measures 465m2. This south- facing glass cover has the shape of a quarter-circle, from the ground to a vertical wall, forming an attached space. Its size enables it to house such large plants as Astarapea, Aralia racemose (Araliaceae), Chorisia spaciosa (Malvacae) or Ficus benjamina (Moraceae), which may measure more than 5m high and cannot be accommodated in most other greenhouses. In making the case for funding this project, the University argued for the scientific necessity to provide the conditions needed to maintain the hundreds of exotic plants already brought to the garden, and also for maintaining its status among the leading gardens of Europe, keeping abreast of scientific progress. A building topped with a turret was later attached to the greenhouse wall. Built to house management and research departments, this building still exists, although other features of interest such as wooden buildings, the original shade gardens and a greenhouse, have disappeared over the years. Nevertheless, the greenhouse has been reconstructed according to the 1867 plans of architect Idelfons Fern√°ndez Calvache, of which we have written records. These structures were probably replaced by the present iron ones during the last quarter of the 19th century. Near the end of the 19th century, small greenhouses were built next to the seed nursery under the leadership of Ar√©valo Baca. In 1888, work was completed on the biggest greenhouse, which is known as ‚Äúthe raft‚Äù because of the proximity of the two elements. It was built according to the 1861 design. In 1900, the present shade garden was opened. Planned in 1897 by the versatile Madrid architect M√©lida Alinar in 1897, it was constructed of iron on a base of brick, and was inspired by the glass canopies of railway stations of the time. This marked the completion of building works on the site, and provided it with one of its most attractive features. The botanical garden now became part of the science faculty, and the School of Botanical Studies increased its involvement with the site. The practical and experimental role of the plantations was enhanced in the context of the agricultural boom of that period, under the leadership of Rafael Cisternes (1867-1876) and Josep Ar√©valo Baca (1876-1888). In 1878 the northern extension was opened, creating the present-day layout of the enclosure, whose juxtaposition with the streets Beat Gaspar Bono and Quart has remained unchanged since then. Between 1879 and 1880 the campus of the Sant Josep college or dels Pares Jesu√Øtes was established. =20th and 21st centuries= The garden was restored after the flood of 1957 thanks to the tenacity of the director Ignacio Docavo. Several damaged buildings were restored between 1962 and 1968, aiming to incorporate other elements of scientific interest. Later, with professor Manuel Costa as director, a comprehensive rehabilitation was undertaken. This project included the garden - restructuring the plantations, alternative irrigation techniques, and care of the plots - and the most characteristic architectural elements - the outer fence, the greenhouses and heated spaces, the shade garden, and the pavilion. The research building was constructed in 2000 on the site of expropriated buildings facing calle Quart. Currently, in addition to the preservation of the historic garden, it continues to function as a centre for botanical study, research, development and dissemination. It undertakes research on flora, biosystems and vegetation. It participates in international projects related to vegetational biodiversity and study of native plants. It has a library, a herbarium and a repository of germplasm. It promotes conferences of specialists, day classes, meetings and expositions. Today, the Botanical Garden of the University provides a centre for scientific and teaching activities, a vegetated, architectural and historical space, and a feature of the urban landscape.

It publishes a quarterly journal and holds annual meetings in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Purpose The AAPP is a learned society of psychiatrists and philosophers who share an interest in the interface of philosophy and psychiatry. It was formed to facilitate the integration of those two fields by promoting cross-disciplinary research, educational initiatives, and graduate training programs. The organization believes that philosophical methods applied to psychiatry bring types of analysis and critique that are valuable for their clarity of thought, meaning, and application to clinical practice. It also believes that psychiatry informs philosophy, and that \\"philosophy and psychiatry\\" is developing into an interdisciplinary field of its own. AAPP aims to enhance the psychiatrist's effectiveness as teacher, researcher, and practitioner by shedding light on the philosophical issues embedded in these activities. It also aims to study the ways in which psychiatric knowledge, theories, and practices can add to basic philosophical assumptions about subjects like mind, knowledge, and subjectivity. Specific interest areas of AAPP include the identification and understanding of abnormal experience and behavior; the problem of classifying psychiatric conditions; the relationship between neuroscience and clinical practice; the evaluation of clinical methods; and moral and ethical issues raised by psychiatric categories and practice. Publications The organization's official journal is Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology, published quarterly by Johns Hopkins University Press. The AAPP Bulletin is an informal publication released on an irregular schedule, typically one or two times a year. AAPP, in collaboration with two related organizations, sponsors Psagacity, a privately owned website featuring professionally produced oral history videos of prominent members. Meetings AAPP holds it annual meeting as an Affiliated Group on the opening weekend of the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Related organizations AAPP is closely associated with other organizations in the field, including the UK-based International Network for Philosophy & Psychiatry and the Philosophy Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The Department of Psychiatry at the University of Montreal and the Centre Hospitalier de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Montreal are sponsoring institutions of AAPP and its journal.

History  The 5th Division traced its lineage back to the 1895 formation of the 1st East Siberian Line Brigade. On 4 July 1900 it was redesignated the 5th East Siberian Rifle Brigade, consisting of the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th East Siberian Rifle Regiments. The brigade fought in Russian invasion of Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion. The 17th and 18th Regiments received cap badges for the Sungari Campaign, and the 20th received a cap badge for \\"distinction in 1900.\\" On 10 February 1904 it was upgraded into the 5th East Siberian Rifle Division. The division fought in the Russo-Japanese War as part of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps. Between 17 and 18 July 1904, it participated in the Battle of Kangualin. In 1910, it became the 5th Siberian Rifle Division and its regiments became Siberian Rifle Regiments instead of East Siberian Rifle Regiments. In 1914, the division's headquarters were located at Berezovka, near Verkhneudinsk (now the Vagzhanova microdistrict of Ulan-Ude). Its 1st Brigade at Berezovka consisted of the 17th and 18th Siberian Rifle Regiments, both also at Berezovka. Its 2nd Brigade at Troitskosavsk included the 19th and 20th Regiments, located at Berezovka and Troitskosavsk, respectively. The 5th Siberian Rifle Artillery Brigade with two battalions at Berezovka provided artillery support for the division. The division fought in World War I.

She performs as leader, ensemble director, soloist and chamber musician all over the world. To the concert activity she adds that of professor of violin and chamber orchestras. Early life \\"I was five, I didn't have any idea what lungs are\\" Lorenza originally wanted to play the trumpet as she had just seen the elephant trumpeters in the Walt Disney movie \\"Robin Hood\\". The music school didn't approve of her wanting to play the trumpet as she was too young and her lungs were not big enough. They started her off on the violin instead. Education \\"I met Lorenza Borrani when she was 9 years old at the Music School of Fiesole. [...] She was a sweet and enthusiastic child, together with her mother we went to see the concert Itzhak Perlman held at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, it was the early 90s. Great Perlman and great Lorenza, who over the years has been able to conquer the public and critics with her wonderful qualities of interpreter.\\" Loreanza Borrani thinks it is very important to mention the education of a musician and she feels very faithful to the teachers of her youth. It was a Dutch lady, a neighbor, who noticed her curiosity about music. She began taking violin lessons, around age five, at the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, studying with Alina Company; Piero Farulli, Zinaida Gilels and Pavel Vernikov. In her concert debut in 1995 at the theatre \\"La Pergola\\" in Florence, she performed Bach‚Äôs Concerto for 2 Violins with Pavel Vernikov and the direction of Emmanuel Krivine , in the presence of the at that time Italian Republic President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. She undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, Austria, with Boris Kuschnir and participated in masterclasses with Pier Narciso Masi, Mstislav Rostropovich, Ana Chumachenko, Maya Glezarova and Ilya Grubert. Often, in her interviews, Lorenza Borrani recalled the importance that some conductors, with whom she worked, have had in her musical growth. Among them, especially Lorin Maazel, Claudio Abbado and Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Career \\"Maybe the moment I like most about my role as a musician is rehearsal. The moment in which something is built, more than the moment in which the product is presented. The moment of the 'work in progress' is really very special for me.\\" Since 2008 Lorenza Borrani has been Leader (concertmaster) of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with which she performed, among others, under the direction of Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bernard Haitink, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Yannick N√©zet-S√©guin, Antonio Pappano, Andras Schiff and Simon Rattle. In 2003 she became leader of Symphonica Toscanini, directed by Lorin Maazel. She was a member of Orchestra Mozart from 2005 to 2008, with whom she performed Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 7 under Claudio Abbado in 2006. A nice episode of her experience with the Orchestra Mozart was the waltz danced with Roberto Benigni during the performance of Peter and the Wolf conducted by Claudio Abbado, in Bologna (2008). She also played in the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra under Claudio Abbado and in 2018 and 2019 she played again as leader of the Orchestra Mozart directed by Bernard Haitink. She has performed as a guest-leader or directed ensembles such as the European Union Youth Orchestra, Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Filarmonica della Scala, Bayerischen Rundfunk Orchester, Freiburger Barockorchester, Det Norske Kammerorkester (Artist-in-Residence, 2020) , Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra, Vall√®s Symphony Orchestra, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Tenerife and Australian Chamber Orchestra . With the Australian Chamber Orchestra she premiered her own orchestral arrangement of Prokofiev‚Äôs Violin Sonata No.1, on tour across Australia in spring 2019. As chamber musician, Lorenza Borrani has collaborated with Isabelle Faust, Daniel Hope, Andr√°s Schiff, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Janine Jansen, Irina Fiodorovna Schnittke, Christian Tetzlaff, Alexander Lonquich , Mario Brunello and others. As concertmaster of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Lorenza Borrani appears in the season 2020-2021 of the Philharmonie Berlin in a concert with the pianist Yuja Wang. She is a member of the Honorary Committee of the project \\"Farulli 100\\" dedicated in 2020 to the memory of Piero Farulli (viola of the legendary Quartetto Italiano and founder of the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole) on the centenary of his birth. She performs on a Santo Serafino violin (Venice, 1745).  Spira Mirabilis and Spunicunifait Quintet  In 2007 Lorenza Borrani was one of the co-founder of Spira Mirabilis, a musical laboratory \\"to continue to study, to meet, to learn and to rehearse together, and then to share music with an audience\\" . Thanks to this project and to the meeting with italian clarinetist Lorenzo Coppola, Lorenza Borrani developed curiosity and passion for the execution of the classical repertoire on period instruments. Spira Mirabilis was appointed Cultural Ambassadors for the European Union in March 2012, is still a living project today and has enjoyed great success all over in Europe , with appearances including Musikfest Bremen, London‚Äôs Southbank Centre, Essen‚Äôs Philharmonie, and Paris‚Äô Cit√© de la Musique and Salle Pleyel. In 2018 Lorenza Borrani debuted at Schloss Elmau the ‚ÄòMozart Quintets‚Äô project, a collaboration with her close chamber music partners dedicated to the study and period performance of Mozart‚Äôs rarely performed string quintets . In 2019 the quintet played the complete Mozart's string and wind quintets for the Amici della Musica (Friends of Music) of Florence at the theatre \\"La Pergola\\". In 2020 the quintet was named Spunicunifait and in winter 2021, it will perform in Salzburg at the Mozart Week (the Salzburg's festival for classical music, around the time of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's birthday, organized by the International Mozarteum Foundation) and at the Wigmore Hall in London.

He served as secretary to William III and to George I of Great Britain. Life Robethon was born at Authon-du-Perche, north-west France, into a Calvinist family. He is said to have joined the service of King William III when Prince of Orange only. He came to England about 1689, and was naturalised in 1693, being employed by William III, at first in a humble capacity. In 1693 he acted as secretary to Baron Sch√ºtz, the Hanoverian envoy in London. Afterwards he passed into the service of the Earl of Portland who, when ambassador to Paris in 1698, took Robethon with him. In September 1698, Robethon became private secretary to William III. Among William's correspondents, Robethon made an important contact in George William, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, who visited England in 1701. On William's death in 1702, Robethon transferred his services to the Duke, who died in 1705. Robethon then was employed by his son-in-law, George Lewis, the future George I of England. Robethon held the threads of an extended European correspondence. The leading Whigs in England kept themselves in touch with the House of Brunswick, and the letters from the Elector's family to their supporters in England were drafted by Robethon. The Duke of Marlborough paid him well for information on the intrigues of Louis XIV at the court of Saxony. Robethon also worked to assist Marlborough in neutralising Charles XII of Sweden, and undermining overtures Louis made to the allies in 1707. He was well informed about the Old Pretender. Worldly, adept and well briefed on English politicians, Robethon had influence with George I, though not with the ladies of the court. In 1714 Robethon accompanied George I to England, as secretary and counsellor, but was not easily accepted. Sunderland used him and Bothmer in 1716 to split the king from Robert Walpole, who disliked Robethon. Before the return of Walpole to power, Robethon's influence waned. Robethon made the first French translation of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism (in verse), which was published in Amsterdam and London in 1717. In 1721 he was appointed governor of the French La Providence Hospital in east London.Murdoch, Tessa, and Randolph Vigne with foreword by Jacob Pleydell- Bouverie, 8th Earl of Radnor, The French Hospital in England: Its Huguenot History and Collections Cambridge: John Adamson , p. 101. He died in London on 14 April 1722. Legacy Some of Robethon's correspondence was in 11 volumes of Hanoverian letters with the Stowe MSS., now in the British Library. The collection was formed around the Electress Sophia's papers, which were entrusted to Robethon by George I on his mother's death in 1714. They were later sold by the executors of the secretary's son, Colonel Robethon, in 1752, to Matthew Duane, and while in his hands were seen by James Macpherson. They were subsequently purchased by Thomas Astle, and in 1803 by the Marquess of Buckingham. Family Robethon married Claudine Maxwell, nicknamed \\"Madame Grenouille\\", in 1703; she survived him. They had a son, George William Frederick. The couple seem to have had pensions from both George I and his son.

Background \\"Relaxin' at Camarillo\\" was inspired by Parker's term for a half a year, recovering in Camarillo State Hospital in Ventura County, California. He had been sent there to recuperate from drink and drug addiction after a term spent in jail from setting fire to his bed sheets, running naked through the hotel lobby and resisting arrest, incapacitated. Camarillo was a mental hospital set in several Mission Revival buildings to the north of Los Angeles. Recordings After release, Bird was able to record it along with three originals by trumpeter Howard McGhee: \\"Cheers\\", \\"Stupendous\\" and \\"Carvin the Bird\\". Parker recorded the tune with McGhee on trumpet, Dodo Marmarosa on piano, Wardell Gray on tenor, Barney Kessell on guitar, Red Callender on bass and Don Lamond on drums. The tune was originally recorded in C major, and has become a jazz standard. Ted Gioia, commenting in West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California, 1945-1960, has referred to the original recording as a \\"sinuous blues\\", a 12-bar blues that is a \\"further testimony to the subtlety of Parker's rhythmic phrasing\\".

The brewery has three facilities located in Fort Point, Boston and Canton.  History  Founders JC and Esther Tetreault established the brewery in 2013 with its first facility in Fort Point, Boston, Massachusetts. In December 2015, the brewery opened a second facility in Canton, Massachusetts. In October 2018, Trillium opened a new 3-story restaurant and brewery in Fort Point.  Awards  For the year 2016, RateBeer listed Trillium as the third-best brewery in the world, and the best brewery in Massachusetts. RateBeer also included six Trillium beers in their top 15 beers in the India Pale Ale (IPA) category, one beer in the Double IPA category, six beers in the American Amber/Pale category and one beer in the Wheat category.  Controversies  In 2014 Trillium failed to renew their state brewers license, resulting in a nearly month-long closure. Trillium claimed to have submitted an application for renewal in 2013, however no license was issued and the state sent numerous notices to the company without response. Trillium continued to operate illegally for the majority of 2014 and was closed by the state at the end of November 2014. In late 2018, a number of former Trillium employees posted messaged on BeerAdvocate.com accusing the ownership of cutting wages, serving sub par product to customers, paying retail staff server wages and illegally using tequila in a beer and instructing staff to lie about it. Trillium owner JC Tetreault spoke to the Boston Globe admitting to making \\"a mistake\\" and did not deny any of the claims, confirming many of them. On November 26, 2018, the owners of Trillium posted a statement on their website saying retail employees will have their hourly wages restored for longtime workers whose pay had been cut. They company also apologized to employees, customers, and friends. The Boston Globe reported the company's retail workforce will be paid $15 to $18 an hour, and still have the ability to earn tips from customers purchasing beer. In July of 2020 cans of Trillium's fruited Berliner Weiss, Daily Serving, began to explode at consumer's homes due to refermentation taking place in the cans. Trillium released a statement about the exploding cans which was perceived by many as blaming the customers for poorly storing the cans and taking no responsibility for the fact that they sold a product that could explode. https://www.pastemagazine.com/drink/craft-beer/exploding-beer-cans- trillium-450-north-fruit/  References   External links  * Beer brewing companies based in Massachusetts ","title":"Trillium Brewing Company"},{"id":"53483456","text":"Justin de Vos (born 12 November 1998) is a Dutch football player of Cura√ßao descent who plays for EVV Eindhoven.

Early life and education Julio Fonseca was born in San Jos√©, Costa Rica on May 22, 1885. His primary and secondary education was obtained at the Seminary School in San Jose. He studied for his bachelors at the Lyceum of Costa Rica.Flores, B. (1973). Julio Fonseca. San Jos√©: Ministerio de Cultura, Juventud y Deporte. He began to study music from an early age at the National School of Music, and later at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He created his first compositions in 1897 - 1902 while under the tutelage of important musicians such as Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Vargas Calvo and Alvise Castegnaro. These compositions include ¬°Licha ... ! (1897), Noche de luna (1897), Brisas del campo (1898), En la matin√© (1898), Esperanza (1898); also works for the solo piano: Celia (1898), Fuegos Fatuos (1901), Escenas del fest√≠n (1901), Miniatura (1901), Estudio (1901), Nocturno (1901), Paisaje (1902); Ave Mar√≠a (1898) and Oh Salutaris, composed in 1902.  Time in Europe (1902‚Äì1906)  =Milan, Italy= In 1902, he received a scholarship from the government of President Ascensi√≥n Esquivel Ibarra to study in Europe. He was accepted to both the Royal Bavarian Music School and the Milan Conservatory. After careful consideration, he decided to study in piano and harmony in Milan. He arrived to discover that he was one year short of the conservatory's age requirement and had to study for a year at an art school. The school terminated Fonseca's studies prompting him to write a letter to the Costa Rican government requesting permission to transfer to another conservatory while maintaining his government provided scholarship. =Brussels, Belgium= Fonseca's application was accepted at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels prompting a move to that city in 1904. His academic stay was extended into 1906, when he was diagnosed with a serious pulmonary disease that motivated him to return to Costa Rica. During his time Europe, he wrote the songs Amor ti chiedo (1904) and the work, Nocturnetto, written in Milan. In Brussels, he wrote The Sonata en Si for piano and piano; the trio for violin, cello and piano El Cen√°culo, the quartet for strings and piano, el G√≥lgota, and Romanza, a song with French lyrics. First return to Costa Rica (1907‚Äì1913) From 1907 to 1913, he remained in Costa Rica teaching music direction and instruments. During this period, he met Mar√≠a Elena Mora whom he married in 1912. Together, they had three sons and two daughters: Jimmy (1916), Harold (1920), Mercy, Molly y Julio (1924). Among his most important compositions at this time were the waltzes: El Enigma (1912) and Florita (1912); and the promenades Claudia (1912) and Brisas del Caribe (1912); the funeral march Ecce homo (1911) and the march El centenario (1911). Time in the US (1914‚Äì1916) In 1914, Fonseca travelled with his wife to New York to improve his musical knowledge and economic situation. Their stay in lasted only one year as the economic and labor situation was very difficult given the turmoil of World War I. The situation was challenging enough that they had to receive assistance from the musician, Alejandro Monestel and the writer, Manuel Gonz√°lez Zeled√≥n. During this year (1914), Fonseco wrote important works like the religious songs, Dios te Salve numbers 1 and 2; the tangos, El elegante, El gaucho, Midinettes, No afloj√©s, che; the funeral march, Inri; the orchestral works, Maxixe and Obertura h√∫ngara, and his famous waltz, Leda. Second return to Costa Rica (1916‚Äì1950) =Teaching= After his return to Costa Rica in 1916, Fonseca dedicated his efforts to teaching, participating in important academic projects such as the founding of the Conservatorio de M√∫sica y Declamaci√≥n.Vargas, M. C. (2004). De las fanfarrias a las salas de concierto. San Jos√©: EUCR. He was also part of the faculty of the Escuela de M√∫sica Santa Cecilia,Flores, B. (1978). La M√∫sica en Costa Rica. San Jos√©: Editorial Costa Rica where he occasionally assumed the duties of the Director of the Institution (J. J. Vargas Calvo) during the director's absences. In 1934, Fonsca founded the la Academia Euterpe with his son Jimmy and violinist Ra√∫l Cabezas. The academy was only in operation for a few years. It primarily focused on teaching violin and piano, but also had a chior and an orchestra.Z√∫√±iga, V. (1992). Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Nacional. San Jos√©: EUNED Fonseca was an instructor at the Colegio de Se√±oritas where he was a professor of music from 1927 to 1942. Finally, Fonseca was a founding professor at the Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica, in 1942. This institution later transformed into the School of Music Arts of the University of Costa Rica. =Organist and choir director= Julio Fonseca Guti√©rrez had a deep and profound bond between his artistic life and his religious beliefs. This is evident in his relationship with Catholic institutions, and his work as the Choir Director of the Iglesia de la Merced from 1932 until the last years of his life. Fonseca's youngest son, Julio Jr., dedicated himself to the priesthood inspiring Fonseca to compose the Mass, Vitis et Palmites, in December 1948 in honor of his son's ordination. Fonseca's unedit works contain many compositions exalting the pillars of the Christian religion with 35 songs and hymns dedicated to the Virgin Mary. His works inspired by Christianity also include important compositions like the choral cantatas Los Siete Dolores de la Virgen (1920) and el Auto M√≠stico de la Virgen de los √Ångeles (1938). He also wrote five masses: la Misa Teologal en Sol Mayor (1928), la misa Coraz√≥n de Mar√≠a (1929), Ave Mar√≠a Stella (1932), la misa Ujarr√°s (1934) and la misa Vitis et Palmites (1948). =Other work= In addition to his work as a teacher, composer and choir director, Fonseca was also known as the director of an orchestra and musical group that performed during dedications of social spaces and special events in Costa Rica during the first half of the 20th century. He was also recognized as an official instrumentalist of the Military Band of San Jose,Araya, J. R. (1957). Vida musical de Costa Rica. San Jos√©: Imprenta Nacional a musical institution for whom he composed and released some of his work. He was also a music critic and journalist, writing for the newspaper La Justicia Social in the early part of the 20th century, and later for the magazine El Maestro and for la Revista Musical with three articles published in 1940, 1941, 1944. In 1910, he wrote a booklet titles Lecciones de Armon√≠a (Lessons in Harmony) for the Santa Cecilia school of music. =In search of national identity ‚Äì trips to Guanacaste= Julio Fonseca was part of a group of musicians that responded in 1927, to a call from Education Secretary Luis Dobles Segreda of governor Jim√©nez de Oreamuno's administrationVargas, M. C. (2008). ¬øC√≥mo tuvimos m√∫sica nacional? La Naci√≥n, √Åncora, p. 6 to search for a national identify in the field of music. In 1929, the government decided to send three musicians, Roberto Cantillano, Jos√© Daniel Z√∫√±iga and Julio Fonseca, to Guanacaste where they would compile, harmonize, and edit a compilation of folklore, El Folleto de M√∫sica Folcl√≥rica Nacional. Three editions of the work were published in 1929, 1934, and 1935. Last years The last years of Julio Fonseca were full of emotional contrasts. The death of his wife Maria Elena in 1948 caused health problems for him. His son Julio Jr was ordained and priest. He wrote more important works such as the mass, Vitis et Palmites and the waltz, Mar√≠a Elena. In the months before his death, he visited his sons, Jimmy and Harold. During this trip, a tribute concert was arranged by the Pan American Union that included an opportunity for him to conduct the orchestra. Julio Fonseca died in San Jos√© on June 22, 1950.

His career was tarnished due to his association with organized crime. Early life and career Bevilacqua grew up in Silver Lake, an Italian-American neighborhood of Providence. He attended Providence public schools and received a Bachelor of Arts from Providence College in 1940.Joseph M. Muratore, Italian-Americans in Rhode Island, Volume 2 (1999), p. 92.Manual with Rules and Orders for the Use of the General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1975), p. 237. He served in the Army from 1941 to 1946, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant and serving in the Italian Campaign (World War II) where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart. He received a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown Law School in 1948, and his clients and friends included organized crime figures. Political career Bevilacqua was elected to the Rhode Island House in 1954; he became majority leader in 1966 and Speaker in 1969. He worked for the passage of the state's medicare statute and for job retraining measures. He was elected by the General Assembly as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court in 1976, and he promised to put aside \\"old friendships and causes.\\" Privately, however, he reassured mobster Nicholas Bianco: \\"Don't worry, I'll still keep my connections.\\" Around this time, a number of allegations surfaced regarding Bevilacqua's ties to organized crime. The New York Times stated that allegations had been made in 1976 that he had harbored a fugitive from a 1963 department store robbery, and had accepted a payment of $2,000 from him. It also became public that he had written a letter to the State Parole Board in 1973 vouching for the integrity of crime boss Raymond L. S. Patriarca. The letter read, \\"To whom it may concern: I have known Mr. Patriarca for a good many years. I have found him to be a good person of integrity and, in my opinion, good moral character.\\" Bevilacqua officiated at the wedding of Patriarca's chauffeur, who was under indictment for fraud. The State Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline investigated these incidents and took no action. Impeachment and resignation The Providence Journal brought public attention to Bevilacqua's ties to organized crime figures in 1984. State police officers followed him as he visited the homes of crime figures, and he was also observed frequenting a mob-connected motel for mid-day trysts with women. The Journal ran a front-page photo of him zipping his pants fly while leaving the Alpine Motel in Smithfield, Rhode Island. A judicial commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg censured Bevilacqua for associating with criminals. The General Assembly began impeachment proceedings in 1986, the first such proceedings in the state's history, but Bevilacqua resigned during the proceedings. Death Bevilacqua was hospitalized several times in his last few months, including for a heart attack in early May 1989. He was taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital on May 30, 1989 and died there on June 21. He is buried in Saint Ann Cemetery in Cranston, Rhode Island.

A self- taught cook, she helms the kitchen of Hi≈°a Franko restaurant in Kobarid, Slovenia. Born to distinctly ambitious parents, she trained alpine skiing as a child, earning a place in the Yugoslavian youth national team, but later decided she didn't want a professional career. After that, she studied diplomacy in Gorizia, when she met her partner Valter Kramar. Kramar's parents owned Hi≈°a Franko, an already established restaurant. Incidentally, they decided to retire just as she completed her study, so she and Kramar decided to stay and take over the family restaurant (against the wish of her parents). At first, she worked as a waitress (Kramar became a sommelier) and tried convincing the then chef to try experimenting with traditional recipes, to no avail. After he left, she took over the kitchen. With the help of her mother- in-law and a family friend, she shortly learned cooking well enough to attract attention in the wider region with her culinary creations. In 2010, she was featured in the Italian culinary magazine Identit√† Golose, which brought her even more attention. She began receiving invitations to top-notch culinary events, such as being a guest chef of the Ikarus restaurant in Hangar-7 in Salzburg, Austria, and the Gelinaz Grand Shuffle in New York City. In 2016, Ro≈° was featured in the Netflix documentary Chef's Table and in early 2017, she was named world's best female chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants academy. Her cooking style features innovative remaking of traditional recipes from the upper Soƒça valley region, prepared with local ingredients.  Recognition  In 2016, Ro≈° was featured in the Netflix documentary Chef's Table. In 2017, she was named world's best female chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants academy.

Most of the estimated 3,100 prostitutes in the Gambia are from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea . Prostitution takes place on the beach, in bars and hotels on the coast. Away from the coast, prostitution mainly takes place in bars. The bars are frequently raided and the foreign prostitutes deported. They often return within a few days. The HIV infection rate for prostitutes is high. Sex tourism Gambia is a popular destination for sex tourism. One of the most popular areas is the \\"Senegambia strip\\", the coastal area around Kololi, and is often arranged through local \\"bumsters\\". Sex tourism in the Gambia attract western female tourists eager for sex with younger men. The Gambian Tourist Board plans to change the face of tourism in the country and encourage tourism for wildlife and heritage rather than sex. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the Gambia. The Gambian government is taking an active stance against it. Many young people turn to the sex trade due to poverty. The Gambia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 3 August 1990, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in September 2000, which mandates the government to protect children from sexual child abuse. The main legislation is the Tourism Offences Act, 2003, which is describes a child as anyone under eighteen, even though the legal age of consent is sixteen years. The Tourism Act means that anyone employed in the tourism industry is committing a crime if s/he offers sexual favours to customers for money. The punishment is a fine, imprisonment of a maximum of two years and disqualification from tourism related work for ten years. The law states that hotel operators can face a fine and five years in prison if they knowingly allow child prostitution on their property. Child prostitution is particularly prevalent around the Tourist Development Area, as well as in Kololi, Senegambia and Pipeline. Some girls are sent to be prostitutes by their parents to support their families. Within The Gambia, girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Children from West African countries, mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin, are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia. The majority of these victims are subjected to sexual exploitation by child sex tourists, primarily from Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Canada. In recent years, sex traffickers are increasingly hosting child sex tourists in private residences outside the commercial tourist areas of the capital, Banjul, making the crime harder for law enforcement to detect. Traffickers have allegedly exploited Sierra Leonean boys and girls as ‚Äúcultural dancers‚Äù in The Gambia. Observers believe organised sex trafficking networks use European and Gambian travel agencies to promote child sex tourism. Sex trafficking The Gambia is a Tier 2 Watch List country for Human trafficking according to the US Department of State. The Gambian 2007 Trafficking Act prohibits trafficking and those convicted can be sentenced to prison for up to 50 years. The Gambia is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Within The Gambia, women, girls, and‚Äîto a lesser extent‚Äîboys are subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from West African countries‚Äîmainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin‚Äîare recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia.

It was released on 14 April 2017 on Ninja Tune Records. Upon its announcement, the video for the lead single \\"X22RME\\" was released on Ninja Tune's YouTube channel. AZD is Actress's fifth album. The preceding album, Ghettoville, had been suspected to have been his last. As an artist, Actress has always been considered vague in regards to the intentions behind his actions and albums. Christian Eede of The Quietus writes that while a common theme of Cunningham's albums reportedly experienced by listeners is death and a downbeat vibe, AZD shows Actress in a more humorous and open light. Cunningham tends to give vague titles to his music works to give his audience a glimpse of what the concept of the pieces are instead of fully revealing his thoughts on his songs. The album has a central concept of the sound associated with 'chrome'. Chrome can represent futuristic ideals while also conveying coldness which in turn could represent human dissociation. Even with this, AZD is a big change in terms of energy from past albums. Its energy is described and felt as higher, as it is not as gloomy or dark as his others.

It is often wrongly attributed to vocalist Ethel Waters, who first recorded it on September 18, 1926 with Will Marion Cook's Singing Orchestra. Waters is credited with popularizing it. Cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, pianist Fats Waller and the Paul Whiteman Orchestra featuring Bing Crosby all recorded it in 1927. The song has become a jazz standard, popular with Dixieland musicians. History Ethel Waters first recorded it for Columbia Records on September 18, 1926 and she identified Heywood and Cook as the authors in her autobiography. It was Waters who popularized the tune. The following year, Waters first sang it during her Broadway premiere in a production of Africana at Daly's Sixty-third Street Theatre. After the Waters release, the tune was adopted by numerous Dixieland groups, who increased the tempo. Cornetist Bix Beiderbecke recorded the song in 1927 with Frankie Trumbauer, and it was subsequently widely recorded in the late 1920s and 1930s by artists such as Fats Waller (with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in New York on 11 May 1927), Bing Crosby with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra on April 29, 1927 in one of Crosby's earliest recordings, Django Reinhardt, Artie Shaw, Art Tatum (The Genius of Art Tatum, 1953-4) Maxine Sullivan, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong. Teddy Wilson had a widely successful recording of the song in late 1937. In 1938, Benny Goodman featured it in his renowned concert of that year. Paul Whiteman re-recorded the song, and had a second hit with it in December. In following decades it was recorded by Erroll Garner, Gene Krupa, Al Cohn, and Steve Lacy. Billie Holiday adopted the tune, and performed it \\"Chicago style\\". Though the song declined somewhat in popularity after the 1950s, it remains a staple of Dixieland musicians. Jimmy Rushing also recorded \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\" with his big band in 1958. In 1974, guitarist Charlie Byrd performed a rendition of the tune at the Concerts by the Sea in Redondo Beach, California, which appeared on his Byrd by the Sea album. Billboard praised the sensitivity and delicate nature of the album recording. Violinist Stephane Grappelli recorded it with George Shearing for their 1976 album The Reunion. In 2000, bassist Michael Moore's trio recorded it for the History of Jazz, Vol. 1 compilation. Structure Alec Wilder says of the song in American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900-1950: The song, popular with Dixieland musicians, features lyrics such as \\"And if I can win ya, I'll never more roam, I'm coming Virginia, My Dixieland home.\\" References 1926 songs 1920s jazz standards Bing Crosby songs Dixieland jazz standards Songs about Virginia ","title":"I'm Coming Virginia"},{"id":"53484287","text":"Glenea pagana is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Born in Prague, Bohemia (in the present-day Czech Republic), he began his studies in 1928 with the Institute for Egyptology and Africanistic at the University of Vienna, completing his dissertation on a Hausa Dialect in 1932. From 1934 to 1938 he carried out fieldwork in Zeniya, Egypt where he studied and recorded the pronunciation of Coptic by Copts in the area near Luxor, later collaborating with William Worrel in the production of \\"Popular Traditions of the Coptic Language\\" in 1934. From 1948, he resided in Paris. In 1960, he settled with his family in Geneva, Switzerland, where, from 1973-1980, he was titular professor of Egyptology and Hamito-Semitic (Afroasiatic) Languages at the University of Fribourg. After publishing numerous scholarly articles in the various topics of his expertise, in 1978 Vycichl was instrumental in the founding of the Soci√©t√© √âgyptologique de Gen√®ve.

Funded by the local education authority, it is run as a free school by the University of Cambridge and is the first University Training School for primary in the UK. With a planned capacity of 630 pupils, the school is also used for teacher training and acts as a centre for educational research. History Following the University's 800th anniversary in 2009, plans were formed to address the issue of the lack of affordable accommodation for its staff and post-graduate students. The 150-hectare North West Cambridge Development between Madingley Road and Huntingdon Road was identified as an area for development, and in February 2013 formal planning approval was granted for development of the site to include 1500 homes for university staff, 1500 homes for private sale, and accommodation for 2000 graduate students. To help support this, a primary school was also included in the plans, and work began on the site following a ground-breaking ceremony on 14 November 2014. The school opened with the new school year in September 2015 with two Reception classes, one Year One class, and one Year Two class. In September 2016 three Reception classes were added. Over time the school will fill as the initial intake becomes older until there are three classes in each year up to Year Six. Building The school was created by architects Marks Barfield, designers of the London Eye, and is circular in shape enclosing a central courtyard. Drawing inspiration from Mandy Swann's book Creating learning without limits, the school encompasses a \\"learning street\\", a central space that runs between the classrooms that themselves open directly onto the space without the need for doors.

Irish Nationalists and Republicans believe that collusion took place between the British security forces and Loyalist paramilitaries in the shootings. The six men who were killed became known as \\"The New Lodge Six\\". Background The Troubles broke out in August 1969 with severe rioting in Belfast and the British army was called in to restore order. Shortly after, the newly formed guerrilla movement the Provisional IRA waged a campaign against the British of shooting and bombing. In response, Loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and (UDA) waged a campaign of killings against the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and also bombed targets in the Republic of Ireland. The conflict was a bloody and bitter one with all sides carrying out massacres of civilians. The incidents included McGurk's Bar bombing, which killed 15 civilians, was carried out by the UVF, Bloody Sunday, in which the British army shot dead 14 Catholic civilians and Bloody Friday, which killed 9 people (2 British soldiers, 1 UDA member and 6 Civilians) was carried out by the IRA. The New Lodge, on the edge of the city centre, with a history of active Irish republicanism and surrounded by Loyalist areas, saw much violence during The Troubles. Most of the remaining Protestant population left under intimidation in the early 1970s, to be replaced by Catholics intimidated from Loyalist areas of Belfast. As a stronghold of the Third Battalion of the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade, rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the British Army and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences during the early 1970s and other periods of high political tension such as the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, and occurred sporadically during the rest of that period. The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout The Troubles, particularly to drive-by shootings. The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland. Shootings In the first four days of February 1973, fourteen people died and many more were injured in numerous gun attacks across the city. On Friday 2 February, the hooded body of 28-year-old Catholic, Patrick Bradley from Andersonstown, was found in a car in Maurice Street. An 18-year-old petrol pump attendant was shot dead in his caf√© on York Road. Earlier in the day, ten people from the Beechmount area were injured when gunmen opened fire from a passing car. Undercover British army involvement was suspected in the Beechmount shooting. In Ardoyne, in a similar attack, residents escaped injury. Tension was high in Belfast on Saturday 3 February. The UDA had paraded from many parts of the city to the Laddas Drive RUC station to demand the release of two of its members who had recently been interned. This was the first time Loyalists were threatened with internment and there were many protests and rioting by Loyalists in Belfast because of it. The first shooting in the New Lodge area occurred at around 11.00pm when members of the UDA shot dead James Sloan (19) and James McCann (18), both IRA Volunteers, while they stood outside Lynch's Bar, in a drive-by shooting. The car drove down the Antrim Road and fire was directed at a Chinese restaurant injuring others. After the initial attack, residents gathered on the streets after hearing the shooting, they soon came under a hail of gunfire from several positions. British Army soldiers fired a number of rounds at a crowd of people from Duncairn Gardens down Edlingham Street and from the top of Templar and Alamein Flats. For the first time in Northern Ireland the army were using their new 'Nitesights'. Four more people, Tony Campbell (19), Ambrose Hardy (26), Brendan Maguire (33) and John Loughran (35) were shot dead by British snipers. Aftermath The British Army released a statement after the shootings in which they claimed that between 23.45 and 03.00 there was a severe gun battle in the New Lodge area. In about 30 separate incidents, nearly 200 shots were fired at the security forces and fire was returned on most occasions. They said that seven of the people shot were gunmen and six of them died, eyewitness claims dispute these statements claiming none of those shot was armed at the time they were killed. The sister of Ambrose Hardy claims he was waving a white petticoat when he was killed. Six years later Ambrose Hardy's brother John Hardy (43) was killed by UVF gunmen while he was having dinner with his six children.

Artistic practice Writing for Artspeak, Cindy Richmond has described Campbell's work as a \\"confirmation of Minimalism's continued vitality.

The surfaces of her monochromes are rendered carefully, step by step, through a reverential application of paint.

The vote came in March of 2005, after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban. In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions. Proposed by Honduras, the statement was largely supported by Roman Catholic countries and opposed by countries with active embryonic stem cell research programs. Many Islamic nations abstained. The UN Declaration on Human Cloning, as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is \\"incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.\\" The US, which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally Britain, where therapeutic cloning is legal and regulated, voted against it. The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding. \\"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology,\\" Bernard Siegel, a Florida attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a Reuters report. \\"But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning.\\"  References  * 50px This article contains quotations from Wikisource, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic (CC BY 2.5) license.

In 1970, he recorded the song \\"Desdemona,\\" which was composed for him by Mati Caspi and written by Gad Kaynar. In 1971, Desdemona reached the top of the Israeli Hit Parade. Early life and military David ben Ami (nicknamed \\"Dadi\\" from an early age) was born to one of the founding families of the Nahalal moshav. In his youth, he studied drama with the theater director and acting teacher Nola Chilton. He served in the IDF in the Southern Command Band and in the Northern Command Band. After his release from the army he studied theater studies at Tel-Aviv University and worked as an actor in the Cameri Theater. A short time later, he began his return to Jewish religious practice under the direction of Rabbi Israel Meir Lau and Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh. Influenced by friends from the Chabad Chassidic school of thought, he travelled to New York to spend an entire year in the court of the Lubavitcher Rebbe Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Eventually, he returned to Jerusalem and chose to follow the directives of Breslov Chassidism. As part of his becoming a ba'al teshuva, he began to use his full name of \\"David Refael\\" and his original family name of \\"Feinshil\\" which was used by his ancestors in the Diaspora. His grandfather, who immigrated to Israel during the second aliya, had Hebraicised it to \\"Ben-Ami\\". For many years, he abandoned his musical career and focused on anthologizing ancient Chassidic melodies from the elderly people of the Meah Shearim neighborhood in Jerusalem, which he performed in his albums from 1988 onwards. He stated, \\"My mission is to endow the songs and to perpetuate the melodies.\\" In his appearances he performed Israeli songs, and in one of his later albums he sings Israeli songs and tunes that were inspired prior to the establishment of the State of Israel.

Pelzer (October 9, 1889 ‚Äì April 24, 1985) was an American art teacher, artist and muralist known for her work in public spaces. In addition to the mural for the post office mural project in Waverly, Iowa, she completed eight murals for the Hotel Jefferson, of Iowa City and a mural for the lobby of the Press-Citizen. In addition to her mural work, Pelzer was known for portraits, floral works and landscapes. Early life Mildred Lenore Weenink was born on October 9, 1889 in Auburn, Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin to Eudora D. (n√©e Thompson) and Henry D. Weenink. By the time she was two years old, her family had moved to Dillon, Montana, where she completed her schooling, graduating from the Montana State Normal School in 1909. Immediately upon her graduation, Weenink applied and was accepted to begin studies at the Pratt Institute, where she entered the following year. After two years of study at Pratt, Weenink graduated in 1912. Career Upon completing her schooling, Weenink was hired to teach at the Montana School for the Deaf, Blind, and Backward Children, in Boulder, Montana, but left after one term. Continuing her studies, Weenink attended Columbia University. From 1915 to 1916, Weenink taught in the public schools in Bedford, Indiana, before going to serve as director of the art department at the Dakota State Normal School in Madison, South Dakota. On January 1, 1917, in Dillon, Weenink married fellow teacher, Louis Pelzer, and they made their home in Iowa City, where Louis was teaching history at the University of Iowa. Once relocated, Pelzer began studying with Grant Wood and served as his publicist. She also studied with Marvin Cone and began her own career, painting portraits of college faculty and raised their two sons, Lorne Parker Pelzer and Henry Pelzer. In 1934, Pelzer was commissioned by the Works Progress Administration to create eight murals for the Hotel Jefferson, the largest structure in Iowa City at the time. The murals were four feet high by twelve feet long and depicted historic scenes from the development of the city from settlement to the twentieth century, spanning the period between the meeting of the Fox leader Poweshiek and settlers from the East to the arrival of automobiles. Pelzer confirmed historical details with her husband, who was a history professor. At the dedication banquet, attended by 150 people, the head of the political science department, Benjamin Shambaugh noted the significance of Pelzer's achievement to document the history of the state with artwork. That same year, she also produced a map, Iowa: Prairie Chronicles in Picture which covered significant historical events in the state and their locations. Her work was known nationally, having appeared on the cover of the July 1934 issue of Better Homes and Gardens. She also exhibited in Kansas City, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, as well as throughout Iowa and was chosen for a painting by the Packard Motor Company. Pelzer's mural for the Iowa City Press-Citizen Building took two years to prepare. In 1935, the preliminary painting for Symphony of Iowa was the state‚Äôs entry for an exhibition hosted by the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) held in Detroit. When the Press-Citizen Building was completed in 1937, the painting was installed in the lobby. Around 1961, six of the Jefferson murals were placed in storage, having faded with light exposure. In 1966, At the Iowa City Landing, Symphony of Iowa, The Railroad Comes‚Äî1856 and We Build the Capitol were restored by Forrest Bailey who was commissioned by Richard T. Feddersen. In August 1937, Pelzer's painting of the Grinnell College campus was donated by Henry Hromek and his wife to the college in memory of their son. A month later, Pelzer won the federal commission to complete the post office mural for Waverly, Iowa, as part of the Section of Painting and Sculpture‚Ä≤s projects, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The mural, A Letter from Home in 1856 depicts a scene of a couple on their farm, where the wife had brought a letter from their previous home to the field. As her husband paused his plowing, the wife read the letter to him, as their child grasped at her mother's skirts. In 2014, the post office, along with 40 other buildings in Waverly's historic district, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1940, Pelzer was one of the founders of the Iowa Artists Association and served as the chair of the organization. That same year, she was recognized with a national award given by the GFWC for her work in promoting art and with young artists. Tragedy struck the family during World War II, when both of their sons were killed in action. In the midst of their grief, Pelzer's husband Lewis died of a heart attack in 1946. After her husband's death, Pelzer focused on her painting, working in Florida, Hawaii, and Iowa and competed in several shows before moving to Hawaii in 1949 to create a series of gouache landscapes. Her Hawaiian landscapes were noted for their vibrant colors and for capturing movement. A portrait, Black Pearls received first place in an oil painting competition and she was asked by a local merchant to create a line of hand-painted dresses. She left Hawaii in 1950 to complete commission work in Cuba and Florida and resettled in Florida in 1952, after sending a floral painting to Wesley House, the new Methodist student center at Iowa University. Later that year, Pelzer remarried on 25 July 1952. Her second husband was retired Major General George Arthur Lynch. After her marriage, Pelzer-Lynch continued to paint with the encouragement of her husband. When he died in 1962, she traveled to Hawaii, Mexico, Spain and attended international exhibitions including the Venice Biennale and documenta in Kassel. A retrospective of her works was held in 1969 at the Loch Haven Art Center of Orlando. Death and legacy Lynch died on April 24, 1985 in Orlando, Florida. She and her first husband's papers were donated to the State Historical Society of Iowa and the collection, Pelzer family papers spans the period from 1904-1962. An annual scholarship is awarded in her name in art, American history and music, through a fund Lynch established prior to her death and a graduate fellowship bearing her name is given to art scholars pursuing graduate level studies at the University of Iowa. In 1973, the Iowa State Bank and Trust company restored two of the murals and rehung them in the Longfellow School. In 1992, the four murals restored by Feddersen were donated to the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art. A biography, Historic Scenes by Mildred Pelzer 1934: The Pampered and Tragic Life of an Iowa City Artist by Bob Hibbs was published by the Johnson County Historical Society in 2009.

Nick is desperate to replace the books lost when Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) burnt his Aunt Marie's trailer, but doesn't have the money. The two Anubis Wesen arrive in Portland and kill Felix in his hotel room, where Nick and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) find a shipping slip which they follow to the killers; in a fit of rage, Monroe tears out their throats. Nick and Monroe find Felix's trunk and take it to the spice shop. In addition to detailed catalogs of Wesen, the books contain Grimm family trees, including Nick's ancestry. Monroe finds a secret compartment and, using his watchmaker skills, unlocks it. It contains three keys, and using these with the two keys Nick already had, they stamp together the five pieces of the Map of the Seven Knights, ancestors of the Grimm.

As if the clash of a populist monster conspiracy and a shadowy government agency weren't enough to drive the season, now there's the location of a treasure that could be anything up to and including the Ark of the Covenant. Yet despite everything else that‚Äôs going on, there's something about this introduction that feels like a jolt instead of a burden, the playing field suddenly expanded in the right way.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Alas, poor Felix. We hardly knew you! At least he got to be in arguably one of the strongest episodes of the season thus far ‚Äì Grimm Season 5 Episode 10 was straightforward and tightly-written, and the Case of the Week (RIP Felix!) served the long-term arc.

The show choosing to have one overarching story that connects each episode this season is really paying off. Every episode so far in season 5 has been incredibly engaging and memorable.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"Since its return from winter hiatus, Grimm has steadily redeemed itself for the sins of the early episodes of this season; returning to some of the show's dropped storylines and oldest mythology does well to connect the series' two dissonant tones. Just because the secret government mutant black-ops MIB terminator factory part of the universe is hilarious and awful doesn't mean it can't still be entertaining. If Grimm can maintain the balance between the stuff we actually care about and the stuff that makes us die inside, as shown in this week's episode, the series might (MIGHT) just return to being the Friday night highlight in my book. No promises though.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Yes it looks like the Grimm gang is finally off on a European adventure after they discover a series of mysterious links back to the old country. Well, the links are actually the long-forgotten keys from season one, now that the writers seem to have remembered they exist.

He had been the Provost's Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Central Florida since 2001. Since 2013, he had also been a Pegasus Professor there. He wrote 17 books and over 250 peer-reviewed papers. From 1978 until 2014, he was the editor-in-chief of the academic journal Social Science Research.  Education and career  Wright received his bachelor's degree from Purdue University and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1973, he joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor, where he remained until 1988, when he joined the faculty of Tulane University. In 2001, he left Tulane to join the sociology department at UCF as Distinguished Research Professor.  Research  Wright has researched several topics in the field of sociology, including poverty, homelessness, covenant marriage, and gun control. His assessment of numerous studies regarding gun ownership concluded that using a gun in self-defense increases the chances of harm to oneself, while also decreasing the chances that the user will be victimized by a criminal. In 1983, he collaborated with Peter Rossi and Kathleen Daly on a study underwritten by the National Institute of Justice which showed that about 1% of privately owned guns in the United States are used in crime; the study reported that the \\"benefits of stricter gun controls ... are at best uncertain, and at worst close to nil.\\" In 1986, he and Rossi published the book Armed and Considered Dangerous, which reported the results of a survey of 1,800 felons. They concluded, among other things, that handgun bans may be counterproductive, as criminals may switch to other, more dangerous weapons instead, and that criminals are more afraid of armed civilians than of being arrested by police. = Books & Monographs = * A Florida State of Mind: An Unnatural History of America's Weirdest State (St. Martin's Press, 2019) * Lost Souls: Manners and Morals in Contemporary American Society (Routledge, 2018) * Violence, Periodization and Definition of the Cultural Revolution: A Case Study of Two Deaths by the Red Guards (Brill, 2018, with Joshua Zhang) * Hunger in the Land of Plenty: A Critical Look at Food Insecurity (Lynne Rienner, 1018; with Amy M.

The episode was written by Sean Calder and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"And glory like the phoenix midst her fires, Exhales her odours, blazes, and expires.\\" Two young employees stay late at Harrison's Outfitters, when Damien Barso (Gideon Emery) uses a key to enter the building. He generates fire from his body and sets fire to the building. The two employees are trapped in the office and when they discover the fire, it is too late to escape. Nick, Hank and Wu are called in to investigate the deaths of the young folk. They meet John Harrison (John Murray), the owner of the store, and his son Andy (Hank Harris), whom John is grooming to take over the business, which has been in the family for three generations. Lt. Willis (Jessica Caesar), the arson investigator, draws their attention to the weird nature of the fire. It seemed to start with the breaker box, but instead of following the ventilation system, seemed to walk through the building, turning corners. The only time it behaved like a normal fire was when the young employees broke the window of the office in an attempt to escape, providing oxygen to the flames, which crisped them. Suspecting wesen involvement, Nick tasks Wu with looking for similar cases. He finds several and learns that they were being investigated by Bauerschwein arson investigator Lt. Peter Orson (Daniel Roebuck), whom Nick had put behind bars for murder in Season 1's fifth episode (The Three Bad Wolves). Visiting Orson in prison, Nick and Hank learn that Orson had actually seen the arsonist, but did not know his name. Orson convinces them to let him out (with tracking ankle bracelet) to help them. Adalind (Claire Coffee) is keen to visit Nick and Juliette to get her daughter back, but Prince Viktor (Alexis Denisof) counsels diplomacy. To illustrate his point, he introduces Adalind to Sam Damerov (Kenajuan Bentley), with whom Sean Reynard (Sasha Roiz) has entrusted the information that he has on Kelly Burkhardt's (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) whereabouts. Damerov reports the information to Viktor. Learning that the Harrison's business was facing Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Nick and Hank visit Charles Laney (Allen Galli), the Harrison's lawyer. After they have gone, Laney alerts Barso, telling him that the deaths of the young people has elevated the intensity of the investigation. He and Barso meet in Laney's car. Laney advises Barso to kill his client so that he cannot be identified. Barso responds by setting fire to Barso and steps out of the car, which explodes soon after. They learn that he is an excandesco through the trailer library, but the Grimm who wrote of an excandesco's role in the burning of Rome during Nero's reign was unsuccessful in his attempt to kill the excandesco responsible due to the extreme heat. Nick, Hank and Orson visit Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Munro (Silas Weir Mitchell) in the spice shop in the hope of finding a way to stop Barson. Munro is enraged by their bringing Orson with them, as Orson had killed his friend. Rosalee gets Munro to settle down, and he ultimately agrees to help. They decide that an ointment might be a way of stopping Barson. Rosalee and Munro set about making it in sufficient quantity. With Orson's help, Nick and Hank identify Barson and set about tracking him. In the meantime, we learn that Barso's last client was Andy Harrison, who does not want to take over a failing business from his father. Barso lures John Harrison to the burned store, pretending to be an arson investigator with news. When John Harrison turns up, he captures him and uses him as bait to get Andy to the store. Nick, Hank and Orson, on finding Laney's body, have decided that Barso is killing the people who can identify him. Rosalee and Munro have settled on large water guns as a means of delivering the ointment. Nick and Hank go to the Harrison house, thinking that John Harrison hired Barso and is therefore at risk, but they find Andy Harrison leaving to go to the store. He confesses that it was he, not his father, who engaged Barso and that it is he whom Barso wants to kill. Nick, Hank, Orson, Monroe and Rosalee, with Andy Harrison, converge on the store with the ointment-filled water guns. Orson volunteers to be bait to draw Barso away from John Harrison, whom Nick and Hank free. Then Barso, chasing Orson, exits the store to find himself surrounded. Unaware of the efficacy of their water guns, he woges to kill them, and they squirt the ointment over him, sealing him inside his own fire. He explodes. While this is happening, Adalind turns up at Nick and Juliette's house, and confronts Juliette. Juliette tells her to leave, but Adalind woges into her hexenbiest form. Juliette responds in kind, and the ensuing battle severely damages the furniture. Fearing for her life, Adalind flees and breaks down in her car. Nick comes home to find the mess and Juliette finally has the courage to show him that she is now a hexenbiest.

Many fans, myself included, have been very excited by the Juliette storyline, with her finally gaining fantastic new abilities that would allow her to not be a victim in every other episode.

If it's not the Wesen Council scaring your average Wesen straight, then it's other Wesen hunting their peers or upholding ancient blood feuds, and then, of course, there are the Royals. Not all Wesen are so obviously powerful as a Blutbad or as terrifying as a Hexenbiest; some Wesen are more easily preyed upon, and it's these Wesen, our Baurschwein and our bunny rabbits, that Grimm turns to when it wants to illustrate the injustices of Wesen society.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Grimm returned from yet another mid-season sabbatical to deal with the fallout of Nick's discovery that his girlfriend is a right witch.\\" References External links Grimm (season 4) episodes 2015 American television episodes ","title":"Bad Luck (Grimm)"},{"id":"53485399","text":"\\"Double Date\\" is the 15th episode of season 4 of the supernatural drama television series Grimm and the 81st episode overall, which premiered on March 27, 2015, on the cable network NBC.

While in other circumstances Nick might try to find some middle ground, here his approach is blunt force by way of a crossbow, loading Linus/Stacy up with enough testosterone to keep the latter repressed so the former can be convicted of the crime. It's a problematic point (or an 'ethically ambiguous, morally grey area-type situation' as Monroe puts it) but the ethics of the argument are almost entirely glossed over. Despite the excellent framing of the church stand-off and the clear sense of loss on Linus's face when he's unable to reconnect, everything is tied off too neatly and without enough acknowledgement of how they're essentially killing Stacy off. True, the fact that they're both willing participants in the crime makes Nick's actions justified, but there's a whole level of ramifications here that Grimm doesn't have either the time or interest to explore.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Well, that's the worst case of dissociative identity disorder I've ever seen.

The episode was written by Dan E. Fesman and was directed by Rob Bailey. Plot Opening quote: \\"How the silly frog does talk! He can be no companion to any human being!\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate the homicide of a cyclist named Zack found dead by a seemingly severe allergic reaction; they then meet an acquaintance of his, a 'Folterseele' (a golden/poison dart frog like wesen) named Bella Turner (Leah Renee) (inspired by the tale of The Frog Prince). According to Rosalee, Folterseele are a classically tragic - \\"always beautiful, always deadly\\" - type wesen, which are thankfully very rare as their skin secretes a highly poisonous deadly toxin poisonous touch which can kill, through no fault or intention of their own, with merely a single touch. They're also difficult to detect as they woge like no other Wesen, precipitated rather by sexual tension than emotion, usually via unwanted sexual advances. So, with help/advice from Rosalee & Monroe, Nick & Hank attempt to find a better solution rather than merely just locking her up. When a new member of the Royal family shows up in Portland, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) and Adalind (Claire Coffee) realize the Royal family have stepped up their efforts to find Diana. This new Royal, Kenneth, is certainly not one to be trifled with. When Adalind attempts to pass off her second pregnancy as of royal conception, soon realises Kenneth is not one so easily fooled. Renard's undercover double-agent Sam, on passing on unsatisfactory info, is also quickly thwarted and killed. A volatile Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), conflicted by her new Hexenbiest state, threatens Renard that he best find a solution as she wants her life back. When she finally returns home, regardless of Nick's pleading to the contrary, she informs him she's moving out; seemingly still holding Nick partly responsible for her unwanted predicament. Later she ponders whether to embrace her new self or attempt to get rid of it. Bella Turner is attacked at her work place by another man from the cycling group. He also dies from her poison. She goes to her mother's house and hides in the barn. Her mother finds her and tries to comfort her. Inside the house her grandmother is heating up a branding iron. The mother and grandmother fight over the branding iron. The grandmother knocks the mother out. Nick and Hank arrive just in time to save Bella from having her face burned by her grandmother. They take Bella to the spice shop and offer her their cure for her toxin warning her that they don't know if it will work or what side effects it will have. She says it is better than never being able to touch someone who loves you, and drinks the potion. When Renard finally meets Kenneth he finds he's more than met his match. He forcefully informs Renard he's been tasked with finding his daughter, then threatens Renard that if he doesn't join forces he'll end up like his late friend Damerov - and the King minus another son. The episode ends \\"3 weeks later‚Ä¶ at a nice restaurant somewhere in The Pearl.\\" At a table, two people we can't really see are on their first date. The man talks about how nervous he is. The camera pans up to reveal Bella with green bumpy skin. She asks if he's sure he isn't bothered by the way she looks.

It was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby), and Wu (Reggie Lee) are called to investigate a rare Wesen that leaves its victims dead from extreme hypothermia, frozen solid within just a matter of minutes. According to Rosalee they're called Varme Tyv (Norwegian for 'Heat Thief') - a Blue Racer (Coluber constrictor foxii) snake- like Wesen, which if/when away from their hibernacula during winter, can't survive without taking body heat from someone else. Since they lack the ability to create their own body heat, they too would freeze to death otherwise. Other sources of heat (such as fire or somesuch) would be useless for survival since their physiology can only process human body heat. If safely overwintered in their hibernacula, where they usually huddle for heat with their own kind, they're otherwise harmless, especially during summer or warm weather. Nick & co', after consequently finding further victims (three in all), they attempt to ascertain if they're after just one or more culprits. When they finally run down the main suspect to his hibernaculum, on attempting to disentangle him from the others, they inadvertently wake up the whole cluster of Varma Tyv, who had all been hibernating in a tangled, huddled heap in the centre of the heated underground cellar room. Startled out of hibernation, they defend themselves by attacking the intruding trio. Massively outnumbered, the trio attempt to flee back up and out. Just as they're about to be overpowered by the charging hoard, the now exposed and therefore increasingly incapacitated by the cold bunch, thankfully start to freeze before they can inflict much harm. Nick is however overcome with guilt, since according to their investigation only one of them was ever guilty of murder, Nick's unable to let the rest die when innocent of any crime. Nick decides they need to carry them all back inside, back into cozy hibernation, before they freeze to death. The guilty murderous one, however, is left to suffer the same fate he'd previously meted out to his victims. Meanwhile, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) starts to feel that she is losing her humanity and attempts to seek help from Rosalee & Monroe. Angered by the fact that Nick had already disclosed her 'secret-Hexenbiest-state' to Hank, she fiercely woges, shocking them all, then leaves in a huff. Instead now intent on seeking revenge against Adalind (Claire Coffee). She pursuits Adalind when she's out shopping and overcome with vengeful emotions, telekinetically attempts to dislodge a large stone gargoyle off the side of a building onto her head, in the hopes she's crushed beneath. Adalind's alert 'bodyguard/jailer' saves her just in the nick of time, but not before Adalind is able to get a glimpse of Juliette reflected in the window before her. Now aware Juliette means to kill her and fearing for her life, she later begs new Royal Kenneth to avenge her before Juliette is able to strike again. Kenneth refuses, insisting they can instead use the situation to their advantage. Elsewhere, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) continues to suffer from mysterious bleeding and disturbing visions - where large disembodied black-taloned, red daemon-like claws, clutch at him; leaving him shaken and confused as he collapses.

Puerto Ricans were gathered in the streets, celebrating after a parade downtown.\\"Neighborhood fight ; Activists push to keep Puerto Rican pride alive in Humboldt Park\\". Chicago Tribune. June 12, 2006 ‚Äì via Proquest. The celebration was in honor of St. John the Baptist, after whom San Juan, Puerto Rico is named. In 1966, the parade for this celebration was officially renamed the Puerto Rican Parade. After a white police officer shot and wounded a young Puerto Rican man, a riot began and continued for three days, in spite of police efforts. The riot signified the difficult conditions Puerto Ricans faced in Chicago, including high unemployment, low income, racial discrimination, poor housing, and inadequate education.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. pp. 145‚Äì147. In the aftermath of the riot, new community organizations and community leaders more actively engaged in city politics to work to improve conditions for Puerto Ricans in Chicago.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 155. According to a University of Chicago study, in the years following the 1966 riot, Puerto Ricans ranked police relations as their second biggest problem after unemployment. Although community members spent a decade working for better conditions, in 1977, Puerto Ricans in Chicago still faced myriad issues. They experienced displacement, housing discrimination, racism, unemployment, poor housing, poverty, and police brutality.Fernandez, Lilia. Brown in the Windy City. University of Chicago Press, 2012. p. 134. = FALN bombing = On June 4, 1977, several hours before the Humboldt Park riot, a bomb went off on the fifth floor of the Cook County Building, outside the offices of acting Mayor Michael Bilandic and George Dunne, the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. No one was harmed, but the blast blew out windows and caused $6,000 in damages. FALN, a separatist group for Puerto Rican independence, claimed credit via a phone call to radio station WBBM-FM. The following year, the committee in charge of the Puerto Rican Parade moved the parade date to June 24 to avoid possible associations between June 4 bombings and the parade.  Riot  The details of the beginning of the riot are disputed. It began in Humboldt Park on June 4, 1977, after the Puerto Rican Day Parade. The festivities are misattributed in some print news as a celebration for \\"Puerto Rican Independence Day\\". Violence began around 6 o'clock in the evening and lasted until around midnight. The riot began in Humboldt Park itself, near the intersection of Division Street and California Avenue. According to the police, the violence began with gang-related shooting in the park. Police Superintendent James M. Rochford issued a nine-page report on June 14, 1977, which declared that seven other people in the park were hurt by gang gunfire before the police began shooting. The gangs in question were the rival Puerto Rican street gangs the Latin Kings and the Spanish Cobras. Sergeant Thomas Walton shot and killed Julio Osorio, 26. Rafael Cruz, 25, was also killed by a bullet from Sgt. Walton's gun. Preliminary autopsy reports showed both Osorio and Cruz were shot in the back. The family of Rafael Cruz recounted that Cruz came to Humboldt Park with his mother and brother, where they walked arm in arm. Later, Cruz was running out of the park, to a car where his niece was waiting, when police shot him in the back. According to the Chicago Tribune, on late Saturday afternoon, police arrived to Humboldt Park to break up gang- related fighting. When police were arresting one of the combatants, the young man resisted, and \\"picnickers became angry and began hurling objects.\\" The New York Times printed that following the shooting of Osorio and Cruz, the police tried to close the park and \\"were met with a barrage of bricks, bottles, stones, sticks and chairs, but Hispanic witnesses charged that policemen stormed the park with nightsticks and attacked many picnickers, including families with children.\\" The account continues to state that the riot escalated because police were outnumbered (Chicago police officers were stationed in large numbers at Soldier Field for a rock concert that day). Another account describes police arriving to respond to reports of gang activity in part of Humboldt Park, to find a park full of Spanish-speaking people congregating. The presence of police, and perhaps some provocation by police, started the riot. During the first day of the riot, two people were killed (Osorio and Cruz), approximately 3,000 people were involved, 116 people were injured, 119 were arrested, and 38 police officers and 3 firefighters were injured. Rioters threw rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails. The police department reported that 17 police cars and trucks were damaged during the riot. One police officer was seen setting fire to a fallen Puerto Rican flag, waving the burning flag, and stepping on it.\\"1977 Division Street Riots\\", Que Ondee Sola. Vol. 35 No. 4, April‚ÄìMay 2007. Northeastern Illinois University. via Harold Washington Library Special Collections. p. 4. Acting Mayor Bilandic came to Humboldt Park and the riot area for about 15 minutes after the violence died down, late Saturday night. Police helicopters hovered over the Division Street area during the riot. Approximately 200 police officers in riot gear, some on horseback, worked to clear the streets. However, as soon as the police moved on to another area, the crowd would return. On Sunday morning, police set up a command post in the park as firefighters and public works crews cleaned the area. The buildup of police and the activity drew a crowd of hundreds of people, mostly young. Minor vandalism and looting began in the afternoon, and police asked bars and businesses to close. Rioters threw rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails for the second night in a row. Official cleanup of the park began on Monday, and three civilian cars were removed from the lagoon. = Car chase with the police = During the riot on Sunday night, 23-year-old Luis Velasquez ran down police Sergeant William Diaz. Velasquez drove off, and engaged in a chase with the police that reached speeds of 80 m.p.h. Velasquez was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder, aggravated battery, reckless driving, resisting arrest, and possession of controlled substances. = Fires = According to a witness, by evening, the police closed off the streets surrounding Division and California. People ran through this area to avoid confrontation with the police. Others were scared, as a building fires burned, while the fire department did not respond or work to control the blaze. Official accounts explain that firefighters were not sent in to control the fires because the police could not guarantee their safety. These fires left 15 families homeless. Four days after the riot, the body of Domingo Torres Claudio, 62, was found in the rubble of the grocery store below the apartment where he lived. On Saturday night, rioters looted the grocery store, then started a fire. When the fire department came, rioters shot at the firefighters. The building burned while the police and fire departments regrouped. Claudio was a retired factory worker and lived alone.  Aftermath  The police response to the riot constituted much of the controversy in its aftermath. Following the 1968 Chicago riots, John S. Boyle, Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, handed down orders for \\"mass arrests\\", when 50 or more people are arrested at one incident. Although these orders were still in place, and over 100 people were arrested on the night of June 4, mass arrest protocol was not followed. As a result, there were no interpreters, the people arrested at the riot were unable to contact their families, get medical attention, or meet with attorneys one-on-one. Some community members reported that some of those arrested were held overnight in police vehicles. Nearly half of those arrested on the first night still had not made bond by the time of their hearings. The Cook County Special Bail Project Inc., a local group that helped disadvantaged defendants obtain release from jail on bail, prepared a report that charged that the failure of police to call for mass arrest procedures constituted a violation of rights. The chief of the Chicago Police Department's patrol division, John McInerney, said that he made a judgement to not call for a mass arrest court, because he felt the defendants from the riot could be processed normally. Processing the arrests took between 13 and 19 hours to complete. After the riot, police Superintendent Rochford issued a gag order, preventing police officers from discussing the events in Humboldt Park.Humboldt pk.troubled 'island' without clout. (June 12, 1977). Chicago Tribune ‚Äì via Proquest. Members of neighborhood gangs complained of police harassment after the riot. The increased, confrontational policing maintained the tense conditions that led to the riot. Some records show that more Puerto Ricans were being arrested after the weekend of June 4. A week after the riot, to protest against police harassment, Puerto Rican community members held a march from the riot area to the Daley Center, where they held a rally. About 300 people marched, and Maria Cruz, sister of the late Rafael Cruz, and Jenny Osorio, sister of the late Julio Osorio, both spoke at the rally. In the week following the riot, community members of Humboldt Park met with mayor Bilandic to discuss the weekend's riot. After waiting three hours, the Humboldt Park residents had 20 minutes with the mayor. Puerto Rican community leaders also met with Chicago police officials and Department of Human Services officials for two hours, and expressed their concerns about the community. The city government's only direct response to the riot was a grant of $471,000 to fund community service jobs. Mayor Bilandic appointed deputy commissioner Hugh Osborne and Deputy Police Superintendent Samuel Nolan to represent the city in meetings with Latino community groups, following the riots. Osborne and Nolan fielded the concerns and demands of Puerto Rican community leaders on behalf of the city. Among these demands were more summer jobs in the West Town community, which were initially cut back in the budget. On July 25, 1979, U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Sullivan announced that no police officers would be prosecuted for the shootings of Osorio and Cruz. After a two-year investigation, Sullivan said that there was not sufficient evidence to establish \\"willful intent\\" in the shootings. A federal grand jury was convened, but no indictments were sought. The families of the men killed filed civil damage suits against the policemen involved. While the 1966 Division Street riots were seen as a turning point in Puerto Rican community action, according to community leader Rev. Jorge Morales, the Humboldt Park riot made the community more apathetic about civic involvement. The increased media attention and coverage of Puerto Rican community issues following the riot did not result in changes or improvements. Michael Rodr√≠guez Mu√±iz, on the other hand, argued years later that the aftermath of the riot created \\"a radical consciousness\\" among Puerto Ricans in Chicago.

The episode was written by Brenna Kouf from a story by the series co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and was directed by Aaron Lipstadt. In the episode, Nick and Eve struggle to fight against Zerst√∂rer, who is also wanting to leave the other place and go to the real world to retrieve Diana for his own purposes. For her own protection, Adalind and Renard take her to the house where Nick had his first Grimm case but there are consequences along the way. The episode is the conclusion of a two-parter with the previous episode as the first part. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised the Zerst√∂rer's performance in the episode but some found the pace to be slowed down. Plot Opening quote: \\"You shall break them with a rod.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli), Wu (Reggie Lee), and Hank (Russell Hornsby) search for Zerst√∂rer (\\"Destroyer\\" in German) when he arrives in Portland. Diana (Hannah R. Loyd) hides with Kelly in the cabin in the woods from \\"Pilot\\" under Adalind (Claire Coffee) and Renard's (Sasha Roiz) protection. Trubel (Jacqueline Toboni) arrives, having finished dismantling the criminal Wesen organization Black Claw for good. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), Rosalee (Bree Turner), and Eve (Bitsie Tulloch) deduce that the stick is actually a long-hidden shard of wood from Zerst√∂rer's powerful staff. When Zerst√∂rer attacks the precinct, Wu and Hank are fatally injured, and Nick is overpowered. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 4.14 million people, earning a 0.8/3 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Dr. Ken, Dateline NBC, Last Man Standing, and an NCAA Tournament. This was a 4% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.96 million viewers with a 0.8/3. This means that 0.8 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Zerst√∂rer Shrugged\\" received positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"While I still think it would have been interesting to see more of Zerst√∂rer and the Other Place throughout the season, 'Zerst√∂rer Shrugged' does a lot to make the Destroyer live up to his reputation. His entrance heralded by a flock of dead bats, diving through a mirror in Olympic style, human beings swatted away as if they were less than said bats, a flood of terrifying analogies in the Grimm diaries, Diana genuinely terrified for the first time in her young life: the sense of dread and impossible odds builds well over the episode‚Äôs run time.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic was more critical of the episode, giving it a 1.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"It was understandable in the sense that the series is at an end, drama, loss, high stakes, and so on, but it just felt so sudden and pointless due to the lack of intelligent behavior earlier in the episode. Of course, it would've made for a completely different story if Nick just drove off, leaving Zerst√∂rer hiking after him. (It's not like Mr. Skullface can drive, right?)\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"Going into the finale, we now know the final battle‚Äôs going to involve Zerst√∂rer going after the stick and/or Diana and/or Kelly, and Nick definitely had incentive to protect all three.

It pretty much put everything into place for the series finale. Zerst√∂rer has been established as really really tough, because a) he's even more bulletproof than he was last week, and b) he kills two Team Grimmers. We learn that he not only wants Diana but Kelly. Although again, not with any foreshadowing or lead-in, but just having Diana having a prophetic dream. What's the point of featuring lots of page flipping if it doesn't find basic plots like 'Devil's Child Bride's Brother is Also Important.'\\" References External links 2017 American television episodes Grimm (season 6) episodes ","title":"Zerst√∂rer Shrugged"},{"id":"53485860","text":"Increase is a male given name.

The episode was written by series co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and was directed by Greenwalt. The show centers on Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a Portland Police Department homicide detective who discovers that he is the last descendant of a group of guardians named \\"Grimms\\" who had to protect the world from a group of Wesen, mythical creatures which only the Grimms can see. He is aided by his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) and a Wesen named Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) to solve cases related to the Wesen and stop them from causing an uprising in the human world. Throughout the course of the show, Nick has faced terrorist Wesen organizations such as the Verrat, the Royal Family, the Wesenrein and Black Claw which sought to invoke a greater power of Wesen over humans on Earth. His fight against the Wesen has also caused consequences to his life. In the final episode, Nick along with his friends seeks to destroy Zerst√∂rer, who plans on taking Diana and Kelly for his purposes. The finale received a mostly positive reception from both critics and fans who praised the conclusion of the storylines and David Giuntoli's performance in the episode. While some thought the finale was rushed, they concluded that the series got a \\"satisfying\\" ending to the show. Plot Opening quote: \\"Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) regains consciousness and finds Zerst√∂rer gone. He tries to revive Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Wu (Reggie Lee) with the stick but it doesn't work. Trubel (Jacqueline Toboni) arrives and finds the precinct filled with dead officers. Deducing that bullets cannot work, they decide they have to cut his head in order to kill him permanently. He warns Adalind (Claire Coffee) and Renard (Sasha Roiz) about it but they tell him that Zerst√∂rer not only wants Diana (Hannah R. Loyd), he also wants Kelly. Nick leaves but sends Trubel to the cabin to protect them. Meanwhile, in the spice shop, Eve (Bitsie Tulloch), Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) do research to find a way to kill Zerst√∂rer. They find that \\"one's blood\\" may be enough to kill him and Rosalee begins developing a potion named \\"Force Du Sang\\", requiring the blood of three opposed forces: a Grimm, a Wesen and a Hexenbiest. Nick arrives at the spice shop to inform them of Hank's and Wu's deaths. After Monroe and Rosalee leave for the cabin, Nick and Eve are attacked by Zerst√∂rer (Wil Traval), who uses his staff to make Eve stab herself, killing her. Zerst√∂rer disappears before Nick suffers a breakdown. Nick eventually arrives at the cabin where he, Adalind and Monroe put their blood in a bowl for the potion. Diana appears and announces that Zerst√∂rer will arrive as Nick's stick reveals his location, intending to retrieve it. Zerst√∂rer arrives and Diana willingly goes with him. Renard attacks him but he's no match for Zerst√∂rer, who stabs him in the heart with the staff, killing him. Monroe throws the potion on Zerst√∂rer, making him suffer a breakdown but the effects soon disappear, finding that there's nothing that can kill it. Adalind tries to kill him with an ax but he takes it and kills her with a slash to the chest. He then has his staff shift into a snake that bites Rosalee and Monroe, killing them too. Zerst√∂rer leaves, leaving Nick to cope with his losses. He uses his staff to strangle Trubel before Nick arrives. Zerst√∂rer states that he only needs the stick and in exchange for the stick, he will bring back those who died, proving it by resurrecting Trubel. Nick decides to give him the stick but Trubel takes it and runs into the woods. Nick intercepts her and they get into a fight until Nick beats her and takes the stick. He is then haunted by voices inside his head until his mother Kelly (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and Aunt Marie (Kate Burton) appear. Against his wishes, both of them stop Nick from going and inform him that what he needs is his ancestors' strength to battle Zerst√∂rer. Nick, Kelly, Trubel and Marie then join and attack Zerst√∂rer, managing to cut one of his arms. Nick then takes the staff, which unites itself with the stick and stabs Zerst√∂rer in the chest, effectively killing him. Kelly and Marie explain that they are all descendants from the First Grimm and disappear (confirming that this was all in Nick's head). However, Diana appears and reveals that she managed to see Kelly and Marie. Just then, Zerst√∂rer's body disintegrates and his remains create a portal and begins to suck the staff within. Nick refuses to let go of the staff and is sucked into the portal. Nick is hurled into the scene where he and Eve returned from the Other Place in Monroe's house with everybody alive. Diana then tells Nick that Zerst√∂rer is dead and as such, they are all safe. After greeting everyone, they discover that the staff also passed through the portal. A narration reveals that Nick did not know what to say and Zerst√∂rer never entered the world. 20 years later, in a modernized trailer, a person narrates how Nick managed to defeat him with his blood, and the ones from Kelly, Marie and Trubel, who is also revealed to be his third cousin on his mother's side. He concludes by saying, \\"Some will say it's just a myth, legend or fairy tale but I know it's true because my father told me so\\", revealing to be a grown-up Kelly Burkhardt (Kevin Joy). He is then joined by a grown-up Diana (Nicole Steinwedell), who grabs the Zerst√∂rer's staff and tells him to get ready to hunt Wesen with their parents as well as Monroe's and Rosalee's triplets. While Kelly leaves, Diana stares for a minute on the Grimm diaries before showing her purple eyes. This causes the book to close with its cover showing a big \\"G\\". The series ends with the words, \\"The End\\" followed by \\"Thank You\\" translated in many languages. Production =Development= On April 5, 2016, Grimm was renewed for a sixth season by NBC, despite decreasing ratings and being \\"on the bubble\\" for 2 months. However, a few weeks later, the network announced that the season would be cut from its usual 22 episodes format to just 13 episodes with possible midseason premiere although the network have commented that they have the option to increase the number of episodes. Later, when NBC unveiled its fall schedule for the 2016-17 television schedule, Grimm was given the 9:00 p.m. at Fridays timeslot but no premiere date was announced. This, along with the continuing decreasing ratings of the second half of the fifth season prompted analysts to question if the sixth season could be its last although co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf have stated that they weren't sure if the season would be its last. Finally, on August 29, 2016, NBC officially announced that the sixth season would be the last of the series and that the premiere date would be at January 6, 2017 an hour earlier than the given 9:00 p.m. timeslot with uninterrupted episodes and the finale set to be broadcast on March 31, 2017. The writers commented on the final season, \\"The fact that we got this concept going and we were able to actually explore all these psychological motivations dealing with history, mythology and fairy tales and dealing with religion and belief and all those things that you can't do on a regular show, and just have it come full circle, which you'll see in the end of the season, I think that's the most satisfying thing. Somehow we just kind of pulled it off for a whole 123 episodes with an arc that makes sense.\\" On December 2016, it was revealed on a tweet that the final episode would be titled, \\"The End\\" and would be written by series co-creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and directed by Greenwalt. =Writing= Before the sixth season was announced, Giuntoli expressed his hopes for the finale, \\"If we get a Season 6, it could very well be our last season, and it will be the first time that the writers would get to write to an ending. If we do, it'll be a very fun ride, with major events.\\" David Giuntoli said that the finale \\"will be a satisfying ending for fans.\\" Giuntoli claimed that the series finale \\"Was a satisfying ending to read. I think it will be a satisfying ending for fans.\\" Giuntoli also added that the finale would feature a time jump. For her part, Bitsie Tulloch mentioned that the themes of the finale were \\"Family, loyalty, revenge, forgiveness. Because it's the final season you see many loose ends being tied up.\\" She also added that \\"I think people will like the way it ends. It's a mostly happy ending (it can't be completely happy  it is Grimm after all). There are a few things that are slightly open-ended, so it feels like everyone wins.\\" Co-creators Greenwalt and Kouf discussed that they wrote everyone's deaths to show Nick at his worst moment, \\"That's the logic of it. Because if you're fighting great evil and great evil wants something that is going to destroy the world and he's got to convince you that it's worth it to give this to him so he can destroy the world, you've got to take a lot away from [Nick].\\" They also explained, \\"And Nick was ready to make that Devil's bargain, too, to have his loved ones back, until he had a somewhat supernatural experience of the strength of his blood and his ancestors who came before him, and then naturally who would come after him. I mean, just imagine if we had just killed everybody and he just walks off to the drug store! Everyone would have had a big fit.\\" They also explained, \\"The point was not to have a lethal ending or a happily-ever-after ending, the point was to take Nick to the lowest possible point he could be, where he thought he could not possibly dig any deeper inside. And he was willing to give up the world so that he could have his loved ones, as anyone would do in that position. But then kind of mystically, and kind of not mystically, his ancestors appeared to him, and he found a deeper strength than he even knew he had. And that was really the theme, his deepening purpose as a post-modern Grimm.\\" They also added that they were planning on bringing more previous cast members, among them Danny Bruno as Bud Wurstner but time constraints forced them to stop it from happening. The surprise addition of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Kate Burton was easy to get and they were given two days to film their scenes. However, a snowstorm in Portland delayed the production five days and left the actresses with just one day to film the scenes. About the time jump 20 years later, Greenwalt and Kouf stated that everyone is \\"all just one big, happy family, fighting evil monsters\\" with Trubel \\"definitely out there.\\" Greenwalt said, \\"That's the big question: what did happen to Diana and Kelly? And we also always had the image of the book itself closing, and that being the final image, except for saying 'thank you' to the fans. Then to go not only full circle in terms of a myth/legend/fairy tale but actually go out to the future and have a guy say, 'What you've been seeing is all true. I know it happened because my father told me,' that always struck me as really strong, kind of an oral history and written history of these kinds of tales.\\" Regarding a spin-off or anything related to the scenes, Kouf said, \\"We always thought it was a fairytale ending, and fairytales don't seem to end. They don't go away, they're always with us and they keep going on, so what a perfect way to end this type of series with a new beginning.\\" Regarding the fans' efforts to save the show through many petitions on Change.org, Kouf commented \\"I think the fans are fantastic for doing that. It just shows you how much they love the show. I think it's great, who knows what'll happen, but it's hard to consider something that nobody has put in front of us.\\" Greenwalt, for his part, said, \\"We so appreciate the broad reach of this kind of storytelling. There's something universal about all of this worldwide, and we're so grateful that people connected with the show, and we thank them for that because without that we wouldn't be doing it. He also said, \\"you never know.\\" Reception =Viewers= =Critical reviews= \\"The End\\" received positive reviews. Terri Schwartz from IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.0 rating out of 10 and wrote in her verdict, \\"Grimm offered up a satisfying series finale that successfully brought the show to a close. Nick's journey as a Grimm felt like it was given its proper due, and the episode both had stakes while also delivering a happy ending. The jump forward in time at the end was particularly successful, promising that the fairy tale continues on even if we aren't watching it.\\" Les Chappell from The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\" rating and wrote, \\"'The End' is a series finale that definitely has that mood of a last go-around to it, the feeling that there's nothing to be gained by holding back. A literal devil walking the earth for ultimate power, a nigh nuclear poison to be brewed that takes all their combined talents, and the intervention of Grimms from beyond the grave ‚Äî all of it is on display here. Even though there are some quibbles, they're quibbles that are as much a part of the Grimm experience as the witticisms and monsters.\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"'Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.' These words open the final episode of the little fairy tale show that could. And at first, they seem cruelly ironic, as nothing about the Zerst√∂rer's staff is a comfort to Nick, who endures losses that almost break him. Thankfully, that comfort isn't an empty promise, and Grimm closes its six-season run with a reminder that it's the people we love who give us our strength.\\" Kevin Yeoman from Screen Rant, wrote, \\"There's an It's A Wonderful Life quality to Grimms final few moments (before an obligatory time jump reveals that Nick's son Kelly and Diana are carrying on the family tradition 20 years in the future) that brings everyone back to life, but robs the finale of some of its dramatic power. But while wiping out nearly every character on the show would have been a memorably bleak way to end things, Grimm seeks to imbue the finale with emotional weight by applying the tried and true formula of the importance of family. Whether or not that undercuts what was building up to be a remarkably violent and somber end will likely depend on how much mileage you get from the idea of ghosts returning to help the living in their time of need. In the end, it works as an appropriate narrative loophole affording the series the chance to reminisce about its television journey while also playing with (though not fully committing to) the idea of truly bringing things to an end. With that, Grimm signs off for the last time.\\" Kevin Yeoman from Oregon Live, wrote, \\"As 'Grimm' reminded us, before Walt Disney and other family friendly folk got their hands on the Brothers Grimm stories, they were often as dark as the Black Forest, with monsters preying on innocent victims, until the happy ending  we hoped  restored order. It was fitting, then, that the 'Grimm' series finale, appropriately titled 'The End,' sent Nick through a nightmarish journey, before closing the book with an ending that evoked both fairy tales and the show's own mythology.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic was more critical of the finale, giving it a 2.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Not. Gonna. Stick. The whole plotline with Zerst√∂rer annoyed me from the outset, but as I noted in the review for Grimm Season 6 Episode 12, it was really the stupid choices made by normally-intelligent characters that galled me the most. This time around, we not only got poor decision-making skills but also some of the most head-scratching moments of deus ex machina I've seen the entire series!\\" =Accolades= TVLine named Giuntoli the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of April 1, 2017, for his performance in the finale. The site wrote, \\"'The End' is a fitting finish for NBC's fairytale series, and Giuntoli's performance is a crowning glory for his time on the show.\\" References External links 2017 American television episodes Grimm (season 6) episodes American television series finales ","title":"The End (Grimm)"},{"id":"53485920","text":"Lucien Theodore De Roeck (9 March 1915 in Dendermonde ‚Äì 5 March 2002 in Elsene) was a Belgian drawing artist, type designer, typographer and graphic designer. He is best known for the design of Expo 58, the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  Early Life and Interests  Lucien De Roeck was born in Dendermonde. When he was 5, the family moved to Elsene, near Brussels. De Roeck was born to draw. From his earliest memories on he remembered himself drawing. He always had a sketchbook and a pencil on hand. For the rest of his life, De Roeck drew at least 10 minutes every day. All of his sketches and drawings have been captured in over 400 sketchbooks. Dendermonde is situated next to the river the Scheldt. From a very young age until his death he was fascinated by the stream and had a special connection with it. He spent a lot of his time watching and drawing the boats on the Scheldt. The port of Antwerp, located next to the Scheldt, was a great subject of his drawings as well. When De Roeck was 15, he started being more serious about drawing. The place where you could find him drawing the most was on the tram on his way to school where he documented the passengers. At that time, he decided to take evening classes in drawing.  Education  At the age of 17, in 1932, De Roeck enrolled in La Cambre which is a notorious art school in Brussels. They had a very modernist way of teaching inspired by Bauhaus. His teachers of the evening classes had a liberal approach. This made De Roeck opt for the rather socialist and progressive La Cambre, unlike his traditional Flemish education in high school. De Roeck had a strong affinity for architecture, but due to limited financial possibilities he chose to study the shorter program Advertising Design. This separate program was exclusive at La Cambre, it wasn't taught at Bauhaus. He had the atelier Advertising Design by Joris Minne. Nand Geersen instructed the course Book Design. He graduated with great honors in 1935 and thought this grade was too high, which showed his great modesty. The modernist mind-set of La Cambre was brought by Henry van de Velde, the headmaster at that time. He set the example for De Roeck. Van de Velde taught him to simplify the complexity of a subject by reducing and erasing redundant elements and only keeping the essential. De Roeck lived by this idea of a versatile synthesis guided by a clear opinion. Keeping your curiosity was also taught by van de Velde and De Roeck admired this quality. The knowledge and minds-set he learned in La Cambre, he would later transfer to his future students. As well as the idea that learning is endeavoring, editing and critically reviewing. After serving his military service in 1935 he took an extra year to experiment with typography at La Cambre as well. In 1939 De Roeck decided to take a course in calligraphy at the London Royal College of Art. This ended abruptly. He was called for duty in May 1940 to fight the Battle of the Lys.  Career  In 1935, De Roeck and his fellow students were asked by the mayor of Antwerp Camille Huysmans to design a poster which would serve as an advertisement for Antwerp. For sketching he went back to his beloved Scheldt to draw the small boats and huge ships. The iconography and composition of the final poster had influences from A.M Cassandre and Leo Marfurt. De Roeck won the assignment and over 10.000 copies were made. There was a second edition in 1936. After, a second design brief was assigned to the class. This time it was to promote the ferry connection Ostend-Dover. De Roeck wonoas the best design for this assignment. In 1941 there was a lawsuit in which De Roeck was accused of the illicit use of the font Peignot designed by Cassandre in his poster for an international dance contest. This incident made Lucien focus more on the specialization of letter shapes. He had already developed a strong affinity for type design in the 1930s. Specialization would guarantee De Roeck security and avoid future similar incidents. The first big assignment he had after his studies and military service, was in 1937 by Yves Denis, the director of the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels. De Roeck was asked to do the lay-out of their newspaper they published every month, the Journal des Beaux-Arts. In 1941 De Roeck pursued teaching which turned out to be his second nature after drawing. He started teaching typography at La Cambre. Later in Ecole des Filles de Marie (later Sint-Lucas paviljoen and now Karel de Grote-Hogeschool) in Antwerp, the provincial college in Saint-Ghislain and evening schools and Brussels as well. It wasn't until 1980 that De Roeck decided to retire. After his retirement he spent an extra year at La Cambre to do an unpaid internship in teaching. Students of his are amongst others Pierre Alechinsky, Michel Olyff and Jean- Michel Folon. De Roeck became in 1946 a staff member of the Book Museum in Brussels. He organized exhibitions about typography and book printing. In 1969 he became a member of ATypI and in 1958 he took part for the first time in the L‚Äôassociation des Rencontres internationales de Lure. = Wartime = During the Battle of the Lys, De Roeck kept an autobiographical sketchbook. He fought back with drawings. These are a series of cubist drawings with elements such as soldiers, airplanes and explosions which summed up what he had experienced. Afterwards he was taken to a German detention camp and was freed end 1940. As much as he wanted to make a name for his himself after he graduated, the circumstances weren't good. Because of the war, designing wasn't always possible. This was a major setback for the beginning career of De Roeck. He had to earn money as a house painter. When he had a commission, usually for posters, the design was frugal. He used simple typography and little color. He would also design infographics for the Belgian newspapers with information on the movements of the Allied armies. Paper was scares during wartime, which forced De Roeck to take other surfaces to draw on. He had to settle for smaller pieces of paper, a piece of tablecloth or found cardboard. All of this was still enough to satisfy his craving for drawing. = Freedom of the Press = After the Second World War ended, the press got its freedom back. This resulted in the flourishing of the Belgian press. From 1944 De Roeck designed for La Lanterne. He provided a revival of Le Phare with his talents as typographer and illustrator and launched their new Sunday magazine. He also designed for La Cit√© and Le Quotidian. For the paper Pan he reviewed theatre plays in images. The narration would adapt to the overall feel of the plays. = Expo 58 = De Roeck experienced the peak of his career during the 1950s. In 1954 he won the design competition for the poster of the World Fair of 1958. He used an asymmetrical star in the center of the design, combined with a globe in the right upper corner. The star has the city hall of Brussels in the middle. The five points stand for the visitors of the 5 continents Brussels would welcome, as well as the number of decennia Congo was a colony of Belgium. The typography exists of ‚ÄòBrussels‚Äô and ‚Äò58‚Äô and the colors used are blue and green which suggest heaven and earth. In the expo itself, De Roeck enlarged the star and built luminescent 3D versions, used to decorate a footbridge with a view over several pavilions. De Roeck received in 1960 an honorary badge as knight for the realization and success of Expo 58 from the Order of Leopold II. In 1966 he got one from the Order of Leopold. = After the 1950s = In the 1960s the International Typographic Style advanced and from 1980 the digital revolution took off. This all didn't have much grip on De Roeck. He renewed himself but remained true to his own style.  Work Process and Aesthetics  At the start of designing a poster, the sketching phase was the most important. De Roeck developed an idea which was sometimes better than the final product. He occasionally complained to his students that when he showed designs to his clients, they would have remarks on the composition or color. They often wanted details from one sketch combined with another and this led to half-hearted design he said. For his earliest posters, created in the thirties, he used the diagonal axis of view, typical for the idiom of that time. He also created a dynamic rhythm between text and image. He pleaded for a direct approach, a clear transmission of language on a subject that looked simple at first sight. In order to reach this, the only way was to analyze the basic elements that gave the outcome the most suitable look. The function determined the form, but he combined this with elegance. He never got rid of these ideas. Because De Roeck had a great fondness for architecture, he worked with high precision. This was convenient when designing plans, decors and scale models. De Roeck worked in 1959 on a mobile panorama sight of Brussels in perspective and relief, commissioned by the Commissariat of Tourism. He painted large pieces of fabric with the images of Brussels buildings.  Personal life  Lucien De Roeck married in 1941 to Adrienne van Emden. She studied at La Cambre as well and had a degree in weaving. His daughter Anne and his son Michel were born in 1944 and 1945. As a family they moved a few times, but stayed within the city of Elsene. As an homage to his children he would sometimes use their names as his pseudonym. Under the pseudonym Luc Doek, De Roeck made a comic named Jef Klawieter. Later, influenced by Jij√©, who he met in La Cambre, he drew Gibou. But soon after de Roeck realized that comic books aren't something for him, he had a more spontaneous way of sketching and drawing. He was friends with other comic artists Herg√©, Edgar P. Jacobs and Andr√© Franquin and made intimate portraits of them. He had the rare ability of capturing the fleeting of a model. Sometimes he wouldn't even lift his pencil from the paper. For New Year's he sent them greeting cards decorated with lyrical typography. At his death the Fonds Lucien De Roeck was created as an archive of his work.

An osteolytic lesion (from the Greek words for \\"bone\\" (·ΩÄœÉœÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ), and \\"to unbind\\" (ŒªœçŒµŒπŒΩ)) is a softened section of a patient's bone formed as a symptom of specific diseases, including breast cancer and multiple myeloma. This softened area appears as a hole on X-ray scans due to decreased bone density, although many other diseases are associated with this symptom. Osteolytic lesions can cause pain, increased risk of bone fracture, and spinal cord compression. These lesions can be treated using biophosphonates or radiation, though new solutions are being tested in clinical trials. Cellular causes Bone lesions are caused by an imbalance of regulatory factors, characterized by an increased depletion and resorption of old bone tissue and a decrease in bone rebuilding, known as bone remodeling. This imbalance is due to a flooding of regulatory factors released by specific tumors, thus overwhelming the tissue repair system and resulting in these lesions. The over-activity of osteoclasts can also cause hypercalcemia, which can cause damage to the kidneys and requires additional medication and monitoring. In multiple myeloma, an increased number of myeloma cells block osteoblasts from creating new bone, while these cancerous cells also release factors that cause an upregulation on osteoclasts, causing an increasing in bone tissue resorption and an overall breakdown of bone integrity. This breakdown often begins in the bone marrow near tumor sites and spreads outward to the surface of the implicated bone. The most common cancers that metastasize to form osteolytic lesions are thyroid, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal, malignant melanoma and breast, though any cancer can cause bone lesions. Lesions are most often found in larger bones, such as the skull, pelvis, radius, and femur. Potential treatments =Biophosphonates= Biophosphonates are drugs that are used to prevent bone mass loss and are often used to treat osteolytic lesions. Zoledronic acid (Reclast) is a specific drug given to cancer patients to prevent the worsening of bone lesions and has been reported to have anti-tumor effects as well. Zoledronic acid has been clinically tested in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D to encourage bone health. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment RANKl inhibitor that targets the osteocyte apoptosis regualtory RANKL gene, is also prescribed to prevent bone metastases and bone lesions. Most biophosphonates are co-prescribed with disease-specific treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation for cancer patients. =Radiation= Bone lesions in multiple myeloma patients may be treated with low-dose radiation therapy in order to reduce pain and other symptoms. Used in combination with immunochemotherapy, radiation therapy can be used to treat certain cancers when aimed at areas of bone lesion and softened bone.

Norway Norway years Norwegian music-related lists ","title":"List of years in Norwegian music"},{"id":"53486009","text":"Altior (foaled 6 May 2010) is an Irish-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who competes in National Hunt races. After winning one of his three National Hunt Flat races he was unbeaten in five hurdle races including the Sharp Novices' Hurdle and Supreme Novices' Hurdle. In the 2016/2017 National Hunt season he won six consecutive steeplechases including the Henry VIII Novices' Chase, Wayward Lad Novices' Chase, Game Spirit Chase, Arkle Challenge Trophy and the Celebration Chase. Background Altior (Latin for \\"Higher\\") is a bay gelding with a white star bred in Ireland by Paddy Behan. In June 2013 the three-year-old gelding was auctioned at the Goffs National Hunt sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨60,000 by Highflyer Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of Patricia Pugh and was sent into training with Nicky Henderson at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire. Altior's sire High Chaparral won The Derby in 2002 and the Breeders' Cup Turf in 2002 and 2003. His other progeny included So You Think, Dundeel, Free Eagle and Toronado. His dam Monte Solaro won two National Hunt races and has produced several other winners. She was a distant female line descendant of the influential French broodmare Democratie. Racing career =2014-2015: National Hunt Flat races= Altior began his racing career in a National Hunt Flat race at Market Rasen Racecourse on 18 May in which he started the 4/6 favourite in a seven-runner field. Ridden by Nico de Boinville he led from the start and won in \\"impressive\\" style by fourteen lengths. After an absence of nearly nine months the gelding returned in a Listed National Hunt Flat race at Newbury Racecourse in which he started favourite and finished third behind Barters Hill and Buveur d'Air (also trained by Henderson). He was then sent to Ireland for the Grade 1 Champion INH Flat Race at Punchestown on 29 April and finished sixth of the thirteen runner behind Bellshill. =2015/2016 season: Novice hurdles= In the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Altior was campaigned in novice hurdle races. He made his debut over obstacles at Chepstow Racecourse on 10 October and won by thirty-four lengths from Murray Mount. Three weeks later he won at Ascot Racecourse beating Ch'Tibello by one and a quarter lengths despite making a bad mistake at the final flight of hurdles. On 15 November Altior was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Sharp Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite. After racing in second place he took the lead at the second last and held off a strong challenge from Maputo to win by half a length. On 26 December he won again, taking a novice hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse by thirteen lengths from the Willie Mullins-trained Open Eagle. On 15 March 2016 Altior made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he was one of fourteen horses to contest the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and started the 4/1 second favourite behind Min, an Irish gelding who had won the Moscow Flyer Novice Hurdle on his last start. The other runners included Buveur d'Air, Bellshill, Charbel and Petit Mouchoir. After racing in mid- division, he began to make progress after the fifth of the eight hurdles and took the lead approaching the final obstacle. He accelerated away from his rivals to win by seven lengths from Min, with his stablemate Buveur d'Air taking third place. After the race Henderson said \\"He always looked to be in the right place, Nico gave him a great ride. I was always happy and he's very good. He and Buveur D'Air have both run cracking races\\" while de Boinville commented \\"I was seriously impressed... We know he stays and that's what he did. I think he outstayed them.\\" =2016/2017 season: novice steeplechases= The 2016/2017 National Hunt season saw Altior competing in novice chases starting with the Starlight Novice's Chase at Kempton on 21 November which he won by sixty-three lengths at odds of 2/13. Henderson commented that he had been considering aiming the horse at the Champion Hurdle and added \\"he's got serious pace. You could win a Flat race with Altior any day you like\\". Two weeks later he started at odds of 2/7 when he was moved up in class for the Grade 1 Henry VIII Novices' Chase at Sandown Park. After racing in third place, he took the lead after jumping the final fence and \\"sprinted clear\\" to in by four lengths from Charbel. His rider Noel Fehily said \\"I was most impressed with him going to the last, I was a length down, he winged it and in two strides he was three lengths clear. I thought it was very impressive\\". The Grade 2 Wayward Lad Novices' Chase at Kempton saw Altior start at odds of 1/9 against three opponents. He took the lead at the third last fence and won \\"very easily\\" by eighteen lengths from Marracudja. After the race Henderson said \\"I think he is a very good horse. Going round here on his first chase he was good and at Sandown he was also good. Today you could see he had really worked it out. What he did just now was really 10 out of 10\\". On 11 February 2017 Altior was matched against more experienced chasers in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury in which his opponents were Dodging Bullets, Fox Norton (Summit Juvenile Hurdle, Cheltenham Chase) and Traffic Fluide. Starting at odds of 30/100 and ridden as on his three previous starts by Fehily he led for most of the way, drew clear of his rivals at the fourth-last fence and won by fourteen lengths from Fox Norton. Having won nine successive races, Altior returned to the Cheltenham Festival of 14 March 2017 and started the 1/4 favourite for the Arkle Challenge Trophy. The best fancied of his opponents were Royal Caviar, Charbel, Forest Bihan (Lightning Novices' Chase) and Cloudy Dream. After racing in second place, Altior was left in front when Charbel fell and the second last and stayed on well to win by six lengths from Cloudy Dream. On the final day of the season, at Sandown Park, Altior beat Champion Chase winner Special Tiara by 8 lengths in the Celebration Chase (in which he started 30/100 favourite). Timeform gave Altior a rating of 175p following this performance ranking him as second only to Douvan on 182. =2017/2018 season: steeplechases= Henderson identified the Tingle Creek Chase as Altior's first target for the 2017/18 season, with the Queen Mother Champion Chase as his long-term objective. In mid-November however this plan was scrapped when Altior developed a breathing problem which required surgery on his larynx and eliminated him from the Tingle Creek Chase. Henderson commented \\"hopefully he will be back in time for the Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March and perhaps the other championship races in the spring\\". The trainer was forced to defend his conduct in the matter, having stated just two days previously that the horse was \\"totally on target\\" for the Tingle Creek and then announcing the breathing problem in his blog on the website of online betting firm Unibet. Altior eventually made his seasonal reappearance on 10 February 2018 in the Game Spirit Chase where he was ridden by Nico de Boinville and faced by two rivals in the Tingle Creek Chase winner Politologue and Valdez. In a race run on very soft going Politologue made most of the running but Altior came to challenge over the last two fences, took the lead at the last and won comfortably by four lengths. Henderson said after the race \\"If you‚Äôd dreamt what would happen, that would just about have been it,\\" Henderson said. \\"He's just got class. His work is so easy. We‚Äôre very lucky to have a wonderful bunch of horses, but we haven‚Äôt got much that can go with him. He's done some good bits of work with other horses, but he's just better than them.\\" =2018/2019 season: steeplechases= Altior made a winning start to his 2018/2019 season when winning the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown on 8 December 2018. He ended the calendar year by romping home to win the Desert Orchid Chase on 27 December 2018. His next start came in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot, he opposed two rivals, Fox Norton and Diego Du Charmil. He led the full way round and was unchallenged winning by 7 lengths, although jumping left. Altior returned to the Cheltenham Festival and was sent of at odds of 4/11 to retain his Champion Chase crown. Following Saint Calvados and then taking over 3 out, with a pack of rivals looming behind waiting to pounce, briefly headed by Sceau Royal, Nico de Boinville got to work on his mount and his trademark turbocharged finished kicked in and he surged clear and asserted towards the finish. He has now won at four consecutive Cheltenham Festivals and matched Big Buck's record of 18 wins in a row. =2019/2020 season: steeplechases = Altior's 19-race winning streak was ended at Ascot in November 2019 by Cyrname in the Grade 2 Christy 1965 Chase. He then missed out on running in both the Silviniaco Conti Chase and Clarence House Chase in January after recovering from an abscess but returned to form with a win in Newbury's Game Spirit Chase.

It stars Zoey Deutch, Kathryn Hahn, Tim Heidecker, Adam Scott, Joey Morgan, and Dylan Gelula. It had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2017. It was released theatrically on March 16, 2018, by The Orchard. Plot Erica (Zoey Deutch) gives a police officer a blowjob in his car while her two friends catch them in the act on video. They then extort him for money as Erica is not eighteen. It is revealed that she and her friends extort ephebophiles frequently as a form of vigilantism. Erica totals up her earnings, which she is saving up to bail her father out of prison. Her mom's new boyfriend Bob has a son, Luke, who gets out of rehab and comes to live with them. Erica and Luke soon develop an unlikely friendship. While at the bowling alley together, Luke has a panic attack when he sees his middle school teacher, Will Jordan (Adam Scott), whom he accused of sexual assault. Will was never charged due to inconsistencies in Luke's story. Later that night, Erica interrupts Luke's suicide attempt. Erica and her posse decide to make Will their next target, with Luke reluctantly participating. At the grocery store, Erica flirts with Will, who is aware she is a teenager in high school. Later, she approaches him at the bowling alley, and they make out in his car in the parking lot. Before it can go any further, she abruptly stops it. Her friends accuse her of sabotaging the plan because she likes him. The gang forms a new plan and they lace a beer with roofies. They accidentally pour in too much, so Erica says she won't let him drink the whole thing. Erica arrives at Will's house with the six pack, apologizes for the other night, and they go inside his house to hang out. Erica asks about the miniature Eiffel Tower replica on Will's coffee table, which was a gift from his ex-wife. This prompts Will to tell her about how he was accused of molesting Luke, which he vehemently denies. Although he was never charged, he tells her how the accusation ruined his life. Erica realizes he's almost done with the beer, so she slaps it out of his hand, and he feels the strong effect of the roofies. He grabs her arm, and Luke runs in and punches him, causing Will to fall backwards onto the coffee table, smashing it. The four of them pick Will up and prop him up on the couch while two of the girls strip down to their underwear and take pictures with him to use to blackmail him. Luke worries that his breathing is too slow, but they leave, shaken by the encounter. On the way out, Erica sees that the other girls vandalized his garage by spray-painting the word \\"pedophile\\" on it. The next morning, the cops show up at their house and accuse Erica and Luke of vandalism. When they mention that they haven't been able to get ahold of him yet, Erica and Luke go back to the house to make sure he's okay. When they arrive, Will is sitting limp on the couch exactly where they left him. They try to shake him awake and he falls over, revealing the Eiffel Tower model impaled in his back and a puddle of blood. Luke convinces Erica they have to run away to Mexico. While on the run, Erica throws up from guilt, and looks for reassurance from Luke that Will deserved what happened to him. Luke reveals that he was never molested by Will; he walked in on Will molesting his classmate and lied to protect her and other possible victims. Luke surprises Erica by driving her to her dad's prison and giving her bail money. However, she is heartbroken to find out that he was bailed out a few days ago and did not contact her. Erica decides she doesn't want to live her life on the run, and she wants to go home and turn themselves in. Luke agrees, but on their way back, a police car tries to pull them over. Erica tells Luke that they can't get caught before turning themselves in, so they try to lose the police on a dirt road. In the chaos, Luke confesses his love to her. They give up on the chase to stop to have sex and are found by police as they lie together on the ground. One month later, Erica visits Luke in prison, shortly before her house arrest begins. Despite their circumstances, they are happy and in love.

I have always been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts the extent of the consequences.\\"Lisa Steele (Director) Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects (1974) Dist. V tape Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects was selected by Toronto International Film Festival as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.  Background  Lisa Steele was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1947 and immigrated to Canada in 1968. An important pioneer of video art in Canada since the early 1970s,Russell 2002, p. 430 Steele has shown internationally at the Venice Biennale (1980), the Kunsthalle (Basel), the Museum of Modern Art (NYC), the National Gallery of Canada, the Institute of Contemporary Art (Boston), 49th Parallel Videoseries, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Long Beach Museum. Her videos are in collections worldwide, including The National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Houston, Texas), Ingrid Oppenheim, Concordia University (Montreal), Newcastle Polytechnic (England), Paulo Cardazzo (Milan), the Canadian Embassy (Tokyo) and the Akademie der Kunst (Berlin). She is a founding director of Vtape in Toronto, a national information and distribution service for independent video and a founding publisher and editor of FUSE Magazine. Steele has collaborated exclusively with her partner Kim Tomczak since the early 1980s.  Context and description  Steele's earliest works are part of a key moment in video art history, not only setting the tone for her later work but in particular, pioneering a language for a medium becoming crucial in 1970s Canadian art. Early video art in Canada made by women was a direct critique of mass media with an \\"awareness\\" of \\"media's manipulation\\" of the viewer. Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is a crucial early work that \\"has entered the canon of Western art history as one of the best examples of early feminist video art from Canada.\\" Like much early video art, the work is performance-based, with a static camera and one angle. The entire twelve minutes is unedited and > the soundtrack consists entirely of the sounds and voice of the take. > Notwithstanding the private and unspectacular setting, the strict form of > Birthday Suit. With Scars and Defects ‚Äì its seemingly rehearsed > choreography, the chronological ordering of memory, and the unvarying > repetition of gestures ‚Äì unsettles the viewer‚Äôs spontaneous impression of an > unedited sequence. Directly addressing the viewer as \\"you\\", moreover, > contrasts with the otherwise private setting. Such gaze alignment, which the > fixed camera position epitomizes, opens up the scene toward a literally > \\"exhibitionist\\" affirmation of self. In Birthday Suit with scars and defects Steele disrobes and examines the scars on her naked body, accumulated over her lifetime, on the day of her 27th birthday in order to channel the scars' \\"origin stories through the touch of her fingers, all in an effort to chart the marks endured in her twenty-seven years of life.\\" Like much of her work in the 1970s, Birthday Suit addresses the video medium as \\"a gendered tool of power [as a] means of surveillance and social control, or of confession and self-examination.\\"  Early video art in Canada  By the 1970s artists, seeking more control over their work but also the display and distribution, turned to mass media, new technology and communication technologies. Video, photography and audio became the media of choice for artists with a feminist practice. In particular, women artists utilized performance and technology to both engage the viewer but also as a form of direct documentation, often utilizing the artist's body. Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is an important early example of feminist video art. Steele's approach to identity is both matter-of-fact but also fictionalized, employing irony and as an extension of conceptual art, practices of directness and banal bluntness. Early video art employs approaches first found in performance and body art in the 1960s. Addressing voyeurism (both from the mass media and modernist impulses) and using documentary tropes, in particular direct cinema, the first generation of video art's concerns with sexuality and sexual politics aligned it with feminist discourse of the era. Feminist art in the early 1970s operated in the \\"ideological\\" and \\"linguistic\\" space of the body. Steele's Birthday Suit engages with \\"nudity, pain and memory\\", reinventing the \\"adult female body\\" through memory. A form of \\"critical embodiment\\" Steele's video self-portrait \\"counters normative 'pedagogical spectacles' of women's bodies\\" by emphasizing the \\"unhealthy... body in ways that forcefully enact embodied agency.\\"  Reception and legacy  For the 2017 Canadian sesquicentennial, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) selected a list of the 150 essential moving-image productions made in Canada, determined \\"through a national poll of over 200 members of the film, television, advertising and music industry along with journalists, critics, scholars, and filmmakers.\\" Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects was selected as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy. Described as a canonical work of video art and body art, Birthday Suit ‚Äì with scars and defects is also an important influence on later artists. An aspect of online video sharing, on platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion, is the aesthetic of the amateur where \\"non-professionals, art students, or amateurists comprise the vast majority of videos.\\" Often taking as their inspiration autobiographical video artworks of the 1970s, focusing on the physical body in front of the stationary camera, with minimal editing, the uploaders \\"physically or conceptually substitute the artist‚Äôs body and narrative for their own. In other words, uploaders employ the artist as a productive template for their recorded performances.\\" Steele is one of the most widely appropriated artists on video-sharing websites. Online videos employ Steele's performance of body narrative, often emphasizing the unhealthy, scarred or marked. Like Steele's direct engagement with an absent viewer, these online homages forge complex relationships with viewers, albeit anonymously and not as art.

He is best remembered for composing \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\" in 1926, which became a hit for Ethel Waters. He became a prominent figure in black musical theater, and produced scores for films such as Moon Over Harlem (1939) and Murder on Lenox Avenue (1941). Biography =Early years= Heywood born in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1896. He showed an aptitude for playing the piano and with other stringed instruments at an early age. Heywood's father, a physician, was intent that his son follow in his footsteps, and sent young Heywood to college at Queens Royal College in Trinidad, and then to Fisk University in Nashville. Heywood studied at Fisk for two years before moving on to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois for medical studies. During his time at Northwestern, Heywood's interest in music began to take precedence over his medical education. He moved to New York and began studying music at Kordkin Moser Conservatory. In 1923, he got his first professional music-related job. Heywood composed music for The North Ain't South, which was performed at Harlem's Lafayette Theatre. =Records, radio and Broadway= Heywood was working for RCA Victor by the early 1920s. On 29 August 1923 his \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" was recorded by Rosa Henderson. On February 2, 1926 his \\"Charleston Ball\\" was recorded by the Charles Dornberger Orchestra. Heywood is best remembered for composing \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\", teaming with Will Marion Cook who added the lyrics. It is often wrongly attributed to vocalist Ethel Waters, who first recorded it on September 18, 1926 on the Columbia Records label with Cook‚Äôs Singing Orchestra, though she is credited with popularizing it. Trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke, pianist Fats Waller and the Paul Whiteman Orchestra featuring Bing Crosby all recorded it in 1927. The song has become a jazz standard, popular with Dixieland musicians and was recorded by many other artists including Benny Goodman in 1938. In 1927, Heywood continued his collaboration with Waters, recording tunes such as \\"Keep an Eye on Your Man\\", \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" and \\"Clorinda\\" with her. Heywood and Waters made their Broadway debuts on July 11, 1927 with the Heywood-written revue, Africana. Heywood also performed in the musical he had written when a replacement was needed for cast member Louis Douglas. The role called for someone who spoke fluent French; Heywood had studied the language when at Fisk and Northwestern. The song \\"Clorinda\\" was part of the original score with \\"I Want My Sweet Daddy Now\\" added after the revue's first performance. The production ran for 72 performances at the Nederlander Theatre and put Waters on the road to stardom. The same year, Heywood's \\"Mango Lane\\" and \\"Susanne\\" was recorded by Dan Michaels and Hilda Perleno, singing as a duet, with Heywood accompanying them on piano. On 4 January 1928, the Paul Whiteman Orchestra recorded Heywood's \\"Smile\\". Heywood also made regular radio appearances with Hilda Perleno on WCGU during 1928. By 1929, he had a local radio program of his own. In 1931, Cab Calloway recorded his song \\"Black Rhythm,\\" a canny parody of stereotypes about black music.Richard Middleton, \\"Epilogue,\\" in Jazz Worlds/World Jazz , ed. by Philip V. Bohlman and Goffredo Plastino, p. 447. =Theater and film= In the early 1930s, Heywood capitalized on the surge in popularity of plays with all-black casts, often with religious themes. He became known for his work in black musical theater. Heywood's \\"The Black King\\", based on Marcus Garvey's life was a success on Broadway under L√©onide Massine, prompting him to approach Bud Pollard to direct a screen version in 1932. Heywood was later a film score composer for films such as Moon Over Harlem (1939) and Murder on Lenox Avenue (1941). For Murder on Lenox Avenue he wrote the songs \\"Trying to Forget\\", \\"I'll Get Even With You, and \\"What You Know About That\\". He also appeared in films; Oscar Micheaux's 1931 film, The Exile, featured Heywood's musical score and his appearance as \\"Don Heywood and his Band\\". He appeared in Micheaux's film Veiled Aristocrats and arranged the music for Ten Minutes to Live with a role as the master of ceremonies in the film. Heywood died in New York City in 1967 of unknown circumstances.

In Bath, Bird met the elderly Walter Sickert who became a major influence on him. During World War Two, Bird served in the Royal Navy and was deployed to the Far East and India. While on active service, Bird continued to paint and submitted a number of works to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. WAAC eventually purchased a small number of these pictures and they are now held in the Imperial War Museum and the British Government Art Collection. After the war, Bird studied at the Institute of Education in London, where his lecturers included Nikolaus Pevsner, before returning to Bath to teach art at the Bath Art Secondary School. In the early 1950s, Bird taught for a time as Head of Painting at the Bretton Hall Training College. In 1953 he joined the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield in Yorkshire. Bird lived as a lay member of the Anglo-Catholic community there for eight years. When he left Mirfield, Bird joined the teaching staff at the Royal College of Art under Robin Darwin. There he taught drawing in the Film and Television School on a part-time basis before taking a full-time role as the vice-principal of the Central School of Art and Design. Bird worked at the Central from 1961 until 1983. From 1983 until the last year of his life, Bird presented an influential series of summer school lectures on The Art of Seeing.

However, under Article 61 of the Penal Code, exceptions may be granted in cases of necessity, which has typically been interpreted to permit an abortion necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. In some cases, this exception has been extended to cases where the pregnancy poses dangers to the pregnant woman's health, and to cases of foetal impairment. A physician can only perform an abortion in such cases when two specialists approve, unless the woman's life is in imminent danger. Any person who induces an abortion may be imprisoned, and physicians who do so may be sentenced to prison. Convictions are uncommon, because the prosecution must prove that the woman was pregnant and the means by which the pregnancy was interrupted. In 1998, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, issued a fatwa calling for access to abortion for unmarried women who had been raped. In 2004 he approved a draft bill that would permit abortion in the case of rape; the bill was unsuccessful. Despite legal restrictions, abortions are common. In a 2000 study of 1025 women from six villages in Upper Egypt, 416 were found to have had at least one abortion; among this group, there were 265 abortions per 1000 live births. Abortions are carried out by indigenous methods, at clandestine clinics, or at great expense by private gynecologists. In addition, unsafe abortions are common: a 1998 study found that about 20% of obstetric hospital admissions were for post-abortion treatment. One study estimated that between 1995 and 2000, there were 2,079,216 abortions, and 2,542 maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions.

Depending on the German state, the exact name of the programme varies. History =Foundation= The first youth fire brigade in Germany was established in 1882 in Oevenum on the island of F√∂hr, making it probably the oldest in Europe. Due to many of the men working mostly at sea, the fire safety of the island was made the responsibility of the youth fire brigade. The first youth fire brigade in accordance with the modern model is the youth fire brigade based at Nieb√ºll, founded in 1953. During the Third Reich youth fire brigades were reorganized during the course of the Gleichschaltung as Hitler Youth fire brigades. The German Youth Fire Brigade (DJF) was founded in 1964 in Berlin. By the \\"Youth Law of the GDR\\" on the 4th of May 1964 working groups named \\"Young Fire Protection Helpers\\" were created in the GDR. Children in these groups were taught outside of school about the basics of fire safety, preventative fire protection, firefighting, and first aid. The working groups were generally headed by members of the volunteer fire brigade. After German reunification, the working groups were reorganized as \\"youth fire brigades\\". Education Youth Fire Brigades usually meet weekly for training. The training includes basic activities that are carried out by the fire service as well as training to improve dexterity, agility, and overall fitness, as well as improving the general knowledge of members. Youth firefighters are trained by experienced firefighters. Most of them are in leading ranks. Activities outside of the fire brigade are undertaken in many youth fire brigades. For example, camping, visits to cinemas, and sports such as soccer can be carried out. These help to promote a sense of camaraderie within the youth fire brigade. Uniform Bad Zwischenahn Jugendfeuerwehr The uniform of the youth fire brigade in Germany consists of appropriate footwear, youth fire brigade branded trousers, youth fire brigade branded shirts, a helmet, and cut resistant plastic gloves. Many youth fire brigades provide additional weather- proof youth fire brigade branded raincoats, and safety shoes/safety boots at their own expense. The jackets are blue with orange on the shoulders, and a reflective strip across the back. The trousers are blue with reflective stripes.

The areas were sites of mass murder during the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. Background and planning During the early stages of the planning for the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, the rear areas behind the front lines were envisioned to be subordinated to the respective armies, as they had during the invasion of Poland. By early April 1941, however, the military planners decided to limit the areas of army jurisdiction (), with the bulk of the territory to be controlled by the Army Group Rear Areas. The planners envisioned that the occupied territories would quickly pass onto civilian administration; thus, the directives called for the Army Group Rear Areas commanders to concentrate on the security of lines of communication and important military installations, such as storage depots and aerodromes. Army Group Rear Areas were also responsible for the transfer of prisoners of war to the rear. Organisation Army Group North, Army Group Centre and Army Group South Rear Area Commands were responsible for the rear area security in their respective areas of operation. Each had a headquarters subordinated to the corresponding army group, while also reporting to the Wehrmacht Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner, who had responsibility for rear security. Each Army Group Rear Area had a , for propaganda activities aimed at the civilian population. Army Group Rear Area commanders controlled nine Security Divisions, tasked with security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combating irregular fighters (partisans) behind the front line. Security Divisions also oversaw units of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police) of the Wehrmacht. Rear Area commanders operated in parallel with the Higher SS and Police Leaders appointed by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, for each of the army group rear areas. In the words of historian Michael Parrish, these army commanders \\"presided over an empire of terror and brutality\\". Security warfare and atrocities The area commanders' duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combating guerillas (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas. In addition to the Wehrmacht security forces, the SS and the SD formations operated in the same areas, under the command of the respective Higher SS and Police Leaders. These units included Einsatzgruppen detachments, three police regiments (North, Centre and South), the Waffen-SS units of the Kommandostab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, and additional Ordnungspolizei (Order Police Battalions), which units perpetrated mass murder during The Holocaust in the areas of military jurisdiction. The security formations, often in coordination with or under the leadership of the Wehrmacht, conducted security operations against the civilian population, under the doctrine of Partisanenkrieg (later Bandenbek√§mpfung, or \\"bandit fighting\\"). \\"Anti-partisan operations\\" in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age. In its reports, the Wehrmacht units euphemistically described the operations as \\"elimination of partisan nests, partisan camps, partisan bunkers\\". Their records show that in the early phases of the occupation, in 1941‚Äì42, Wehrmacht security divisions lost one soldier killed for every 100 \\"partisans\\" that died, with the Jewish population making up the majority of the victims. In the Army Group Centre Rear Area, 80,000 \\"suspected partisans\\" were killed between June 1941 and May 1942, for 1,094 German casualties.

The frog is endemic to the Western Ghats, India, and is only known from its type locality, Pandipath, in the Agasthyamalai Hills, Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala. Smaller than a human fingernail, it is among the smallest frog species in the world. Nyctibatrachus pulivijayani is part of a genus that evolved in India around 70‚Äì80 million years ago. The species of frog was discovered by scientists from the University of Delhi. Etymology The specific name pulivijayani honours Mr. Vijayan Kani, who supported Biju and his students during their field campaigns. He got the name Pulivijayan after braving a leopard attack (puli is Malayalam for \\"leopard\\"). The word puli can also allude to leopard-like spots on the dorsal surface of this species. Description Five adult males in the type series measure in snout‚Äìvent length; no females were collected. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is indistinct. The fingers and toes have discs but no webbing. The dorsum is light brown to silvery-brown and has prominent dark brown spots. The venter is light yellowish-brown with minute black speckles. The hands and feet are darker. The throat is light grey. Weakly developed dorso-lateral glandular folds are present and re separated by scattered granular projections. Habitat The type locality is an evergreen forest at above sea level. Specimens were found hiding under herbs and grasses on marshy ground, usually away from water. Males were observed calling both during the day and in the late evening.

It was originally entitled The Storyteller. The film's production was a personal project of Getty's, who largely self-financed at the estimated cost of $4-6 million. Production took fifteen years to complete. Following Getty's death in 2015, editing for the film was completed by producer Michael Luceri. It made its official premiere at the Fantasporto Film Festival on February 26, 2017; and was later acquired by Vision Films, who released the film via Video on Demand on April 4, 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the film's unevenness and dialogue while commending the film's strangeness, and Getty's devotion to the material.  Plot  Dennis is a man with a mental disability who has had nightmares all his life since he was a child, including one where he entered a carnival ride that seemed underwhelming. He is told that \\"the ride isn't over.\\" As an adult, Dennis has a dream where a living demon, called the Cadaver, fastens a zipper onto his back and enters his body. Also in his dream, he finds a hidden room in the cellar that holds a full-length mirror that Dennis believes the Cadaver came from. The very next day, his brother John presents him with an identical mirror as a gift. He begins speaking to his reflection, who seems to answer back to him. Dennis' brother John has difficulty of his own. His girlfriend, Lydia, demands that they get married, but is upset that he will not do anything about Dennis. He is visited by Mildy Torres, a woman from social services, who believes that Dennis needs to be taken away. This upsets John as he feels that Dennis is his responsibility. Dennis continues to have nightmares of the Cadaver and his reflection informs him that in order to get rid of it, they need to start killing animals. He begins working in the secret cellar, which perplexes John, especially when he sees that Dennis has videos on taxidermy. Dennis says the videos are not his but were accidentally switched with another customer. Once Dennis begins killing children, his reflection takes on a more competent demeanor and reveals that \\"he\\" was the one giving him the nightmares and that they still have more killing to do. Dennis meets with his crush Susan, an employee at his favorite ice cream place. He tries to ask her out, but the conversation gets awkward and Susan turns him down, hurting him. The Cadaver sends Dennis back to kill Susan. Before he can reach her, she runs out into the street and gets killed by a moving vehicle. When John and Lydia take Dennis to his favorite restaurant, he supposedly kills a man in the bathroom without hesitation, scaring himself. Dennis attempts to destroy the mirror, but his reflection pushes him in and takes on the \\"real\\" Dennis instead. After a night out, John and Lydia discover that they do not recognize anyone at places they visit regularly, implying that Dennis has killed more people. Mildy Torres arrives at the house with two officers and are all killed by Dennis. While sitting at a favorite cafe, John reveals to Lydia his secret: Dennis was a child prodigy whose works had been published in the newspapers. One day while arguing, John punched Dennis and he fell down the stairs. When he awoke, his mentality diminished greatly and John has felt guilty ever since. Lydia sympathizes with John and accepts the idea that if she and John marry, Dennis will always live with them. She leaves to get Dennis, so they can share the happy news over dinner. John's friend Pete is sitting nearby and reveals that the taxidermy tapes are Dennis'. John instructs Pete to call the police, and he hails a taxi. Lydia arrives at the house and is stabbed by Dennis, who proceeds to remove her insides. John arrives and enters the cellar, where he sits in a chair with a spotlight on it. Dennis appears with a now-stuffed Lydia and puts on a ventriloquist act and John realizes he is glued to the chair. The previous victims have all been stuffed and are used in an extravagant diorama revealing that John intentionally hit Dennis with a baseball bat while he was sleeping. Afterward, he used the fabrication of Dennis falling downstairs to cover his violent act. As more stuffed bodies are revealed, it becomes unclear if John or Dennis is seeing what is actually happening. Overwhelmed, John takes a gun and shoots himself. Dennis is slammed down by a Cadaver-Spider hybrid, only for it to be revealed that he is actually being restrained by police officers who drag him away. The final scene shows Dennis in a padded room. It is revealed that the reflection Dennis is still in control while the real Dennis is trapped deep in his subconscious.

According to a post-production producer who had worked on the film and a friend of Getty, Ryan Readenour: \\"When he was young he would have these really powerful, sick, twisted dreams, and [they were] so shocking to him that he didn't think they came from him.\\" Getty conceived the idea that it could be a storyteller who created these dreams, and The Storyteller was then used as the first title of the film. In a supplementary interview on the DVD release, Getty also stated he was inspired by the David Berkowitz Son of Sam killings, in which Berkowitz said he was ordered to kill by a demon taking the form of a talking dog. Getty postulated, what if there really was a demon giving the serial killer orders. Filming began in 2002, and the film was shot largely in Getty's own mansion. He also converted one of the rooms in his mansion into a post-production suite. He made his own unique camera rigs, built expensive sets, and with his FX team he created elaborate animatronic robots, including an octopus that can play a drum kit. The production however would stop and start over many years as it was beset with funding issues and conflicts with the cast, including a lawsuit from a studio assistant. The cast and crew also went through a number of changes, and according to Koehler, only he and Michael Berryman made it through to the changes. This is the final film to feature Matthew McGrory who appears in an uncredited cameo from footage shot before his death in 2005. The health conditions of both McGrory and Berryman (who had been ill for some years) had slowed down the production and scripted scenes had to be replaced. Getty continued to work on the film for many years after the filming, creating his own special effects and trying to perfect the film. He died in 2015 before the film was finished, with the coloring and editing not completed. Producer Michael Luceri, who had also edited the film, finished the film. Release The Evil Within made its official premiere at the Fantasporto Film Festival on February 26, 2017. It was later screened at the Dead by Dawn Horror Film Festival on April 20 that same year. Amsterdamned Film Festival on October 27. That same day the film was alternately screened at the Morbido Film Festival as a part of its \\"New Blood\\" section. =Home media= The film was later acquired by Vision Films and released on April 4, 2017 on VOD services in North America such as Amazon under a new title, The Evil Within. Critical reception The Evil Within received mixed reviews from critics, with many critics noting the unevenness of the film. However, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 100% approval rating based on five reviews. Most noted that in spite of its flaws, the movie succeeds in more ways than not. David Fontana of Film Inquiry thought that the film is \\"riddled with strange and unfocused plot-lines\\" and \\"filled with cringeworthy character acting\\", and that it \\"becomes so wrapped up in its own eccentricities that it is all but impossible to follow coherently\\". He nevertheless praised the film for its surreal visuals and special effects, and thought the \\"nuanced details\\" of the film \\"help to raise The Evil Within above its flaws\\", and that \\"it's hard to argue with that much [of Getty's] devotion to this singularly distinguished work of art\\". Charles Bramesco of The Guardian considered the film \\"very clearly the handiwork of a rank amateur under the influence of powerful narcotics\\", but that \\"Getty‚Äôs monomaniacal drive and technical knowhow resulted in some truly outr√© horror\\", and that his \\"wild experiments with the form command respect\\". Travis Johnson of Filmink criticized the film's dialogue, and felt that there were \\"no discernible reasons for scenes and interactions to exists at all\\", but still judged it \\"one of most singularly strange films to come along in a good while\\" and that it is a \\"remarkable cinematic artifact that is absolutely worth experiencing\\". Andrew Todd from Birth.Movies.Death. gave the film a mostly positive review, stating that the film was 'far more elaborately crafted than one would expect'. Todd further noted that the film's perceived \\"faults\\" were actually its strengths, comparing the film to Marcin Wrona's final film Demon as \\"it's hard to watch without reading the director's psychological state and subsequent death into it.\\" Andrew Marshall from Starburst Magazine rated the film a score of 7/10, while noting the film's \\"dubious\\" sub-plots and occasionally stilted dialogue, Marshall stated, \\"The Evil Within will not be for everyone, and as the years pass it's likely that the story of its prolonged production and tortured creator will become better known than the film itself, but one thing you can say for sure is that Andrew Getty has left his mark upon the world.\\" Matt Boiselle from Dread Central awarded the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"Solid cast-work, a disquieting overall aura, and Matthew McGrory in one of his final on-screen appearances ‚Äì it all adds up to a film that should be in your queue of midnight watches now.\\" See also * List of films shot over three or more years References External links  English-language films 2017 films 2017 horror films American independent films American supernatural horror films Demons in film 2017 direct-to-video films Direct-to-video horror films American psychological horror films ","title":"The Evil Within (2017 film)"},{"id":"53487083","text":"Ice core researchers from AWI drilling at the EastGRIP ice core site The East Greenland Ice-Core Project, known as EGRIP, is a scientific project that plans to retrieve an ice core from the Northeast Greenland ice stream.

In Sunni Islam, the concept of the logos has been given many different names by the denomination's metaphysicians, mystics, and philosophers, including  øaql (\\"Intellect\\"), al-insƒÅn al-kƒÅmil (\\"Universal Man\\"), kalimat AllƒÅh (\\"Word of God\\"), haqƒ´qa mu·∏•ammadiyya (\\"The Muhammadan Reality\\"), and n≈´r mu·∏•ammadƒ´ (\\"The Muhammadan Light\\"). Throughout Islamic history, there have existed several different metaphysical concepts that have been understood to correspond \\"in many respects\\" to the logos Christology of Christianity and to the use of the term logos in late Greek philosophy.Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., ‚Äú øA·∏≥l‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Prophet Muhammad In the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni Islamic metaphysicians, philosophers, and mystics of the Islamic Golden Age, Muhammad, who is given the title of \\"Seal of the Prophets\\" in the Quran,Qur'an 33:40. was understood to be \\"both a manifestation of the Logos and the Logos itself, he was also very kind and had prayed for his people every night, and was always very worried about his peopleSeyyed Hossein Nasr, The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 63 This classical identification of Muhammad with the logos emerged from particular interpretations of specific Quranic verses, sayings of the prophet, and through the writings of the early mystics of Islam. Cosmological concepts At the same time, the logos concept was also intimately tied in the works of the same authors to other important Islamic cosmological concepts, such as the ideas of  øaql (\\"Intellect\\"), which \\"resembled the late Greek doctrine of the logos\\" and represented an Arabic equivalent to the Neoplatonic ŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ (\\"Intellect\\"), law·∏• ma·∏•f≈´·∫ì (\\"Guarded Tablet,\\" in Quran 85:22),Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ideals and Realities of Islam (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1966), p. 42 ·∏≥alam (\\"Divine Pen\\"), umm al-kitƒÅb (\\"Mother of the Book,\\" in Quran 3:7, 13:39, 43:4),Wensinck, A. J., ‚ÄúLaw·∏•‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936), Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R.

The logos was often presented as \\"created\\" in Islamic doctrine, and thus was more akin to Philo's understanding of the phrase than Nicene Christianity. = øAql= One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is  øaql, which is the \\"Arabic equivalent to the Greek (intellect).\\" In the writings of the Islamic Neoplatonist philosophers, such as al-Farabi () and Avicenna (d. 1037), the idea of the  øaql was presented in a manner that both resembled \\"the late Greek doctrine\\" and, likewise, \\"corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology.\\" The concept of logos in Sufism is used to relate the \\"Uncreated\\" (God) to the \\"Created\\" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the logos. The logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is \\"unique\\" within each region. Jesus and Muhammad are seen as the personifications of the logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.Sufism: love & wisdom by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 p. 242 Sufi essays by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973 p. 148] One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher Ibn Arabi, who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works The Ringstones of Wisdom (Fusus al-Hikam) and The Meccan Illuminations (Al-Fut≈´·∏•ƒÅt al-Makkiyya). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a logos (Kalimah), as an aspect of the unique divine being. In his view the divine being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with logos providing the link between man and divinity.Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis by N. Hanif 2002 p. 39 Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,Charles A. Frazee, \\"Ibn al-'Arabƒ´ and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century\\", Numen 14 (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229‚Äì40. although (writing in Arabic rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it. For Ibn Arabi, the logos or \\"Universal Man\\" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence. Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic logos.Edward Henry Whinfield, Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maul√°na Jal√°lu-'d-D√≠n Muhammad R√∫m√≠, Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), , p. xxv. In the 15th century Abd al-Karƒ´m al-Jƒ´lƒ´ introduced the Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man. For al-Jƒ´lƒ´, the \\"perfect man\\" (associated with the logos or the Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis by N. Hanif 2002 p. 98 In Ottoman Sufism, ≈ûeyh G√¢lib (d. 1799) articulates S√ºhan (logos-Kalima) in his H√ºsn √º A≈ük (Beauty and Love) in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, S√ºhan appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.Bet√ºl Avcƒ±, \\"Character of S√ºhan in ≈ûeyh G√¢lib‚Äôs Romance, H√ºsn √º A≈ük (Beauty and Love)\\" Archivum Ottomanicum, 32 (2015).

United States  In 2014, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research began to study the issue of overcriminalization, the idea that state and federal criminal codes are overly expansive and growing too quickly. At the federal level alone, Institute fellows identified over 300,000 laws and regulations whose violation can lead to prison time. The Institute asserts that this puts even well-meaning citizens in danger of prosecution for seemingly innocuous conduct. From 2014 to 2016, the Institute produced reports on the status of overcriminalization in five states (North Carolina, Michigan, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Oklahoma) and has continually added more state-specific research. National Review has described United States Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch as \\"a sharp critic\\" of overcriminalization.  United Kingdom  According to the Law Commission, the rate of introduction for new criminal offences has increased drastically since 1997, with 3,000 new offences having been added to the statute book between 1997 and 2010. The accusation of overcriminalisation has been challenged by Chalmers and Leverick.

In 2017, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed a process which began in 2012 to establish rules for commercial use of this band, while reserving parts of the band for the US Federal Government to limit interference with US Navy radar systems and aircraft communications. On January 27, 2020, the FCC authorized full use of the CBRS band for wireless service provider commercialization without the restrictions to prevent interference with military use of the spectrum. Under the new rules, wireless carriers using CBRS might be able to deploy 5G mobile networks without having to acquire spectrum licenses. History The creation of a new publicly available transmission band in the 3.5 GHz band was identified as a possibility by the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for shared federal and non-federal use in its 2010 Fast Track Report. This band was identified as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released by the FCC in December 2012, which the FCC found would \\"promote two major advances that enable more efficient use of radio spectrum: small cells and spectrum sharing\\". The record was thereafter supplemented by a commission-level public notice and two workshops to discuss technical issues related to the proposed Service. In April 2014, the commission released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that included detailed proposed rules to govern the new service. Operation The Citizens Broadband Radio Service is governed by a three-tiered spectrum authorization framework to accommodate a variety of commercial uses on a shared basis with incumbent federal and non- federal users of the band in the US. Access and operations will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system, conceptually similar to the databases used to manage Television White Spaces devices. The three tiers are: Incumbent Access, Priority Access, and General Authorized Access. * Incumbent Access users include authorized federal and grandfathered fixed satellite service users currently operating in the 3.5 GHz Band. Under the rules promulgated by the FCC, these users, particularly including US Navy radar operators, will be protected from harmful interference from Priority Access and General Authorized Access users. Existing 3650‚Äì3700 MHz band operations \\"are grandfathered for up to 5 years\\", with the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology charged with soliciting public comment on \\"the appropriate methodology for defining the grandfathered wireless protection zone contours\\". * The Priority Access tier consists of Priority Access Licenses (PALs) that will be assigned using competitive bidding within the 3550-3650 MHz portion of the band. Each PAL is defined as a non-renewable authorization to use a 10 megahertz channel in a single census tract for three-years. Up to seven total PALs may be assigned in any given census tract with up to four PALs going to any single applicant. Applicants may acquire up to two-consecutive PAL terms in any given license area during the first auction. * The General Authorized Access tier is licensed-by-rule to permit open, flexible access to the band for the widest possible group of potential users. General Authorized Access users are permitted to use any portion of the 3550-3700 MHz band not assigned to a higher tier user and may also operate opportunistically on unused Priority Access channels. Use of the CBRS band will not require spectrum licenses, and is expected to reduce the cost of data transmissions. This will enable carriers \\"to deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals\\". Since these frequencies have historically been used for government purposes, users of the CBRS band will be required to \\"take care not to interfere with others already using nearby airwave bands in some locations, including military radar stations and satellite receiver stations\\". As with Wi-Fi, CBRS equipment will be deployed to individual building owners, and those owners, or end users occupying the property, would pay a fee for spectrum allocation through a server.  CBRS Standards In 2015, the members of the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) formed the Spectrum Sharing Committee to \\"facilitate the interpretation and implementation of FCC rulemaking to a level that allows industry and government to collaborate on the implementation of a common, well functioning ecosystem...\\". Through this committee some 300 engineers from over 60 organizations developed the 10 baseline standards necessary for CBRS deployment. These standards covered requirements, security, protocols, professional installation, priority access licensing, and testing. Recognizing that the development of the standards alone was not sufficient to fully support a commercial ecosystem, the members of the WInnForum went on to establish a number of certification programs: * An accreditation program for public key infrastructure (PKI), root of trust (RoT) and certificate authorities (CA) supporting the CBRS Communications Security Standard and the PKI Certificate Policy * An accreditation program for Certified Professional Installer (CPI) trainers following the CPI standard * A program to authorize test labs to perform CBSD protocol testing following the WInnForum CBSD Test Standard This latter program was developed in coordination with the FCC: in order to be FCC certified to operate in the CBRS Band, an equipment manufacturer needs to show that their CBSD can communicate with a Spectrum Access System (SAS) and follow its directives as per 47 CFR Part 96. The CBRS ecosystem has developed standards in the WInnForum supporting SAS to CBSD communication (WINNF-TS-0016), and in addition, the WInnForum CBRS Test and Certification Task Group has developed a test specification (WINNF-TS-0122) and test harness supporting that standard. The FCC has determined that successful completion of the Wireless Innovation Forum defined tests will provide evidence of Part 96 compliance in this area. Final test code for CBSD protocol testing was released by the Wireless Innovation Forum on 24 May 2018, and since that time over 30 CBSDs have been certified and received their FCC ID, proving compliance with WInnForum specifications. The members of the WInnForum also worked to facilitate SAS certification testing, developing an open source SAS test harness to assess compliance with the WInnForum SAS test specification (WINNF-TS-0065) and the FCC rules. This test harness was turned over to the NTIA Institute for Telecommunications Sciences on May 26, 2018 and testing began on the SAS implementations provided by Amdocs, CommScope, Google, Federated Wireless and Sony.> This testing was completed in June of 2019, and marked the last major milestone necessary for the FCC to allow initial commercial deployment. CBRS Alliance In 2016, six companies interested in promoting CBRS technology and driving adoption formed the CBRS Alliance. As of mid-2017, the CBRS Alliance listed over 60 members, including Alphabet AT&T;, Charter Communications, Cisco Systems, Comcast, the CTIA, Ericsson, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, Ruckus Wireless, and SpiderCloud Wireless. Expected impact Bloomberg Technology has described CBRS as potentially being \\"[m]ore reliable than Wi-Fi\\" and \\"technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded\\", and quotes CBRS Alliance president Michael Peeters characterizing CBRS as possibly \\"a better option for factories, airports and ports\\". Network World has noted that it is \\"quite likely that the band will be used for 5G, and that might synch nicely with services offered in other countries that are actually targeting the band for 5G services\\". It is further proposed that such a 5G network \\"promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second\\". Early Trials Beginning in 2017, a number of CBRS trial projects were initiated in various cities. In February 2017, Nokia, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology in a CBRS- band broadcast of \\"live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas\\". In April, Kansas City, Missouri \\"approved a Google test of 3.5GHz shared wireless in more than eight locations in that area for up to 18 months\\". In May, Google received permission from the FCC to test wireless technology within the CBRS band at four NASCAR race events held during the summer of 2017, in Bristol, Tennessee, Brooklyn, Michigan, Darlington, South Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia. By August 2017, Verizon Communications had formed a consortium \\"to carry out the first use of CBRS band 48 spectrum in a 4G LTE Advanced (LTE-A) carrier aggregation demonstration\\". In November 2017, the CBRS Alliance entered into an agreement with the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA) \\"to cooperate closely in the advancement of the CBRS spectrum band\\". Deployments In January 2019 the Global Mobile Suppliers Association reported that there were 11 companies investing in CBRS trials in the US, including AT&T; Mobility, Boingo Wireless, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Google, Midcontinent Communications, T-Mobile US, US Cellular, Verizon Wireless and Windstream.GSA: LTE in Unlicensed and Shared Spectrum: Trials, Deployments and Devices (January 2019) Mobile Country Code 315 and Mobile Network Code 010 have been assigned for IMSIs in CBRS systems in the US. The LTE frequency band for CBRS in the US is referred to as band 48 in the 3GPP standards. In March 2019, Motorola Solutions launched Mototrbo Nitro, the first fully managed CBRS platform and product offerings. Mototrbo Nitro is a line of business-critical, CBRS communications and data products, which includes the first purpose-built OnGo portable radio. Deployment of Mototrbo Nitro infrastructure allows for services such as Nitro Cloud management, and is inter-operable with existing Mototrbo networks.

She attended graduate school in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester receiving a master's degree in 2001 and a Ph.D. in 2003 in Brain and Cognitive Sciences. From 2003 to 2005, Thompson did post- doctoral research with a teaching fellowship at the University of New South Wales School of Psychology, in Sydney, Australia. = Career = After completing a summer as a Research Fellow at the University of Rochester, Department of Brain and Cognitive Science in 2005, Thompson was an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY from August 2005 to August 2007. In September 2007, Thompson became an Associate Professor of Psychology at Monroe Community College, Department of Psychology, where her academic research interests branched into the psychology of eating and positive psychology, and where she also developed courses in those two subjects. She started teaching the Psychology of Eating and Body Image in 2008 and Positive Psychology in 2009, was tenured in 2013 and continued at Monroe until June, 2016. In the spring of 2016, Thompson became an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Rochester. In the fall of 2014, Thompson founded Bright Line Eating Solutions, LLC, an 8-week online weight loss program based on psychology and neuroscience with four core principles, called Bright Lines, of eating no sugar, no flour, only at meals, and only bounded quantities.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOMhDNWhzY Dr. Anthony Lim: Sugar: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Thompson has been the CEO since 2014. In 2015, Thompson became the President of the Board of the Institute for Sustainable Weight Loss.  Bright Line Eating  Thompson launched Bright Line Eating in 2014. The program represents a synthesis of Thompson's personal experience in multiple Twelve-step programs for food addiction and her research as a brain and cognitive scientist. The name of the program derives from the legal concept of Bright-line rules, \\"a clearly defined rule or standard, composed of objective factors, which leaves little or no room for varying interpretation. The purpose of a bright-line rule is to produce predictable and consistent results in its application.\\" The program defines four such rules: * no sugar * no flour * meals (designated times for eating, with abstinence from eating at all other times) * quantities (the bounding of the quantity of food taken, using some measurement device (e.g., a digital scale to weigh food, or, more simply, a plate to contain the meal) and provides a set of tools, plus social support media, to guide the participant through both the weight-loss phase and during the \\"maintenance\\" phase that follows.

Education and early life Peter Folkes was born in Beaminster, Dorset, England in November 1923. He studied painting at the West of England College of Art, Bristol (1941‚Äì50) with his education being interrupted, though not curtailed, by The Second World War. Career Military service, in World War II, took Folkes to Africa, Sicily and Italy, as a draughtsman in the Signal Corps; he was mentioned in dispatches. In September 1950 Folkes became senior art-master at King Edward VI School, Southampton and later, after a year painting in America on a Goldsmiths Travelling Scholarship, awarded in 1963, he took up the post of lecturer in painting at Southampton College of Art in 1964. In 1989 he became Head of Fine Art at the Southampton Institute of Higher Education where he worked until retirement. (Southampton College of Art was merged, leading to the Southampton Institute of Higher Education which, in turn, became the present Southampton Solent University). Works Peter Folkes began painting local scenes of Southampton when he moved there in 1950. His early sketches and paintings are of the estuaries of the rivers Test and Itchen, boatyards, the docklands and Southampton Water. In the late 1950s Folkes experimented with the range of new materials becoming available. His fascination with old weathered gravestones, their carvings and inscriptions, too, developed at this time. Church spires appear in his later, much more Cubist, water-colours. Visits to Portland in the early 1960s resulted in a series of works that show a shift towards Modernism. Folkes, here, used a limited palette of blues and browns to describe the quarries and cliffs. In 1964, whilst in America, a series of paintings emerged, inspired by the regular geometry of skyscrapers. Graham Blakesley of Gable Contemporary Art has written: ‚ÄúSpanning sixty years of artistic output across the 20th century, the influences on Peter Folkes are eminently identifiable in his work. From the academic discipline of the Classical Renaissance to the French Impressionists, from the mid-century Abstract Expressionists through to Pop Art and social realism of the sixties, Peter has always retained an ability to absorb ongoing external influences only to process his own personal style which re-emerges with artistic interest.\\" For the RWA Academicians' Questionnaire of October 2000, Peter Folkes said: \\"During the last twenty-five years I have been strongly influenced by Cubist painters, in particular Lyonel Feininger, Charles Demuth and Raoul Dufy during his Cubist period. Also the water-colours of Eric Ravilious.\\" Collections The paintings of Peter Folkes are located in private collections and in the public collections of the UK Government Art Collection, Arts Council of Great Britain, Southampton City Art Gallery The Royal West of England Academy, the Universities of Hull, Keele, Portsmouth, Southampton (both Southampton and Solent), and King Edward VI School Southampton. Awards and prizes In 1952 he was elected an Associate of the Royal West of England Academy and was made an Academician (RWA) seven years later. In 1963 he was awarded a Goldsmiths Travelling Scholarship (USA). In 1969 he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours after which he became Vice-President in 1989. He was joint winner of the Winsor & Newton painting prize in 1981 and 1983; in 1998 he won the prize for the best painting in the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours Exhibition. Personal life Peter Folkes married Muriel Giddings in Bromley in September 1949. The following year, in 1950, Folkes and his wife moved to Southampton where they lived thereafter. Folkes has two sons: Andrew born in 1953, eand Richard born in 1950, plus six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. He died in January 2019 at the age of 95.Peter Folkes RI, RWA, Hon.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three relatively small, pink flowers which have a labellum with three distinct lobes. Description Caladenia reptans subsp. reptans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which often grows in clumps. It has a single, hairy leaf, long and about wide with a purplish lower surface. Up to three pale to dark pink flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide and the lateral sepals are a similar size. The petals are long and wide and spread fan-like with the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and has three distinct lobes. The lateral lobes usually have three red stripes and the middle lobe has between four and ten short teeth on the sides. There are two rows of thick calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to early October. In areas of high rainfall it tends to only flower after fire but in drier areas it flowers in the absence of summer fires. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia reptans was first described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 2001, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies reptans and the description was published in Nuytsia.

The first Hotel Phoenix opened at the site in 1848 but closed when it was confiscated by the Germans during World War II. The building was after the war converted into a new headquarters for the Danish Communist Party and the newspaper Land og Folk. The building was acquired by Arp-Hansen Hotel Group in 1990 and reopened as a hotel the following year.. It is mentioned in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth, History =Gyldensten's mansion = Jean The Plessen Mansion The still undeveloped site at the corner of Bredgade and Dronningens Tv√¶rgade was in the middle of the 17th century owned by the pharmacist Esaias Fleischer. He was the owner of the L√∏ve Apotek (Copenhagen) Lopn Pharmacy on Amagertorv as well as property in several other locations in the city. In 1670, a few years after his death, it was sold to Hans Arenfeld, a nobleman and owner of Knivholt Manor at Frederikshavn. Rach and Eegberg in c. 1750 It was later acquired by commander of the Rotal Gorse Guards Samuel Christoph von Plessen. In circa 1780, he constructed a two-storey town mansion at the site. He left Copenhagen when the Toyal Horse Guards were moved to M√∏n in 1785 but kept the house in Bredgade. Its value was estimated at 16,000 Danish rigsdaler at the time of his death in 1704. Advertisement for Stadt Hamburg from c. 1838 The property was later acquired by count Jean Henri Huguetan Gyldensteen. He adapted the building in 1740. Gyldensten passed the house on to his illegitimate son Jean Henri Desmerci√®res in 1749. He constructed a new wing towards Dronningens Tv√¶rgade as an individual Tococo-style town mansion. At the turn of the 19th century it was owned by grocer Peder Erichsen. At this point it was the only privately owned building in Copenhagen whose facade featured a clock. =Hotel Stadt Hamburg= In 1837, the property was acquired by restaurateur and hotelier W. Murdoch from ¬ªStadet Lauenburg¬´ in Store Strandstr√¶de. He converted it into a hotel under the name ¬ªStadt Hamburg¬´. The shipbroking firm N. Schi√∏tt & Hochbrandt was based at Dronningens Tv√¶rgade 1-3 from 1820-46. It then moved to new premises at No. 10. =Hotel Phoenix opens= Hotel Phoenix in c. 1860 The Cavellier Hall in Hotel Phoenix, c. 1900 In 1847 it was acquired by an aktieselskab. The old building was demolished and Hotel Ph√∏nix opened in a new building in 1848. The hotel was frequently used for housing guests of the nobility as well as the royal family. The hotel was privately owned from 1883 to 1919. In 1891, Carl Neiiendam bought the hotel from the grocer Christopher Emil S√∏dring. He was appointed to Royal Court Hotelier after the hotel had been used for housing some of the guests for King Christian IX and Queen Louise's fold wedding in 1892. Carl Neiiendam sold the hotel in 1917. =Closure and reopening= The hotel in c. 1900 Hotel Phoenix was confiscated by the occupying German forces during World War II. The building was used as local headquarters of the German Navy. German soldiers on guard at the entrance to the confiscated hotel in 1945 In October 1945, a few months after the liberation, Hotel Phoenix was acquired by the Danish Communist Party. Ole Buhl and Harald Petersen were commissioned to adapt the building for its new use as party headquarters in 1946. The party's newspaper Land og Folk and several other associated activities were also based in the building. Arp- Hansen acquired the building in 1990.

Berns (born December 1, 1942) is a professor of surgery and cell biology at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, San Diego. Berns is a founder of the first Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP), the Beckman Laser Institute, the UCI Center for Biomedical Engineering, and the UCI Photonics Incubator. His pioneering work has focused on the use of laser technology in medical and biological research. He has developed tools and techniques for the surgical use of lasers, down to the level of manipulating single cells and individual chromosomes. Berns has published extensively on use of lasers in both biomedical research and medical treatment of illnesses including skin disorders, vascular disease, eye problems, and cancer. Education Berns received his B.S. from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in 1964, followed by his M.S. in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1968. From 1968-1970, he held a postdoctoral position at the Pasadena Foundation for Medical Research, Pasadena, California. Career Berns was an assistant professor in the department of zoology of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor from 1970 to 1972. He them joined the University of California, Irvine (UCI) as an associate professor and department chair in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology. He was named the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Professor in 1988. In addition to a number of appointments at the University of California, Irvine, he became an adjunct professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, San Diego in 2000. Berns founded the first Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP) at UCI in 1979. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a National Biotechnology Resource, the LAMP center's sophisticated laser microsurgery instruments could be used by cell biologists from across the country. Berns co-founded the Beckman Laser Institute at UCI in 1982, with support from Arnold Beckman. The nonprofit institute for translational research opened on June 4, 1986. Berns was its first director, serving from 1982-2003. Berns was also a founding director of the UCI Center for Biomedical Engineering, from 1999 to 2000, and founded the UCI Photonics Incubator in 1999. Research In 2006, Berns received the Biomedical Optics Lifetime Achievement Award at SPIE's International Symposium on Biomedical Optics, ‚Äúfor his contributions to the development and growth of laser microbeam technology, a major step towards establishing new tools for understanding laser interactions with biological tissues, which have resulted in significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment of disease.‚Äù Sometimes referred to as the \\"father of laser microbeams,\\" Berns has written over 480 articles and 6 books. In 1969, Berns published a generative paper on use of lasers for subcellular surgery in Nature. Using an argon laser with a phase-contrast microscope, small lesions were placed at specifically chosen sites on the chromosomes of cells sensitized with chemical fluorophores. In subsequent research, Berns and others found that Nd:YAG lasers could be used to cut organelles such as mitochondria or stress fibers without prior sensitization. This landmark study concluded that focusable laser light could have wide application to the ablation of cell components in biological systems. When combined with a light microscope to display the structures in a living cell, lasers could be used to selectively target those structures with minimum damage to surrounding structures. Since then Berns has investigated the basic interactions of light beams at the levels of tissues, cells, and molecules. He has developed tools and techniques such as \\"laser scissors\\" and \\"laser tweezers\\" for manipulation of structures within a living cell, that can be used for the examination of cell biology and treatment of molecular pathology.

The product is typically made with unripe, green bananas that are dried and then milled into banana flour. Banana pasta is a gluten-free food. The product can be dried for later cooking or can be cooked immediately after preparation. Banana pasta is cooked like standard pasta, typically by boiling it. A study found that banana pasta has a higher water absorption rate compared to standard pasta, which generates higher yields after cooking. In 2012, University of Bras√≠lia researchers found that banana pasta can be a useful product for those with celiac disease, and that compared to whole wheat pasta, banana pasta is lower in calories and fat, higher in protein, and less expensive to produce. The product has also shown promise as a means to utilize green bananas, which have few industrial uses and a low commercial value. History =University of Bras√≠lia study= In 2012, food scientists at the University of Bras√≠lia conducted a study involving the creation of a banana pasta using green bananas, which were milled into flour; they published their results in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In a taste test comprising 25 participants with celiac disease, a disease caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, and 50 without the disease, both groups favored the flavor of banana pasta compared to other gluten-free pastas, such as those prepared from brown rice, soybeans, quinoa, and potatoes. The group without celiac disease was also given pasta prepared from wheat flour, as a comparison. Favorable responses were higher among those with celiac disease, and was lower among those lacking the disease. Also, the non-celiac group \\"rated the green banana pasta the same as whole wheat pasta for flavor, aroma and appearance and liked the texture of the banana dish better\\". Compared to whole wheat pasta, the researchers found that banana pasta is higher in protein, lower in fat and calories, and less expensive to produce than whole wheat pasta. It was also suggested that banana pasta may contribute to controlling intestinal regularity and glycemic indexes because of the high levels of resistant starch in banana pasta. =Commercial production= In 2017, Tonya Ifill, an entrepreneur in Barbados, developed a banana pasta made with green bananas. Ifill stated that a significant aspect of developing the product was determining a proper amount of water to add to the banana flour, and that water temperature was an important factor as well. For example, if the water was too hot, the pasta crumbled. See also * List of banana dishes * List of pasta References Further reading * Rodrigues da Silva, Aline; (et al.)

The 1st Rockbridge Artillery were organized as part of the Stonewall Brigade in late April 1861 in Lexington, Virginia, from men of Rockbridge County. The battery fought at the First Battle of Manassas, supporting the brigade in its defense of Henry House Hill on 21 July. The battery provided artillery support for the brigade in the First Battle of Kernstown, the Battle of Port Republic, the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Second Battle of Manassas, and the Battle of Antietam. In October 1862 the 1st Rockbridge Artillery was detached from the brigade, and from that point in the war would be part of corps artillery battalions. The battery fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Siege of Petersburg. After the Confederate abandonment of Petersburg, the 1st Rockbridge Artillery joined in the retreat and surrendered at Appomattox Court House on 9 April 1865.  History  = Formation = The seventy men of the 1st Rockbridge Artillery were organized in April 1861 by VMI professor John McCausland. William N. Pendleton took command of the battery in late April after McCausland was transferred to command another unit. The battery was initially equipped with two 6-pounders from VMI and two guns from Richmond. Pendleton named the first four guns \\"Matthew\\", \\"Mark\\", \\"Luke\\", and \\"John\\", after the Apostles. On 11 May, the battery departed for Harpers Ferry, where it joined Thomas J. Jackson's Virginia brigade, which was later called the Stonewall Brigade. = First Manassas = On 18 July, the battery moved east with the Stonewall Brigade to link up with Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard's troops at Manassas Junction. On 21 July, during the First Battle of Manassas, Pendleton's Battery was among the Confederate batteries defending the key position of the battle, Henry House Hill. The battery was visited by Confederate president Jefferson Davis, who had gone to Manassas to watch the battle, during the Union retreat. In the aftermath of the battle, the battery received captured Union cannon.

With a few other women, she formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri and an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis. She organized a society known as the Freedmen's Aid Society, and served as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association. Early life and education Rebecca Naylor was born in Woodsfield, Ohio, November 10, 1826, the daughter of Robert F. Naylor (born in Pennsylvania, but lived mostly in Virginia) and Mary Bettis Archbold (of Virginia). Till the age of 14, she studied at Monroe Institute and the Marietta Seminary. The family then removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, and later to Quincy, Illinois. In Quincy, in 1844, while still a teenager, she married William Tweedy Hazard, of Newport, Rhode Island. Career The husband was not a college man. His occupation during most of his life was that of a manufacturer (flour mills). Five children were born to the couple. In 1850, the family removed to St. Louis, Missouri. For many years, domestic affairs claimed the attention of Hazard. =Philanthropist= In 1854, she united with other women in establishing an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis.

At the breaking out of the American Civil War, Hazard, who was an ardent Unionist, engaged in hospital work, including the care of sick and wounded soldiers. She helped to organize the Union Aid Society and served as a member of the executive committee in the great Western Sanitary Fair. Finding that large numbers of African American women and children were by the exigencies of war helplessly stranded in the city, Hazard sought means for their relief. They were in a deplorable condition, and, as the supplies contributed to the soldiers could not be used for them, she organized a society known as the Freedmen's Aid Society, for their special benefit. At the close of the war, that society was merged in an orphan asylum. Closely following that work came the establishment of a home for women, which was maintained under great difficulties for some years, before being abandoned. With Mary Foote Henderson, Hazard co-founded the School of Design for women in the field of decorative art. It later became part of the Woman's Exchange. =Suffragist and writer= Deeply impressed with the disabilities under which women labor in being deprived of political rights, Hazard, Virginia Minor, Anna Clapp, Lucretia Hall, and Penelope Allen, met in May 1867, and formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, the first society bearing the name, and having for its sole object the ballot for woman. Devoted to this cause, Hazard gave it her attention for many years, filling the various offices of the association, and also serving one term as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association. She authored the popular suffragist song, \\"Give the Ballot to the Mothers\\" which was sung by a choir at the first convention of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association in November 1889. In 1870, the city of St. Louis, falling under evil counsels, framed into law the Social Evil Ordinance. Realizing the danger to good morals, Hazard at once engaged in the conflict for the overthrow of law. Three years later, she met with other women and organized an appeal to the legislature through a petition campaign to rescind it. The law was repealed by the Missouri Legislature in 1874. The call for the formation of the association for the advancement of women, known as the Woman's Congress, was signed by Hazard, and she continued to be a member of that body, contributing at various times to its sessions the following papers: \\"Home Studies for Women,\\" \\"Business Opportunities for Women,\\" and \\"Crime and its Punishment.\\" Personal life In 1844 Rebecca N. Hazard married William T. Hazard (1812-1879), of Newport, Rhode Island. Five children were born to this union, among whom: Charles F. Hazard (1847-1877), Nathaniel Hazard (1848-1928), William T. Hazard (1851-1914). In 1850, the family moved to St. Louis, Missouri. After the death of her husband, in 1879, Hazard mostly retired from public work, but at her home in Kirkwood, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, a class of women met each week for study and mutual improvement. As a result of these studies, Hazard published two papers on the \\"Divina Commedia.\\" She also wrote a volume on the war period in St. Louis. Her contributions to local and other papers were numerous. Hazard was a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and of the American Akademe, a philosophical society having headquarters in Jacksonville, Illinois. She died in Kirkwood in 1912. She died on March 1, 1912, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri.

The level of corruption used to be considerably lower in Eritrea than in many other African countries. Indeed, it was traditionally viewed as having a ‚Äústrong ‚Äòanti-corruption‚Äô culture‚Äù and considered relatively ‚Äúegalitarian and corruption-free.‚Äù In 2006, a report by Bertelsmann Stiftung stated that corruption, as of that date, was not a serious problem within Eritrea. While noting that there had been ‚Äúcases of corruption since independence,‚Äù they existed on a negligible level, although politically-motivated corruption allegations have been made. But, in fact, corruption is said to have been growing steadily worse ever since 1998, when, not long after the end of its decades-long war of independence, a border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war. Another source stated in 2015 that over the previous decade, corruption had become ingrained in Eritrean everyday life, with bribes required for most government services. Other alleged types of corruption include the payments of ransoms for hostages ‚Äúunder the eyes of the government.‚Äù On Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2014, Eritrea ranked at 166th out of 175 countries. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being highly corrupt and 100 very clean, its score in recent years has declined from 25 in 2012 to 20 in 2013 to 18 in 2014. Background Eritrea's location along the Red Sea Eritrea was a part of Ethiopia until 1991, when Eritreans won a civil war that had lasted for thirty years and were granted independence. After a UN-supervised referendum, in which Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993. At that time, Eritrea had a weak private sector with few skilled workers, a situation that led the government to take steps to build a strong private sector. During the 1990s, the private sector began to flourish and the economy grew significantly, causing many observers in the West to view Eritrea ‚Äúas a beacon of Africa.‚Äù The decades of war, however, had planted the seeds of many social and economic problems, corruption among them. A 1998 border conflict with Ethiopia led to another war, which ended in 2000. Despite the official end of the war, warfare has continued on a lower scale. Meanwhile the regime has been accused of clamping down on free speech, shutting down private newspapers, shrinking the private sector, and imposing indefinite military service. All of these moves against individual liberty, human rights, and the free market have been factors in increased corruption. As of 2006, Eritrea had not yet held free elections; the Constitution adopted at the time of independence had not yet been implemented; the president was ruling by decree; the National Assembly had last met in 2002; opposition parties were prohibited, as were civic organizations, the right to assemble, and freedom of the press; the judiciary was inactive; the ruling party, government, and military formed ‚Äúone single conglomerate of power‚Äù with ‚Äúa low level of transparency.‚Äù Since 2001, civil liberties had been ‚Äúgradually restricted,‚Äù with ‚Äúnumerous arbitrary arrests‚Äù and human-rights violations on an ‚Äúalarming‚Äù scale. From 126th place on Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index, Eritrea dropped to 134th in 2012 and 166th in 2014. The increase in state ownership in Eritrea has been critiqued as a step back for economic freedom and for doing business generally, partly because it has caused rising corruption. The 2012 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom named Eritrea the second-worst country in sub-Saharan Africa for economic liberty. The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Project Index for 2011 ranked Eritrea at 180th, with only three countries, Guinea Bissau, Central African Republic, and Chad, scoring worse. It has been suggested that since the government maintains control over foreign exchange, friends of government personnel are allowed to bring goods into the country and sell them at great profit, thus increasing opportunities for corruption. Nonetheless, economic growth has been very strong since 2011, largely because of country's mining boom, which has placed Eritea among the fastest growing nations on earth; but corruption has kept this new wealth from reaching as many people as it might have. At the same time, the country has also been ravaged by drought. Factors Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki meets with former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld Among the supposed factors breeding corruption in Eritrea is the intense concentration of power. The Eritrean Constitution calls for a separation of powers among the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches, but this has never been implemented. Isaias Afwerki, who has been president since 1993, has usurped the Congress's constitutional powers and is generally viewed as being all-powerful. The 19-member Executive Council consists entirely of presidential cronies. Eritrea's business community is composed mainly of personal associates of the regime's economic officials, fronts for top-level officials of the ruling party, and people who ‚Äúenjoy the patronage of senior officers of the security and military establishments.‚Äù The government ‚Äúcontrols all foreign exchanges‚Äù and is ‚Äúvirtually the only legal source of imports,‚Äù a situation that makes it possible for military and government officials to profit by collaborating with illegal smugglers. Similarly, the country's strict laws about importation and the inconsistency in the granting of exit visas enable customs and immigration officials to profit from bribery and money laundering. A 2014 report has described institutional corruption has \\"erode[d] the foundations\\" of economic development. The state's control on the economy allows for little private investment, while extremely low government salaries encourage corruption. An additional factor in the spread and persistence of corruption is the lack of an independent press to report on it. Eritrea has been described as ‚ÄúAfrica's biggest prison for the media.‚Äù The only news media are government-owned, and experts compare them to the Soviet media. Judiciary The 1997 Eritrean Constitution calls for a judiciary that is independent from parliament. None of this has been implemented, however. Instead there is a judicial system consisting of two separate court systems: Regular Courts that adjudicate disputes based on law and Special Courts that adjudicate disputes that are not based on law.Kjetil Tronvoll; Daniel Rezene Mekonnen (2014). The African Garrison State: Human Rights & Political Development in Eritrea. Boydell & Brewer Ltd. pp. 46‚Äì. . The latter courts are supposed to address corruption, but are themselves considered by Amnesty International and other experts to be ‚Äúone of the most corrupt and inhumane court systems‚Äù globally.Vernon Valentine Palmer; Mohamed Y. Mattar (22 July 2016). Mixed Legal Systems, East and West. Routledge. pp. 158‚Äì. . Military A 2013 report by Transparency International UK called Eritrea the ‚Äúmost militarised country in Africa,‚Äù with about 20% of its population in uniform. For this reason, many have called Eritrea the 'North Korea' of Africa. The army is not only large but also one of the nine most corrupt armed forces in the world, along with Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, the DRC, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. According to TI, there is a possible scheme in place of public funds earmarked for \\"secret\\" military purposes in the name of national security which are in truth appropriated illicitly. There are said to be several military-owned businesses with ‚Äúunauthorised private enterprise by military personnel.‚Äù Nationalization In 1996, Eritrea's government declared that all land would henceforth be considered the property of the state and would be re-distributed in accordance with need. It then confiscated a good deal of private land and turned it over to former soldiers, foreign investors, and resettlement programs. The 1990s also saw the privatization of some companies, and since 2000 the government has increasingly intervened in the economy and commerce and propagandized against private trade and business. These activities have involved a considerable amount of favoritism, kickbacks, and other forms of corruption. Mining Industry In July 2013, Martin Plaut reported that since 2011, the government had earned over $900 million from the Bisha gold mine, but it was not known what had happened to the money. Even as the state was reportedly amassing huge mining profits, Plaut charged, poverty and hardship were worsening. ‚ÄúThere is some evidence,‚Äù he stated, ‚Äúthat show the [government] is gambling and squandering state resources without any accountability.‚Äù Persecution of Christians Eritrea, as of 2011, was one of 8 nations considered to be Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) by the US State Department owing to the abuse and persecution of Christians other than those belonging to the three recognized denominations: the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. ‚ÄúUp to 3,000 Christians from unregistered church groups were held in detention‚Äù in 2011, according to Amnesty International. Between 2002 and 2011, many churches were closed, and tens of thousands of Christians fled the country; state-owned media have told the public that suppressed Christian groups were being paid by the CIA to destabilize the government, and have actively encouraged citizens to turn in persons whom they suspect of holding prayer meetings in their homes. This mass religious persecution has provided an opportunity for extensive corruption of a specific kind on the part of ruling-party politicians and military officials, who have arrested suspected Christians under the country's official anti-Christian policy and held them in prisons, unofficial detention centers, and military barracks in exchange for ransom. Anti-corruption efforts There is reportedly no real organized effort in Eritrea to combat corruption. The regime has been described as using a ‚Äúso-called war on corruption‚Äù to crack down on political dissenters and opponents. In May 2015, the president urged a group of party and government officials to discuss American and European pressure on Eritrea to reform its government and release detainees, yet when some of those officials proposed that the government reform in certain areas to appease Western nations that send aid to Eritrea, the president underscored the need to stand up to pressure from the ‚Äúhegemonic West.‚Äù Business leaders in Eritrea were reportedly ‚Äúshivering with fear‚Äù over what the president's comments might signify; it was said to be unclear if the rumors signified a wave of jailing or not. Shortly after the aforementioned meeting, the president addressed the country on the 24th anniversary of Eritrean independence, denouncing ‚Äúdeluded and corrupt‚Äù state officials who, he charged, amassed wealth illegitimately. ‚ÄúSuch deplorable practices of corruption and theft,‚Äù said the president, ‚Äúmust be combated vigorously.‚Äù  See Also * International Anti-Corruption Academy * Group of States Against Corruption * International Anti-Corruption Day * ISO 37001 Anti-bribery management systems * United Nations Convention against Corruption * OECD Anti-Bribery Convention * Transparency International References External links Eritrea Eritrean society Crime in Eritrea Politics of Eritrea Eritrea Eritrean law Economy of Eritrea Government of Eritrea ","title":"Corruption in Eritrea"},{"id":"53488076","text":"The Tripartite Indenture of 1856, was an agreement between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the City of Boston, and the Boston Water Power Company signed December 11, 1856.
