A multi-access key enables the user to freely choose the characteristics that are convenient to evaluate for the item to be identified.Pankhurst, R. J. 1991. Practical Taxonomic Computing.Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press. Although good single- access keys will try to start with characters that are reliable, convenient to observe and generally available throughout most of the year, it is often impossible to achieve this for all taxa in a key. A multi-access key lets the user adapt the key to the particular organism that is being identified and to the circumstances of identification (e.g. field or laboratory). Multi-access keys may be printed in various way (tabular, matrix, formula style, etc.) but are more commonly used as computer-aided, interactive keys. Alternative terms Alternative terms used for multi-access keys are \\"random-access key\\", \\"multi-entry key\\", polyclave, \\"matrix key\\", \\"tabular key\\", \\"synoptic key\\". Some of these terms should be avoided in this sense, however: * \\"Multi-entry\\" keys allow the free choice of characters only in the first step, whereas in a typical multi-access key the choice of characters used for identification can be repeated multiple times (reducing the number of remaining taxa each time). The single step of selecting one or multiple criteria is followed by a dichotomous key for the species remaining after this step. * The terms \\"tabular key\\" and \\"matrix key\\" are best limited to a tabular presentation format of multi-access keys.Fig. 19.6 in Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press. * The term \\"synoptic key\\" has an older definition, defining it as a key reflecting taxonomic classification and opposed to diagnostic keys arranged solely for the convenience of identification. History Interactive multi-access keys are a high-tech descendant of polyclaves (\\"card keys\\"). Historically various styles of encoding features of species (such as flower color) on punch cards were used. Holes or notches in these cards would allow the user to choose cards based on characters observed in a specimen until only one card remained, yielding a tentative identification.  Advantages  Multi-access keys largely serve the same purpose as single-access (dichotomous or polytomous) keys, but have many advantages, especially in the form of computer-aided, interactive keys.Dallwitz, M.J., Paine, T.A. and Zurcher, E.J. 2000 onwards. Principles of interactive keys. The user of an interactive key may select or enter information about an unidentified specimen in any order, allowing the computer to interactively rule out possible identifications of the entity and present the user with additional helpful information and guidance on what information to enter next. Full-featured interactive keys may readily be equipped with images, audio, video, supplemental text, much-simplified language in conjunction with technical language and hyperlinks to assist the user with understanding of both entities and features.Brasher, J. W. 2006. The Southern Rocky Mountain Interactive Flora (SRMIF) and factors correlated with recognition of plants and mammals. University of Northern Colorado, Ph. D. Thesis. Interactive keys remedy some of the problems outlined above. The problem of language translations is made easier in interactive keys because characters and states frequently are simplified with less reliance on the intricate nuances of long strings of words. The problem above where only one sex of an unknown specimen is at hand is mitigated because the user can simply use other characters. The problem of not having a reliable and complete description to compare a specimen with is alleviated by full service interactive keys that include or link to such descriptions and authoritatively identified images. The problem above about complete descriptions not being available in the field is also remedied if the interactive key is on a laptop or handheld computer. With paper-based dichotomous keys the discovery of a new species renders the key incomplete; interactive keys are easily updated by adding information for newly discovered species and reposting computer files on the internet. Many different computer programs for interactive keys are currently available, some of which are truly multi-access, and some not.Dallwitz, M.J. 1996 onwards. Programs for interactive identification and information retrieval.Dallwitz, M.J. 2000 onwards. A comparison of interactive identification programs.

Early life  Field was born in London, England. His father was the owner and managing director of Siegmund Robinow & Son Ltd, a company in London and Hamburg, which at that time manufactured exclusive garments. After attending Stagenhoe Park near Hitchin from 1953‚Äì1958 he attended The King's School, Canterbury from 1958‚Äì1960, then Aiglon College in Switzerland from 1960‚Äì1963. Field attended the California College of the Arts in Oakland, California early in 1965 to major in Industrial design and graduated with a Bachelor's degree.Official CCA Alumni Directory - Roger Field Field also completed courses in Film & Television at San Francisco State University. In 1969, he filmed the California College of the Arts at the request of Harry X. Ford, the president of the college in 16mm (titled To Be An Artist),California College of the Arts (CCAC) \\"To be an Artist\\" film with Field's name in credits as director, etc. which included poet Michael McClure, an English professor at CCAC at the time. The film, which was financed by the college, was later shown on television. Field, an aviation enthusiast who had received a Private Pilot Licence with a multi-engine rating in California, then moved to Munich to work on the newly formed Airbus project, contributing to the interior design of the aircraft. While in Munich, Field developed drill units reducing the risk of cross contamination for the dental industry ( and other patents). Field is currently marketing his professional 35mm film camera invention for cinema and television. The camera considerably improves image quality by using unperforated 35mm film (which allows much wider exposed images), (). The camera could be used with Field's camera light screening unit (matte box) which been manufactured for many years by the Chrosziel Filmtechnik company in Germany. ().  Foldaxe  While designing passenger seats for the Airbus in 1975, Field had the idea for a folding electric guitar which he named \\"Foldaxe,\\" for being transported as hand luggage under an aircraft seat. Guitarist Chet Atkins inspired Field in 1975 to design a folding guitar without the string tension changing and going out of tune. Field solved this problem by designing a unique mechanism hidden in the guitar which, once the guitar has been tuned, keeps the string tension constant when folding and unfolding it so that it is always ready to play when unfolded. Atkins appeared with Les Paul on television with the Foldaxe on Jane Pauley's The Today Show and on Entertainment This Week. Field himself appeared several times on television shows with the Foldaxe, unfolding it and then playing it amplified. The Foldaxe was reviewed in Industrial Design magazine, winning the Designers' Choice Award sponsored by I. D. MagazineDesigners' Choice Award Certificate in 1980 for the entire USA. In 1980, noted industrial designer Raymond Loewy sent Field a letter congratulating him on the design of the Foldaxe.Letter from Raymond Loewy to Field, 22 March 1980 regarding the Foldaxe The Foldaxe was featured in Atkins's book Me and My Guitars.Atkins, Chet and Cochran, Russ. (2003). \\"Me and My Guitars\\". Milwaukee. Hal Leonard Corporation. . They have been played by many famous musicians and personalities who have been photographed with them, including Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Lenny Breau, Paco de Lucia, John McLaughlin, Hank Marvin, Paul McCartney, David Copperfield, James Burton and Albert Lee. The interest in The Foldaxe by Hank Marvin, guitarist for The Shadows, led Field to be the instigator in 2001 of the reunion of the Shadows.World News Network article 16 July 2004 with photo of Hank Marvin of The Shadows and Roger C. Field holding Foldaxe] Jet Harris of The Shadows addressed Field's intention to do so in the Otago Daily Times after meeting with Field and Bruce Welch near Tilburg in the Netherlands. Harris and Welch supported Field's efforts to influence Hank Marvin to return to the band. Field developed a guitar technique he calls Tap-Picking, a technique of adding additional bass notes to guitar fingerpicking by tapping and pulling-off the bass strings with the left hand at times when the right hand thumbpick and fingers are on the treble strings and cannot play bass notes. In the text of his tablature booklet with the LP Dadi's Picking Lights Up Nashville, Volume 1, Marcel Dadi cited Field's playing ability as inspiration for the tune Roger Chesterfield.

It includes a handmade Brazilian rosewood case, a 73-key weighted wooden keyboard with polyphonic aftertouch, comprehensive backlit LCD displays for instrument programming, and solid push- buttons as opposed to the membrane buttons on the DX7. Only 140 were produced. The Yamaha DX5 is a derivative of the DX1, introduced in 1985 with a list price of US$3,495. It has the same synth engine, but lacks the DX1's fully weighted keys, polyphonic aftertouch, aesthetics (rosewood case and wooden keyboard), and user interface features (parameter displays).

During the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany in May 1940, she escorted the Dutch submarine O-13 to England. Later that month, on 29-31 May, she escorted the Dutch passenger ship Batavier II to Cherbourg, to pick up 280 Dutch troops. Refitted and rearmed in 1940, she was assigned to serve with the British Royal Navy's 11th Minesweeping Flotilla, stationed in Milford Haven, Wales. Later in 1941 she served with the 9th Flotilla off Portland. She mainly acted as buoy ship, marking the swept channels. From October 1941, she swept acoustic mines off Harwich and the Isle of Wight. Later she was sent to Scotland and served as an escort ship with a British submarine flotilla. On 26 March 1943 she was transferred to the Royal Navy. She was returned to the Netherlands in 1946 and was recommissioned in the Royal Netherlands Navy. She sailed for the Dutch East Indies where she served as patrol ship until 1950. After her return, she was rebuilt as boom defence vessel. Struck in 1961, she was then transferred to the Zeekadetkorps Nederland (Dutch Sea Cadets).

It is located along the Old Santa Cruz Highway, east of State Route 17. History California became an American territory in 1846. The earliest known permanent white settler in what became Patchen was Charles Henry \\"Mountain Charley\\" McKiernan. In the 1850s and 1860s, McKiernan built roads throughout his property on the summit of the mountains and operated a toll road down an old Indian trail near the site. In 1850, McKiernan settled near the lagoon about one mile south. On May 8, 1854, McKiernan and John Taylor, a neighbor, were hunting with Taylor's dog. They both shot at a grizzly bear and McKiernan hit the bear but only dazed it. Not having time to reload his gun, McKiernan hit the bear over the head with his rifle until it broke. The enraged bear rose up and made a snap at Charley, catching him over the left eye and forehead, crushing his skull and tearing out a piece about five by three inches. Three San Jose doctors crafted a silver plate from two Mexican pesos and patched the hole in Charley's head without the benefit of anesthetics. Grizzly bears were reportedly hunted into extinction in California; the last reported sighting of a grizzly in the Santa Cruz Mountains was in November 1885 near Bonny Doon. McKiernan lived until January 16, 1892. Directly across the road from the town's site is California Historical Landmark marker #448 commemorating the town and the legend of \\"Mountain Charley.\\" This was the first settlement in the area and centered on the Post Office, called Patchen. The origins of the name Patchen may go back to ancient times in what is now Patching Parish in Sussex, England. People by the name Patching, Patchen, and Patchin have been listed in that area since the 800 A.D. In 1634, Joseph Patching came to the U.S. and most of the Patchens in America can be traced to him. The name reached the San Francisco Bay Area by way of a famous racehorse named \\"George M. Patchen\\" and his son, \\"Smith Patchen,\\" nicknamed \\"California Patchen,\\" because of his good showing in California in 1862 and again in 1867 in San Jose, San Francisco, and Sacramento. The post office name appears on government records as having been established at Patchen on March 28, 1872. The post office operated until November 30, 1929. One of the first postmasters was D.C. Feely; in 1885, he represented Patchen at the American Exposition at New Orleans. Feely took a polished wood collection, a soil sample from his farm, and a large exhibit of fresh fruit provided by the local fruit growers. Road named for a novel by Jack London. The Feely Ranch, located about a quarter mile north of Patchen, was a favored vacation spot of writer Jack London (1876‚Äì1916). London wrote some of his works while vacationing at the ranch. The area is still identified on the official Santa Clara County Assessor's map as \\"Call of the Wild\\" (the name of Jack London's famous early novel) and there is a road by the same name north of Patchen. The Edgemont Hotel was located in Patchen and operated by Mr. and Mrs. L.N. Scott. It was located in the flat area near the road, about where the main parking lot for the Christmas tree farm is today. In 1855, the California Stage Company was awarded the United States mail contract from San Jose to Santa Cruz and Patchen became the place to change horses. One of the most famous drivers on the mountain route was Charley Parkhurst, who drove over the mountain roads about 1868. Like other stage drivers, Parkhurst wore a heavy muffler, gloves, a buffalo skin coat and cap. Also, like other drivers, Parkhurst had a sharp throaty whistle, used like a horn to warn others that the stage was just around the corner. For these reasons \\"Charley\\" was able to hide her identity until her death. The stage was held up at Patchen on the afternoon of April 1, 1874. After the second robbery in the same area on April 28, 1874 the culprits were captured and sent off to the state prison at San Quentin with the help of \\"Mountain Charley\\" and the local posse. From the 1880s to the early 1900s vacationers, going into the mountains to places such as the Edgemont Hotel in Patchen or to Santa Cruz, filled the roads with horses and wagons. A narrow gauge railroad opened in 1880 from Los Gatos, along the Los Gatos Creek, to Wright's Station about a mile east of Patchen. From Wright's Station it went through a two mile long tunnel to Laurel, then through other tunnels to Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz. The Southern Pacific bought the railroad around 1900. At 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, the most disastrous earthquake in California history shook the area. Roads were blocked by landslides, bridges were broken, houses and hotels were shaken to the ground, and the railroad was destroyed. Shifts in the nearby San Andreas Fault caused significant offsets and fissures, especially in Wrights. The railroad was rebuilt and continued to operate until early 1940, when severe storms blocked the route. Southern Pacific considered rebuilding the railroad again, then decided to abandon it. The same year State Route 17 was completed and bypassed Patchen, contributing to its decline. In 1949, one of the three buildings which remained from the original town of Patchen was torn down by Paul von Ahnen, who used its hand-hewn timbers to build his house, across the road from the present Christmas tree farm. The building had been the old stage station, built in the 1870s. On December 29, 1957, fire destroyed the building which had been erected by Joseph Fowler in 1876 as the post office. Fowler had kept the office in his home for the four years prior to that time. The chimney of the old post office stood until 5:04 p.m. on October 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake brought it crashing to the ground after more than one hundred years. The barn, the last remaining building, was disassembled and reassembled on a new foundation in 1985 and is in the process of restoration by the current owner. The huge concrete reservoir located on the property was fed by springs and used as the water supply for the town. The land where the town once stood was purchased, piece by piece, during the late 1960s and early 1970s by the current owner and converted to a Christmas tree farm to preserve it from development.Patchen, California - History of this early Santa Cruz Mountain town Patchen Christmas Tree Farm The Christmas tree farm on the site of Patchen is one of the few farms that produces Monterey pines. It also grows Sierra redwoods and the ever-popular Douglas firs. The farm preserves relics from Patchen's heyday, including the water supply reservoir, a historical landmark plaque, and remnants of a bar and hotel. Owner Jim Beck started buying little pieces of land in the 1960s. He told the Saratoga News that his \\"original motivation was because there was a lot of explosive growth in the mountains and I didn't want to see all that development going on around me. I considered growing wine grapes or kiwis, but I decided on Christmas trees. This is like an overgrown hobby for me.\\" A frequent danger in the Santa Cruz Mountains is forest fires. In the mid-1980s, a forest fire came so close to the farm that the trees were threatened. Beck rewarded the firefighters who put the fire out with free Christmas trees for life.Saratoga News  Christmas Tree Farms Patchen Pass Nearby the town's site is Patchen Pass, the highest point on Highway 17, with an elevation of above sea level.Map of Patchen Pass This pass is sometimes covered for hours or even days with snow.

Bredow's lifework became famous only after his death. It comprises ca. 1000 documented works (watercolour paintings, coloured chalk drawings, oil paintings and figurines) and numerous previously unreleased drawings.(MEISSNER/TAVERNIER 1995) \\"Bredow‚Äôs best works are classical in their simplicity and balance and are equal or quite often even superior to Schmidt- Rottluff‚Äôs late black-rimmed watercolour paintings, for instance\\".(HORNIG 1996, 531) The artist is considered to be \\"one of the greatest discoveries of the German art market during the 90‚Äôs\\".(M√úLLER 2001)  Life  1930‚Äì1934: he studied at the arts and crafts school in Berlin and took lessons with the graphic artist Hans Orlowski (1894‚Äì1967), the costume and stage designer Harold Bengen and the painter Max Kaus (1891‚Äì1977). After finishing his vocational education he became a painter and graphic artist for film, advertisement, fashion and theatre in Berlin. He was befriended with Bogislav Barlog and was acquainted with Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. 1940‚Äì1942: he worked as art teacher in Berlin, afterwards did his military service in the German Armed Forces. 1949: he became teacher for costume design and taught drawing and painting at the municipal technical college for textile industry and fashion. 1952‚Äì1954: he was art master at the vocational school Berlin-Neukoelln and in 1954 director of the sketch courses at the dressmaker's guild Berlin. Since 1955 he had been working as art teacher at private and public schools (Bad Sachsa 1955‚Äì1964; Langeoog 1957‚Äì1958; Hinterzarten 1959; Oberhausen 1961‚Äì1964, 1966‚Äì1971; Bad Honnef 1964‚Äì1966; Schloss Schwarzenberg 1971‚Äì1973; since 1973 at the public boarding school of Lower Saxony in Esens/ East Frisia). On 17 November 1973 Bredow died during an eye operation in Bremen. He was interred in Nienburg. Bredlow's estate became Sofie Walter's (‚Ä† 2005) property by order of the local court in Aurich. In 1989 the art collection Tumulka (Munich) took over the largest part of Bredow's works. The artist's written estate has been kept safe in the archive for fine arts of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg since 1992.  Artistic Development  Bredow is an \\"artist of the lost generation\\", who were born during the turn of the century and due to the confusion during the world wars and the artistic dictatorship of the National Socialists cannot be classified to a movement that belongs to abstraction or the Art Informel, which were accepted after 1945. Like other artist of this generation (Eduard Bargheer, Werner Gilles, Werner Heldt, Xaver Fuhr, Hans Puhrmann, Philipp Bauknecht, Hermann Teuber, Alfons Klein, Heinrich Steiner, Wendelin Schied etc.), who were around 40 or 50 years old, Bredow also took up the techniques of cubism, abstraction and especially of expressionism, when he continued his work after 1945. From this he developed his post-expressionist style, whose foundations he laid in 1955 and which led to artistically mature and independent late works of art from 1960/1 until his early death in 1973. Bredow did not focus on representing a certain motif. Concerning themes he, as a draughtsman, preferred sketched nature observations and romanced figuration in the foreground. As a watercolour artist he favoured the condensed visual experience of landscape or still life and in oil paintings the depiction of idealised or sometimes abstract females. The dominating theme in his coloured chalk drawings are figurative, such as depictions of Christ and the saints. Journeys play an important role in artistic advancement. In 1941 and 1949 Bredow visited the Baltic Sea and in 1957-158 the North Sea (Langeoog). In 1955 he took up an invitation from consul Thomas Entz, a ship-owner from Flensburg, and went on a cruise across the Mediterranean to Algeria, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. In the museums of Paris (1939, 1958‚Äì1973) he came face to face with modern masterpieces. In Spain (1958‚Äì1967), Italy (1964‚Äì1971) and Ticino (1959, 1972) he was enthralled by nature and landscape. His travel experiences find graphical expression in his travel diary (Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg) and his watercolour paintings: picturesque places, mountains, coastal landscapes, harbours with boats, fruits and flowers, but rarely humans. His pictures are influenced by his search for motifs typical of a country and they very often express his desire for colour and harmony. Particularly in his watercolour paintings Bredow increasingly discovered colour as a means to form his works, which are characterised by a combination of increased spontaneity and a rush of colour especially during his mature period. They show the tension between bright almost glowing colours and scarcely outlined forms. In his coloured chalk drawings and oil paintings Bredow explores abstracting representationalism, which is reminiscent of Werner Gilles' geometrical use of forms and Ernst Wilhelm Nay's abstract expressionism.  Exhibitions (selection)  Bredow displayed his works only once in his lifetime (1954 participation in a group exhibition at the Kunstamt Berlin-Wilmersdorf). Not until his death did exhibitions of his works attract interest: * 1976 Bremen, Bankhaus Martens und Weyhausen * 1977 Worpswede, Galerie in der Lindenallee * 1978 Nienburg, Museum der Stadt * 1979 Berlin, Haus am Kleistpark * 1991 Chemnitz, St√§dt.

The technology it uses is based on the theory of agent-based computational economics (ACE), the computational study of economic processes modeled as dynamic systems of interacting heterogeneous agents. Altreva's Adaptive Modeler and other agent- based models are used to simulate financial markets to capture the complex dynamics of a large diversity of investors and traders with different strategies, different trading time frames, and different investment goals. Agent-based models based on heterogeneous and boundedly rational (learning) agents have shown to be able to explain the empirical features of financial markets better than traditional financial models that are based on representative rational agents.  Technology  The software creates an agent-based model for a particular stock, consisting of a population of trader agents and a virtual market. Each agent represents a virtual trader/investor and has its own trading rule and funds. The model is then evolved step by step in the following way: At every step a new (historical) real market price is imported. All agents evaluate their trading rule and place orders on the virtual market. The virtual market then determines the clearing price and executes all matching orders. The clearing price is taken as the forecast for the next step real market price. (So the virtual market serves as a one-step- ahead prediction market for the real market). This process is repeated for every new received real market price. Meanwhile, the trading rules evolve through a special adaptive form of genetic programming. The forecasts are thus based on the behavior of the entire market instead of only the best performing trading rule. This intends to increase the robustness of the model and its ability to adapt to changing market circumstances. To avoid overfitting (or curve-fitting) to historical data - and unlike many other techniques used in trading software such as optimizing of trading rules by repeated backtesting, genetic algorithms and neural networks - Adaptive Modeler does not optimize trading rules on historical data. Instead its models evolve incrementally over the available price data so that agents experience every price change only once (as in the real world). Also there is no difference in the processing of historical and new price data. Therefore, there is no specific reason to expect that a model's back-tested historical performance is better than its future performance (unlike when trading rules have been optimized on historical data). The historical results can therefore be considered more meaningful than results demonstrated by techniques based on optimization.  Examples and use cases  In an example model for the S&P; 500 index, Adaptive Modeler demonstrates significant risk-adjusted excess returns after transaction costs. On back-tested historical price data covering a period of 58 years (1950‚Äì2008) a compound average annual return of 20.6% was achieved, followed by a compound average annual return of 22.2% over the following 6 year out-of-sample period (2008-2014). Adaptive Modeler was used in a study to demonstrate increased complexity of trading rules in an evolutionary forecasting model during a critical period of a company's history.Low Correlations between Dividends and Returns: The Alitalia's Case . Federico Cecconi and Stefano Zappacosta, IASTED Proceeding Modelling and Simulation 2008. In a study of profitability of technical trading in the foreign exchange markets, researchers using Adaptive Modeler found economically and statistically significant out-of-sample excess returns (after transaction costs) for the six most traded currency pairs. The returns were superior to those achieved by traditional econometric forecasting models.New Evidence of Technical Trading Profitability. Viktor Manahov and Robert Hudson, Economics Bulletin, 2013, Volume 33, Issue 4. Adaptive Modeler was also used to study the impact of different levels of trader rationality on market properties and efficiency. It was found that artificial markets with more intelligent traders (compared to markets with less intelligent or zero-intelligence traders) showed improved forecasting performance, though also experienced higher volatility and lower trading volume (consistent with earlier findings). The markets with more intelligent traders also replicated the stylized facts of real financial markets the best. As an example of virtual intelligent life in a complex system (such as a stock market), Adaptive Modeler was used as an illustration of simple agents interacting in a complex (nonlinear) way to forecast stock prices.

Hard services usually relate to physical, structural services such as fire alarm systems, lifts and so on whereas soft services allude to cleaning, landscaping, security and suchlike human-sourced services. Building manager A building manager is a person who supervises the hard and soft services of a built structure. There are essentially two types of building manager positions: residential and commercial. Residential building management In a residential environment, a building manager will typically supervise a team of porters or concierge, cleaners, electrical and mechanical contractors and depending of the size of the development, a team of administrative staff. If the development comprises several blocks, it is common that the Building manager will report to an estate manager although both titles have become interchangeable. To a lesser extent, the term \\"development manager\\" is also used. Traditionally, this role's title was \\"house manager\\". The disparity in the job titles can reflect some differences in the job description but in essence the title that perhaps best defines the role is that of building services manager as the main aspect of the job relates to the day-to-day running of the development with particular focus on the maintenance, site staff management, health and safety and presentation of the building or residential complex. The biggest challenge in the role is to manage residents' expectations and match these up to the budget constraints and prevalent legal requirements. Managing agent An external property management company that will issue and chase up the service charges, supervise the annual budget and approve any additional works and requirements so that the development complies with current health and safety legislation and to ensure that the residential development, building or estate is maintained in accordance with the lease requirements and the service level agreement determined by both the lease and the service charge levied. They also manage the on site staff (i.e. the building manager and his team). They do this on behalf of the freeholder and they are only responsible for maintaining the communal areas and not the apartments themselves which are referred to in property management jargon as the \\"demised premises\\". Leaseholders The owners of the apartments can be at the same time occupiers but in some cases they will be investors. They are responsible for the maintenance of their apartments (known as demised premises) and they pay an annual service charge, inclusive of a fee, to the managing agent for managing the communal parts. Freeholder The freeholder has possession over the freehold of the development (i.e. the communal areas and the land the site was built on). Normally, the freeholder is the developer but in some developments, the leaseholders, when formed into a residents association, purchase the freehold this is known as a RMC and the residents need to form a company with rules and regulations, a secretary a chairman and must make a copy of their annual accounts available to Companies House. Contracted maintenance companies The contracted maintenance companies that have been appointed to maintain the plants and systems of the building (fire alarms, electrical and mechanical systems, CCTV, intercom systems, car park, landscaping etc.)This contracted companies must comply with all the relevant health and safety legislation and code of practices applicable to their sector and must as well offer a good service at competitive prices since the building services manager or the property manager will need to justify these costs to the leaseholders and freeholder. External regulatory bodies External regulatory bodies include local councils, Health Education Officers, and Fire Safety Officers. It is because of this delicate balance of powers that the job of the building manager could be described as a \\"balancing\\" act, since it will be down to him or her to ensure that all parties are satisfied. The building manager with the assistance and guidance of the managing company he or she works for will implement renovation, maintenance and repair projects as required. The challenge can be in many cases to balance these requirements with important priorities such as those dictated by the Fire, Health and Safety legislation as well as following the industry's codes of good practice and compliance. Both residential and commercial developments vary greatly in type depending on the standard, asset value and the service level agreement provided will depend on these factors. Commercial building management This subdivision of building management is quite similar to the previous one, the main difference being that the building will normally be made up of commercial units and or offices. The tenants will, in this case, be companies and the building manager will probably have some involvement in the sales aspect and will be responsible for ensuring that the office space is let at all times.

As a public official he submitted reports that highlighted the mistreatment of Indigenous students in the Canadian Indian residential school system and advocated for the improvement of environmental conditions at the schools. He also worked on the health of immigrant populations in Canada. Biography Peter Bryce was born in Mount Pleasant, Ontario on August 17, 1853. He obtained his medical degree from the University of Toronto, where he studied natural science geology, and went on to study neurology in Paris. He lectured for a time at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario in science and applied chemistry. Bryce served as the first secretary of the Ontario Board of Health from 1882 to 1904, when he was appointed the Chief Medical Officer of the federal Department of Immigration. Bryce was hired by Indian Affairs Department in Ottawa to report on the health conditions of the Canadian residential school system in western Canada and British Columbia. His report was never released by the government but was published by Bryce in 1922 under the title The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. Bryce claimed that Indigenous children enrolled in residential schools were deprived of adequate medical attention and sanitary living conditions. He suggested improvements to national policies regarding the care and education of Indigenous peoples. In a 1907 report Bryce cited an average mortality rate of between 14% and 24% at the schools and a shocking 42% infant mortality rate on the reserves, this due to sick children being sent home to die. Bryce noted that the lack of certainty about the exact number of deaths was, in part, due to the official reports submitted by school principals and \\"defective way in which the returns had been made.\\" He appealed his forced retirement from the Civil Service in 1921 and was denied, subsequently publishing his suppressed report condemning the treatment of the Indigenous at the hands of the BNA.https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft/storyofnationalc00brycuoft_djvu.txt Bryce died on January 15, 1932 while travelling in the West Indies.

He is considered to have played a great role in the development of the ballet in Scandinavia. He was the father of August Bournonville. Early life Bournonville was the son of the actors Louis-Amable Bournonville and Jeanne Evrard, born as the twin of his brother Guillame. He became the student of Noverre in 1769, at the age of nine, and toured in Vienna, Paris and London before he was employed in the Royal Swedish Ballet at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm with his sister Julie Alix de la Fay in 1782.  Career  = Sweden = Bournonville was premier dancer and ballet instructor at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm until 1792. During his time in Sweden, he was described as beautiful as Apollo: \\"His appearance was that of a true Apollo. On top of that he had a form of virtuosity in all kinds of dance, which he used with the finest taste\\". King Gustav III of Sweden was at one point so enthusiastic about his performance and beauty that he called out to him to untie the ribbon of his hair so that he could see his loose hair fly during his pirouette.Gunilla Roempke (1994). Gunilla Roempke. ed. Vristens makt ‚Äì dans√∂s i m√§tressernas tidevarv (The power of the ankle - dancer in the epoch of the royal mistresses) Stockholm: Stockholm Fischer & company. His favourite student and dancing partner in Sweden was Charlotte Slottsberg, with whom he made a successful pair in the ballets. It was Antoine Bournonville himself who asked to have her as his partner, after he recognized her talent as an artist and, in 1784, by his own initiative gave her a part in Les Meunieres Provencaux, which is considered to have been the starting point of Slottberg's true maturity as an artist. Charlotte Slottsberg was said to have been infatuated by his beauty, which at one occasion made her lover, Prince Charles to scream at Bournonville in his jealousy. He was also active as an actor, a singer and a choreographer. During his stay in Sweden he wrote the ballets Les Meuniers proven√ßaux (1785) and Les P√™cheurs (1789). = Denmark = He left Sweden in 1792 after the assassination of king Gustav III of Sweden and was employed at the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen in Denmark after a guest performance there. His favourite dance partner in Denmark was Marie Christine Bj√∂rn. In 1816‚Äì1823, he was the ballet master of the Royal Danish Ballet. Private life Bournonville was married first to the Danish dancer Mariane Jensen, second to his Swedish housekeeper Lovisa Sundberg (the mother of August Bournonville) and also had a child with the Danish dancer Karen Olsen. He died on 11 January 1843 and is buried in Asminder√∏d Churchyard in Fredensborg.

Located at 284 rue Saint-Honor√©, in the 1st arrondissement, it was built between 1653 and 1740. The church is organized as a series of chapels. One of them is dedicated to Saint Susanna in memory of the church which used to stand in its place. Accordingly, there is a mural painting above the altar, showing Saint Susanna fleeing her attackers, and looking up to the heavens for the help of God. History In 1521, the tradesman Jean Dinocheau had a chapel built on the outskirts of Paris, which he dedicated to Saint Susanna. In 1577, his nephew Etienne Dinocheau had it extended into a larger church. In 1629, it became the parish church and thereafter underwent further work. The first stone of the church of Saint-Roch was laid by Louis XIV in 1653, accompanied by his mother Anne of Austria. Originally designed by Jacques Lemercier, the building's construction was halted in 1660 and was resumed in 1701 under the direction of architect Jacques Hardouin-Mansart, brother of the better-known Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Work was finally completed in 1754. At the time of the French Revolution, the church of Saint-Roch was often at the centre of events and was the scene of many shootings which have left their mark on the fa√ßade. 13 Vend√©miaire was one such occasion, this was pivotal in the rise of Napoleon. It was not only the outside of the church that was damaged. During the Revolution it was ransacked, and many works of art were stolen or destroyed.

Other notable burials included C√©sar de Vend√¥me (1664), Ren√© Duguay-Trouin (1736), Claude-Adrien Helv√©tius (1771), and Jean- Honor√© Fragonard (1806), while the Marquis de Sade, the Marquis de Lafayette and Vauban were among those married in this church. After the failed November 1830 Polish Uprising, Saint-Roch became known as the 'Polish church' due to the many exiles who attended service there; they included Chopin (1810-1849), who allegedly composed a Veni Creator prayer he played on the church organ during Mass. On 18 November 1880 Prince Roland Bonaparte and Marie-F√©lix Blanc were married at the church. In 1825 a mass composed by Hector Berlioz was performed at the church.

It was formally established in 1604 on the initiative of Dom Didier de La Cour, prior of the Abbey of Saint-Vannededicated to Saint Vitonus near Verdun, a reformer of the Benedictine Order after the Council of Trent. The Abbey of St. Hydulphe at Moyenmoutier was a secondary centre of the reform. Description The response to the attempts to return the Benedictine houses to a more rigorous way of life in accordance with the Rule, combined with serious study and scholarship, was very positive, but Lorraine was not at that time under the French crown. A parallel movement specifically for the Benedictine monasteries in the Kingdom of France, on the same principles as those of the Congregation of St. Vanne, was therefore launched from the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris in 1621, and gave rise to the Congregation of St. Maur, which became better known than the Vannists. The Congregation of St. Vanne continued however in Lorraine in parallel to that of St. Maur until the French Revolution, when both were abolished. Distinguished Vannist scholars included Antoine Augustin Calmet, R√©my Ceillier, Jean Fran√ßois, Nicolas Tabouillot, Thierry Ruinart and Ambroise Pelletier.

The instrument may be administered by psychologists, that need not have neuropsychological backgrounds. It was developed by, and is named after, psychologists Raymond Dean and Richard Woodcock. The DWNB consists of the Dean-Woodcock Sensory- Motor Battery (DWSMB) (Dean & Woodcock, 2003c), the Dean-Woodcock Structured Neuropsychological Interview (Dean & Woodcock, 2003d), and the Dean-Woodcock Emotional Status Examination (Dean & Woodcock, 2003a). When the DWNAS is used with the Woodcock Johnson III (WJ III) (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), or the Bateria III Woodcock-Mu√±oz (Bateria III) (Mu√±oz-Sandoval, Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2004), a profile of an individual's sensory, motor, emotional, cognitive, and academic functioning is obtained. The DWNAS offers a neuropsychological interpretation of the WJ III and Bateria III. A fundamental element of the DWNAS is that it provides both a clinical neurological and empirical theoretical base (CHC) to assessment. The DWSMB is a battery of tests drawn primarily from the traditional neurological examination to provide coverage of basic sensory, motor functions and sub-cortical functioning, most of which have pathognomonic neurological signs. The DWSMB is divided into two major sections ‚Äî sensory and/or the Bateria III motor. Motor tests are predominantly meant to measure motor functioning at the cortical level. Multiple cognitive functions necessary in neuropsychological assessment are offered by the WJ-III or the Bateria III. The Dean-Woodcock Structured Interview and the Dean-Woodcock Emotional Status Examination provide information regarding the patient's history and current psychological and medical functioning. They address the need in neuropsychological assessment to consider factors that may inhibit or facilitate a patient's performance. Unlike most other neuropsychological batteries for adults (such as the Luria- Nebraska, the Halstead-Reitan, and so forth), the Dean-Woodcock battery does not contain tests of prefrontal lobe function so it cannot be used to evaluate the executive functioning on an individual. This is both an advantage and a shortcoming of the battery. The advantage is that it makes the battery much cheaper, less time-consuming to administer, and potentially less tiring and frustrating for the examinee. The shortcoming is that most neuropsychologists would need to supplement the battery with one or more executive functioning tests (tests sensitive to prefrontal lobe functions; e.g., the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, or a combination of other tests).

In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and Douyin in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of RMB 1 in compensation and a public apology. In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for RMB 90 million in economic losses. In December 2019, the Chinese government ordered Tencent to improve the firm's user data rules for its apps, which regulators regarded to be in violation of censorship rules.

The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England since September 1954. The house dates from the mid 16th century but much of the current appearance is from the 1630s. It was originally called Spiers but renamed in honour of Wolfe's death and victory at the Battle of Quebec in 1759. The house is now owned by the National Trust and open to the public with paintings and memorabilia relating to Wolfe's life. History Originally called Spiers, the house was built in between 1530 and 1550 as a timber framed \\"L\\" shaped building. It was altered in the 1630s, when the current exterior was added. James Wolfe was the son of a distinguished general, Edward Wolfe who rented Spiers. Wolfe lived there from 1728 until 1738. The house was renamed after his victory at the Battle of Quebec. It was occupied in 1911 by Canadian author Henry Beckles Willson and his family. 1911 England Census Mr J B Learmong of Montreal acquired the house and presented to the National Trust in 1917. Architecture and contents The square brick building has two storeys and an attic with a tiled pitched roof. The three-bay front has three equal gables. There is a water pump by the back door which dates from 1792. A blue plaque along the outer brick wall marks the entrance of the Wolfe's home. Various pictures relating to the life of General Wolfe are displayed in the house. The purchase of two portraits were assisted by the Art Fund. The house is surrounded by a garden stocked with plants which would have been available in the 18th century. The coach house has been converted into a tea room and bookshop with an exhibition on the battle and on Wolfe's life. The house itself contains memorabilia and paintings connected to him.

In 1966 and 1967, seven regional systems were established to provide geographical convenience. That is, mountain regions grouped together as did metropolitan areas and the plains portions of the state. In 1975, Colorado State House Bill 1384 made the regional service systems official for all publicly supported libraries - public libraries, school media centers, governmental institutions and academic libraries. The legislature aimed to develop and coordinate cooperative library services including interlibrary loan, document delivery and purchasing. Private, for-profit libraries joined the regions as associate members, paying for desired services. Overall, the regional systems became known as CLiC, an acronym from Colorado Libraries in Cooperation, organized in 1976 in response to proposed state budget cuts. Some services to Colorado libraries included the McNaughton Plan (a shared book leasing program for small public libraries); a courier to deliver materials from one library to another; assistance with obtaining state, federal and private grants; coordinated book purchasing at lower prices; shared consultant services, especially for technical computer equipment; and workshops directed at continuing education for librarians. Directors of the seven systems visited member libraries to establish communication and to keep informed of the needs of individual libraries within the systems. Each regional service system employed an executive director with a small office staff. Regional member libraries sent representatives to a membership council which elected a governing board responsible for oversight of the regional service system, for budgeting the region's share of state funding, for supervision of the director and for hiring and firing of the office staff. Most governing boards met monthly. The director reported to the board, writing an annual report, planning services for the area and helping develop the next year's budget. As computerization advanced, the regional service system offered training, consulting services, equipment repair and database searching services. Development of Union Lists aided in interlibrary loan. At first, the updated lists from other libraries arrived on microfiche. Gradually, the libraries computerized their holdings. The spread of the worldwide web in the 1990s led to shared search systems and the development of on-line catalogs accomplished with the help and direction of the regional directors. In 2003, Governor Owens vetoed the section of the Colorado State budget that funded the Regional Library Service Systems amongst other budget cuts affecting a large number of libraries in Colorado.http://www.lrs.org/documents/closer_look/budgetcuts.pdf Each of the regions closed their offices and laid off staff. By the end of 2004, the Regional Library Service Systems no longer existed. A single, statewide entity called the Colorado Library Consortium was formed in 2004http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2005/03/ljarchives/people-60/ to serve Colorado as a whole with one director and one office staff located in the Denver metropolitan area.http://eadsrv.denverlibrary.org/sdx/pl/toc.xsp?id=WH1960_d0e16862&qid;=sdx_q5&fmt;=text&idtoc;=WH1960-pleadetoc&base;=fa&n;=2&ss;=true&as;=true&ai;=collection- cat Colorado Library Consortium Records, WH1960http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2005/11/ljarchives/good-news-in-colorado- voters-approve-measure-to-retain-funds/  References  External links * CLiC website Category:Organizations based in Colorado Category:Library consortia ","title":"Colorado Library Consortium"},{"id":"16709386","title":"List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters"},{"id":"16709409","text":"Andrius Baltu≈°ka (born 26 November 1971 in Leningrad) is a Lithuanian physicist.

KidsCom now sends an e-mail to parents when children register at the site, providing notice of its collection practices.

Unveiled in 1923, it became a Grade II listed structure in 1958, and was upgraded to Grade II* in 2018. It is considered to be the official memorial of the RAF and related services. It is sited at Whitehall Steps, near Cleopatra's Needle, between the north-bank ends of Charing Cross Bridge and Westminster Bridge, and directly to the east of the main Ministry of Defence building on Whitehall. The Fleet Air Arm Memorial and the Battle of Britain Monument are nearby. Background A committee to erect an RAF memorial was first established in February 1919, and relaunched in January 1920, led by Lord Hugh Cecil and Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard. Funds to erect a memorial were raised by the RAF Memorial Fund subsequently known as the RAF Benevolent Fund. The memorial was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield. The memorial was unveiled on 16 July 1923 by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). The Chief of the Air Staff traditionally places a wreath at the memorial on Battle of Britain Day, 15 September, each year. Description The memorial comprises a tapering Portland stone pylon topped by zodiacal globe bearing a gilded eagle, taken from the RAF's badge, with raised wings, facing east towards the River Thames and nominally towards France. The eagle was sculpted by William Reid Dick and cast by Parlanti. Blomfield used similar pylons for Torquay War Memorial and Luton War Memorial, topped by different devices. The pylon bears inscriptions on the sides facing the Embankment to the west and to the river to the east. Further inscriptions were added after the Second World War, unveiled by Trenchard on 15 September 1946. Inscriptions West face with inscriptions Around the top of the pylon, each face bears alternately the words and , from the motto of the RAF, \\"Per ardua ad astra\\", this was initially the Royal Flying Corps motto when created in 1912. On the west side of the pylon facing the Embankment, the words \\"Per Ardua\\" are picked out in gold, and lower down there is the RAF insignia, and a dedication: , and a quotation from Exodus, chapter 19: . Further down, on the base, is another inscription . The side facing the river bears the RAF insignia again and the inscription: . Thus, the monument was not initially created purely for the RAF, but for all 'Air Services' that served during World War One.

Born in Milan, Italy, Monti studied voice from an early age, and made his debut in concert in Florence in 1941, and that same year sang his first major role, the Duke of Mantua, in Cagliari. His career was interrupted by the war, but he resumed his studies in 1950 by entering the \\"Scuola di Canta\\" of the Teatro alla Scala. In 1951, he made his official operatic debut at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples as Elvino in La sonnambula, a role he will remain closely associated with throughout his career. He sang widely in Italy, appearing in Le comte Ory at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence in 1952. In 1954, he appeared in an Italian television production of Il barbiere di Siviglia, opposite Rolando Panerai and Antonietta Pastori. His career quickly took an international turn. He appeared as Elvino at the Wexford Festival in 1952, returning the following year as Nemorino in L'elisir d'amore. He also made guest appearances in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and made his debut as Elvino opposite Anna Moffo at the San Francisco Opera in 1960. A stylish singer, Monti had a light and attractive voice, and can be heard on a number of recordings. He recorded both Paisiello's and Rossini's Barbiere di Siviglia, La cambiale di matrimonio, Il re pastore, L'elisir d'amore, but is probably best remembered for his two recordings of La sonnambula, opposite Maria Callas in 1957 and Joan Sutherland in 1962.

The poem was famously set to music by Robert Lucas de Pearsall on 4 June 1840, scored for SSAATTBB in Eb. In 1854, Pearsall produced a contrafactum of Lay a Garland, to the Latin text Tu es Petrus, dedicating it to the first bishop of St Gallen, John Peter. This is more often performed by choirs in a liturgical setting, as the original words for the music are more appropriate to a secular occasion. Lyrics The song is sung by Aspasia where her betrothed is forced into a marriage of convenience to the king's mistress. The original words are as follows: > Lay a garland on my hearse of the dismal yew. Maidens, willow branches wear, > say I died true. My love was false, but I was firm from my hour of birth. > Upon my buried body lie lightly, gentle earth. However Pearsall's music is set to these adapted words changed from first to third person > Lay a garland on her hearse of dismal yew. Maidens, willow branches wear, > say she died true.

Instead of the stipulated twelve officials, they were only ten left. It was not possible to elect two new men to fill their places, because of the great death numbers of the plague. The judge therefore decided to call upon these two women, Karin Jota from Kallhyttan and Walborg from Nordmarkshyttan, to fill the places of the court to make the number complete.

Outlands was published by Outlands Publications in England in the winter of 1946. It was digest size, 40 pages long, and cost 1/6d.  Background  The magazine was edited by Leslie J. Johnson, who had used his RAF gratuity to establish Outlands with fellow science-fiction fans. He edited the magazine from his home in Liverpool. Johnson had previously worked on science fiction stories with John Russell Fearn and Eric Frank Russell, his co-writer on the story Seeker of Tomorrow which appeared in Astounding Stories magazine in July 1937. Around the time of the magazine's launch in October 1946, a preliminary announcement described the magazine as \\"for all who seek wider fields of thought and imagination, and who aren't afraid to face facts that run counter to accepted beliefs.\\" Offering scope for writers with original ideas, the creators distanced themselves from committing to any set formula for the magazine, and promised to feature whatever they wanted to write as long as it was \\"unique and significant.\\" The creators attempted to solicit interest in advance of publication by circulating this announcement to science fiction and fantasy fans, and inviting anyone interested in receiving more information about the magazine to contact them at \\"Outlands Publications\\", 19 Richmond Avenue, Liverpool 21.  Contents  The published magazine consisted of 40 pages of fiction and articles, and an editorial illustrating the stated aim of the creators \\"to interest you with stories and articles which will have a slant towards the future. Yet we don't like to say we are publishing any particular type of material. You may label our stories 'science fiction,' 'weird fiction' or 'fantasy'; call them what you will...\\" Contents included science-fiction pieces by John Russell Fearn and George C. Wallis, and fantasy stories by Charnock Walsby, Sydney J. Bounds and John Gabriel. Articles included \\"Psychic Scents,\\" by A. Hastwa, dealing with spiritualism and later reprinted in the December 1950 issue of Fate, and \\"Mystery Power,\\" by Leslie V. Heald, citing inexplicable Fortean phenomena. The only story title displayed on the cover was 'Pre-Natal' by Fearn. Other features covered an American fantasy fan convention and recent British science-fiction publications, alongside opportunities for readers to contribute, including \\"The Curious Club,\\" which invited readers to submit reports and articles dealing with unusual events and bizarre ideas, as a basis for general discussion. Bounds' debut professional sale under his own name appears in the first issue. 'Strange Portrait' is a macabre story based on the concept of The Picture of Dorian Gray in which a 'living' painting acts out the murderous jealousies of artist David Guest. The publication of his story left Bounds feeling that his post-war career as an electrical fitter seemed less inviting than one writing fiction. \\"The Opaque Word\\" by Anthony Cotrion also appeared, alongside fiction by George C. Wallis and an obituary of H.G. Wells, who had only recently died on August 13, 1946.  Reception  The magazine was first launched on a basis of private subscription only, but later appeared on the bookstalls priced at 1/6.

After the war, the family lived in comfortable surroundings in the affluent riverside suburb of Mt Pleasant, where she became a teenager before the birth of her three younger siblings. Though successful at her schoolwork, she was sexually active by age 14, which caused her to be committed for eight months to a notoriously cruel Catholic Church welfare home.Wills, Juliet \\"Dirty Girl: The State Sanctioned Murder of Brothel Madam Shirley Finn\\", Fontaine Press, Fremantle 2017, Her biographer Juliet Wills recounts that Finn left school at 15 and found work at a city frock shop, where she met her husband-to-be Des Finn, a 22-year-old air-force mechanic. They married in Perth and went to live in Melbourne, where he continued with the RAAF and she worked as a sales assistant at Buckley & Nunn. Her sons Steven and Shane were born in 1959 and 1960 respectively. They transferred back to Perth, where daughter Bridget was born in 1961.

She also joined a witchcraft coven which conducted \\"black magic and sex\\" activities in Kings Park. From this she advanced to a career of topless dancing and body painting in association with a travelling fairground boxing troupe. In 1969 Finn was conducting a \\"body painting and escort business\\" which was raided by police, and she was charged and convicted with \\"keeping premises for the purpose of prostitution.\\" As a result, the family was socially ostracised and the children had to leave the Catholic primary school. =Regulated prostitution= Finn became associated with King's Cross, Sydney, brothel operator Dorothea Flatman who transferred to Perth in 1968 and set up a number of brothels under the symbiotic protection of Australian vice overlord Abe Saffron and a policy of \\"containment\\" upheld by the W.A. Police.

Synopsis After the events of Across the Sea of Suns (1984), small groups of humans have settled on other star systems. However, there is a constant threat from the Mechs, a civilization of machines left over from other civilizations and evolved to see all biological civilization as unstable and dangerous. Great Sky River tells the story of the Bishop family, who fight for their very existence on the planet Snowglade, which has been taken over by the Mechs. The Bishops are one of a number of families on Snowglade, all named for chess pieces. These \\"families\\" are more like clans or tribes. All use cybernetic implants and mechanical aids to enhance their perceptions and physical abilities. Personalities of dead members of the Family can be stored in memory tabs and accessed by plugging them into ports implanted in the neck. Bodily functions, such as the sexual drive, can be turned off to remove distractions. The Families seem to be equipped for long conflicts and periods of privation, continually migrating to avoid the Mechs. The novel takes place during a period when the Mechs have invaded Snowglade and are slowly altering its climate to suit themselves; drying it out to protect their steel bodies from rust. This adversely affects the humans, who otherwise seem to exist in a wary truce with the Mechs. Then, the Mechs begin destroying human settlements. For some reason, they are interested in Killeen Bishop, leader of the Bishop Family. As the series progresses, it is revealed that the Bishops and related colonists are post-humans, or as the text describes them, a \\"fourth species of chimpanzee\\". The adults are actually 3 meters in height and have a stronger, more limber skeletal structure than humans. They are the survivors of thousands of years of conflict with the Mechs on Earth, the beginnings of which were described in the previous novels. Having defeated the Mechs in the Solar System, they have traveled to near the galactic center using slower- than-light space vessels, meaning that the setting is tens of thousands of years in the future. The remainder of the series describes the Bishops' progress to the center of Mech power, and the great secret they carry, which the Mechs fear.

It stood on the corner of Long Acre (formerly Charles Street) and Endell Street, with entrances in Wilson Street and Long Acre. The site is within the modern Camden, part of Covent Garden.Walter Thornbury Old and New London: A Narrative of its History, its People and its Places. Illustrated with Numerous Engravings from the Most Authentic Sources.: Volume 3, accessed 1 April 2008 St Martin's Hall contained a 3,000-seat main hall and a 500-seat lecture hall. It was used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The Queen's Theatre, one of the largest in London, had a capacity of 4,000 seats. The theatre closed after barely more than a decade, in 1878. The name Queen's Theatre has been used for other theatres in central London, including the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden (from 1685 to 1705), Her Majesty's Theatre (from 1705 to 1714), Scala Theatre (during the period 1831-1865) and the modern Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue (since 1907). History =St Martin's Hall= St Martin's Hall was built for John Hullah, in 1847, by William Cubitt, from a design by Richard Westmacott. The scheme was financed by subscription and it was built on a parallelogram of land, by wide, connected to a plot on Long Acre ( by ); and consisted of a main hall with connected anterooms, galleries and a 500-seat lecture hall.St. Martin's Music Hall 16 February 1850 The Builder, at Arthur Lloyd theatre history site, accessed 1 April 2008 It was built in the Elizabethan style, with a large domed iron roof. The music hall was capable of seating 3,000 persons and was opened in 1850 by Hullah, the founder of a new \\"school of choral harmony\\". In addition to his singing classes, Hullah directed oratorios and concerts, both instrumental and vocal, at the hall. The hall was then used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The German Reed Entertainments were initially presented here in 1855 - known as \\"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings\\" - before moving to the more intimate Gallery of Illustration and later St George's Hall. Charles Dickens first appeared as a public lecturer in St Martin's Hall, in April, 1858, speaking on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children, in Great Ormond Street. A week or two later, he spoke on his own account. On 26 August 1860, a fire broke out in a nearby coach factory and the hall was destroyed, together with its organ. The hall was rebuilt as a concert hall, opening in 1862. The First International was founded in St Martin's Hall in 1864. The final musical entertainment was given in 1867. =Queen's theatre= In 1867, a 4,000-seat theatre was built within the shell of the existing building by C. J. Phipps for Henry Labouch√®re and his partners, with interior decoration by Albert Moore and Telbin.Sherson p. 201 A new company of players was formed, including Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, Ellen Terry and Henrietta Hodson. The theatre opened as the New Queen's Theatre, with a production of Charles Reade's The Double Marriage on 24 October 1867. An early success was Dearer Than Life, by H. J. Byron, with Brough, Toole, Wyndham, Hodson and Irving, coupled with W. S. Gilbert's La Vivandi√®re, a burlesque of La fille du r√©giment.Sherson, p. 202 The theatre continued with melodrama, adaptions and classic revivals, dropping the epithet 'new' the following year. 1869 programme Initially, the management was run by the actor Alfred Wigan, who also appeared in its productions. By 1868, Hodson and Labouch√®re were living together out of wedlock,Labby and Dora (Labouchere genealogy site) accessed 1 April 2008 as they could not marry until her first husband finally died in 1887.London Facts and Gossip 17 January 1883 The New York Times accessed 1 April 2008 Labouch√®re bought out his partners and used the theatre to showcase Hodson's talents.Feature on Hodson in Footlights Notes The theatre hosted comedies, such as F. C. Burnand's The Turn of the Tide (1869, starring Hermann Vezin and George Rignold with Hodson), historical dramas, such as Tom Taylor's Twixt Axe and Crown (1870), popular revivals of Shakespeare (starring such famous actors as Samuel Phelps) and Tommaso Salvini, dramatisations of Dickens novels, burlesques and extravaganzas. Although the theatre was among the largest and best equipped in London, and featured some of London's most famous stars, it lacked the guidance of an actor-manager of the stature of Henry Irving or Herbert Beerbohm Tree.Sherson pp. 209-10 In 1877, the theatre became the National Theatre and hosted a series of promenade concerts under Riviere and Alfred CellierSherson p. 208 followed by an ambitious dramatisation of The Last Days of Pompeii (Lord Lytton's eponymous novel) that was meant to feature a staged eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake and a sybriatic Roman feast. However, the earth did not quake, the volcano did not erupt, acrobats fell onto the cast below, and the production was an expensive flop.Sherson p. 204 The same year, the theatre was joined by overhead wires to the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, and public demonstrations of the Cromwell Varley telephone were given. Several simple tunes were transmitted and emitted softly from a large drum-like apparatus suspended over the proscenium.London and Londoners in the Eighteen- Fifties and Sixties, Alfred Rosling Bennett (1924) Chapter 44 The Drama (The Victorian Dictionary) accessed 1 April 2008 The theatre was open for little more than a decade, closing in April 1878. The interior was converted into a department store for the \\"Clerical Co-operative Society\\" and later occupied by the Odhams Press. The fa√ßade remained until redeveloped into a residential block in the 1970s. Notes References *Earl, John and Michael Sell.

He was capped 42 times for the Scotland national rugby union team. In his club career he played for Bath Rugby, Glasgow Warriors and Bristol. His position of choice is as a prop. Rugby Union career =Professional career= During his club career, Hilton won the Heineken Cup for Bath in 1998, as well as league and domestic cup successes for the same club. He left Bath and played for Glasgow in the Welsh-Scottish League and then the Celtic League. After being capped for Scotland on residency criteria he continued to play for Glasgow until 2003http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/player/000976.php before then returning to the English West Country to play for Bristol, until his retirement in 2008. =International career= He gained his first cap for the Scotland against Canada on 21 January 1991 and his 42nd and final cap against South Africa on 16 November 2002. Hilton originally believed he qualified for Scotland as his grandfather was born there. However, in 2000 - and after 41 caps for Scotland - Hilton discovered his grandfather's birth was registered in Bristol and not Edinburgh as he believed. Hilton stated that his grandfather was born 16 weeks before the Bristol registration but he could not prove whether or not his grandfather was born in Scotland. Without adequate documentation he did not qualify to play for Scotland under the international eligibility rules. At around the same time it was discovered that Welsh internationals Shane Howarth and Brett Sinkinson were ineligible to play for Wales under the grandparent rules. The resulting scandal encompassing Hilton and the others was named Grannygate and was embarrassing for the players and Rugby Unions alike. However both the SRU and the WRU escaped without fines. As part of a subsequent TV investigation Hilton's great-grandfather was traced to Glasgow giving credence to Hilton's Scottish ancestry. Hilton had already moved from Bath to Glasgow to play for Glasgow Caledonians, now Glasgow Warriors, a year before the scandal broke so he had already a period of residence in Scotland. He had then to complete another two years in order to qualify again for Scotland under the 3-year residency rule. After that period of residency Hilton played once more for Scotland in a victory over South Africa in 2002. On Grannygate and the belated South Africa game Hilton was to explain: \\"I had a lot of friends in the game, even journalists, who knew I was honest and hard working on the pitch and that encouraged me to try to get another cap. It was natural, too, because I felt Scottish. I‚Äôd got two England U21 caps but it was just like playing for any other team and I thought ‚Äòthis is not for me.‚Äô It took to 2002 until I was cleared to play for Scotland again and I won my 42nd cap against South Africa at Murrayfield. After trying for two and a half years to get this goal it was given to me through an unfortunate injury to Mattie Stewart. I was not at my best but it was great that Scotland didn't turn their back on me and I was very determined to prove I should be there. I played 15 minutes off the bench and the crowd reaction was brilliant.

The squadron flies the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and is part of the 35th Fighter Wing at Misawa Air Base, Japan. The squadron traces its heritage back to the 1942 activation of the 313th Bombardment Squadron. The squadron served in the continental United States as a training unit until its 1943 inactivation. The squadron was reactivated in 1966 as the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron, fighting in the Vietnam War. The squadron flew Wild Weasel anti-SAM missions with the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, operating out of Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The squadron moved to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base in October 1967, flying F-4s in combat air patrols against North Vietnamese MiGs and ground strike missions. The squadron was inactivated with the end of the war in 1975. The squadron was reactivated in 1976 a training squadron at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and inactivated again in 1982. The squadron was reactivated as the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron in 1985 at Misawa, flying the F-16. It was redesignated the 13th Fighter Squadron in 1991.

The Panthers provide in Offensive and Defensive Counter-Air capabilities, and specialize in the role of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. History = World War II = The 13th Fighter Squadron was first activated as the 313th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) on 1 February 1942, part of the 21st Bombardment Group. The squadron was initially stationed at Bowman Field in Louisville, Kentucky, but moved to Jackson Army Air Base, Mississippi, a week later. On 24 April, the squadron moved to Columbia Army Air Base in South Carolina, becoming an operational training unit five days later. It served in the continental United States, training bomber crews for overseas service. The squadron also conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Gulf of Mexico between June and August. The squadron was disbanded on 10 October 1943. = Vietnam War= Pave Sword laser pod. On 2 May 1966, the squadron was reactivated as the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II. The squadron flew Wild Weasel missions to destroy North Vietnamese Surface-to-air missile sites. In October 1967, the squadron was moved to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, becoming part of the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. At Udorn, the 13th flew F-4D and F-4E aircraft, remaining there for the remainder of the war. In 1971, the squadron adopted as a mascot a panther nicknamed \\"Eldridge\\" after a former member of the squadron, but later attributed to be named for Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver. The squadron later became known as the \\"Panther Pack\\". The squadron scored 11 MiG kills, compiled 21 aerial victories, and flew more than 30,000 combat sorties. The squadron earned 15 campaign streamers, six Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Valor, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm during the war. The squadron was inactivated in June 1975 with the end of the war. = MacDill AFB Training unit = The squadron was reactivated on 15 January 1976 at MacDill Air Force Base as the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron, part of the 56th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadron conducted F-4 pilot and weapon system officer replacement training and was inactivated on 1 July 1982. = Misawa Air Base = On 1 June 1985, the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron was reactivated at Misawa Air Base in Japan, assigned to the 432d Fighter Wing and flying the F-16A/B Fighting Falcon. The 13th became the first permanent fighter squadron stationed on mainland Japan since 1972. On 19 September, the 313th Bombardment Squadron's lineage was consolidated with the 13th TFS. On 31 May 1991, the 13th TFS was redesignated the 13th Fighter Squadron. It was transferred to the 35th Fighter Wing's 35th Operations Group on 1 October 1994, part of an organizational realignment to ensure wings with rich heritages remained active. The squadron achieved initial operational capability in F-16CJs in 1996. The squadron's tail code was simultaneously changed from \\"MJ\\" to \\"WW\\" in recognition of the wing's Wild Weasel heritage. On 8 July of that year, the squadron became the first Pacific Air Forces F-16 unit to deploy in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, as a result of a policy change allowing all units the opportunity to deploy. During Operation Southern Watch, the squadron flew its first combat missions since the 1975 Mayaguez incident. Since 1996, the 13th FS has deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Jordan ten times, most recently in 2014 to Jordan where the Panthers opened the US air campaign against the Islamic State.

It separates Cootes Paradise Marsh on the west from the harbor on the east. Geologically the Burlington Heights is a sand and gravel bar formed across the eastern end of the Dundas Valley by Glacial Lake Iroquois. It is the northern continuation of the longer Iroquois Bar which extends south into Hamilton. Burlington Heights is traversed by York Boulevard. In the south, extensive parkland surrounds Dundurn Castle on the east side of the road and the large Hamilton Cemetery on the west side. North of Dundurn Castle a city park is named for Sir John Harvey. The southern portion of the Burlington Heights was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1929, because of its strategic and military importance to the British during the War of 1812. Dundurn Castle was later designated as a National Historic Site in its own right in 1984. The Royal Botanical Gardens is another National Historic Site adjacent to the Burlington Heights National Historic Site. The Royal Botanical Gardens owns and manages the properties on the Burlington Heights peninsula north of the Desjardins Canal History In the late 18th Century Anishinaabe people used the Burlington Heights extensively. These people known as Mississaugas traveled along the northern shore of Lake Ontario throughout the year as various resources became available. The Reverend Peter Jones (KahkewƒÅquonƒÅby), an Anishinaabe farmer, missionary, and writer, son of Tuhbenahneequay and Loyalist surveyor Augustus Jones, was born on the Burlington Heights in 1802.Smith, Donald B. 2013. Sacred Feathers: The Reverend Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) and the Mississauga Indians, Second Edition. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Ontario. 408 Pages. These people are now known as the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. =19th century= War of 1812 Stone markers and cannon. The centre stone marks the first line of earthwork defences erected at the Heights' during the War of 1812. The \\"Heights\\" were the location of a British Army post during the War of 1812. The British army post was established on the commandeered property of Richard Beasley in May 1813. Batteries (on the north and south ends), a magazine, Sally port and earthworks were built to create a line of defence. Troops with the 8th (The King's) and 49th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) (Hertfordshire) Regiments of Foot were stationed at the Heights after being forced to retreat from American troops advancing into the Niagara Peninsula in May 1813.http://www.battlefieldhouse.ca/war1812.asp From Beasley's Establishment the British forces, under the command of General John Vincent and Sir John Harvey launched a successful attack on a much larger American force early on the morning of 6 June 1813, at Stoney Creek. On 29 July 1813, an American naval squadron arrived near the Burlington Heights in an attempt to dislodge the British forces from the promontory, and to relieve the British-Native blockade of Fort George. Approximately 500 American soldiers disembarked at Burlington Beach under the command of Colonel Winfield Scott, but he found the defenders too well-entrenched in the heights for any assault to be successful. As a result, the American force withdrew from the area, opting instead to raid the settlement of York. Because of the Heights' importance to the British Army during the War of 1812, the southern portion of the promontory was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1929. Post-War of 1812 After the War of 1812, former British barracks on the northern part of the peninsula were used as a hospital for immigrants with contagious diseases, most notably during an outbreak of cholera between 1832 and 1833. In 1832 Beasley sold his property on the Heights to Sir Allan Napier MacNab, who built the 72-room Dundurn Castle on the site of Beasley's house. Dundurn Castle, c. 1890s. The building was erected in the 1830s at the southern end of the promontory. Before 1852, the Heights separated Cootes Paradise Marsh from Hamilton Harbour. That year the Desjardins Canal, which had opened in 1836 and which allowed shipping to reach Dundas from Hamilton Harbour, was straightened by an excavation through the Burlington Heights. On March 12, 1857 the Great Western Railway bridge over the Desjardins Canal collapsed as a result of a derailment caused by a faulty axle on a locomotive, killing 59 people. This remains Canada's second-worst railway accident in terms of deaths. =20th century= In 1926 the City of Hamilton purchased most of the Burlington Heights north of the Desjardins Canal for a civic beautification program and construction of a new bridge over the canal.

Built in 1847 and opened in 1848, it served as home for the Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins during his theology studies. In 2002 St Beuno's was categorised as a Grade II* listed building and a Welsh Historic Monument (Denbighshire CC, Record No. 26459). History =Foundation= South wing and grounds In 1832, Following the Act of Catholic Emancipation of 1829, the Jesuits came to North Wales and founded St Winefride's Church in nearby Holywell, Flintshire.St Winefride's Church Holywell from British Listed Buildings, retrieved 5 December 2018 In 1846, Fr Randal Lythgoe, the Provincial of the Jesuits in Britain, visited Holywell and travelled around the around. When he came to Tremeirchion, to see some farm land that the Jesuits owned, he immediately decided that this should be the site for a new college. The college would teach theology to Jesuits in training to be priests. It was decided to name the college after a local saint, St Beuno, instead of a saint associated with the Jesuits. =Construction= Courtyard St Beuno's was designed by the architect Joseph Aloysius Hansom, known for the Hansom cab. He went on to design many churches for the Jesuits, such as the Oxford Oratory, St Walburge's Church in Preston, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Spinkhill in 1846, St David's Church, Dalkeith in 1853, Annunciation Church, Chesterfield in 1854, St Joseph's Church, Leigh in 1855, and the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester in 1871. The outside walls were made of stone, with Gothic gargoyles and stone carving, and inside were broad corridors and large but simple rooms. In the late 1870s, the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins while studying to become a Jesuit priest, described the building, \\"It is built of limestone, decent outside, skimping within, Gothic like Lancing College done worse.\\"Poems and Prose of Gerard Manley Hopkins By Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. H. Gardner p.175 Originally, St Beuno's College was a quadrangle enclosing a garden. On the west side of the quad was a basement corridor containing the recreation Room, schoolroom, two private rooms and the entrance Hall, above which was a library, the rector's room and a parlour. On the south side, the highest part of the quadrangle, were three galleries which housed the teachers and the students. On the north side was the refectory. =Developments= 20 years after its construction, St Beuno's College needed to the extended to accommodate the increased numbers of Jesuits training there. Extra rooms in the attics were added and a new North Wing was built to the left of the tower. Originally, heating for the lower floor was provided by heat from greenhouse below the west front being channelled into the house. Fresh water was provided from local streams and kept in tanks, which still exist above the terraces, and food was grown locally both in the college's grounds and on the adjacent college farm. The college had its own gas works. There was also a school built for local children. = Tertianship= In 1926, the college ceased being a theology college. The Jesuit students were moved to Heythrop College in Oxfordshire. Instead, St Beuno's became a place of study for the last year of Jesuit training, the tertianship. During the Second World War it was a place of refuge to many Jesuit novices who were sent from Manresa House in Roehampton, during and after the Blitz. When the war finished, it reverted to being a tertianship. Dedication of Tremeirchion Rood Cross in 2004 =Retreat centre= From 1970 the house had begun to open to religious sisters on first 8-day and then 30-day retreats. During the 1970s, as those engaged in the tertianship became increasingly uneasy living in the countryside, the retreat work grew from strength to strength. In 1980, St Beuno's became a retreat centre. St Beuno's has a programme of retreats all the year round, from weekends to 30 days. It also offers courses in Ignatian Spirituality from one to six months' duration.Dates and Historical details from \\"Canute's Tower St Beuno's\\" by Paul Edwards, Published by Gracewing in 1990,  Tremeirchion Rood Cross  In 1862 the College was presented with a medieval cross by a Mr Hynde, who bought it for ¬£5 from the Anglicans at Corpus Christi, Tremeirchion. The Tremeirchion Rood of Grace stood for 140 years on a plinth at the entrance to St Beuno's before being restored and then translated back to Tremeirchion churchyard as a Millennium gift. It now stands beneath the yew under which in the mid-19th century it had been found buried.  Rock Chapel  In 1866 the 'Rock Chapel', was built on a wooded hill to the south of St Beuno's. It was designed by a Jesuit student, Ignatius Scoles, who had followed the footsteps of his father, Joseph John Scoles, and trained as an architect before joining the Jesuits to become a priest. He went on to design St Wilfrid's Church in Preston, Brickdam Cathedral and Georgetown City Hall in Guyana.

Sandcrete is usually used as hollow rectangular blocks similar to concrete masonry units, often wide, thick, and with hollows that run from top to bottom and occupy around one third of the volume of the block. The blocks are joined together with mortar. Strength and usage The final compressive strength of sandcrete can be as high as 4.6 N/mm2, which is much less than concrete's 40 N/mm2. Sandcrete is unsuitable for load-bearing columns, and is mainly used for walls, or for foundations if no suitable alternative is available. As material for walls, its strength is less than that of fired clay bricks, but sandcrete is considerably cheaper. Sandcrete is the main building material for walls of single-storey buildings (such as houses and schools) in countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. Research has shown using organic ash to replace Portland cement, which is better than simply using less Portland cement. Coarse aggregate Addition of coarse aggregates has been tried, since this is a cheap way to increase compressive strength, but since the cement content of sandcrete is small, so is the amount of water that is added to the sand/cement mix to cure it. Adding more solid materials makes the mix much less fluid, making it difficult to cast into blocks.http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt;=13776632 Denis, Alain, Ahmed Attar, Denys Breysse, and Jean Jacques Chauvin. \\"Effect of Coarse Aggregate on the Workability of Sandcrete.\\" Cement and Concrete Research 32.5: 701-06.

She is best known for her contributions as a soca singer. She came to national attention in 2005 with the huge hit collaboration \\"The Islands\\" alongside Bunji Garlin, written by Kernal Roberts and produced by Shawn Noel (Da Ma$tamind). Her life It was in 2005 when Patrice Roberts shocked the entertainment industry in Trinidad and Tobago with her talent. Her introduction through a vocal collaboration was with Bunji Garlin, who at that time was in the spotlight. It was her refreshingly soothing and powerful vocals that quickly got her the attention that many established entertainers desired. Very few were able to provide accurate answers about her and her career, appearing mystery like. Patrice Roberts has assumed her position in the Caribbean music industry as a force to be reckoned with. Music was always an instrumental part of her life and would inevitably become her career. As far as her mind allows her to journey Patrice recollects always being in love with music and singing. It was at the tender age of seven she began taking her passion seriously. Since then Patrice has not regretted surrendering to her passion. In 2006, shortly after Patrice shot into the spotlight she became one of the frontline vocalists and the only female vocalists in the internationally recognized Soca Band, which at that time was known as Xtatik (now HD). For Patrice her professional career had just begun and she was in full flight. It would be a challenging and difficult journey for Patrice but one that she would embrace and make her own when given the opportunity. Fresh out of school, Roberts experienced what many would consider ‚Äúculture shock‚Äù; moving from her countryside dwellings in Toco to city lights. Her transition from a calypso consumed lifestyle to Soca meant that the life she was accepting would attract obstacles beyond her understanding, ‚ÄúI had to adapt to the culture, the atmosphere and now compete with established artistes.‚Äù Prior to her collaboration with Bunji Garlin and her alliance with Machel Montano and HD, Patrice had numerous Calypso accolades under her belt. Her journey from then to now was crafted by ace songwriter and producer, Kernal Roberts. The male Roberts was approached by Patrice's then mentors; Dan Nero and George Stanisclaus for her introduction into the \\"Soca World.\\" This is how 2005 began. One of her greatest achievements followed soon after when she was named the youngest female Road March winner for her collaboration with Machel Montano titled ‚ÄúBand Of The Year‚Äù. This achievement would solidify her existence in the Soca world and prove to critics that she was more talent than they expected. Her talent has provided her with opportunities to travel extensively throughout the Caribbean, The USA and Europe with more opportunities still presenting themselves. To understand her career one must understand her struggles, obstacles and successes, a simple word of advice from her to anyone interested in following their dreams is, \\"Believe in them.\\" To date Roberts has been recognized for some of her hit singles namely, 'Big Girl Now', 'Old and Grey', ‚ÄòA Little Wine‚Äô, ‚ÄòSweet Fuh Days‚Äô, ‚ÄòLike It Like This‚Äô, 'Touch Me', ‚ÄòInto You‚Äô, ‚ÄòCriminal Wine‚Äô, and 'B.O.D.Y' with Machel Montano, among others. Artistry: Feminism in Trinidad On 1 January 2017 Patrice Roberts released a song called Big Girl Now. In the context of Caribbean and Trinidadian history and Roberts‚Äô role as a female soca artist, the song serves as a modern repudiation of a male dominated culture. Trinidadian culture has historically been male dominated and the same can be said of soca since its inception. Before and after Trinidad's independence from Britain, the country has kept a strict binary of male and female roles. Men dominated the \\"rational\\" public sphere thus laying claim to the spoken word and women were relegated to the private sphere as was much of the rest of the Caribbean.Pinto, Samantha. \\"Why Must All Girls Want to Be Flag Women? Postcolonial Sexualities, National Reception, and Caribbean Soca Performance.\\" Meridians 10.1 (2009): 137-63. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017. The gendered authority over the spoken word in the Caribbean and Trinidad gives great meaning to women who challenge such notions. In the 1980s, the male dominated field of soca music began to shift as Trinidadian vocal performers began to emerge. Enter Patrice Roberts who was born in 1985 just as women began to dominate soca music. In Big Girl Now, Patrice Roberts brushes past traditional notions of who can and can't produce soca music and takes back her own sexuality as a grown woman from a society that attempts to tell her what she can and can't do. Much of gendered Trinidadian society can be traced back to early post-independence. Just after the independence of Trinidad from Britain on 31 August 1962, the country set about creating the imagined community of \\"nation\\" and citizenry (state). In this light the creation of cultural borders such as that on sexuality is one of the modern nation-state.Harewood, Susan. \\"Transnational Soca Performances, Gendered Re-Narrations Of Caribbean Nationalism.\\" Social and Economic Studies 55.1/2, POPULAR CULTURE (2006): 25-48. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017. For example, the Sexual Offenses Bill of 1986 that attempted to regulate women's bodies by dictating what was allowed sexually. The bill stated that \\" promiscuity\\" was a \\"contaminant of the West\\". Soca music as performed by female soca performers, such as Patrice Roberts in Big Girl Now, can be thought of as a repudiation of the nation-state evident in lyrics such as \\"mind your business, hush your mouth\\" while Patrice Roberts and her friends in the music video for Big Girl Now take part in what might be considered \\"promiscuous behavior\\" by traditional norms. Some critics of Caribbean music and the soca music scene such as author Kevin FrankFrank, Kevin. \\"Female Agency and Oppression in Caribbean Bacchanalian Culture: Soca, Carnival, and Dancehall.\\" Women's Studies Quarterly 35.1/2, The Sexual Body (2007): 172-90. JSTOR. Web. 29 May 2017. believe the role of women to be a solely exploitative and poisonous one while looking at the lyrics of male soca artists and the dance \\"winning\\". These critics fail to take into account contemporary female soca performers and the colonial history of pre- independence Trinidad as well as early post-independence Trinidad. Both periods sought out to control the sexuality of women. According to Susan Harewood, national narratives that make up the conception of \\"nation\\" are multi-authored but rarely egalitarian. Throughout Trinidad's history these narratives have been written by men. Artists and Trinidadian women such as Patrice Roberts are authoring their own narrative of what it means to be a Trinidadian woman. Carnival and Soca Music (Traditional Culture) Patrice Roberts was born and grew up in Trinidad. Trinidad is a nation having remarkable carnival culture, and it is also known to be the hub of the soca and the calypso music. The soca music is also called the soul calypso. Both genres represent the carnival culture in Trinidad. Trinidad carnival music exhibits three themes including the tradition, the social identity, and the performance context and function. The tradition component of the carnival music includes the usage of music in religious ceremonies and weddings. In these occasions, the instruments such as guitar, cautro, and maracas are used. In additional, vocal, clapping, stamping and special breathing sound \\"doption\\" are also used in the soca and calypso music. People dance in the Trinidad carnivals. The social identity component reflects the ethnic diversity in Trinidad. There are huge population of Indians, Africans, and other ethnicities. The soca music mixes the calypso with East Indian music. Comparing to calypso, the soca music has faster tempo and it is more energetic. The soca music is designed for festivity and cheerful dance. While the soca lyric has less storytelling, it is calling the audiences to respond to the singer. The soca music is also having more sound effects from the studio production. As a Trinidadian, Patrice Roberts‚Äô songs exhibit characteristics of the soca music and the Trinidad carnival dynamic. As a popular singer, she performs the soca music to broad global audiences and fosters cultural exchanges. In 2006, Patrice Roberts sang with Machel Montano, an internationally known soca singer. Together, their song \\"Band of De Year\\" won the 2006 Carnival Road March. This achievement brought fame to both singers, the soca music, and the Trinidad carnival culture. Patrice Roberts and Motherhood Despite their best efforts the people of Trinidad and Tobago still suffer color and class discrimination as well as sexism . It is apparent in the music industry is male-dominated while women are taking up the vocalist roles in bands. Even though women are able to use their voice to speak of the gender-biased oppression as a welcoming to the music industry, it is also to be said that they are restricted to playing musical instruments roles that can farther increase their credibility. Despite this, Calypso music became the opening door for women to work in the music industry. Calypso music is a type of political and social folk song genre from Trinidad. Calypso music gave the women of Trinidad a voice to sing of gendered-biased oppression.Munro, Hope. What She Go Do: Women in Afro-Trinidadian Music. Jackson: U of Mississippi, 2016. Print. Patrice Roberts started her career with calypso music but transitioned to Soca, the Soul of Calypso music. Despite being a musical performance that are sometimes cases as a form of male objectification, she is also a mother. She wrote a song for her daughter of one, Lily. Patrice Roberts came from a traditional Muslim family where it restricted her of doing what she loved, to sing. The changing role of women as well as the improved status of local expressive forms help create a space for women to participate in the cultural life of Trinidad and Tobago, just as they won role for themselves in public life in general.Munro, Hope. What She Go Do: Women in Afro-Trinidadian Music. Jackson: U of Mississippi, 2016. Print. Patrice Roberts was able to still be an entertainer and was able to perform when she was pregnant. This past mother's day, she celebrated her daughter's first birthday by publishing a song for her. Her daughter's name is Lily and the song title is Diamond in My Heart.

Its main theme is a celebration and depiction of the Rosary. History The Rosary Basilica is the third of the churches to be completed on the site (after the Crypt and the Upper Basilica). It was designed by architect Leopold Hardy and completed in 1899. It was consecrated in 1901 and has a capacity of 1,500 worshippers. Its style is influenced by Byzantine architecture. In 2006-7 the interior and exterior of the basilica were extensively renovated and the mosaics (many of which were deteriorating) were restored. Nave Interior view of the dome The nave is open and circular, surmounted by a dome. The dome contains sixteen circular stained glass windows. The fifteen spaces between these windows signify the fifteen decades of the traditional rosary. The sanctuary of the basilica looking towards the Sorrowful Mysteries The nave is surrounded by fifteen smaller side chapels, one for each of the traditional Mysteries of the Rosary. On the left of the nave are found the Joyful Mysteries; in the centre behind the sanctuary are the Sorrowful Mysteries, and to the right are the Glorious Mysteries. Each side-chapel comprises a large mosaic with a central image depicting the theme of that Mystery, and an inscription in Latin. Incorporated within the larger image may be smaller images of related themes. For example, the side chapel directly behind the altar contains a depiction of the Crowning with Thorns, which is surmounted by an image of the Ark of the Covenant (see figure). Detail of a side chapel mosaic depicting the Pentecost Most of the mosaics bear a date of around 1900. In each side-chapel is a small altar bearing six candles. Mosaic depicting the Virgin Mary In the upper wall of the sanctuary is a mosaic depicting Mary with outstretched arms and the caption Par Marie √† J√©sus (\\"Through Mary to Jesus\\").Oliver Todd, The Lourdes Pilgrim, Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 44. This depiction, of a very young woman facing directly forwards, is much more in keeping with Bernadette's descriptions of the apparition than the iconic statue in the niche in the Grotto. The gilded crown and cross surmounting the dome The exterior of the dome is surmounted by a dramatic gilded crown and cross, which were a gift from the People of Ireland in 1924. The cross was regilded in 2000-2. Fa√ßade The Rosary basilica has a semicircular white marble entry facade, depicting Mary handing the Rosary to St. Dominic. In 1941, the white marble side doors of the basilica were engraved with a message of gratitude to Marshal Philippe P√©tain, who visited Lourdes in 1941 and allowed the Church to reclaim ownership of the Domain. In translation, this inscription read: The exterior facade of the basilica has been modified in 2007 to include mosaics depicting the Luminous Mysteries, which were added to the traditional fifteen mysteries by Pope John Paul II in 2002.

The 1884 house designed by Emil W. Ulrici overlooks Saint Paul from the bluffs east of downtown.  History  Germans were one of the earliest immigrant groups that came to Saint Paul. As many of them became prosperous, they moved into Dayton's Bluff and built substantial homes for their families. Several, including the home of Adolph and Anna Muench, were set at the edge of the bluff to take advantage of the descending landscape that allowed for a view of Phalen Creek and the Mississippi River. The Munches began residing at this address in 1873, in an earlier house that burned down in 1884. The current structure, was built the same year at a cost of $10,000 and had the nickname of, \\"the Manor\\". Adolph was a prominent member of the German American community. He was in the lumber business until becoming publisher of the Volkszeitung, a German-language daily newspaper. Anna died in 1896 and, when Adolph died in 1901, the house was offered for sale. After staying empty for two years, it was converted into duplex and was rental property for several decades. One descendant fondly remembered the traditional Fourth of July parties at the house. The lawn was dotted with Japanese lanterns and carriages were crowded in the turnaround. Every summer there were ice cream socials among the lilac bushes and oak trees. Local architect Emi Ulrici designed the new house that was completed at 653 East Fifth Street. Ulrici, a German-American, who built almost exclusively for his prosperous fellow immigrants that were scattered throughout Saint Paul in the 1880s. This Queen Anne style with asymmetrical towers gables and balconies with a traditional tower is considered the finest of his surviving residential commissions.

Its origins trace to 1851, when the Sisters of St. Joseph opened a school for girls in a log cabin in the frontier settlement. In 1863 the school relocated to a new building, which was expanded over the following decades into a complex that still stands today as the oldest extant Catholic school building in the state of Minnesota. With The school complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for its local significance in the themes of architecture, education, and religion. It was nominated for being the state's oldest known Catholic school, a longstanding local landmark, and a symbol of a religious group's early educational efforts on the American frontier. History Fifteen years after the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet arrived in Missouri from Lyon, France, four of the Sisters came to Minnesota Territory. Joseph Cr√©tin, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of St. Paul, had asked them for help with the work facing the growing community. The four Sisters of St. Joseph arrived by steamboat and settled on the banks of the Mississippi River in November 1851. Within a week they opened their first school in the vestry of a log chapel, the forerunner of the Cathedral of St. Paul. When the need for more space became apparent, the Sisters acquired land on what was then the outskirts of the city, in an area known as St. Anthony Hill (now Cathedral Hill). In 1863 the first building that became St. Joseph's Academy was built on the corner of Marshall and Western Avenues. This three-and-a-half-story limestone building is one of the oldest in St. Paul. Growth spurred the construction of more buildings on the property to house new programs and more classrooms. From 1863, St. Joseph's Academy had been a boarding school, too distant for daily commutes. This ended in 1905, when the city had grown and more streetcar lines became available in St. Paul. By 1926, St. Joseph's Academy had become one of the early St. Paul high schools. In the early 20th century, the Academy's curriculum featured a well-equipped science laboratory. As the catalog stated, there was also a \\"collection of specimens for botanical and geological study\\". The commercial department expanded so that students could choose between working after high school and taking college preparation courses. During this period of growth from 1882‚Äì1930, St. Joseph's was also home to Ellen Ireland, a high achiever and one of the high school's first graduates. Ireland entered the St. Joseph's convent and became Mother Seraphine, leader of the sisters in the St. Paul Province. Except for temporary assignments at other convents, St. Joseph's Academy was her lifelong home. She joined her brother, Archbishop John Ireland, in helping to expand the academy. Together they prepared the way for the founding of the College of St. Catherine (now St. Catherine University) in 1905. In 1901 graduates of St. Joseph's Academy formed an alumnae association and began their newsletter, Chapter Chats. Although the newsletter lapsed for a number of years, the tradition was reinstated in 1931. In the early 21st century the SJA Alumnae Association continues to send Chapter Chats to thousands of members. St. Joseph's Academy was home to many accomplished teachers over the years. Several of the Sisters also contributed their talents to the wider community. Among them was Sister Mary Aloysius Sherin, a celebrated math and science teacher from 1935 to 1955. In 1938 Sister Ann Thomasine Sampson became director of the SJA Glee Club. The group was in demand for many community-wide events in St. Paul. After retirement, Sister Ann Thomasine conducted oral histories of a number of Sisters. The histories are still available in the archives of the Sisters of St. Joseph. Sister Irmina Kelehan, an English teacher at St. Joseph's, responded in 1956 to a request from the Japanese government to open a school in Tsu, Japan. She joined several other Sisters of St. Joseph from around the United States and opened a school for girls. They named it St. Joseph's Academy. In 1971, enrollment declined while the costs of maintaining older buildings kept rising. The Sisters decided it was time to close St. Joseph's Academy and turn to other ministries. The property and buildings were sold to Christ's Household of Faith.

It is the thirty-ninth book in the series and it was originally published in French in 1972 and in English by Cinebook in 2010 as The Bounty Hunter. Plot Following a short introduction on the general status of bounty hunters in the Old West, we get introduced to the titular character, Elliot Belt, a notorious and unscrupulous representative of his trade. To avoid the risk of an injustice, Lucky Luke decides to find a horse belonging to Bronco Fortworth. But Fortworth, convinced that the thief is the Cheyenne Wet Blanket, launches a wanted notice and a reward of 100,000 dollars to who will bring the Indian. The bounty hunter Elliot Belt is interested in the offer. He repeatedly offers Lucky Luke to join, but the lone cowboy declines his offer. While Lucky Luke seeks to find Wet Blanket first, fearing that this hunt could lead to an Indian war, Elliot Belt is obsessed with the reward he could receive. He brings together several other bounty hunters to attack the Cheyenne village and find Wet Blanket. This incident is close to causing an Indian war. However, Wet Blanket agrees to be a prisoner, while proclaiming his innocence, so that the worst is avoided. On the way back to the small town of Cheyenne Pass, Luke and Wet Blanket discover the horse of Bronco Fortworth. They bring him back to town when the Wet Blanket trial has just started. A dramatic change takes place: Thelma, Fortworth's estranged wife, comes to testify at the trial and admits that it was she who released the horse, jealous of the affection that Fortworth had for the animal. The Fortworth couple, who had separated, reconciles. Wet Blanket is exonerated. Fortworth gives the reward to the Cheyennes. Leaving court, Belt attempts to kill Lucky Luke for revenge, but his plan fails. Luke learns that Belt is wanted for reward for \\"trying to cause an Indian war\\". Belt's head being put at a price, Luke lets Belt escape: in his turn, he is going to be hunted down by bounty hunters. Notes * Elliot Belt's appearance is an obvious nod on Lee Van Cleef, particularly his acting roles as merciless bounty hunter. *The scene where Elliot as a child denounces himself to his father (for a reward) for having chopped down a cherry tree is inspired by the myth concerning George Washington.

Kilpatrick was charged with eight felonies and Beatty with seven. Charges for both included perjury, misconduct in office and obstruction of justice. Worthy also suggested that others in the Kilpatrick administration could also be charged. On December 1, 2008, Beatty admitted lying under oath and was sentenced to 120 days in jail. She began serving the sentence on January 5, 2009.http://www.freep.com/article/20081201/NEWS01/312020002/1001/news Text- messaging scandal The charges stem from a political-sex scandal emerging from a sexual relationship between Detroit Mayor Kilpatrick and his chief of staff Christine Beatty. The revelation of this extra-marital affair was confirmed in text messages exchanged between Kilpatrick and Beatty. The text messages appear to contradict testimony that Kilpatrick and Beatty gave at a trial in 2007 in regards to whether they had an affair and had fired an officer for investigating the mayor's behavior. The City of Detroit settled the lawsuit for $8.4 million based on the recommendation of Kilpatrick and the City of Detroit law department. The news led to Beatty resigning in February 2008 and political leaders and citizens calling for Kilpatrick to resign.

Since the 1990s onwards, the Government of Argentina has taken steps to address this problem. However, the policies of Argentina have been criticized for being weak, primarily due to focusing on civil, rather than criminal dealing with this form of violence, and for stressing conciliation between victim and perpetrator. The policy dealing with domestic violence has also been made more difficult due to the decentralized nature of the country: Argentina being a federal state with 23 provinces has caused significant regional variation between provincial policies on domestic violence, with women across the country having differing levels of protection. Legal situation Argentina's Ley Nacional 24.417, of 1994, was its first law on domestic violence. Under this law, domestic violence is defined as \\"injury or physical or psychological abuse\\"(lesiones o maltrato f√≠sico o ps√≠quico) by family members. In 2009, a much broader law was enacted: Ley de protecci√≥n integral para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia contra las mujeres en los √°mbitos en que desarrollen sus relacion es interpersonales [Ley 26.485] (The Comprehensive Law on the Prevention, Punishment and Elimination of Violence against Women in their Interpersonal Relations [Law 26.485]). This new law defines many forms of domestic abuse that were not present in the former law. Public support Public and private institutions offer prevention programs and provide support and treatment for abused women. In general, complaints of domestic violence are addressed in civil courts, which can secure protection measures, including banning a perpetrator from a victim‚Äôs home or workplace.United States Department of State In 2012, the Congress passed an anti femicide law imposing stricter penalties on perpetrators who kill their spouses, partners, or children as a consequence of gender based violence.United States Department of State  See also  * Women in Argentina * Crime in Argentina References Argentina Category:Violence in Argentina ","title":"Domestic violence in Argentina"},{"id":"16710902","text":"St. Clare's Priory, Stockholm Blodbadsplanschen 1524 Anna Rheinholdsdotter Leuhusen (died c. 1554), was the Abbess of St. Clare's Priory in Stockholm. She became known for her involvement in the Swedish War of Liberation between Sweden and Denmark in the 1520s. Background Anna Leuhusen was born the child of Reinhold Leuhusen, merchant in Stockholm, and the sister of Martin Leuhusen, who is listed as a member of the city council of 1521; Martin Leuhusen was a fervent Catholic who did not convert until 1536. Her sister was married to the Danish colonel Gregorius Holst. The year of her birth is unknown. Anna Lehusen entered the Clara Abbey as a member of the order of Saint Clare of Assisi. She was appointed abbess sometime prior to 1508. This year, she is confirmed as such, when she appealed to the city for economic assistance in her capacity of abbess. Act during the war During this period, Sweden and Denmark, formally united through the Kalmar Union, was involved in various warfare which eventually led to the Swedish War of Liberation. In 1520, the city of Stockholm was sieged and taken by the Danes after the defeat of Christina Gyllenstierna. Soon after, however, the rest of Sweden rose in rebellion and in 1522, the city was besieged by the Swedes under Gustav Vasa. During the siege, the St. Clare's Priory was used as an escape channel by people who wished to join the Swedes outside the city, both merchants and courtiers. Leuhusen was a Danish loyalist and, according to the legend, responsible for betraying several of these people. During the day, she signaled by hanging a white cloth out of the window and, during the night, a lamp to the part of the convent facing the city, as a sign to the Danes that there were refugees in the building. When they left the convent on their way outside the city, they were taken by the Danes and executed for treason. This was performed in collaboration with her brother-in-law, the Danish loyalist mayor of Stockholm.Lisbet Scheutz (2001 (2003) nuytg√•va).

Anna Leuhusen is known to have kept one of the convent most treasured possessions. When the abbey was founded in 1288, Princess Richenza of Sweden had entered it, and became its abbess in 1335. Richenza possessed a golden chain, which was consequently used by the abbesses of the abbey for centuries. Anna Leuhusen kept this chain when the abbey was dissolved and gave it to her family.

None of the schools, however, were ultimately successful. The \\"Parsons Plan\\" academic model employed at Charles City was the brainchild of Millard Roberts, who was the president of Parsons College from 1955 to 1967; the multi-faceted plan featured innovative teaching and administrative techniques and emphasized the recruitment of a geographically and academically diverse student body. Among other characteristics, the \\"Parsons Plan\\" schools welcomed unconventional students who had not seen success at other colleges. In the 1960s, the schools were also attended by a substantial number of young men seeking draft deferments that would allow them to avoid military service during the Vietnam War. Charles City's reputation and fortunes were strongly tied to those of Parsons and when Parsons faltered beginning in 1967 the prospects for Charles City College and the other Parsons satellite schools grew bleak. The satellite schools also suffered from a lack of funding, high student turnover and accreditation issues. Ultimately, none of the \\"Parsons Plan\\" colleges became economically viable and all closed by the mid-1970s.

McCaslin was described as \\"an avid fan\\" of country music singer Chely Wright. In 2001, he attended a charity event and placed the winning bid of $14,500 for a dinner with the performer, with proceeds benefiting Wright's Reading, Writing and Rhythm Foundation. Subsequent United States Secret Service files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (United States) indicate that McCaslin stalked Wright using mail sent to her fan group, sending a VHS tape to her brother and showing up at a concert in an attempt to slip her a note. = The Phantom Patriot = Richard McCaslin as the Phantom Patriot On January 19, 2002, McCaslin attempted a raid on the Bohemian Grove campground, just north of San Francisco, while dressed as his alter ego The Phantom Patriot.Masked man enters, attacks Bohemian Grove:'Phantom' expected armed resistance, by Peter Fimrite, San Francisco Chronicle, January 24, 2002 McCaslin later claimed to have been concerned about ritualistic child sacrifice taking place at Bohemian Grove, after seeing the documentary film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, by radio show host Alex Jones.Bohemian Grove commando found guilty, SFGate, April 17, 2002 McCaslin planned to burn the massive owl statue at the Bohemian Grove, believing it to be emblematic of the Canaanite god Moloch, associated with child sacrifice.

Steam locomotives =No. 1 Sans Pareil= The first gauge locomotive operated on the line, built by Bassett-Lowke of Northampton in 1912 as Prins Olaf for a railway in Cristiania (now Oslo), Norway. It arrived for the line's opening in 1915 to Muncaster Mill. It was a Bassett-Lowke Class 30 4-4-2 locomotive and was painted in the dark blue livery of narrow gauge railways. It was withdrawn from traffic in the mid-1920s and parts of it were incorporated into River Mite of 1927. Its leading pony truck was reused under the Passenger Tractor of 1929 for many years. An identical locomotive, Synolda, now resides in Ravenglass railway museum. =No. 2 Colossus= A Bassett-Lowke Class 60 4-6-2, built in 1913 for Captain JE Howey, later of Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway fame, and named John Anthony. It arrived at the same time as Katie in 1916 and was nearly destroyed in a collision with Muriel in 1925. However, it ran after overhaul until 1927, when it was dismantled and utilised as part of the new River Mite 4-6-0-0-6-4 four-cylinder locomotive. =No. 3 Muriel, then River Irt =  Muriel  Muriel, whilst at the Duffield Bank Railway A 0-8-0T, constructed for the Duffield Bank Railway by Sir Arthur Heywood in 1894. It arrived in Ravenglass via the Gretna munitions factory in 1917 with Ella and was principally used on stone trains.  River Irt  River Irt Muriel received a major overhaul and rebuilt at Murthwaite in 1927, becoming a 0-8-2 tender locomotive named River Irt. It has remained in traffic on passenger duties ever since and is now the oldest working gauge locomotive in the world. In 1972 it was rebuilt to a narrow gauge outline with a raised cab, and was then re-boilered in 1977, giving the locomotive its current appearance. It has visited the National Railway Museum in York and was part of the Ratty fleet at the Liverpool and Gateshead Garden Festival Railways in 1984 and 1990. The livery of the locomotive is currently mid-green with yellow and black lining. River Irt briefly appears in animated form in the 1980‚Äôs animated film ‚ÄòThe Plague Dogs‚Äô, where the engine is seen pulling the train the two main characters use to escape from a group of soldiers hunting them. =No. 4 Ella = Sir Arthur Heywood's 0-6-0T of 1881, built for his Duffield Bank Railway, it arrived with Muriel in 1917. Ten years later came the decision to convert the locomotive into an Internal Combustion machine, after years of regular use on granite trains from Beckfoot quarry. Its frames became part of ICL No. 2. =No. 5 Sir Aubrey Brocklebank= A 4-6-2 tender locomotive, similar to Colossus, built by Hunt of Southampton in 1919. The engine became the railway's new flagship locomotive on passenger duties and replaced Sans Pareil on in everyday usage. In 1927 the engine was dismantled and used in the construction of the new River Mite locomotive, the running gear of the locomotive combined with that of Colossus gave the railway a new four-cylinder machine for the 1928 season. =No. 6 Katie = A 0-4-0T built by Sir Arthur Heywood in 1896 for the Duke of Westminster's Eaton Hall Railway. It came to Ravenglass in 1916 and left in 1919. Few photographs survive of it working in Cumbria, however the remains of the locomotive returned to the railway in 1982 after spells at Llewellyn's Miniature Railway, Southport and the Fairbourne Railway, Wales. In 1992, the R&ER; Heritage Group formed, with an aim to restore the locomotive to original condition. After many years of fundraising and work, Katie‚Äôs rebuild was completed in 2017. She is usually on display in the railway‚Äôs museum at Ravenglass, but is frequently steamed for special events and ‚Äòdriver for a fiver‚Äô days in the summer. She has also made several visits away from Ravenglass since her return to steam, including the Beamish Open Air Museum, the Fairbourne Railway, and the Kirklees Light Railway. =No. 7 River Esk = River Esk at Dalegarth Built in 1923 as a 2-8-2 by Davey Paxman of Colchester and designed by Henry Greenly, it was designed to haul both stone and passenger trains, however soon found more use on passenger traffic. It was originally fitted with Lentz poppet valve gear, but this didn‚Äôt prove to be successful. It was painted works grey in 1924, then LMS red with black and straw lining to 1927. It was then repainted mid green with black and yellow lining during a rebuild in 1928 by the Yorkshire Engine Co, when the original valve gear was replaced with the current walcharts valve gear. At the same time, the loco received a Poultney steam tender, making the locomotive a 2-8-2-0-8-0. This proved unsuccessful and was soon removed, instead being utilised nearly forty years later as part of the second River Mite, after languishing at Murthwaite. The locomotive was out of use from 1940 to 1952, survived into the preservation era and was repainted in a new livery of LNWR black in 1967 and received a new tender in 1970. In 1983, the Esk was fitted with a gas-producer boiler and received an award from British Coal, however this has been out of use since 2001. The locomotive has visited the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway several times and was a predecessor to that railway's Greenly Pacific locomotives. The engine is currently in Blackberry Black of the LNWR with red, off-white and black lining. In 2013, River Esk was undergoing an overhaul in the workshop at Ravenglass when the facility was destroyed in a fire. Staff and volunteers managed to save the frames and some other components from the flames, but the majority of River Esk‚Äôs parts were damaged beyond repair. Following completion of the new workshop in 2015, River Esk was rebuilt, and returned to steam in 2018. =No. 8 River Mite (I) = River Mite, in its original articulated form Constructed at Murthwaite with a new boiler and the running gear of Colossus and Sir Aubrey Brocklebank in 1927, the first River Mite was an unsuccessful four- cylinder locomotive of the railway's own design. It lasted a decade in traffic before scrapping, the locomotive being too lightly built for the amount of work and the steepness of the gradients of the line. =No. 9 River Mite (II) = River Mite at Fisherground Halt Using the former Poultney 0-8-0 tender chassis, fitted to River Esk from 1928 to 1931, the new Preservation Society in 1963 started fund raising and ordered it to be built into a 2-8-2 locomotive, which was designed and completed by Clarksons of York. It was delivered in December 1966 hauled by traction engine Providence, and commissioned on 20 May 1967. Its presence enabled the railway to operate a longer and more intensive summer service. It is in many ways similar to the River Esk, using that loco's original 1923 coupled wheels in the Yorkshire Engine Company frames but different front and a rear Cortazzi truck, with a miniature main line outline styled on an LNER Gresley 2-8-2 P1 locomotive and an LMSR Stanier tender. The cost was some ¬£8,000, entirely raised by voluntary subscription as are all the major maintenance costs. After heavy overhauls in 1977 and 2006/7, it celebrated its fortieth year at Ravenglass in 2007 owned by the R&ER; Preservation Society. The locomotive was painted in the Indian Red of the Furness Railway, with yellow and black (now vermilion and black) lining, apart from a short period in cherry red from 1972 to 1977. At the end of the 2019 operating season, River Mite was withdrawn for another major overhaul. The loco is currently at Old Hall Farm, Bouth, and is expected to return to service in the near future. =No. 10 Northern Rock = Northern Rock With passenger numbers increasing in the early 1970s, the decision was taken by the railway company to acquire another steam loco to supplement the existing fleet. After undertaking trials with the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway no. 2, Northern Chief in 1972, it was decided that the new loco would a 2-6-2 narrow gauge online design to match the profile of the new closed saloons entering service on the railway, and incorporating the best features of a number of existing locomotives. The new loco would also be built onsite in the railway‚Äôs workshop at Ravenglass. Originally, the new engine was to be named Sir Arthur Heywood. After the railway received funding from the Northern Rock building society to support the construction of the new loco, it was instead decided to name the locomotive after its chief sponsor. It entered traffic in 1976, as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the railway‚Äôs opening to passengers. Northern Rock has since proved to be a reliable and powerful locomotive, and remains the flagship of the locomotive fleet at Ravenglass. The engine has visited several railways, including the 1990 Gateshead Garden Festival Railway, the Bure Valley Railway, and as far away as Dresden, Germany, to publicise the railway. Two similar locomotives have been built at Ravenglass for the Shuzenji Romney Railway in Japan, Northern Rock II and Cumbria, in 1989 and 1992, respectively. The livery of the engine is Highland Railway Muscat Green with red and dark green lining. =No. 11 Bonnie Dundee= Bonnie Dundee exhibited in Ravenglass station in April 2015. Originally a gauge 0-4-0WT built by Kerr Stuart in 1900 for Dundee gasworks, the engine was bought by Ian Fraser around 1960 (who took his case to build a locomotive shed in his garden to the Secretary of State for Scotland) and donated to the railway in 1976. After a rebuild, it emerged as an 0-4-2T in 1982, with the side tanks from 'Ella', and was used on winter and other lighter trains. 1996 saw the locomotive rebuilt again with a new boiler and reversed Southern valve gear replacing the original inside Stephenson's valve gear, this time incorporating a tender. It was withdrawn from traffic in 2005 awaiting an overhaul, and visited the Windmill Farm Railway in 2007-10 on static display. The engine has since been moved to the workshop at Old Hall Farm, Bouth, and is currently undergoing restoration to working order. The engine is painted in the Bronze Green livery of the North British Railway. =No. 12 Whillan Beck = Whillan Beck Built in 1929 at Krauss, Munich, works No. 8457, formerly named Pinta, is a 4-6-2 locomotive built to work at the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. After operating there throughout the exposition, it was then used occasionally until 1932 before being placed in storage until the 1960s, when it was purchased along with its sister locomotives to run on a park railway in Madrid, though it is unknown if No. 8457 ever ran there. In the 2000s it was then purchased by a group intending to start up a railway in Barcelona, but this project never materialised and the locomotive remained in storage. In 2015, the locomotive was purchased by the R&ERPS; as part of the 'Train From Spain' Appeal and arrived in Cumbria in February 2016, with the chassis moving to Ravenglass later that month. The locomotive made its first moves under its own steam in November 2016, but required a new tender before it was able to enter service in March 2018. It was previously in crimson lake livery, though it has now been repainted in Caledonian Railway blue, as voted for by members of the R&ERPS.; =Synolda= Sister locomotive to Sans Pareil, built in 1912 by Bassett-Lowke of Northampton. It arrived at the R&ER; in 1978 and was restored to running condition in two years by apprentices from British Nuclear Fuels at the nearby Sellafield plant. It currently resides in Ravenglass museum, although the locomotive is in operational condition and appears in steam at special events. The livery is Royal Blue of narrow gauge railways. =The Flower of the Forest= An 0-4-0 vertical boilered tank engine, built for Ian Fraser of Arbroath in 1987. After Fraser's death in 1992, the engine returned to Ravenglass and operated during gala and \\"Thomas\\" events in the 1990s. It is now stored unserviceable in the Ravenglass museum compound. The livery is that of the North Eastern Railway. She is now on semi-permanent loan to the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway. She is not planned to be restored. =Si√¢n= Si√¢n is a 2-4-2 currently at the Kirklees Light Railway, however it is owned by the Si√¢n Project Group, who are members of the R&ER; Preservation Society. The locomotive was built by Guest Engineering of Stourbridge in 1963 for the Fairbourne Railway in Wales and then worked at the Bure Valley Railway after the Fairbourne was re-gauged. It is currently in a maroon livery. It had an extended visit to Ravenglass between April 2008 and April 2009, spending most of the 2000-2010 boiler ticket on the Windmill Animal Railway. From May 2018, Si√¢n moved to the KLR in West Yorkshire, joining sister Katie there. Internal combustion locomotives =ICL No. 1 Bunny= A rebuild of a Crewe Tractor, a First World War rail-mounted Ford Model-T car with a 0-4-0 chain coupled wheel arrangement and a built-in turntable in order for it to change direction. It was used from 1923 to 1925 until the magneto broke the gearbox casing. The engine was rebuilt in 1926, with new running gear using the onetime Sand Hutton coach's bogie giving a 2-B petrol mechanical locomotive with a steeple cab wooden body. The locomotive in this form took and still holds the speed record for the line coming down from Dalegarth Cottages to Ravenglass driven by Cecil J Allan in some 14 minutes. This body lasted until October 1928, when it was damaged in a collision with ICL No. 2 near Muncaster Mill. The locomotive received its current body during extensive repairs. It continued in occasional use with light trains until the mid-1950s but was superseded as the other internal combustion locomotives used cheaper tax free TVO and could haul full length trains. It was operable until it had the engine removed in 1961 and became a toolvan or 'The Caboose' for the permanent way gang. It is now undergoing restoration to working condition with its Ford T engine. =ICL No. 2= 1927 saw the appearance of this 2-6-2 petrol mechanical locomotive, stemming from a Lanchester Model 38 touring car chassis mounted on the running gear components of Ella with the frames fitted to new cast stretchers . The engine and transmission from the Lanchester, worked a Parsons marine reverse box with chains to the rod final drive, within a teak body similar to that carried on ICL No. 1. It survived colliding with this locomotive in 1928 and was later withdrawn after pushing a big-end through the crank case the following year. It hauled passenger trains and the heaviest stone trains with equal ease but once the line to Murthwaite was constructed and the second Muir-Hill locomotive converted for running at passenger train speeds, ICL 2 lost its role and was never rebuilt. By the 1950s the frames and wheels still lay beside the line at Murthwaite. =NG 41= Chronologically, NG 41 was the third of the Muir-Hill Fordson tractors to be acquired by the railway. It was built in 1929 in Manchester and bought by the railway in order to haul stone trains between Beckfoot Quarry, Murthwaite Crushing Plant and Ravenglass. After 1953, when the quarry closed, NG 41 was cannibalised for parts like the worm gearing for the other two Fordson locomotives. The chassis lay at Murthwaite until it was scrapped in early 1972, however the wheels were used in the regauging of Bonnie Dundee. =ICL No. 4 Passenger Tractor, then Perkins= Petrol/TVO (mechanical)'0-4-4', No.4 'Passenger Tractor' with fake steam outline 12 August 1951. NG 39 was the second Muir-Hill Fordson tractor to be bought by the railway for quarry traffic. It arrived in 1929, three years after the original tractor, and was rebuilt as a steam-outline Diesel 0-4-4 using the front bogie off Sans Pareil in 1933 for occasional use on passenger trains. In this guise it was known as the Passenger Tractor and in the 1970s nicknamed Pretender. It worked through the war and handled the first passenger services after the end of the conflict in May 1945. In 1975 the hand crank started petrol/TVO (tractor vaporising oil) engine was replaced with a Perkins P6 Diesel, giving the locomotive a modern radiator grill at the front. In 1984, the locomotive was rebuilt again, however this time it lost its fake steam outline and became an 0-4-2 similar to an industrial Diesel shunter. It was named Perkins in 1985 and was given a twin-disc transmission in 1990 reverting to an 0-4-4. Its main use is on permanent way trains being capable of slow speed work for flail mowing and weed killing. It is currently painted yellow and black. =No. 5 Quarryman= Quarryman The first Muir-Hill quarry tractor arrived in 1926 for use on the granite traffic but was used on passenger trains on busy days. It gained an open-backed enclosed cab. In 1953 it exchanged components with NG 41. It was for a time used on relief passenger services with the Passenger Tractor until Shelagh of Eskdale was upgraded in 1975. Up until 1979 it was used regularly on works trains and has now been restored to original condition and is part of the Museum Collection. Its last scheduled passenger run was a special for the Cumbrian Railways Association in 1979, although it has operated informal after-hours specials on occasion since. Looked after by the Murthwaite Locomotive Group, it is currently operational and saw usage on permanent way duties, specifically ballast trains, in winter 2007. =No. 6 Royal Anchor= An experimental B-B Diesel hydraulic locomotive acquired by the railway in 1961 from the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway, who had trialled it and found it not powerful enough. It was built in 1956 by Charles Lane of the Royal Anchor hotel in Hampshire. It used a Ford 4D engine and a hydraulic drive, reputedly using parts from naval gun turrets, and could haul three full open bogie coaches but struggled with four. Without brakes other than putting the transmission into reverse, its ability to stop was limited until it could operate with the first R&ER; air braked coaches around 1973. It was out of use in 1968 after failing to stop for cows on the crossing at Muncaster Mill. Nevertheless, it otherwise gave good service on the overnight and first morning round trip trains. In the high summer season of 1975 it double headed Shelagh of Eskdale when the latter was incapable of hauling a heavy train. It was superseded by the completion of the Silver Jubilee railcar in 1977. In 1978 it was sold to Steamtown, Carnforth. However, after this railway closed to the public, it was sold to American film director Francis Ford Coppola in 2000 for use on a railway in one of his Californian vineyards. The engine first went to the Golden Gate Railroad Museum for repairs. The locomotive is currently in storage on the Coppola estate. =No. 7 Shelagh of Eskdale = Shelagh of Eskdale Tom Jones' Diesel was a 4-6-4 Diesel-hydraulic locomotive partially built by Heathcotes of Cleator Moor in 1956-7. The running gear utilises parts from Ella, specifically the crankwebs (5 of 6 originals survive) and centre drum of the sliding axle, as a repair for accountancy purposes. Unusually for a Diesel locomotive, the driven axles are linked by coupling rods, as for a steam locomotive. When the line was up for sale the construction was put on hold. However, in 1969 the chassis were sent away to Severn-Lamb of Stratford-on- Avon for completion to a design by David Curwen. Originally the engine was a Ford 4D, as in Royal Anchor, and had a Linde hydrostatic transmission that suffered cavitation problems on hot days of constant operation; this transmission was upgraded and the engine was replaced in 1975 by a Perkins 6/354. In September 1981 the locomotive went to the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway to work the school train services during the building of that railway's own mainline Diesel locomotive John Southland. Shortly after its return to Ravenglass, in 1983, it went briefly to Britannia Park, then to the International Garden Festival railway at Liverpool from March until October 1984, hauling HM Queen Elizabeth on the Opening Day. Subsequently it also operated at the Gateshead Garden Festival from February to October 1990. In 1998 the engine was rebuilt into a Diesel-mechanical locomotive when it gained a Ford industrial engine with Spicer Compact Shuttle transmission. It is currently a mixed traffic engine and used throughout the year. Its livery was originally blue with a silver roof, but has been two-tone green of various shades since 1978. =Silver Jubilee = Silver Jubilee and Northern Rock at Ravenglass The Silver Jubilee railcar was a set of coaches which first appeared in an embryonic stage in September 1976 as a single coach fitted with the Ford D engine and Linde transmission formerly in Shelagh of Eskdale, and centreless bogies. The three-car unit was named and launched in May 1977 at the inauguration of the railway's radio control system, the extra coaches being a driving trailer with air throttle controls at the Ravenglass end and a piped centre coach, which was later modified as a saloon for wheelchair access. The original livery was silver with the official Queens Silver Jubilee vinyl badges used on buses, and later a blue line. During its operating lifetime, the set was first used on a shuttle service from Ravenglass to the newly opened Muncaster Mill, and then largely on the first morning round trip and \\"overnight\\" trains, the latter throughout the winter. Although geared for speed a timed run, in special conditions in November 1979, of 17 mins from Dalegarth to Ravenglass could not break the end-to-end line speed record held by ICL No. 1, from forty years before. First the original powercar in 1983 and then in early 1984 both end driving coaches were fitted with automatic gearboxes with electric direction control and air for throttle. In 1984 the unit went to the Liverpool Garden Festival Railway, with an extra semi-open coach added in the middle of the formation. For this event it carried the BR InterCity Executive livery, the first vehicles in the country to do so after the concept coach, using the official BR paint. In subsequent years this livery saw detail changes as the main line HST livery evolved. After the school train, overnight and winter services stopped in 2001, Silver Jubilee lost its particular role. Latterly repainted in First Group 'Barbie' blue and pink/white striped livery, it was finally withdrawn after a trial visit as a 2 car unit to the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway in 2003, and has now been completely converted into locomotive hauled coaching stock. The centre saloon remains disabled saloon number 123, the centre semi-open number 126 was rebuilt to a disabled saloon with new structure under the old roof, the driving trailer is now saloon 136 and the driving car has been converted into disabled saloon 137. =No. 8 Lady Wakefield = Lady Wakefield at Dalegarth Lady Wakefield, known colloquially as Doris, is a B-B Diesel-mechanical locomotive completed at Ravenglass in 1980 and designed by Ian Smith, the railway's chief engineer at the time, based on a layout proposal by Neil Simpkins for the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway. It was built with a 112 bhp Perkins 6/354 engine, identical to that in Shelagh of Eskdale at the time. The engine has a Twin Disc gearbox and driveshafts to each end, along with chain-coupled wheels in centreless bogies. Shortly after commissioning in August 1980, the engine went to New Romney to prove Diesel traction was capable of handling the required loads and speeds on the RH&DR.; The cab had been made to fit through that line's restricted loading gauge under the Littlestone Road tunnel. While at Romney, Lady Wakefield showed that a single Diesel locomotive was capable of pulling the heavy sixteen coach school train. It became the basis for their two Diesel engines, John Southland and Captain Howey, built by TMA Engineering with a heavier slab frame and shaft coupled wheels, and the John Southland II, built for Shujenji in Japan and trialled at Ravenglass in 1989. The engine was also used as the template for a smaller gauge Diesel, Lady of the Lakes for the Ruislip Lido Railway, that was also constructed at Ravenglass. It was named by the wife of Lord Wavell Wakefield and used on permanent way duties throughout the year and passenger work in the summer. It was originally painted maroon with yellow, later with various bright red stripes, then blue with yellow ends and DRS styled motifs, and currently carries British Railways Brunswick Green livery with small yellow warning panels, similar to a British Rail Class 20. =Greenbat= Greenbat, also known as U2, is one of many battery electric locomotives that were built in Leeds by Greenwood & Batley. This particular engine was built in 1957 for Thomas Marshall & Co. of Storrs Bridge Fireclay Mine in Yorkshire. Its builder‚Äôs number is 2872 and was originally built to an unusual gauge of . When the mine closed, the engine was brought to Ravenglass in 1982, where the wheels were re-profiled to the Ratty's gauge and then became a versatile engine with which to shunt coaching stock. It awaits refurbishment at Ravenglass. =No. 9 Cyril= Locomotive ICL 9 \\"Cyril\\". Named after former company employee, Cyril Holland, Cyril was formerly named \\"Shabtrak\\", and is one of many industrial narrow gauge Diesels built by R.A. Lister. It was built in 1932, used on a peat bog railway not far from Manchester and first preserved at the Moseley Railway Trust, in Stockport, in its original form of an open sided cab and on gauge. When the engine arrived on the R&ER; in 1985, the volunteers for refurbishing \\"Shabtrak\\" used parts from another Lister locomotive and a 2-cylinder, Lister engine to rebuild it to gauge. At the same time they fitted a new cab and bonnet, in the style of a Lister Blackstone RM2. The engine now has full electrical, radio and air brake systems for working light passenger trains in emergencies and in 1989 was re-engined with a 20 h.p. Lister engine to improve performance. It was rebodied in 2006 by Ian Page Engineering of Millom. It is currently painted dark green, and is owned by the Murthwaite Locomotive Group. =Blacolvesley= Owned by Dr. Bob Tebb, Blacolvesley is the oldest workable internal combustion locomotive in the world.Dick Bodily: The Blakesley Miniature Railway. Update of June 2017. Retrieved on 7 February 2019. It was built by Bassett-Lowke in 1909 utilising parts of Henry Greenly's Class 10 Atlantic locomotives. Originally, it was fitted with a NAG 12/14 h.p. engine, which was later replaced with an Austin 8 engine at Saltbur. However, the original transmission, gearbox and bevel drive all remain in use. It was built for Charles Bartholomew for the Blakesley Miniature Railway at Blakesley Hall, but the engine has had a varied history since leaving there in 1939. It was later named \\"Elizabeth\\" and was kept on the railways at Saltburn, Haswell Lodge and Lightwater Valley up until 1994, although had been inoperable since the mid-1970s. When it arrived at Ravenglass, it was successfully restarted and operated in August 1994. It is now painted in its original colours once again and operated at gala events. The locomotive celebrated its 100th birthday in 2009 and has been on static display at the Railway Museum at Cleethorpes from 2010 to present. =No. 10 Les= Locomotive ICL 10 \\"Les\\". Les is a unique Lister Diesel locomotive ‚Äì the only gauge locomotive constructed as such by R.A. Lister ‚Äì built in 1960 for Mr. J. Lemon-Burton, of West Sussex. When he died, the engine went to the Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway in Kent. Here it gained the number 21 and the present name and livery. The engine's top speed is and is used by the fitters for minor shunting activities in the confines of Ravenglass station. It is currently in Lister dark green with cream stripes at one end. =No. 11 Douglas Ferreira = Douglas Ferreira In July 2004, the R&ER; Preservation Society placed an order with TMA Engineering of Birmingham for a new B-B Diesel hydraulic locomotive, that was to be funded by the Society. It was delivered the following year and named after the recently deceased former General Manager, Douglas Ferreira. It is a Diesel-hydraulic locomotive, with a Perkins 4-cylinder turbocharged engine, which is more compact yet even more powerful than that on Lady Wakefield, and is essentially a development of the quarter-century elder loco.

It is leased by the society to the company, carrying a Furness Railway Indian Red livery matching that on the Preservation Society's other locomotive, River Mite. It operated at the Bure Valley Railway gala in September 2009.  Three-foot gauge locomotives  For the construction of the railway by Ambrose Oliver, the \\"Contractor's locomotive\\" was noted in reports in the Whitehaven News at work in late 1874 but its identity and its subsequent history has never been determined. Just before the opening of the gauge line to goods in May 1875 an 0-6-0 tank locomotive was obtained from Manning Wardle. Its works number was 545 and it was named Devon. A second, similar, locomotive followed in October 1876 before the line opened to passengers. This was Manning Wardle works number 629, named Nabb Gill [sic].Ian Allan ABC of Narrow Gauge Railways, c. 1960, pp 49-50 The design was a \\" Special\\" developed from designs for Russia from 1871, and repeated for the Malta Railway from 1880. The Manning Wardle locomotives had heavy repairs one at a time at the Lowca Engine Works around 1892-5, with the fitting of Westinghouse air brake equipment and new smokeboxes. In 1905 a derailment at Murthwaite halt involved a locomotive with the boiler from Nabb Gill and the side tanks of Devon, but only Devon was working during the later years to the end of gauge services in April 1913. Both locomotives were gone, presumed scrapped, by late 1915.  Standard gauge locomotives  In December 1929, a 0-6-0 Diesel locomotive was obtained to work the Ravenglass-Murthwaite section. It was built by Kerr Stuart (works number 4421) and had a six- cylinder, , McLaren-Benz engine. Transmission was mechanical and final drive was by roller chains. In 1955 it was sold, through a dealer, to the National Coal Board for use at Wingate Grange Colliery, Durham. A new Dorman engine of was fitted in 1960.Rolt, L.T.C. A Hunslet Hundred, David & Charles 1964, pp 98-100 It is now preserved at the Foxfield Light Railway, restored to original external condition, and was displayed at Ravenglass in the summer of 2000. An unidentified standard gauge Muir-Hill locomotive was also noted at Murthwaite around 1954.

Struchen (1871‚Äì1947). The structure was built for Triune Lodge No. 190, AF & AM. It is one of the earliest and best preserved buildings erected exclusively for the use of a single Masonic Lodge. Henry Struchen, although not an architect, was a contractor and designer. He was a member of Triune Lodge and a prominent builder in the city. Opening ceremonies for the building were held Thursday, March 2, 1911. Triune Masonic Temple was recognized for its historic and architectural significance by being placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1980. Stylistically the temple is a good example of the Neo-Classical Revival of the opening decades of the twentieth century. The exterior is virtually unchanged while the interior retains its classic integrity and remains substantially intact. The front facade features four Doric columns, pedimented windows and a decorative cornice, while the lodge room itself is adorned with stately pillars representing the five classical orders of architecture. The front of the building gives a hint of the grandeur inside. The interior cherry and maple woodwork and many of the original furnishings remain. The building is notable because it incorporates elements of Masonic ritual into its architectural design.

It is the fortieth book in the series and it was originally published in French in the year 1973 and by Cinebook in 2011 under the title of The Grand Duke. The story is loosely based on the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, who undertook a tour of America in 1870-1871. Plot The Russian Grand Duke Leonid pays a diplomatic visit to the United States. However, a great reader of James Fenimore Cooper, in order for an important treaty to be completed, he first wants to have a recreational trip through the West, complete with bandits and Indian attacks! Lucky Luke is assigned as a bodyguard to the duke, who is quickly targeted by all sorts of villainous persons ‚Äî first and foremost a Russian anarchist who tries his best (or his worst) to assassinate the Grand Duke. With the interpreter of the Grand Duke, they travel the country, chased by the mysterious terrorist trying to assassinate the diplomat. Their journey begins in Abilene, the city where cowboys meet.

Uribe Uribe is best known for his political ideas in favor of the establishment of Guild socialism and trade unions in Colombia, his diplomatic work and his support of Colombian coffee growers in fighting diseases such as rust. One of his greatest contributions was, along with Benjamin Herrera, the founding of the Republican University that later became the Free University of Colombia. The Rafael Uribe Uribe Palace of Culture in Medell√≠n is named after him. Early years Rafael Uribe Uribe was born in the small town of Valpara√≠so, in the Sovereign State of Antioquia (Present day Department of Antioquia) at his family's country estate of El Palmar on April 12, 1859. His mother educated him at home and he was reportedly a shy boy. In 1871 Uribe was accepted to the University of Antioquia, then attended a military school called School of the State, where he received martial training. He also studied sporadically in Buga, Capital of the Sovereign State of Cauca (Present day Department of Valle del Cauca) where he also joined the Liberal rebels of Cauca during the Colombian Civil War of 1876 and was wounded in combat. In 1880 Uribe graduated from Our Lady of the Rosary University as a lawyer and the next year worked as Attorney General of Antioquia. He also became a Professor in constitutional law and political economy. In 1885 Uribe participated in another civil war, in which he was involved in the execution of a subordinate for disobedience. However, the Conservatives in power absolved him. Thousand days war In 1895 Uribe Uribe participated in the Civil War (1895), but was defeated in the Battle of La Tribuna by General Rafael Reyes. Uribe escaped through the Magdalena River and was later captured in the town of Santa Cruz de Mompox. He was imprisoned in the C√°rcel de San Diego, Cartagena de Indias. After being granted a pardon, Uribe became a Deputy to the Chamber of Representative in which he became a critic of the Regeneration. The Regeneration advocated for centralism, the restriction of civil liberties and an established accord with the Roman Catholic Church. The main promoters of this movement were President Rafael Nu√±ez (1880‚Äì1888) and Miguel Antonio Caro, (1892‚Äì1898). During these years Uribe also founded a newspaper called El Autonomista (\\"The Autonomist\\") managing a publicity campaign against the conservative government and attacked members of his own party, most notably Aquileo Parra. Due to these printings, Uribe gained significant prominence in Liberal Party, participating also in the uprising of October 20, 1899 which triggered the Thousand Days War. =Santander campaign= During the Santander military campaign between October 1899 and August 1900, Uribe commanded the liberal forces in the Battle of Bucaramanga (November 13‚Äì14, 1899), where he was defeated. He then organized a retreat to the city of C√∫cuta, where he joined forces with Liberal general Benjam√≠n Herrera. On December 15, 1899, while en route to Oca√±a his troops were ambushed at a location known as La Amarilla initiating the Battle of Peralonso. The battle ended the next day with the victory of Uribe over the conservatives. Uribe had attacked the bridge over the Peralonso River. For this action he was deemed the \\"Hero of Peralonso\\". Documents left by the retreating army later showed that its commander Vicente Villamizar had orders to let the liberal army pass to prolong the war and to give the government an excuse to confiscate property and issue more paper money. Moreover, before starting the battle, the government army provided the rebels with two mules loaded with ammunition, of which the liberals had little.[VV.AA.; Gran Enciclopedia de Cantabria. Editorial Cantabria SA. Santander. 1985 (8 volumes) and 2002 (volumes IX, X y X], additional text. =Capture of Conservative Higher Command= On February 2, 1900 Uribe Uribe's troops captured the Conservative Higher Command in a Hacienda named Teran. Between May 11 and May 15, 1900 he fought in the Battle of Palonegro, commanding his own division. The conservatives led by Pr√≥spero Pinz√≥n won the battle and Uribe crossed the border to Venezuela. Conservative troops under the command of general Rangel Garbiras managed to invade Venezuela and cut the aid of Cipriano Castro government to the Liberals but were defeated by general Uribe in the battle of San Cristobal (July 29,1901). Between 1901 and 1902 Uribe Uribe alternated military activities with peace initiatives which were not taken into account by the then conservative government of Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n. General Uribe saw that the Liberals would not be able to defeat the Conservatives, and therefore was inclined to surrender, albeit with certain conditions. On June 12, 1902 the government offered amnesty, and the liberal rebels began to demobilize. Uribe surrendered in the Hacienda Neerlandia on October 24, 1902. He began issuing pamphlets promoting the conservative government, and soon took a lower public profile. Death Rafael Uribe Uribe died on October 15, 1914 after he was attacked with axes the day before by two workers named Jes√∫s Carvajal and Leovigildo Galarza. Local authorities believed it to be an act of terrorism, but those suspicions were never confirmed. In popular culture According to an interview given by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez to Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza in his book El Olor de la Guayaba (The Guava's Smell), the character of Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a in One Hundred Years of Solitude was loosely based on Rafael Uribe Uribe. Garc√≠a M√°rquez's grandfather was under Uribe Uribe's command in the Thousand Days War. The assassination of Uribe Uribe and its subsequent investigation by Marco Tulio Anzola Samper is explored in detail by the Colombian novelist Juan Gabriel Vasquez in his novel The Shape of the Ruins. The 18th locality of the Capital District of the capital city Bogot√°, Colombia is named for Uribe., additional text.

They are commonly found abundantly on Microalgae, seagrass beds, giant kelp, and coral reefs globally, since these are their main food sources and habitats. Their foraging behaviour is grazing on the organism they are living on, where there are typically masses reaching tens of thousands of mesograzers per meter of habitat. They experience predation from micro-carnivorous fish that help regulate the population of kelp and other common food sources of mesograzers by controlling the population of mesograzers; consequently, grazing is an important process linking aquatic vegetation to higher trophic level. Mesograzers show important top-down effect on marine communities, depending on the diversity and presence of predators. Mesograzers are typically overlooked in scientific research however their foraging effects have been suggested to have extreme effects on the population of their common food sources. They both positively and negatively affect macroalgal performance and productivity through grazing on algal (i.e., negative effect), or through removing epiphytes (i.e., positive effects). Mesograzers typically exist in spaces lacking enemies by inhabiting, therefore consuming, marine vegetation which are defended against more mobile, larger consumers through chemical defenses. Mesograzers are quite common in the marine environment, common examples of mesograzers are small Gastropoda, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and small Crustaceans.  Diet  Sea grass washed ashore by irvin calicut Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) holdfast torn from the bottom by a storm. California Channel Islands NMS. Mesograzers consume a variety of marine vegetation. They typically use the same marine plant as both their habitat and food source. Many mesograzers have been found on sea grass beds. They are also quite known for destroying large populations of giant kelp, as this is another popular source for mesograzers. Other common food sources of mesograzers are coral reefs and macroalgal. They can be found living and feeding on these marine plants worldwide. Mesograzers have even been shown to consume invasive species of microalgae.  Ecological role  There is little understanding of mesograzers ecological role. Examination of mesograzer outbreaks in natural, as well as aquacultural settings suggests that they have the potential to alter the abundance of algal. However, the rarity of such events infers that the impact of mesograzers is more than likely insignificant. Nonetheless, observations alone are not significant enough to quantify their ecological role. Many researchers have tried to determine community-wide effects of mesograzers in laboratory studies. This has proven to be difficult due to high spatial and temporal variation in the density of mesograzers, variation in feeding behaviour, along with variable relationships between plant fitness and mesograzers consumption rates. These factors make it difficult to replicate a mesograzers natural environment in a laboratory setting. This difficulty lends to the low understanding of mesograzers ecological role in marine communities. The strongest evidence for mesograzers altering a marine community thus far demonstrates the ability of mesograzers to limit populations of algal epiphytes, which in turn shows benefits for sea grass. However, there is a high need for further field research in this area.  In gastropods  thumb328x328px Dorsal view of Elysia clarki on the algal food source Penicillus capitatus. The scale bar is 5 mm. Grazing herbivorous gastropods are known as mesograzers. They are commonly known to graze upon epilithic microalgae on rocky shores. The grazing gastropods in these regions are exposed to daily exposure to air, as well as immersion in seawater, due to the tides. Intertidal grazing gastropods can therefore get their food from epilithic microalgae and planktonic microalgae deposited during the tidal shift. However, they obtain most of their food by grazing on the microalgae on the rock surface. The algae availability along with feeding capability will determine the diets of the gastropod grazers on rocky shores. Different gastropod grazers with varying radula morphology are known to use the same food source. A possible explanation is that the gastropods may find differentiating between the various types of microalgae in their environment quite difficult. The marine vegetation consumed by grazing gastropods occasionally produces chemical deterrents to prevent mesograzers from feeding on them. Different gastropod grazers elicit different plant responses.  In crustaceans  Many crustacean species depend largely on animals as their food source, however others feed on pure algal diets (e.g., cyclopoid). Different species of cyclopoid have various mouth parts. This affects if they are grazers or predators, and if grazers, what vegetation they will prefer to graze on. Temperature also has an effect on the grazing behaviour of certain small crustaceans. The relationship between algal and grazer typically shifts with the seasons. thumb288x288pxEurydice affinis Marine isopod from the Belgian Continental Shelf 2003. Camera mounted on a Zeiss Stemi C-2000 binocular microscope. Length: ~3 mm. =Isopoda= Isopoda are an order of crustacean commonly known as mesograzers, due to their general small size and grazing herbivorous feeding behaviour. The mechanisms affecting their habitat choice and grazing in sea grass meadows is affected by the latitude. For isopod grazers, food type is considered a universal mechanism in determining the presence of these grazers on sea grass meadows. Food is more important than shelter, in the absence of predators, regarding habitat choice. Many factors, such as food quality, location, predation, plant morphology, and physiology of the isopod affect food, thus habitat choice. Isopod grazers typically respond to substances excreted by their food source, particu00larly epiphytes alone do not attract isopods (e.g., snails). =Amphipoda= Amphipoda are an order of crustacean that typically graze on algae, considering them mesograzers. Due to global stressors, the population main food sources for amphipods, such as algae, have seen some fluctuation. To ensure they are feeding on the best algae, amphipods have many strategies to picking algae to graze on. To optimize their diet they choose the most nutritive algae, or they increase their consumption rate and/or absorption efficiency while grazing on less nutrient rich algae. These amphipod mesograzers use their host vegetation as both food and habitat, therefore the extent of their impact on benthic communities is related to patterns of host use by these consumers. Food and shelter have been defined as the main factors determining these amphipods' host.

Extent  Violence against women was prevalent across all classes of Chilean society by 1994. As of the early 1990s, it was reported that domestic violence affects about fifty percent of the women in Chile. All socioeconomic classes are affected by domestic violence, with some groups having higher rates of domestic violence than others. Consistent with these findings, a 2003 Chilean national survey indicated that 25‚Äì30% of female homicides occur at home. A 2004 Chilean National Women's Service (SERNAM) study reported that 50 percent of married women had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse (2007). Between January and November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the police; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile.

Women are clearly the most likely to become victims of domestic violence, but other members of the household are also at risk for victimization. It has been acknowledged that there has been a long history of sex abuse in the country's Catholic Church as well.https://cruxnow.com/church- in-the-americas/2019/08/30/nuncio-linked-to-controversial-appointments-leaves- chile-in-nicaragua-government-targets-church/ Nature of domestic violence Domestic violence can be physical, psychological, emotional, verbal, or sexual. Men or women may be the offender, but research indicates that women suffer disproportionately from abuse by their male partners.Frost, M. (1999), Health visitors‚Äô perceptions of domestic violence: the private nature of the problem. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 30: 589‚Äì596. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01128.x Throughout history, women have been viewed by society as subordinate to men, leaving them susceptible to abuse by their male partners. Additionally, the home has been viewed as an essentially private institution, impeding lawmakers from moving forward with policies against domestic violence. With many choosing to look the other way when they learn of domestic violence, this problem persists and can be difficult to address. It is a common idea that outsiders, specifically lawmakers, should not interfere with such private matters as violence in the home. Growth of the women's movement in Chile, as elsewhere, has helped raise awareness and created concern at an international level. Contributing factors =Economic factors= Among the contributing factors to domestic violence are household factors, community and societal factors, and individual factors. Household factors include size, density and violence history. Community and societal factors include media violence, poverty level, crime rate, and environmental conditions. Lastly, individual factors are educational level, gender, age, and employment status.Fruhling, H. H., Tulchin, J. S., & Golding , H. (2003). Crime and violence in Latin America: Citizen security, democracy and the state. Woodrow Wilson Center Press Series Crime and Violence in Latin America . A 1999 study conducted by psychologists found that violence is a learned behavior and is passed down through generations. Exposure to violence in early childhood increases the risk for an individual to become violent in their own home.Walker, L. E. (1999). Psychology and domestic violence around the world. American Psychologist, 54, 21-29. In 2004, 44% of the Chilean population was living in poverty, and studies have shown that low socioeconomic status and stressful life events are positively correlated with domestic violence. Additionally, a 2003 study found that poverty, and escalation of negative life events that typically accompany poverty, increase Chilean women‚Äôs vulnerability to domestic abuse. So, while domestic violence occurs in all classes, it is more prevalent among poor households. In Chile, it has been found that families who experience domestic violence are usually isolated and lack supportive ties among the communities in which they live. The geographic concentration of poverty in Chile, with regard to the socioeconomic opportunities and risk behaviors of marginalized families living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, has been linked to higher rates of domestic violence.Kim, H., Grogan-Kaylor, A., Han, Y., Maurizi, L., & Delva, J.

In other parts of the world, there is some recent evidence to support reduced violence in cases where women own assets. Owning land or a house signifies a woman's option to exit a violent relationship and deters marital violence.Panda, P., & Agarwal, B. (2005). Marital violence, human development and women‚Äôs property status in India. World Development, 33(5), 823-850. In Chile, married women and men have equal rights to their assets upon divorce or if a spouse dies.\\"Women, business, and the law: creating economic opportunity for women\\". The World Bank. 2011. Retrieved 18 March 2012. In rural Chile, inheritance is the principle way in which land is acquired by both men and women, whether the land has titles or not. Sometimes women cannot claim their inheritance to land without titles because the cost of legal documents is too high. The same effects on domestic violence have not been seen by female employment alone, since owning a home or land offers an immediate escape option. Land ownership can be empowering for women, a factor that, on its own, has been shown to reduce domestic violence. As these factors intersect, the risk for women is compounded and they become more susceptible to domestic violence. =Cultural factors= Until 1989, the Civil Code of Chile legally sanctioned husbands‚Äô ownership and authority over their wives, giving men power over their female partners and leading to abuse within the home. This power dynamic created by cultural beliefs can be seen around the world and is not isolated to Chile. The belief that Chilean women are more tolerant of male violence than other women has hindered policymakers from moving forward against domestic violence. This belief leaves Chilean women unprotected and trapped within abusive homes. Because events occurring in the home have been viewed as private family matters, historically, domestic violence has been socially and culturally accepted in Chilean society. The secrecy that has protected these offenders is exemplified by research results from 2004 that reported that 30% of women from the Region de la Metropolitana and 21% of women from the Region de la Araucania had not told anyone about their experiences with domestic abuse. The combination of these beliefs has allowed Chilean society to turn a blind eye to the domestic violence problem that plagues their communities. These myths are slowly coming to light as attitudes change and a movement against domestic violence has begun among Chilean women. Traditional marriage and family are very important in Chilean culture. Because of this, many Chilean women are encouraged to stay in abusive relationships and marriages because there is a stigma against divorce and being single, especially if a woman has children with the abusive spouse or partner.Parson, Nia C. ‚Äú‚ÄòSingle women are bitter‚Äù: ‚Äúthe gendered production of affective states in Chile.‚Äù Gender in Cross- Cultural Perspective, edited by Caroline Brettell and Carolyn F. Sargent, Seventh ed., Routledge, 2017, pp. 357‚Äì370. Economic impacts Domestic violence impacts the Chilean economy directly and indirectly. Chile has low levels of female labor force participation. A 2011 study found that while about 75% of U.S. women are engaged in paid employment, 43% of women in Chile are engaged in paid employment.Torche, F.(2010). Educational Assortative Mating and Economic Inequality: A Comparative Analysis of Three Latin American Countries. Demography 47(2), 481-502. Population Association of America. Retrieved April 13, 2013, from Project MUSE database. More sick days are taken by battered partners, decreased household productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Increased healthcare costs are attributed to emergency room visits, mental health services, medication, and physical therapy (2011) .Community costs of domestic violence. (2011, July 19). Retrieved from http://www.stopvaw.org/community_costs_of_domestic_violence Criminal justice and social services costs increase with high rates of domestic violence, but studies have found that programs aimed at intervening in or preventing domestic violence are highly cost-effective.Day, McKenna, and Bowlus, The Economic Costs of Violence against Women, 14, 44. =Direct impacts= The economy of Chile is impacted by domestic violence in several ways. These costs include increased expenditures on medical treatment, police services, criminal justice system, and social services. Injury from abuse leads to more emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. More time is spent by law enforcement responding to domestic violence calls, and criminal justice system costs are increased due to domestic violence court cases, which can lead, in turn, to prison costs. =Indirect impacts= With increased domestic violence rates, earnings are lower, productivity at work decreases, and labor market participation declines. A 1999 study conducted in Santiago, Chile, found that abused women were less likely to work outside the home.Morrison, A. R., & Orlando, M. B. (1999). Social and economic costs of domestic violence: Chile and Nicaragua. Too close to home: domestic violence in the Americas . Another study based in Santiago, conducted in 2000, estimated that women who did not suffer physical violence earned an average of US$385 per month while women who faced physical violence at home earned only US$150 per month. This study displays the severe economic effects of domestic violence in the home.  Impacts on Women  = Mental and Psychological Impacts = Domestic abuse harms women mentally and psychologically in Chile. Some impacts that domestic abuse has on a woman‚Äôs mental health in Chile includes Depression and PTSD. Depression is very common among Chilean women because it is linked to physical and sexual violence. Chilean women also experience PTSD because of abusive households and from significant others who are violent. Policy responses =Background= The Chilean legal system has traditionally been very weak on family violence, due to structural problems, resulting from the failure to label domestic violence as a crime and the failure to prosecute domestic violence under general assault statutes. A study conducted in 1990 in Chile showed that 83.3% of battered women‚Äôs injuries were classified as ‚Äòlight injuries‚Äô and were only punishable as a misdemeanor. Acts of violence that would otherwise be severe crimes under the law, when occurring within the home were passed as ‚Äòlight injuries‚Äô and minimal punishment was pursued. =Chilean National Ministry for Women (SERNAM)= The Chilean National Ministry for Women (SERNAM, Servicio Nacional de la Mujer) addresses the Chilean legal systems‚Äô treatment of domestic violence cases. SERNAM is responsible for developing preventative and remedial programs. They have opened offices across the country, providing legal and therapeutic assistance for victims of domestic violence. In 1997 SERNAM issued a detailed set of policy proposals to assure rural women equality of opportunity, a product of consultative process.Empowering Women: Land and Property Rights in Latin America. By Carmen Diana Deere and Magdalena Leon. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Michelle Bachelet was the first female president of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010. During her presidency, Bachelet increased the budget of the National Women's Service (SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women.Haas, Liesl (2010). Feminist Policymaking in Chile. University Park, Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press. At the end of 2006, there were 29 government and private centers to attend to victims of intrafamily violence. During 2006, the SERNAM partnered with NGOs to conduct courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities. This intensive training program by SERNAM has increasingly allowed many Chilean police to provide effective assistance in domestic violence cases. SERNAM has been active in advancing the domestic violence legislation (see below). =Domestic violence law of 1994= The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address violence in the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005. =Medical personnel= Another barrier is posed by the Chilean medical personnel, which has been criticized for continuing to mistreat victims of domestic violence and to minimize injuries, even though today they are required by law to report known cases of physical assault to the criminal justice system. =Child sex abuse law of 2019= In 2019, amid the ongoing sex crisis in Chile's Catholic Church, legislation was passed removing the statute of limitations on reporting sex abuse against children throughout Chile.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-abuse/chile-removes-statute-of- limitations-on-child-sex-abuse-amid-church-crisis- idUSKCN1U62NOhttps://www.ncronline.org/news/quick-reads/chile-removes-statute- limitations-sex-abuse-cases The legislation, which is not retroactive, was first proposed in 2010.

Lily, the only person who has seen the stalker, forces him to confront his \\"final four\\", none of whom is the stalker, although the woman from \\"Ted Mosby, Architect\\" started tedmosbyisajerk.com, under the impression that Barney's identity is Ted's. Lily is irked by his refusal to apologize to the women he's hurt, Barney reasoning that they were consenting adults, he showed them a good time, and remembered each and every one‚Äîeven going so far as to scrapbook each experience. Eventually, they concoct a plan where Robin would pretend to be a girl that Barney wants to hook up with, Lily would stay by the jukebox in MacLaren's, and the rest of the guys would just hang out at the booth. When Barney pretends to go to the bathroom, he notices a woman approaching Robin. Barney finally apologizes to the woman when he thinks that she is the avenger but he does not recall having slept with her. This turns out to be a friend of Robin's, but Lily nonetheless is proud of Barney for finally giving out a sincere apology. The woman isn't revealed, but Future Ted reassures that she will be revealed another time. At the end of the episode, Barney writes of the experience in his oft-mentioned blog in a scene similar to the computerized diary scenes of Doogie Howser, M.D., in which Neil Patrick Harris (Barney) stars. After glancing over at another conquest he snagged through deception, he concludes that the lesson to all this is, \\"I'm awesome.\\"  Production  The episode was originally named \\"The Final Four\\". Many blogs and reviews refer to it by that name. The tie-in website http://www.tedmosbyisajerk.com was initially bought to prevent it being exploited by cybersquatters, then a simple website was added. Associate producer Carl MacLaren had the idea to do a song for the website, which sprawled into a much longer 20-minute work. The song syncs up slightly with the episode a la the alleged The Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz sync, which can be seen on the season 3 DVD. The vocals were performed by Charlene Amoia (Wendy the Waitress).  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating. IGN gave the episode a rating of 7.6 out of 10. Omar G of Television Without Pity rated the episode A+. It was the only episode of the season rated A+, and described as \\"one of the best episodes of the show\\".

Cardington Artificial Slalom Course (CASC) was the first artificial whitewater canoe slalom course in the UK when it was completed in July 1982, having been first discussed in 1972. Based on the River Great Ouse adjacent to Cardington sluice, within the grounds of Priory Country Park and approximately 2.5 km downstream from Bedford, the course has a dual role as both a flood control structure and a whitewater course for canoe slalom training and events. The course cost ¬£273,000 and was funded by a consortium of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (now the Environment Agency), Anglian Water, the Sports Council (now UK Sport) and local councils and was seen as an excellent example of the relatively low cost adaptation of a necessary structure to provide a facility of national significance. The structure consists of an automatically controlled dropleaf control sluice, 9 metres wide, at the head of a concrete-lined channel which connects the upper reach of the river to the lower. The channel is 120 m long with a bed slope of 1:100. To create the required water flow pattern, fibreglass boulders known as \\"hippos\\" and \\"dollies\\" are secured to the base of the channel. The maximum head is 1.7 m with a maximum water capacity of 15 cubic metres per second. Originally seen primarily as a training venue, the course also holds two national ranking canoe slalom competitions per year at up to Division 2 level, and is the host every year to the Inter Clubs Final, which pits teams from all the top canoe slalom clubs against each other for an overall trophy. Running all weekend with camping overnight, the Inter Clubs is the largest canoe slalom event in the UK (by number of participants), a great social event for the sport and one of the highlights of the UK slalom calendar. The course celebrated its 25th anniversary in September 2007 with a visit by Frank Branston the Mayor of Bedford. The original project's vision of becoming 'a regional centre for canoeing' has come to fruition. Competition events at CASC are organised by Bedford's Viking Kayak Club which also organises national ranking events and finals in kayak marathon. Viking celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011.

Mehra and H. Rechenberg, The historical development of quantum theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, etc., 1982, Vol. 1, Part 2, pp. 532-554. It was advanced in 1924, and sticks to a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field. It was perhaps more a research program than a full physical theory, the ideas that are developed not being worked out in a quantitative way. One aspect, the idea of modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using \\"virtual oscillators\\" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, significantly led Born, Heisenberg and Kramers to explore mathematics that strongly inspired the subsequent development of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The provocativeness of the theory also generated great discussion and renewed attention to the difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory.Max Jammer, Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics, 2e, 1989, p.188 However, physically the most provocative element of the theory, that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction but only overall, statistically, was soon shown to be in conflict with experiment.  Origins  The initial idea of the BKS theory originated with Slater,Letters from J.C. Slater, November, December 1923, reprinted in Ref. 1, pp. 8, 9. who proposed to Bohr and Kramers the following elements of a theory of emission and absorption of radiation by atoms, to be developed during his stay in Copenhagen: # Emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by matter is realized in agreement with Einstein's photon concept; # A photon emitted by an atom is guided by a classical electromagnetic field (compare de Broglie's ideas published September 1923L. de Broglie, Comptes Rendues 177, 507-510 (1923).) consisting of spherical waves, thus enabling to explain interference; # Even when there are no transitions there exists a classical field to which all atoms contribute; this field contains all frequencies at which an atom can emit or absorb a photon, the probability of such an emission being determined by the amplitude of the corresponding Fourier component of the field; the probabilistic aspect is provisional, to be eliminated when the dynamics of the inside of atoms are better known; # The classical field is not produced by the actual motions of the electrons but by \`motions with the frequencies of possible emission and absorption lines' (to be called 'virtual oscillators', creating a field to be referred to as 'virtual' as well).  Development with Bohr and Kramers  Slater's main intention seems to have been to reconcile the two conflicting models of radiation, viz. the wave and particle models. He may have had good hopes that his idea with respect to oscillators vibrating at the differences of the frequencies of electron rotations (rather than at the rotation frequencies themselves) might be attractive to Bohr because it solved a problem of the latter's atomic model, even though the physical meaning of these oscillators was far from clear. Nevertheless, Bohr and Kramers had two objections to Slater's proposal: # The assumption that photons exist. Even though Einstein's photon hypothesis could explain in a simple way the photoelectric effect, as well as conservation of energy in processes of de- excitation of an atom followed by excitation of a neighboring one, Bohr had always been reluctant to accept the reality of photons, his main argument being the problem of reconciling the existence of photons with the phenomenon of interference; # The impossibility to account for conservation of energy in a process of de-excitation of an atom followed by excitation of a neighboring one. This impossibility followed from Slater's probabilistic assumption, which did not imply any correlation between processes going on in different atoms. As Max Jammer puts it, this refocussed the theory \\"to harmonize the physical picture of the continuous electromagnetic field with the physical picture, not as Slater had proposed of light quanta, but of the discontinuous quantum transitions in the atom.\\" Bohr and Kramers hoped to be able to evade the photon hypothesis on the basis of ongoing work by Kramers to describe \\"dispersion\\" (in present-day terms inelastic scattering) of light by means of a classical theory of interaction of radiation and matter. But abandoning the concept of the photon, they instead chose to squarely accept the possibility of non-conservation of energy, and momentum.  Experimental counter-evidence  In the BKS paper the Compton effect was discussed as an application of the idea of \\"statistical conservation of energy and momentum\\" in a continuous process of scattering of radiation by a sample of free electrons, where \\"each of the electrons contributes through the emission of coherent secondary wavelets\\". Although Compton had already given an attractive account of his experiment on the basis of the photon picture (including conservation of energy and momentum in individual scattering processes), is it stated in the BKS paper that \\"it seems at the present state of science hardly justifiable to reject a formal interpretation as that under consideration [i.e. the weaker assumption of statistical conservation] as inadequate\\". This statement may have prompted experimental physicists to improve \`the present state of science' by testing the hypothesis of \`statistical energy and momentum conservation'. In any case, already after one year the BKS theory was disproved by experiments studying correlations between the directions into which the emitted radiation and the recoil electron are emitted in individual scattering processes. Such experiments were independently performed by Bothe and Geiger, as well as by Compton and Simon. They provided experimental evidence pointing in the direction of energy and momentum conservation in individual scattering processes (at least, it was shown that the BKS theory was not able to explain the experimental results). More accurate experiments, performed much later, have also confirmed these results. As suggested by a letter to Born,Letter of April 29, 1924 in: The Born-Einstein Letters, Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916 to 1955 with commentaries by Max Born, Walker and Company, New York, 1971. for Einstein the corroboration of energy and momentum conservation was probably even more important than his photon hypothesis: \\"Bohr's opinion of radiation interests me very much. But I don't want to let myself be driven to a renunciation of strict causality before there has been a much stronger resistance against it than up to now. I cannot bear the thought that an electron exposed to a ray should by its own free decision choose the moment and the direction in which it wants to jump away. If so, I'd rather be a cobbler or even an employee in a gambling house than a physicist. It is true that my attempts to give the quanta palpable shape have failed again and again, but I'm not going to give up hope for a long time yet.\\" Bohr's reaction, too, was not primarily related to the photon hypothesis. According to Heisenberg,Interview with Mehra, quoted in Ref. 2, p. 554 Bohr remarked: \\"Even if Einstein sends me a cable that an irrevocable proof of the physical existence of light-quanta has now been found, the message cannot reach me, because it has to be transmitted by electromagnetic waves.\\" For Bohr the lesson to be learned from the disproof of the BKS theory was not that photons do exist, but rather that the applicability of classical space-time pictures in understanding phenomena within the quantum domain is limited. This theme would become particularly important a few years later in developing the notion of complementarity. According to Heisenberg, Born's statistical interpretation also had its ultimate roots in the BKS theory. Hence, despite its failure the BKS theory still provided an important contribution to the revolutionary transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.

Biography Born in Paris, Julie Manet was the daughter and only child of artist Berthe Morisot and Eug√®ne Manet, younger brother of painter √âdouard Manet. The death of both parents within a three- year period left her orphaned at the age of 16. As a result, she came under the guardianship of the poet and critic St√©phane Mallarm√© and went to live with her cousins. She also received support from the family's artist friends, Renoir in particular. Throughout her life Julie posed frequently for her mother and other Impressionist artists, including Renoir and her uncle √âdouard.

Notably, her candid accounts of dinner-table conversations about that Affair cast light on Renoir‚Äôs privately held views on patriotism and anti-Semitism. Personal life In May 1900 Julie married the painter and engraver , artist and son of the painter Henri Rouart. The wedding, which took place in Passy, was a double ceremony in which Julie's cousin Jeannine Gobillard married Paul Val√©ry. Julie had three children, Julien (born 1901), Cl√©ment (born 1906) and Denis (born 1908). Both Julien and Denis inherited some of Morisot's paintings, now in the Marmottan Monet Museum.

The law prohibits domestic violence, gives women the right to seek prompt protection, and allows victims to seek protection, occupation, or tenancy orders from a magistrate. Penalties for violation of protection orders include fines up to 54 (G$10,000) and 12 months' imprisonment; however, this legislation frequently is not enforced.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Guyana. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The government uses laws and policies against domestic violence with some measure of success; the problems lie with the failure of those responsible for implementation. Magistrates and magistrate court staff are often insensitive to the problem of domestic violence and to their roles in ensuring implementation of the law. In addition, not all police officers fully understand provisions of the law. NGOs report a widespread perception that some police officers and magistrates could be bribed to make cases of domestic violence \\"go away.\\" The government also does not prosecute cases in which the alleged victim or victim's family agreed to drop the case in exchange for a monetary payment out of court. NGOs assert the need for a specialized Family Court. Domestic violence is a problem in all regions of the country. Enforcement of the domestic violence laws is especially weak in the interior, where police do not have as strong a presence and courts meet only once a quarter. Between January and September 2006, Help and Shelter handled 414 abuse cases, including child, spousal, nonspousal, and other domestic abuse; 297 of the cases involved spousal abuse directed against women. Help and Shelter, which received private donor and some government funding, ran a free shelter for victims of domestic violence and operated a hotline to counsel victims. NGOs run public service announcements and train police officers, teachers, nurses, agricultural workers, religious groups, and health clinics to sensitize them to domestic violence. Domestic violence training is part of the curriculum of the Police Training College. There is a Task Force on Violence against Women whose membership includes representatives from NGOs, law enforcement, the health community, and youth.

It is the forty fourth book in the series and It was originally published in French in the year 1975 and in English by Cinebook in 2010 as A Cure for the Daltons.  Synopsis  Professor Otto Von Himbeergeist, a famed psychologist, announces that crime is a psychologically- based personal inefficiency which can be cured by therapy, and he chooses the Dalton Brothers as his test subjects. The doctor takes the Daltons to a farm to be in a better environment for treatment. Lucky Luke has to watch them. Nevertheless, the Daltons escapes with the professor who rallies to them. They then resort to a special method for their robberies: Otto psychoanalyses the director of the bank who gives them the money themselves. But the treatment really worked on Averell who does not want to commit crimes anymore. Using this feature against the Daltons, Luke manages to capture the entire gang and take them to jail.  Characters  * Otto von Himbergeist: Professor of psychology, probably Austrian. He is convinced that an event occurring in the childhood of each criminal is at the origin of the latter's shift towards crime and that he can be cured of his criminal instincts. His therapy usually comes down to listening to the patient tell the story of his early childhood. The doctor always asks people questions that lead them to talk about their past and be upset. He seems to be able to make anyone doubt: he can even disrupt Lucky Luke. Refusing to listen to Luke's recommendations, he tries to give the Daltons treatment but their lifestyle seems more attractive to him than his career as a doctor: he believes he sees his true vocation in crime and rallies to the Daltons. One of the characteristics of Otto is pride, he is proud of his brain and does not allow anyone to doubt his logic. * The Dalton: They agree to undergo the treatment of Professor Von Himbergeist for the sole purpose of being judged cured and released from prison. Averell will be the only one on whom the treatment will work. Lucky Luke uses this weakness to defeat the doctor and the Daltons.

It continues the quest of Lief, Barda, and Jasmine to find the seven missing gems of Deltora, braving dangers and Guardians in each book. The fourth gem has been found and the fifth is hidden in Dread Mountain. The trio travel to the mountains in search for the emerald. Plot summary The trio is journeying to Dread Mountain when they come across a spring. Although initially distrustful of its contents, they drink the water out of thirst, noting a nearby sign saying: \\"Drink, gentle stranger, and welcome. All of evil will beware.\\" and several oddly shaped rocks encircling the spring. They decided to take a rest there and Lief awakens to find one of the \\"rocks\\" unfurling. It reveals itself to be a mammalian flying creature called the Kin, which most Deltorans believe to be extinct. It explains to Lief that the water from the spring makes one dream of whomever one is thinking of during ingestion. It also has a deadly, paralyzing effect on \\"those with evil intent\\". The three head to Dread Mountain with the help of the Kin, landing there only to find the mountain thickly overgrown, deserted of its inhabitants, the Dread gnomes, and overrun by beasts. However, the companions find the entrance into the Mountain, and after avoiding the numerous traps the gnomes have set up to repel invaders, it was discovered that there is a monstrous toad named Gellick that was controlling the gnomes. The trio makes a bargain with the head of the gnomes to rid Gellick for them in return for freedom and the emerald that was studded onto Gellick the giant frog's head. The fight ends with Lief tossing water from the Dreaming Spring into Gellick's mouth, as it uses the deadly, paralyzing effect. The gnomes thank Lief by making peace with their longtime prey, the Kin, and agreeing to hamper the progress of their common enemy, the Shadow Lord in finding the trio. The companions then continue their journey to The Maze of the Beast. Characters *Lief: Lief is the main character of the series. Lief was born to parents King Endon and Queen Sharn though he believed them to be Jarred and Anna of the forge. As a child Lief roamed the streets of Del, sharpening his wits and gaining him the skills needed for his future quests. Though he did not know it, he was constantly protected by Barda and he prided himself on his many 'lucky' escapes. On his sixteenth birthday it is revealed to him that he must begin a dangerous quest to find the lost gems of the Belt of Deltora. *Barda: Barda was enlisted as a friend by the king and queen of Deltora and was trusted to help him find the lost gems of Deltora sixteen years before the initial story took place. For the next sixteen years Barda disguised himself as a beggar so as to discover information vital to the quest. He also became the bodyguard of Endon and Sharn's child Lief, albeit without the semi- arrogant Lief's knowledge thereof. Upon Lief's sixteenth birthday Barda revealed himself to Lief and the quest for the gems of Deltora began. Though Barda was at first annoyed to travel encumbered by a child, he soon saw Lief as more of a help than a hindrance. *Jasmine: Jasmine is a wild girl, described as having wild black hair (dark green hair in the anime) and emerald green eyes who has grown up in the Forests of Silence, where Lief and Barda meet her shortly after leaving Del. Her parents, Jarred and Anna, were captured by Grey Guards when she was seven years old, and so she has been raised by the forest. She can understand the language of the trees and of many animals, and has incredibly sharp senses, but has trouble understanding some social customs. Jasmine is usually seen with her blackbird, Kree, and a mouse- like creature she calls Filli. Jasmine is like Lief and occasionally has a quick temper.

It is the forty fifth book in the series and was originally published in French by Dargaud in the year 1976 and in English by Cinebook in 2010 as Emperor Smith. The story is loosely based on the life of the historical Emperor Norton of San Francisco.  Synopsis  In the small town of Grass Town, Lucky Luke meets Dean Smith, a wealthy rancher in the area who has lost his mind and imagines himself to be the Emperor of the United States. Thanks to his fortune, Smith was able to afford to hire a small army, equipped with cannons, and to put on a whole apparatus. Amused by this character who they consider harmless, the people of Grass Town play the game and pretend to take Smith seriously. Emperor Norton The situation escalates when Buck Ritchie, a notorious bandit of the region, gets to meet Smith, and convince him to use his army to occupy the city. Terrorized, the locals rank on the side of Smith, who sets out to reconquer all the United States, making Grass Town the new capital of the country. Judged for high treason, Sheriff Linen and Whitman, the editor of the newspaper, cowardly plead their case, and are pardoned by the Emperor Smith who gives them a title and a ministry to each. Convicted, Barney, the judge, is sentenced to death, commuted to life in prison, while Lucky Luke manages to escape, and plans to neutralize Smith, and free Grass Town. He does this by infiltrating a ball and kidnapping Smith. Gates, his second-in-command, and former cook, attempts to lead them, but with no-one to pay them, his soldiers quit. Luke arrests Gates. Richie duels Luke, cannon versus pistol, with Luke firing a bullet down the cannon, exploding it. Luke goes to Smith, locked in a small hut nearby, and advises him to cross the nearby Rio Grande into Mexico.  Characters  * Dean Smith: Rich rancher of the region who has gone mad, and imagines himself to be the Emperor of the United States; he now calls himself \\"Emperor Smith,\\" and speaks of himself in the plural. * Buck Ritchie: Notorious bandit, who manages to infiltrate Smith's army. * Colonel Gates: former cook of Smith, who became his right hand man. His important role also made him lose his head. * Judge Barney: Judge of the city, he is the only notable of the city, helped by Lucky Luke, to oppose Smith when the situation degenerates. * Sheriff Linen: Sheriff of the city, he does not concern himself with Smith, who he considers harmless and fun before he takes over. Cowardice leads him to join him. * Rudolph Whitman: Director of the Grass Town Guardian, the city's newspaper, which publishes Smith's proclamations and decrees. He considers the latter as a picturesque figure before joining.

In the Global Gender Gap Report prepared by the World Economic Forum in 2009, Argentine women ranked 24th among 134 countries studied in terms of their access to resources and opportunities relative to men. They enjoy comparable levels of education, and somewhat higher school enrollment ratios than their male counterparts. They are well integrated in the nation's cultural and intellectual life, though less so in the nation's economy. Their economic clout in relation to men is higher than in most Latin American countries, however, and numerous Argentine women hold top posts in the Argentine corporate world; among the best known are Cris Morena, owner of the television production company by the same name, Mar√≠a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, former CEO and majority stakeholder of Loma Negra, the nation's largest cement manufacturer, and Ernestina Herrera de Noble, director of Grupo Clar√≠n, the premier media group in Argentina. Argentine women, however, continue to face numerous systemic challenges common to those in other nations. Domestic violence in Argentina is a serious problem, as are obstacles to the timely prosecution of rape, the prevalence of sexual harassment, and a persistent gender pay gap, among other iniquities. Historical context =Nineteenth Century= Juana Azurduy de Padilla, led independence fighters in the Rio de la Plata region In the early nineteenth century, the Spanish crown ruled the region now encompassed by the modern countries of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, via the viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata, with the capital in Buenos Aires. With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, areas of the viceroyalty rose in revolt. Abduction of a white Argentine woman, Do√±a Trinidad Salcedo by Araucanians painted by Johann Moritz Rugendas One of the participants in the wars for independence was Juana Azurduy, who is honored now by both Bolivia and Argentina as contributing to independence.:es:Juana Azurduy In 2009, Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner promoted Azurduy to the rank of general in the Argentine army from lieutenant colonel. The Argentine army named an infantry regiment based in the northern region of Salta as \\"Generala Juana Azurduy.\\" In June 2014, President Fern√°ndez de Kirchner unveiled the new Argentine 10-peso note with the image of Azurduy. Argentina in the early nineteenth century had few cities, but the port of Buenos Aires grew from a backwater of the Spanish empire into a major port in the late eighteenth century. Rural areas in Argentina were sparsely populated by the indigenous Mapuche and gauchos, mixed race men on horseback who hunted free-range cattle for their hides and to make dried beef. Non-indigenous women on the vast Argentine pampas were few, and depicted in art as vulnerable to abduction by \\"barbarian\\" Indians. =Twentieth Century= Eva Per√≥n, 1947 The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo with President N√©stor Kirchner During the 1930s, Fanny Edelman, a Communist leader who was part of the International Brigades in defense of the Second Spanish Republic, became an international figure representing Communism and Feminism. She participated to the creation of the Women's Union of Argentina in 1937, and in 1972 she became head of the Women's International Democratic Federation. She was honorary president of the Communist party of Argentina until her death in 2011. Following President Juan Per√≥n's enactment of women's suffrage in 1949, First Lady Evita Per√≥n led the Peronist Women's Party until her death in 1952, and helped enhance the role of women in Argentine society. Women played a significant role as both supporters and opponents of the National Reorganization Process, Argentina's last dictatorship, in the late 1970s, and the establishment of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, an advocacy group led by mothers of the disappeared, was done by Azucena Villaflor de Vicenti and, mostly, other women, on the rationale that they would be less likely to be the targets of repression (Villaflor de Vicenti and her fellow founders were murdered by the regime in 1977).Fleitlowitz, Marguerite. A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture. Oxford University Press, 2002. Women's rights in Argentina progressed in significant ways following the return of democracy in 1983. President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n signed laws in 1987 both limiting Patria potestas (the latitude given to a father regarding his treatment of fellow household members, particularly children) and legalizing divorce, helping resolve the legal status of 3 million adults living in legal separation. The Argentine quota law signed by President Carlos Menem in 1991 provides that one-third of the members of both houses of congress must be women, a goal achieved through balanced election slates.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Argentina. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. As of 2006, there were 29 women in the 72-seat Senate, 86 women in the 257-seat Argentine Chamber of Deputies, two female Supreme Court justices, and three women in the presidential cabinet. The President of Argentina, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was elected in 2007; the runner-up in the crowded field was also a woman, Elisa Carri√≥. Family life With regard to the organization of family life, Argentina has a history of social conservatism, and the influence of Catholicism in Argentina has been very strong throughout the 20th century. In Argentina, divorce was legalized only in 1987, and the legalization was the result of a struggle between different governments and conservative groups, mostly connected to the Catholic Church, that lasted a whole century. In 1987, President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n was successful in passing the divorce law, following a ruling of the Supreme Court. The new law also provided for gender equality between the wife and husband.Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies, by Mala Htun, pp 102 By 1987, when divorce was legalized, only three other Latin American countries prohibited divorce (Paraguay and Colombia, which legalized it 1991, and Chile which legalized it in 2004). Adultery was decriminalized in 1995. Also, a new Civil and Commercial Code, modernizing family law, came into force in August 2015. Domestic violence Mass protest against violence against women in Buenos Aires in 2015 Violence against women is a serious problem in Argentina. Amnesty International reported in February 2012 that a woman died every two days as a result of domestic violence in Argentina. The civil society organization La Casa del Encuentro reported that between January and September 2013, 209 women died as a result of domestic or gender-based violence. In 2009, Argentina enacted Ley de protecci√≥n integral para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia contra las mujeres en los √°mbitos en que desarrollen sus relacion es interpersonales [Ley 26.485] (The Comprehensive Law on the Prevention, Punishment and Elimination of Violence against Women in their Interpersonal Relations [Law 26.485]). In November 2012, the Congress passed an anti femicide law imposing stricter penalties on perpetrators who kill their spouses, partners, or children as a consequence of gender based violence. According to the Human Rights Watch‚Äôs 2018 world report, 254 femicides were reported, but only 22 convictions were done in 2016. Human trafficking While individual prostitution is legal in Argentina, the promotion, facilitation, or forcing of people into prostitution is illegal. Argentina is a source, transit, and destination country for sex trafficking of women. Sex trafficking victims often come from Paraguay and the Dominican Republic. Rape and sexual harassment Sexual harassment in the public sector is prohibited and is subject to disciplinary or corrective measures. In some jurisdictions, such as Buenos Aires City, sexual harassment may lead to the abuser‚Äôs dismissal, but in others, such as in Santa Fe Province, the maximum penalty is five days in prison. The law prohibits rape, including spousal rape; but the need for proof, either in the form of clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, has often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. Women‚Äôs rights advocates have accused the police, hospitals, and courts of hostile attitudes against victims of sexual violence. The 2009 law on violence against women (Law 26.485) has comprehensive provisions against sexual violence, including sexual violence within marriage (in particular Article 5(3)ARTICULO 5¬∫ Tipos (...) 3.- Sexual: Cualquier acci√≥n que implique la vulneraci√≥n en todas sus formas, con o sin acceso genital, del derecho de la mujer de decidir voluntariamente acerca de su vida sexual o reproductiva a trav√©s de amenazas, coerci√≥n, uso de la fuerza o intimidaci√≥n, incluyendo la violaci√≥n dentro del matrimonio o de otras relaciones vinculares o de parentesco, exista o no convivencia, as√≠ como la prostituci√≥n forzada, explotaci√≥n, esclavitud, acoso, abuso sexual y trata de mujeres.). Before a change in law in 1999, sexual offenses were classified as \\"Offences against honesty\\", and the concept of \\"honest woman\\" appeared in certain sexual crimes. Act No. 25,087 of 1999 (Ley N¬∞ 25.087) reformed the legislation, and changed its name to \\"Offences against sexual integrity\\". Economic gender gap Women workers at a sportshoes factory in Las Flores, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina Although since the 1869 enactment of the Argentine Civil Code, all citizens are considered equal, and the Constitution of Argentina also states at Section 16 that \\"The Argentine Nation admits neither blood nor birth prerogatives: there are neither personal privileges nor titles of nobility. All its inhabitants are equal before the law, and admissible to employment without any other requirement than their ability. Equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens\\", women often encounter economic discrimination and hold a disproportionately higher number of lower-paying jobs. Approximately 70 percent of women employed outside the home work in unskilled jobs, although more women than men hold university degrees. According to a 2007 study by the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), men earned 5 percent more than women for equivalent full-time work in the Greater Buenos Aires area, and earned 21 percent more than women for equivalent part- time work, an imbalance explicitly prohibited by law: prison terms of up to three years can be issued for discrimination based on gender. Restrictions on abortion Clara Oyuela, (1907-2001) Argentine opera singer Gabriela Sabatini, Argentine former professional tennis player Abortion in Argentina remains prohibited, and is legal only in cases of rape, or where the life of the mother is in danger. The Argentine Penal Code 846, moreover, was amended in 2008 to place stricter sanctions against women who seek an abortion, as well as any medical staff involved in the act. These limitations notwithstanding, an estimated 500,000 abortions are performed annually in Argentina (compared to around 700,000 live births), resulting in at least 10,000 hospitalizations due to complications (estimates vary widely) and around 100 deaths (a third of all maternal mortality). Contraception and reproductive rights Traditionally, access to contraceptives has long been discouraged by a succession of Argentine governments, which instead rewarded large families with subsidies rising disproportionately with the seventh child. Although Argentine women have long had among Latin America's lowest birth rates (averaging 2.3 births per woman in recent years), the policy has tended to encourage higher birth rates in the lowest strata of society (including women least able to afford large families). Contraceptives are widely used by sexually active Argentine women, as condoms are by Argentine men, and a variety of birth control products can be obtained freely in pharmacies; the Argentine government began their free distribution in 2003. In general, couples and individuals have the right to decide freely the number, spacing, and timing of children, and have access to information and reproductive health services. The law requires the government to provide free contraceptives. Women in politics Traditionally, politics was seen a male domain. The legal and social roles of women in Argentina were mostly dictated by the Spanish Law (which itself was based on Roman law) and by the Catholic Church. As such, women were subordinated first to their fathers and then to their husbands. Today, however, women have a notable presence in Argentinian politics, and they make up more than a third of the parliament. Argentina had two female presidents: Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Advocacy and international law The National Council of Women carries out programs to promote equal social, political, and economic opportunities for women. The council worked with the special representative for international women's issues, the Ministry of Labor, and union and business organizations to form the Tripartite Committee on Equal Opportunity for Men and Women in the Workplace, which seeks to foster equal treatment and opportunities for men and women in the job market.Report on Human Rights Practices 2008: Argentina. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1985, Argentina ratified the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). In 1994, the National Constituent Convention incorporated the ratification of the CEDAW into the text of the new constitution. During the 1990s, some laws began to tackle domestic violence, by empowering police agencies and provincial judicial authorities to establish preventive measures. Although the Government of Argentina ratified the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women in 1996 (enacted in the 1994 Convention of Belem do Par√°), not all Argentine provinces have promulgated regulations for its application. Despite the creation in 1985 of the Women's Department under the auspices of the Office of the President, provincial delegations or Women's Sections still have not been established throughout the entire nation.Ocampo, Irene.

It acts as a single issue political party demanding the merger of Belgaum district in Karnataka with the state of Maharashtra. History After India became independent in 1947, the Belgaum district (which was in the erstwhile Bombay Presidency) became a part of the Bombay State. In 1948, the Belgaum City Council passed a resolution declaring that the district was a Marathi majority district and demanding for the inclusion of the Belgaum district in the proposed state of Samyukta Maharashtra. The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti was formed in the same year pursuing the single point demand for the inclusion of the district in the state of Maharashtra. The States Reorganisation Commission recommended the inclusion of the Belgaum district to the state of Mysore. The district was subsequently merged into the Mysore State (currently Karnataka) when the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 was passed by the Parliament of India. The Economic Times describes the MES to have held a significant influence in the district since.  Electoral history  The committee has consistently supported candidates for the to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly; primarily from constituencies in the district of Belgaum. The committee members have also contested elections to the Belgaum City Corporation where it has held a dominant position from time to time. It was a registered party in the 1962 Mysore Legislative Assembly election. MES contests elections only in a few seats in Belagavi area and does not get enough votes to be recognized as an official party. So its candidates often contest elections as 'Independent'. * 1957 Mysore State : Balkrishna Sunthankar won from Belgaum City Vidhan Sabha seat. Balwant Naik won from Nippani. Balwantrao and Shyam Sundar, two MLAs from Bhalki, were either MES activists or at least supported by MES. Nagendra Samaji and Vitthal Patil, PWP's MLAs from Belgaum, were supported by MES.

Kay teaches inductive Bible study, and has authored many inductive Bible study workbooks. The Inductive method of studying the Bible, is a set of steps to follow to \\"mine\\" the details of the given book under study. It is accessible to lay persons and has been used by millions around the world being taught and utilized in small to medium-sized home, church, and market place study groups.  Early years  Kay Lee Arthur was born on November 11, 1933, in Jackson, Michigan. She grew up in a home that honored God. Her family moved frequently, and in each new community they looked for a church home first, and then looked for a house to live in. She graduated from nursing school in 1955 at age 21 and married her first husband, Frank Thomas Goetz, Jr.. They divorced in 1961 and although after becoming a Christian several years later she determined to reconcile, he committed suicide before they could reconcile. Kay explained in 2008, \\"Sin will take you farther than you ever intended to go, it will cost you more than you ever expected to pay, and it will keep you longer than you ever intended to stay. Unfortunately, over the next few years, I sought comfort with several other men including a two-year relationship with a married man.\\" One day she went down on her knees, a harlot, and she got up a saint. Afterwards, she continued nursing and moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee to attend Tennessee Temple University, where she earned a diploma. There, she met Jack Arthur (born March 14, 1926,), who had graduated from Tennessee Temple with a Th.G. in 1956. Jack served with The Pocket Testament League for 10 years, taking him to 70 countries in Africa and Latin America. The couple were married on December 16, 1965 and served as missionaries in Mexico but medical problems forced them to leave the mission field. Kay and Jack returned to Chattanooga, Tennessee, confident that the Lord had further plans for them. Jack became the station manager of a local Christian radio station, and Kay taught the Bible to teens in their living room. The number of teens attending Kay's bible study group steadily grew, and a 32-acre farm was purchased to accommodate the expanding ministry, which was named Reach Out Ranch. The radio station was sold in 1972, and Jack became full-time administrator for Reach Out Ranch. The ministry's name was eventually changed to Precept Ministries International (PMI), in order to more clearly communicate the organization's focus of establishing people in God's Word. Arthur's husband of 51 years, Jack, who battled cancer, died from Alzheimer's disease in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on January 9, 2017, at age 90.  Precept Ministries International  Since co-founding Precept Ministries International, Kay has written more than 100 books[3] and Bible studies, with over 11 million in print. Her inductive Bible studies are available in over 180 countries in approximately 70 languages. Precept Inductive Bible Study groups meet throughout the USA. Kay is a conference speaker who speaks extensively, both nationally and internationally, teaching the Word of God and the Inductive Bible Study Method. She was awarded the NRB Hall of Fame Award at the 2011 National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) Convention & Exposition. \\"The paramount concern Kay Arthur has is for the sheep to follow the Good Shepherd,\\" said NRB President and CEO, Dr. Frank Wright. \\"Kay and Jack have dedicated four decades to equip Christians with the tools necessary to mine the Scriptures on their own.\\"  Precepts for Life  Kay hosts a daily radio, television and online (www.PreceptsForLife.com) Bible Study Teaching program called Precepts for Life, which walks listeners through the Bible, book-by-book and verse-by-verse, using the Inductive Bible Study Method. Precepts for Life has an audience reach of over 75 million households and broadcasts to over 30 countries.Random House, Inc., author spotlight Precepts for Life was voted Best Television Teaching Program for 2004 and 2009 by the National Religious Broadcasters.  Recent updates  Kay was awarded the NRB Hall of Fame Award at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) Convention and Exposition in 2011.[5] Kay Arthur, Lois Crawford, and Aimee Semple McPherson are the only female recipients of this prestigious award, which has also been awarded to Billy Graham, Chuck Colson, William Bright, James Dobson, and Larry Burkett. In 2007 and 2008, Kay Arthur, along with Beth Moore and Priscilla Shirer, spoke for Deeper Still: The Event, a LifeWay weekend conference featuring the three women. Kay received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Tennessee Temple University in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2007. Kay is active in social media outreach and has currently more than 100,000 Facebook fans and builds community on Twitter.  Ecumenical relations  In November 2009, Arthur signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience  Selected works  * Lord, Teach Me to Pray, video teaching series * A Marriage Without Regrets, Gold Medallion Book Award Winner, * The New Inductive Study Bible, Gold Medallion Book Award Winner, * His Imprint My Expression, Gold Medallion Book Award Winner, * Lord, I Need Grace to Make It Today, Gold Medallion Book Award Winner, * How To Study Your Bible,  References   External links  * Kay Arthur's Facebook page * Kay Arthur's Twitter * Precept Ministries International * Precepts for Life Video Broadcast * Transform Student Ministries Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Protestants Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st- century Protestants Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American Christian writers Category:American evangelicals Category:American television evangelists Category:Christians from Tennessee Category:Nondenominational Christianity Category:People from Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:People from Jackson, Michigan Category:Tennessee Republicans Category:Writers from Tennessee Category:American women non- fiction writers ","title":"Kay Arthur"},{"id":"16711709","text":"Buried by the Times is a 2005 book by Laurel Leff. The book is a critical account of The New York Timess coverage of Nazi atrocities against Jews that culminated in the Holocaust. It argues that the news was often buried in the back pages in part due to the view about Judaism of the paper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. It also gives a critical look at the work of Times correspondents in Europe. Argument =Placement of news articles= The placement of news articles in a newspaper is a good indication of the importance given by the newspaper to a story. The Times consistently placed major stories about the Nazi treatment of European Jews on back pages \\"by the soap and shoe polish ads.\\" Leff found that during the period September 1939 to May 1945 very few stories about Jewish victims made the Times front page. \\"The story of the Holocaust‚Äîmeaning articles that focused on the discrimination, deportation, and destruction of the Jews‚Äîmade the Times front page just 26 times, and only in six of those stories were Jews identified on the front as the primary victims.\\" =Terminology= Leff points out that the Times often used a more generic term such as refugee or nationality to refer to Nazi victims who were Jewish. In his review, Gal Beckerman writes, \\"More shocking even than the chronic burying of articles with the word Jew in them is how often that word was rubbed out of articles that specifically dealt with the Jewish condition. It's almost surreal at times. How could you possibly tell the story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising without mentioning Jews? But The Times did, describing how 500,000 persons ‚Ä¶ were herded into less than 7 percent of Warsaw‚Äôs buildings, and how 400,000 persons were deported to their deaths at Treblinka. As Leff put it, The Times, when it ran front-page stories, described refugees seeking shelter, Frenchmen facing confiscation, or civilians dying in German camps, without making clear the refugees, Frenchmen, and civilians were mostly Jews.\\" =Role of religion= Sulzberger was a convinced Reformed Jew which was the basis of his assimilationist approach: Judaism for him was only a religion and that Jews were neither a race nor a people any more than Presbyterians or Methodists were a race. In December 1942 in a memo to New York Times staff he wrote \\"I have been trying to instruct the people around here on the subject of the word 'Jews', i.e., that they are neither a race nor a people, etc.,\\" Former New York Times journalist Ari Goldman, in his review of the book, writes: \\"There can be little doubt that Sulzberger's views about Judaism trickled down to the editors making the decisions about what to put in the newspaper every day.\\" =Staff biases= Leff examines the stances and performances of the Timess reporting and editorial staff. In the field, \\"She exposes the disturbing Nazi and Vichy attachments of a few European correspondents.\\" While back in New York, Sulzberger's bias was shared by other Jewish staffers: \\"Between them and influential Catholics among the crucial night editors, who decided where to place news items, the imperiled Jews of Europe had no advocate in the newsroom.\\" Conclusion Blame for the lack of coverage: Beside the biases and lack of competence of the European correspondents, Leff \\"points out the problems with journalistic convention of the time, which preferred reprinting government pronouncements to digging for unknown stories. There was also, of course, a disorganized Jewish community and a Roosevelt administration too preoccupied with the war, both not pushing hard enough for front-page coverage. But the bulk of the blame, in Leff‚Äôs telling, falls squarely at the feet of The Timess publisher, Sulzberger.\\" A number of observers have observed how badly informed the American public was about the Nazis' systematic murder of European Jews. Leff points out that the way The Times covered the Holocaust \\"contributed to the public's ignorance.\\" But in addition to poorly informing the public, \\"The Times coverage mattered so much,\\" she writes, \\"because other bystanders, particularly the American government, American Jewish groups, and the rest of the American press, took cues from the paper. Among major American newspapers, it was unique in the information it received, how it disseminated the news, and to whom.\\" Reception Most of the reviews were very positive. English historian, David Cesarani reviewing the book in the Jewish Chronicle wrote: \\"The light which Laurel Leff sheds on US government policy adds to the value of her densely documented and judiciously written study. It is a model of research with serious implications for how the press covers atrocity and genocide in our own times.\\" Another Holocaust historian, Tim Cole, writing in the Journal of Jewish Studies points out a wider benefit from the study: \\"Laurel Leff's study of the reporting of the Holocaust in the pages of The New York Times does more than simply fill a gap by offering an in-depth study of America's most significant daily ‚Ä¶ her book stands as a model for future studies in this sub-field of Holocaust Studies ‚Ä¶ [and] makes the book of interest not only to those wanting to know what The New York Times reported on the Holocaust. Leff's study offers a broader insight into American Jews in the wartime years, and in particular the relationship between one American Jew and his Jewishness.'\\"Journal of Jewish Studies, 2006 Volume: 57 Issue: 2 pp.339‚Äì340) Cole. Columbia University journalism professor (and former New York Times reporter) Ari Goldman commented: \\"...Laurel Leff, in her excellent book, Buried by The Times, builds a strong and convincing case that The Times was deliberately downplaying a major story because it didn‚Äôt want to appear to be championing a Jewish cause. Like her observation about the use of wire stories, much of Leff ‚Äôs speculation cannot be verified. But there is much evidence to suggest that the editors were motivated by more than just the news. Leff documents this in great detail both in terms of what The Times published and in terms of the opinions of its publisher at the time, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.\\" Throughout the book Leff's outrage concerning the behavior of The Times is apparent. Beckerman comments favorably on it: \\"Beneath every word of Laurel Leff‚Äôs extraordinary and thorough new study of The New York Timess coverage of what we now call the Holocaust is this same desire‚Äîfor the paper to be shocked and outraged beyond its very black-and-white bounds.\\" However, Pete Novick of The Washington Post criticized her approach. \\"The tone of Leff's account is one of unremitting outrage. When The Times fails to report any Holocaust-related event, she is outraged. If the paper reports on it, she's outraged that the report isn't on the front page. When a Holocaust story is on the front page, she complains that it isn't high enough on the front page. When there is no editorial on some Holocaust-related subject, she is outraged, and if there is an editorial, she's outraged that it isn't the lead editorial. She is regularly outraged when either reportage or commentary, wherever placed, mentions not Jews alone but other victims as well. When one item made clear that a majority of those killed at a certain locale were Jews, she complains that this was noted 'only once' in the story. All of this is so over-the-top as to verge on self-parody.\\" Finally, former NYT executive editor and Pulitizer Prize winning journalist, Max Frankel used Leff's preliminary research as a reference for his article criticizing the Timess reporting of the Holocaust in its 150th anniversary in 2001. He wrote: \\"As Laurel Leff, an assistant professor at the Northeastern School of Journalism, has concluded, it was a tragic demonstration of how the facts didn't speak for themselves. She has been the most diligent independent student of The Timess Holocaust coverage and deftly summarized her findings last year in The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics. You could have read the front page of The New York Times in 1939 and 1940\\", she wrote, \\"without knowing that millions of Jews were being sent to Poland, imprisoned in ghettos, and dying of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. You could have read the front page in 1941 without knowing that the Nazis were machine-gunning hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Soviet Union.\\" Frankel called it \\"the century's bitterest journalistic failure\\".Frankel =Honors and awards= * Best media history book, American Journalism Historians Association * Best history book, Foreword Magazine Related work Leff's ongoing work on American responses to the Holocaust continues to draw commentary. Her research paper \\"Rebuffing Refugee Journalists: The Profession's Failure to Help Jews Persecuted by Nazi Germany\\" asserting that journalists, unlike physicians and attorneys, failed to establish committees to help Jewish refugees secure positions that would have made them exempt from immigration limits and allowed them to come to the United States, inspired a campaign to get the Newspaper Association of America to acknowledge its predecessor organization in the 1930s \\"was wrong to turn its back on Jewish refugee journalists fleeing Hitler\\". The Newspaper Association of America responded by issuing a statement regretting that its predecessor organization did not give a full public airing to the issue at the time and by holding a special session on the topic at its annual meeting.

Maple, with a foreword by E. O. Wilson. Its title is derived from a 10-point \\"contract\\" the authors put forward in the book. Synopsis A Contract with the Earth is, broadly, a manifesto that challenges those on the right to provide a strategy for repairing the planet and calls on government to embrace the concept that a healthy environment is required for a healthy democracy and economy. This approach, alternately branded mainstream and entrepreneurial environmentalism by the authors, requires that companies should lead the way in environmental issues while governments provide them with incentives to reduce their carbon footprint. With its 10 \\"commandments\\", A Contract with the Earth calls for politicians to abandon adversarial politics and for business and conservationists to form compatible partnerships. In one of the book's themes, Gingrich and Maple argue that environmental efforts shouldn't be exclusive to one political philosophy and reject the idea that free enterprise and a cleaner world are opposing forces. The book generated a storm of media attention in late 2007 and early 2008 as the U.S. presidential campaign began to heat up. Gingrich in particular made numerous media appearances arguing that the Republican Party was losing popular support because their response to environmental policy was simply, as he put it, \\"NO!\\" Maple toured the country as Gingrich's stand-in, most notably before the Republicans for Environmental Protection (REP, www.repamerica.org) during their annual meeting (at which John McCain was endorsed as the most \\"green\\" of the Republican presidential candidates). In 2008 Gingrich published another book that advocated oil drilling, Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less, and many pundits called his environmental commitment into question. However, this book's fifth chapter provided an argument for environmental protection. Like many aspects of Gingrich's career, his interest in environmental issues has generated controversy. The book, whose title is similar to Gingrich's co-authored book Contract with America, criticizes the Democratic Party's legislation and litigation on environmental protection issues. Authors Gingrich has been described by Katharine Mieszkowski as a \\"green conservative.\\" He is the former Speaker of House of Representatives, and Maple is president and CEO of the Palm Beach Zoo and professor of conservation and behavior at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Their camp was situated in the Naliboki forest, which was part of Poland between World War I and World War II, and which is now in western Belarus. Biography Bielski grew up in the only Polish Jewish family in Stankiewicze. The small village in Eastern Poland (now Western Belarus) is located between towns of Lida and Navahrudak, both of which housed Jewish ghettos during World War II. Tuvia was the son of David and Beila Bielski, who had 12 children: 10 boys and two girls. Tuvia was the third eldest. His brothers Asael, Alexander (\\"Zus\\") and Aron were later to become members of his partisan group. During the First World War, Bielski served as an interpreter for the Imperial German Army, which were occupying the western territories of the Russian Empire. Already a speaker of Yiddish, he learned to speak the German language from these men and remembered it all his life. In 1927, he was recruited into the Polish Army, where he eventually became a corporal in the 30th Infantry Battalion. After completing his military service, Bielski returned home. In an effort to add to his family's income, he rented another mill. This income was still inadequate, so in 1929, at the age of 23, he married an older woman named Rifka who owned a general store and a large house. The couple lived in the nearby small town of Subotniki. During the Soviet occupation in 1939, Bielski feared that he would be arrested by the NKVD due to his \\"bourgeois capitalist\\" occupation, so he moved to Lida. Before Tuvia left Subotniki he urged his wife, Rifka, to join him in the move to Lida. She refused. In Soviet-controlled Lida, Bielski met and fell in love with another woman named Sonia Warshavsky. The love affair became serious. In late 1939, Bielski divorced his wife, Rifka and married Sonia, though they were not yet \\"officially\\" married due to wartime conditions. Sonia was killed while taking shelter with others in a peasant home. Not long after, Tuvia married Lila \\"Lilka\\" Tiktin, who was only 17 at the time. They knew each other before the war and stayed married until his death 44 years later.Defiance: the Bielski partisans. Nechama Tec. Oxford University Press. 1993 World War II When Operation Barbarossa broke out, Tuvia, Zus, and Asael were called up by their army units to fight against the Nazi German occupiers. Tuvia recalls: \\"Suddenly about fifty planes (Luftwaffe) flew over the town dropping incendiary bombs. In a very few minutes the entire place was on fire. The commander called us in, ordered us to leave the burning town and regroup in a forest about five kilometers from there. We were to continue working. We carried out his command but soon after we began our job in the forest another wave of planes flew over the area and set the woods on fire. The commander called us in and said: 'Friends, you are on your own!'\\" After the units disbanded, the Bielski brothers fled to Stankiewicze, where their parents lived. In early July 1941, a German army unit arrived in Stankiewicze and Jewish residents were moved to a ghetto in Nowogr√≥dek. The four Bielski brothers managed to flee to the nearby forest. Their parents, two of their brothers and other family members, including Rifka and Zus' wife and child, were killed in the ghetto on December 8, 1941. Tuvia Bielski led a group of Jewish partisans who hid in the forest. Although always hunted by Nazis, Bielski's group continued to grow. They periodically raided the ghettos to help people escape. They lived in the forests for over two years, and in their camp, they built a school, a hospital, and a nursery. As leader of the Bielski partisans, his aim was to save the lives of Jews, where he could make a large impact, rather than getting involved with skirmishes with Nazis, where their effect would be negligible. Thus, they did not explicitly seek to attack railroads and roads that the German Nazis were using as supply routes, but did sometimes carry out such attacks in order to save Jews at risk of being killed by Nazis in the Holocaust. The Bielski partisans ultimately saved the lives of more than 1,200 Jews.Tec, Nechmana (1993)Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, New York: Oxford University Press, quoted in Snyder, Timothy (2010) Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, London: Vintage Books. . In 1944, Asael Bielski was conscripted into the Soviet Army and killed in battle in Germany. Later life After the war, Tuvia, Zus and their wives went to Israel via Romania, and ultimately immigrated to the United States in 1956. They joined their older brother Walter in New York, where he had gone before the war. Tuvia and Zus ran a small trucking firm in New York City for 30 years. He married Lilka, another Jewish escapee; they remained married for the remainder of their lives. They had three children: sons Michael and Robert, and daughter Ruth, and ten grandchildren. Granddaughter Sharon Rennert made a documentary about her family called In Our Hands: The Legacy of the Bielski Partisans.Children of the Otriad, (c) 2008 Paramount Pictures Corporation, included with special features on the 2008 DVD Defiance When Tuvia died in 1987, he was nearly penniless. He was initially buried on Long Island; one year after his death, his remains were exhumed and taken to Jerusalem, where he was given a state funeral with full military honors in 1988. The exact grave is at Har Tamir - a part of Har HaMenuchot. The following location is in Hebrew using Latin letters: Gush taf-bet, Chelka daled, Shura 19, kever 11 (block 402, section 4, row 19, grave 11). Legacy Daniel Craig portrayed Tuvia in the film Defiance (2008), which has been criticised in Poland due to its omission of the alleged involvement of the Bielski group in a massacre of Polish civilians conducted by Soviet-aligned partisans in Naliboki.

It is the forty sixth book in the series and was originally published in French in 1977 by Dargaud and in English by Cinebook in 2012. The story is based on the historical feat of constructing the First Transcontinental Telegraph line connecting the West Coast of the United States and the East Coast of the United States in 1861. The title in English is The Singing Wire, referring both to \\"singing\\" of wires (caused by vortex shedding), and the transmission of communication (later voice) across electric cables.  Synopsis  One hundred thousand dollars will be offered to the city which will build the telegraph line to Salt Lake City the quickest. Carson City in the west and Omaha in the east are up to the challenge. But the sabotage of the opposing team and the attacks of Indians will somewhat slow down the pioneers of the singing wire, of which Lucky Luke is a part, having resigned from the Pony Express to join the team.  Characters  * James Gamble: Optimistic engineer responsible for carrying out the telegraph between Carson City in Salt Lake City * Edward Creighton: Friend and rival of Gamble, head of the Omaha team * Bradwell: Dishonest leader of the Omaha team who intends to pocket the promised bonus for the one who arrives first in Salt Lake City * Pots: Cook from the Gamble team, accused of being a traitor * Sparrowhawk: Indian hired by Gamble to persuade the Indian tribes allow the telegraph on their land  History  * Buffalo Bill appears in a panel at the start of the story. * The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln appeared at the beginning of the album. * The president of the Western Union, Hiram Sibley, appears at the beginning of the album. * James Gamble and Edward Creighton were the two engineers responsible for the ultimate telegraph junction. * Washakie, chief of the Shoshone tribe, was real. He initially opposed the installation of the telegraph before being favorable to it. * Brigham Young appears at the end of the comic book album. * The president of the court of California, Stephen J.

Czortek was a 1939 silver medalist of Amateur Championships of Europe, multiple champion of Poland and participant of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. He is also remembered due to his heroic struggle for life in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Early years Czortek was born on July 2, 1915, in GrudziƒÖdz (German: Graudenz), then part of the German Empire. He started his career in the local club GKS GrudziƒÖdz, but soon afterwards, his talent was noticed in Warsaw. He moved to the capital of Poland and represented the team of Skoda Warszawa (team's name was in 1936 changed into Okƒôcie Warszawa). Finally, after World War II, he settled in Radom, where he fought for Radomiak Radom, and then become a successful coach. His name was known to all boxing fans in Poland in the 1930s and late 1940s, as he participated in 23 official international boxing matches, out of which he won eighteen fights, lost four and tied one. In 1936 he took part in the Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, in the bantamweight class. In the first round he beat French boxer Pierre Bonnet, but in the second round he lost to South African fighter Alec Hannan. Czortek was much more successful during the 1937 European Amateur Boxing Championships. That year, in Milan, Italy, he was fourth in the bantamweight, losing to the future champion, Anton Osca from Romania. Two years later, during the 1939 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Dublin, he won silver, after beating Karl K√§bi from Estonia and Lambert Genot from Belgium. In the final fight, Czortek lost to Patrick Dowdall from Ireland. In the 1930s Czortek was a top boxer in his homeland, winning his first gold at the age of nineteen, in 1934 in Pozna≈Ñ. He was a champion of Poland three times in the interwar period (1934, 1938, 1939) (he would also win a national championships in 1949, after the war); he had numerous silver and bronze medals (he was second in the Polish championships in 1935 and 1948, and third in 1936). Fighting for his life in Auschwitz During the Polish September Campaign, Czortek fought together with his division near the border town of Wielu≈Ñ. After Poland‚Äôs defeat, he returned to Warsaw, and hid there, using the name Antoni Kami≈Ñski. Czortek, Antoni, 2004-01-19 The Gestapo were looking for him, and after some time, the boxer had to leave Warsaw and stay in the countryside near Gr√≥jec, with his wife‚Äôs family. Shot in the leg by a German patrol (he continued to limp until his death), Czortek was recognized and sent to Auschwitz. His heroic struggle for survival is still remembered in Poland. Czortek, who had the number 139559, was forced by the SS guards to participate in boxing matches.

In 1944 he was transferred to Mauthausen-Gusen, and in the spring of 1945 was freed by the Americans. After the war Upon returning to Poland, Czortek settled back in Warsaw, but in 1947, after losing a fight to an unknown boxer from Czƒôstochowa, he left the capital and moved to Radom. Kt√≥rzy odeszli , sport.pl, 2004-10-29 As he later told reporters, he was too ashamed to stay in Warsaw after his unexpected loss, and gladly accepted the offer from Radom. His wife was a native of Warsaw and did not want to move, but they were promised a two- bedroom apartment and she relented. Czortek fought until 1949, winning the Polish national championship. He then became a coach in Radom, teaching amongst others the Olympic champion Kazimierz Pazdzior. Czortek was well- respected and was made an honorary citizen of Radom, and was frequently invited to galas and banquets.

Best known for his church buildings in the Gothic revival style, Blanc was also a keen antiquarian who oversaw meticulously researched restoration projects. Early life Hippolyte Blanc was born at 37 North Frederick Street in Edinburgh, third son of four children, to French parents, who ran a business on George Street importing and manufacturing ladies shoes. His father, Victor Jacques Blanc, was from Privas in the Ard√®che area of France. He met his mother, Sarah or Sartia Bauress, whilst living in Dublin and moved to Edinburgh around 1840. Their firm \\"Madame Blanc et Fils\\" was at 68 George Street immediately opposite a house they moved to later in Hippolyte's life at 69 George Street. Blanc attended George Heriot's School, winning the dux medal in 1859, and was then articled to the architect David Rhind. While working for Rhind, he attended classes at the School of Art and Design, where he met Thomas Ross, and became interested in medieval architecture. In 1864, after completing his articles, he joined the Government Office of Works under Robert Matheson, where he became a senior draughtsman in 1869. He married Elizabeth Shield on 21 August 1873, and they moved to 12 St Vincent Street. They later moved to the Grange area in south Edinburgh: first to 2 Thirlestane Road and finally to 17 Strathearn Place. Mayfield Free Church (1876-79), now Mayfield Salisbury Church Architectural career For much of his career Blanc's office was at 40 Frederick Street, extremely close to his parental home and their shop. In 1901 the office moved to 1 Rutland Square. From the early 1870s, Blanc began to undertake private commissions. In 1875, he won his first architectural competition, for Christ Church, Morningside, and the following year won a second, for Mayfield Free Church. He left the Office of Works in 1878 to concentrate on his increasing workload, and by 1887 he had taken on a partner, James Gordon. Blanc executed numerous church buildings, including Kirkliston Free Church (1880), St Luke's, Broughty Ferry (1884), Coats Memorial Baptist Church, Paisley (1885), St Matthew's Parish Church (now Morningside Parish Church) (1888, opened 1890) and Morningside Free Church, Edinburgh (1892), now the Church Hill Theatre. He carried out restoration work to Edinburgh Castle (1886), John Knox House (1886), St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh (1892), and St Duthac's Church, Tain (1896). Secular work includes Mayville Gardens in Trinity, Edinburgh, a pleasant and quirky Victorian cul-de-sac with a low terrace of ornate houses on each side (1881).The Buildings of Scotland, Edinburgh by Colin McWilliam Other major commissions included houses at Eriska, Argyll, and Ferguslie Park, Paisley (1888‚Äì91), since demolished. Bangour Village Hospital, West Lothian, was a competition win in 1898, and he designed the former Bernard's Brewery buildings in Gorgie (1887). Blanc also designed several monuments. In 1912 he took his son, Frank Edward Belcombe Blanc, into partnership, and from 1913 his own architectural work drew to a close. His son continued to practice under the name Hippolyte J. Blanc & Son, until around 1950. From 1893 to 1898 his nephew, Louis David Blanc (1877-1944), also trained under him (working largely on the Coats Memorial Church in Paisley). Louis went on to specialise in department store design, being employed by Harrods as their in-house architect from around 1928.Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Louis David Blanc Blanc's eldest son, Victor Hippolyte Blanc, chose to be a dentist rather than an architect. Sir Frank Mears trained under Hippolyte from 1896 to 1901.

He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1879, a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1901, and was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) in 1896. In addition, he was an active member of several other learned societies. He wrote and lectured extensively, largely on the subject of medieval church architecture. Blanc served as president and treasurer of the RSA from 1907‚Äì17, and was president of the Edinburgh Photographic Society from 1888 until 1892, and honorary president from 1896 until his death. In 1910 he was appointed to a Royal Commission which oversaw British involvement in International Exhibitions held in Brussels (1910), Rome (1911) and Turin (1911).

It is affiliated with Cork GAA and plays in Duhallow division competitions. Its hurling team currently competes in the Cork Senior Hurling Championship having won the Cork Premier Intermediate hurling Championship in 2017. The Club subsequently went on to win the 2017 Munster Intermediate Hurling Championship and the 2018 All Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship. The club's Gaelic football team competes in the Cork Premier Intermediate Football Championship having won the Cork Intermediate Football Championship in 2017 to claim a historic double. History The club has been in existence since 1882, prior to the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. It was in football that Kanturk were a force is the early years when in 1897 the Cork Senior Football Championship final was reached before losing to famed Dohenys of Dunmanway by 5pts to 4pts after a replay. Both games were played in Cork Park in October 1897. Kanturk reached their second senior county football final in 1902. The game was played at Mallow on 16 November 1903 as the various county championships ran very late. Once again Kanturk had to contend with defeat when they lost by 0‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì1 to Lees. In 1909 the championships were re-organised to have Senior, Intermediate and Junior grades. Kanturk were senior that year but re-graded to Intermediate in 1910. This was to prove to be a master stroke as Kanturk won the Cork Intermediate Football Championship final of that year when they defeated C.Y.M.S. in the final played at Fermoy on 5 September by 3‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì1. Of the Kanturk team, P Carver (capt), R Moynihan, P Dennehy and D Singleton represented the club on the Cork Junior Football team. After the advent of the Duhallow GAA Board in 1933, Kanturk's first win was in the Examiner Cup, Junior football league in 1942. The Duhallow Junior A Hurling Championship was won two years later with a return to divisional hurling championship honours in 1949 and saw the club progress to a first ever Cork Junior Hurling Championship final in October only to lose to Bandon by 7‚Äì3 t0 1‚Äì2. At the Cork Athletic Grounds. Novice football victory in 1952 was followed by Examiner Cup, Junior Football league victory in 1953, before the club's first Duhallow Junior A Football Championship was won in 1954 with victory over Dromtarriffe at Banteer. 1957 was a special year with Kanturk winning the Junior football League and Championship double along with Junior Hurling league and Minor football championships, the only cup missing being the Minor & Junior hurling championship. Kanturk's third Duhallow Junior football championship came in 1962 when both the Novice and Junior Championships were won at Millstreet. The Junior decider was a replay and Knocknagree were defeated by 3‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì6. As the footballers played in the Intermediate grade from 1965 to 1970 inclusive, it was the hurling team that stepped up to the mark, winning a record 5 Duhallow Junior A Hurling Championships in a row from 1965 to 1969 culminating in Cork Junior Hurling Championship honours with victory over Mayfield at Castletownroche on a 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì10 score line. The link between both county junior hurling final appearances was that 1969 winning captain, Denis Kenneally is Brother of 1949 team captain, Tom Kenneally. Examiner Cup, Junior football league success in 1973 along with Novice football championship success the same year brought a hope for championship breakthrough. Sadly championship final defeats were their lot in 1986 to Ballydesmond, 1987(Rockchapel), 1993(Newmarket), 1997 & 2000 (Kiskeam). Success at Juvenile, Minor and U21 grades continued over the years to help provide a supply line of talent in both codes. Defeat was also tasted in the Junior Hurling finals of 1977 to Meelin and 1987 to Lismire. Junior hurling league wins in 1987 and 1988 gave hope but the long wait for a championship breakthrough came in 2002 when out of the ashes of a poor league campaign, the 33-year famine was ended with a victory in the glorious sunshine at Banteer with victory over Meelin. Despite County championship defeat to Diarmuid O Mathuna's, Kanturk recovered to gain back to back Duhallow Junior Hurling championship victories in 2003 with a replay win over Freemount at Kilbrin. A narrow county semi-final defeat to Dromina at Buttevant followed before an invitation to up grade to Intermediate level was taken in 2004. Steady progress has been made since then with Championship semi-final being reached in 2007 and 2008 losing to Bandon and Carrigaline respectively. In 2009 Kanturk won the Duhallow Junior A Football Championship for the first time in 47 years, defeating Rockchapel in the final in Boherbue. Kanturk were knocked in the county Championship by Ballygarvan after a replay. In 2010, Kanturk again got to the Duhallow final before losing out to Lyre. A third Duhallow final appearance in a row in 2011 saw Kanturk renew rivalry with Rockchapel at Rathcoole. It was a rematch of the 2009 decider and the 1987 decider which was the last occasion Dromtarriffe hosted the Duhallow showpiece. Rockchapel won on that occasion (1987) by one point and went on to win county honours. In the 2011 Duhallow Final, a goal from Aidan Walsh midway through the 2nd half set Kanturk on their way to a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì06 victory. Subsequently, the club went on to win the Cork Junior Football Championship.

Remnants can be found in north County Leitrim, north County Longford, County Cavan, County Monaghan and County Fermanagh (see the map below). Sometimes, the Dorsey enclosure in County Armagh and the Dane's Cast in County Down are considered to be part of the dyke. Similar earthworks can be found throughout Ireland,The Early Development of Irish Society. Cambridge University Press, 1969. pp.88‚Äì89 although the Black Pig's Dyke is the best known. A notable example is the Claidh Dubh (\\"black ditch\\"), anglicised Clyduff or Cleeduff, in eastern County Cork. It has three sections, the longest of which runs north‚Äìsouth for from the Ballyhoura Hills to the Nagle Mountains.Eachtra Journal: Issue 10. p.11  Name In counties Leitrim and Cavan the earthworks are generally called the Black Pig's Dyke or Dike. In County Longford it is called the Black Pig's Race, while in the Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan border area it is called Black Pig's Dyke or Worm Ditch. The ditches take their names from Gaelic folklore. One tale says that a huge black boar tore up the countryside with its large tusks. Another says that the ditches were made by a huge worm. Construction and purpose A depiction of a cattle raid in 16th century Gaelic Ireland ‚Äì it is believed that the earthworks were built to prevent such raids The earthworks usually consist of a bank with a ditch on either side. The bank is usually about wide and the ditches are usually about deep.Antiquities of the Irish Countryside Excavation of a stretch in County Monaghan revealed that the original construction was of a substantial timber palisade with external ditch. Behind the palisade was a double bank with intervening ditch. The timber structure was radiocarbon-dated to 390‚Äì370 BCE, so all of the earthworks may date to that period.J. T. Koch, An Atlas for Celtic Studies (2007), p. 110 and map 14.1; J. Waddell, The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland (1998). Such dates confound the once popular theory that the earthworks were made in imitation of the Roman frontier in northern Britain.Aidan Walsh, Excavation at the Black Pig's Dyke, Clogher Record, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1991), pp. 9-26. Some have put forward the idea that the earthworks marked the ancient border of Ulster. However, there is no evidence that they \\"collectively constitute one border for one people\\" ‚Äì the earthworks may not be contemporary and there are large gaps between them.Ireland: An Oxford archaeological guide to sites from earliest times to AD 1600. Oxford University Press, 2006. p.155 Others suggest that their sole purpose was to prevent cattle raiding, which was very common in ancient Ireland. Two theories have been put forward to explain why there are large gaps between the earthworks. One is that they were simply built across trackways that were often used by cattle raiders, another is that the gaps between them were once heavily wooded and thus no manmade defence was needed.Ireland: An Oxford archaeological guide to sites from earliest times to AD 1600. Oxford University Press, 2006. p.155.

Around 70,000 members paid subscriptions in the hope of gaining a plot, which were allocated by the drawing of ballots. Five settlements were made, at Herringsgate, Minster Lovell, Snig's End, Lowbands and lastly, Great Dodford. Chartist leader Feargus O'Connor bought the site of Dodford Priory and 273 adjacent acres from a wealthy local farmer Benjamin BomfordLand for the landless, and votes for the disenfranchised.

Equipment and horses were moved from Snig's End to prepare the site that summer. 5,000 Midlands Chartists met at Dodford in July, where O'Connor assured them that the settlement would be completed, despite interference from a Parliamentary select committee and a ‚Äúlying and slandering press‚Äù.Fourth Report of the S.C.: H.C.503, 1847-8, XlX, p.75; Northern Star, 22 July 1848; quoted by P Searby The Select Committee ruled that allocating plots by ballot was a violation of the Lottery Acts, so allocation of plots at Dodford was made to those who paid the largest advance deposits: > members would in effect have to outbid each other to gain plots. O'Connor > proposed this system reluctantly and really wanted one that would be legal > and at the same time would not rule out the acquisition of plots by the > \\"blistered hands, fustian jackets, and un-shorn chins.\\" ‚ÄòLocation Day‚Äô, when settlers were welcomed to their new plots, was 2 July 1849. Unlike other ‚ÄòLocation Days‚Äô it was not celebrated in the Chartist Northern Star, which instead began to print the complaints of settlers. The settlement's 44 plots were ill-prepared, with open wells and no water pumps. Crops of wheat had not been planted: > The first year at Dodford was very hard for the settlers: one of them, John > Wallace, said that they had had only dry bread to eat. For some years > afterwards they did badly too, growing cereals and potatoes. Many supported > themselves at their old trades, at home or in Bromsgrove, and hired > labourers to work their plots.Searby, p42 The company ‚Äì now known as the national Land Company ‚Äì was dissolved, in part because no rents were paid from Dodford residents. The tenants were given the chance to buy out the ground and avoid rent, or to continue paying it to a new owner. Chartists from the West Midlands lent practical help with tools and regular visits in the early, difficult years. A special 'Dodford digging fork' was made in Stourbridge to deal with heavy red soil. However, unlike other Chartists settlements, which continued to do badly, largely because the plots were too small,Searby, page 39 Dodford could access the growing Birmingham and Black Country markets. > John Wallace realized that with careful treatment the heavy soil was > suitable for the cultivation of strawberries and other market-garden crops: > early in the 1860s their growing was begun at his suggestion. From then > until about 1920 strawberries were the staple crop at Dodford; 'Joseph > Paxton' was the favourite variety. The small holders sold market garden products, particularly strawberries, but also flowers, peas, beans and shallots. Orchards of pears and plums were planted. An annual ‚ÄòStrawberry Wake‚Äô was held on the second Sunday of July, where visitors could eat as many as they liked for 6d, until 1922. Garlic was also sold to Lea and Perrins in Worcester. The plot holders also continued with other trades to supplement their incomes, such as nailmaking, making gunlocks and running a grocers' shop. One of the plot holders, John Ward, a butcher from Bolton, ran a pub, now the Dodford Inn. Because Dodford enjoyed success, it became used in 1880s campaigns by Jesse Collings and others, calling for land reform: > these small cultivators are only acquainted with poor rates from the fact > that they have to pay them. What I want to see, and what the working > classes, if they are wise, will insist on securing, is that there should be > three or four thousand Great Dodfords in England.Jesse Collings, quoted in > The Gardens of the British Working Class, by Margaret Willes, p136 The Dodford settlements remained prosperous, and retained their radical character, until the 1890s. Ironically, the advocates of land reform successfully established allotments at Catshill which grew strawberries earlier, on lighter soils, pushing prices down. Dodford experienced a brief moment of prosperity during the First World War as strawberries were sold to Cadbury's for jam, but the tradition died post war, for a number of reasons. Plots were bought as rural retreats. Strawberries suffered lower quality due to disease and the use of artificial fertilizers. Better wages could be found in the Austin factory at Longbridge, and the cheap labour force of pickers disappeared as the Bromsgrove nailmaking industry rapidly declined.

One evening his aunt asks him to take a sari to her mother who lives in another village, which is a route through dense forests. As Sibu is crossing the forest, it gets dark and he decides to rest for a while and falls asleep. He wakes up startled by the terrible roar of a ferocious tiger who is about to attack him when a huge White Elephant emerges and rescues Shibu from certain death. The tiger is frightened and runs away and the magnificent white elephant, whom Shibu names \\"Airawat\\" and he become friends. Next morning Sibu safely reaches the other village and hands over the sari to his aunt's mother. She gives him some money in return to buy himself some treats. With that money Shibu buys some bananas and after returning to the forest, feeds his new friend, Airawat, who is very pleased and gives him a precious gold coin. Sibu returns home with the coin and tells Rani about his new friend and shows her the gold coin. She forbids Shibu to tell anyone, especially their greedy aunt and uncle and asks him to keep the entire incident a secret. Eventually the gold coin is found by Shibu's aunt and uncle. They become extra sweet to him and very cleverly trace out the origin of the gold coin to the White Elephant by following Shibu when he returns to the forest to meet Airawat. Meanwhile a Maharaja comes to the village for hunting. He strikes his tent near the forest and Sibu‚Äôs uncle and aunt tell the Maharaja about the existence of the White Elephant, which is very rare to spot. The Maharaja promises them a handsome reward if they can lead him the White Elephant. The Maharaja gives some money to the Uncle and Aunt when Sibu is handed over to him by them.

The next morning, the Maharaja takes Sibu to the forest along with his associates and a dozen elephants. He puts a gun to the poor boy‚Äôs head and calls out for Airwat and threatens that if he does not surrender, Sibu‚Äôs head will be blown to pieces. Airawat surrenders and is taken into captivity by the Maharaja. Sibu becomes desperate to rescue Airawat and asks Mynah to summon all the animals in the forest to declare war against the Maharaja. Elephants, tigers cobras and other animals unite to attack the Maharaja‚Äôs camp where Airwat is being held hostage. They do not kill anybody but overpower the Maharaja and his lackeys and manage to successfully secure Airawat's release.

He was born and died in Vienna. Edwin-Grienauer-Exhibition at Institut f√ºr Numismatik und Geldgeschichte Vienna University (German), retrieved 20 November 2013 Life Edwin Grienauer was the son of cello player Karl Grienauer and opera singer Helene Schott. His father migrated to the U.S. to pursue his musical career, leaving Edwin to fend for himself in Vienna. At 19, Edwin created his first portrait plaques and then went on to study at Vienna's applied arts college (Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule). He fought in World War I and suffered an injury that partially disfigured his face. In 1935, he received the title of Professor and taught at the Vienna Arts Academy (Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste) after 1945. His studio was located in the Vienna Prater park, where he died in 1964. The artist was an excellent amateur in rowing and won the Austrian championships in double sculls in 1927. His Olympic success came from his art, however: In 1928 he won a gold medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his \\"M√©dailles\\" and twenty years later he won a bronze medal for his \\"Prize Rowing Trophy\\". Work Grienauer was proficient in all areas of sculptural design. He is particularly well known as a designer of Austrian commemorative and regular issue coins. The medal work of Grienauer is dominated by award and service medals of national or economic institutions and prizes for sporting events. His large sculptures are still present today in Vienna and include reliefs and architectural sculptures, religious statues on and in churches in Vienna and Baden, and even floor tiles for St Stephan's Cathedral. A tabernacle showing the Annunciation to Mary is in the archives of St Stephan's Cathedral. Works include coining dies of the Austrian 1st and 2nd Republic. Grienauer designed the denomination side of the last one-Schilling-coin of Austria, which was in circulation from 1959 to 2002. He designed commemorative and regular issue coins for Liechtenstein as well. A complete list of Grienauer's work hasn't been established yet. It was only in 2003 that the institute for numismatics at Vienna University started to work on Grienauer's estate which had been permanently loaned to the institute by the artist's descendants. In addition to coins and medals, the estate contains drawings, models and coining dies, which illustrate the creative process and techniques of the medalist's work.

Biography Slik Toxik was formed out of Toronto hard rock band Portrait. Portrait consisted of original members singer/guitarist Nick Walsh, drummer Kevin Harrison, guitarist Kevin Gale and bassist/ lyricist Dave Mercel. Portrait in its final incarnation was made up of Nick Walsh, guitarists Rob Bruce and Kevin Gale, bassist Frank Currell, and drummer Alex Munro. Former bassist and long time writing partner Dave Mercel remained as the band's lyricist. Pat Howarth soon replaced Currell on bass as the band felt more akin to Howarth due to his musical style and also because he was already a friend from the neighborhood. The band was brought to the attention of Drew Masters who was a national music writer and manager for the band Succsexx. Drew thought that the band should change their name to have more attitude and impact to stand out from the bands that were currently playing on the scene. After adopting a new moniker Slik Toxik was then asked to be support act for Succexx. It was at one of those gigs at the Siboney Club in Toronto's Kensington Market area that manager John Boyes saw the band performing. Shortly after that he courted them to sign a management deal with his brother's company Robert Luhtala Management. The band started to demo some material that was to be produced by Bob Potter (Scorpions, Hawkwind, Marianne Faithfull) at Toronto's Comfort Sound and shopped by RLM to major labels. It was during these sessions that the band was told that they needed to get a different drummer for the studio that had more practical experience. That's when Neal Busby was brought in for the job. The band gave Alex Munro the opportunity to work harder and remain in the band, but being hurt by this situation he opted to resign from the band and Neal was hired full-time. Those sessions with Bob Potter at the helm didn't work out for the band. So they plodded along, self producing the demo with Andrew St. George (Killer Dwarfs, Dan Gibson) engineering the recording and then mixer/producer Anthony Vanderburgh and engineer Rick Anderson (Rush) were brought in to mix and finish the job. After a chance meeting between Nick Walsh, Rob Bruce and producer Paul Gross (SAGA, Lee Aaron) at an EMI publishing gala, a meeting was immediately set up to start working on an album. After finishing 6 songs that would eventually become the album known as 'Doin' the Nasty' the band shopped once again garnering the attention of some major labels. Capitol Records (EMI) signed the band in 1991 and issued an EP, 'Smooth And Deadly'. This was followed in 1992 by the full album Doin' the Nasty. Both the EP and full- length album were produced by Paul Gross and co-produced by Anthony Vanderburgh and recorded at Toronto's world class facility studio Phase One. Slik Toxik toured throughout North America and released four singles which helped the album reach gold status in Canada and placed No. 61 on the Canadian music charts.Scan of RPM charts, May 30, 1992 They won the 1993 Juno Award for Hard Rock Album of the Year. The \\"White Lies/Black Truth\\" video won the People's Choice Award for 'Best Video Of The Year' and \\"Helluvatime\\" took home the 'Best Metal Video Award' at the 1992 MuchMusic Video Awards. Slik Toxik kept in close touch with their fans through mail-outs and contests, which earned the band an enthusiastic grassroots following. As an indicator of their openness toward their fans, they were invited to be one of the last acts to play Toronto's popular Rock And Roll Bar, The Gas Works, on its closing night. In 1992 they played at 'The Great Canadian Party', a Canada Day festival with The Tragically Hip, Spinal Tap and 54-40 at Molson Park in Barrie, Ontario, and they toured North America as opening acts for Kim Mitchell, Faster Pussycat, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Black Sabbath before doing their own headlining tours with Sven Gali and Big House as their opening bands. Hard rock had undergone profound changes in the period between Slik Toxik's formation in 1989 and 1994 when they reconvened to create their second album. In the confusion of the time, many successful and promising hard rock and glam metal bands were abandoned in favour of the newer hard rock trends. Bands such as Alice In Chains, Pantera, and Skid Row had successfully added crunch from the thrash metal scene to their music without compromising their hard rock and glam metal roots. Slik Toxik brought in various producers to add a similar heaviness to their own sound in order to stay true to themselves and their music. The label contracted Glenn Robinson (The Tea Party, Kyuss) . Things were moving forward in positive ways; they had parted ways with RLM by this point and were trying to make a go of it on their own. However, there was a lot of turmoil and dysfunction happening within the band. Between depression, rampant drug and alcohol abuse the members were growing apart. At the 1994 post-Juno Awards party an intoxicated Pat Howarth stole and smashed a limousine, which led EMI to question the stability of the band as well as their viability in the changing hard rock climate. After the band had given him a chance to clean himself up, another incident occurred almost immediately and Howarth was then let go from the band. In need of a bass player, long time friend of Neal Busby, B.I.T. graduate Adam Headland was brought in as a hired gun to record the album and tour. It was at this time that EMI also suggested that Slik Toxik be moved to one of their subsidiary record labels with less money, less support and still carrying a huge debt load. So it was decided by the band to leave the EMI and start fresh considering they had a wide fanbase . Irrelevant was released in 1994 and distributed by A&M; Records and was again produced by Paul Gross and recorded at Phase One Studios in Toronto. Despite the best efforts of all involved, the album was not well received by the grunge-obsessed general public. It did garner some critical acclaim, but that was not enough to keep the band going. After many months apart, the band was brought together to do some final shows to take care of some business affairs. The final touring line up consisted of Nick Walsh, Rob Bruce, Neal Busby, Adam Headland and guitarist Scott 'T-Bone' TeBeau. Subsequent activity After the breakup of the band, individual members went their separate ways, joining new bands and releasing hard rock records in a wide variety of styles. Singer Nick Walsh and lead guitarist Rob Bruce formed the modern rock/hard rock band Raised On Mars, and together they released a self- titled debut. Walsh went on to form the hard rock band Revolver with long time musical partner Laurie-Anne Green. Revolver had produced two albums, one being a CD/DVD set. In 2011 Revolver re-branded to become Famous Underground. Walsh also is currently singing with Canadian classic rock band MOXY for their 40th anniversary CD and tour and is also singing with Classic Albums Live. Guitarist Kevin Gale plays in the modern rock/hard rock band Punishment. They released Beautiful Suffering, a 4-song EP. In 2010, Kevin then joined modern rock Toronto band In fact. As of 2012, Kevin has played with the band CORE. Since then, Punishment has regrouped and entered the studio as of October 2015. Bassist Pat Howarth joined Brave New World, a Thunder Bay-based progressive metal band. Brave New World recorded one unreleased independent album before going on indefinite hiatus. Neal Busby spent time in Toronto death metal/black metal band Solus, who released three underground metal albums. After Solus split up, Neil toured with classic rockers April Wine in place of the ailing Jerry Mercer. Most recently, Neal along with his wife, Huguette Arsenault, have had much success as a songwriting team known as TWIRL. They have had hundreds of songs placed in film, television and advertising such as: Pretty Little Liars, Piranha 3DD, Shameless, and Just Dance Kids 1&2\\\\. Busby teaches drums full-time and has released his first instructional drum book entitled The Ultimate Guide To Rock Drums, published by Mayfair Music. The other ex-members of Slik Toxik have been mostly absent from the music scene.

Potassium dichromate A secondary alcohol can be oxidised into a ketone using acidified potassium dichromate and heating under reflux. The orange-red dichromate ion, Cr2O72‚àí, is reduced to the green Cr3+ ion. This reaction was once used in an alcohol breath test. PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate) PCC, when used in an organic solvent, can be used to oxidise a secondary alcohol into a ketone. It has the advantage of doing so selectively without the tendency to over-oxidise. Dess‚ÄìMartin oxidation The Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane is a mild oxidant for the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.Dess, D. B.; Martin, J. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 7277‚Äì87. The reaction is performed under standard conditions, at room temperature, most often in dichloromethane. The reaction takes between half an hour and two hours to complete. The product is then separated from the spent periodinane. J. S. Yadav, et al. \\"Recyclable 2nd generation ionic liquids as green solvents for the oxidation of alcohols with hypervalent iodine reagents\\", Tetrahedron, 2004, 60, 2131‚Äì35 Swern oxidation Swern oxidation oxidises secondary alcohols into ketones using oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide. It also requires an organic base, such as triethylamine. center The by-products are dimethyl sulfide (Me2S), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and ‚Äì when triethylamine is used as base ‚Äì triethylammonium chloride (C6H15NHCl). Dimethyl sulfide and carbon monoxide are very toxic and malodorous compounds, so the reaction and the work-up needs to be performed in a fume hood or outdoors.

He was a faculty member of Hawthorne College in Antrim, New Hampshire from 1977 to 1989, serving as the Computer Science Depart Chair from 1986 to 1989. In 1985, he joined the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics and VISIONS groups at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and received a Ph.D. in 1987. His doctoral thesis Towards Cosmopolitan Robots: Intelligent Navigation in Extended Man-Made Environments was supervised by Edward M. Riseman. =Career= Shortly after receiving his Ph.D., Ronald Arkin joined the School of Information and Computer Science (now College of Computing) at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founded the Mobile Robot Laboratory. He became a Regents' Professor in 2002 and was the first person to hold such honor in the College of Computing's history. From August, 1997 to August, 1998, Arkin was a STINT Visiting Professor at the Centre for Autonomous Systems, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. He served as the Sabbatical Chair for the Sony Intelligence Dynamics Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan, from June, 2005 to October, 2005, and was also a member of the Laboratory for analysis and architecture of systems at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France. In 2006, the United States Department of Defense contracted Arkin to conduct a study to determine if military robots could be made to operate ethically. The goal is to create a robot with an \\"artificial conscience\\" such that, for example, it might refrain from firing weaponry when children were detected, or to even understand the laws of war and apply them in battle. ‚ÄúMy intention in designing this is that robots will make less mistakes‚Äîhopefully far less mistakes‚Äîthan humans do in the battlefield,‚Äù Arkin says.

With more than 300 singing members, it is also one of the largest. The chorus's stated mission is that it ‚Äúdelights audiences and champions gay equality with robust artistry, fun, and surprise.‚ÄùThe Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, DC In addition to singing members, GMCW has nearly 100 support volunteers, 400 subscribers, 500 donors and an annual audience of nearly 10,000. The parent organization is the Federal City Performing Arts Association, Inc., and GMCW is a member of GALA Choruses. The chorus was established in 1981 by enthusiasts of the San Francisco Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus who attended a local performance at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. In the time since its founding, GMCW has performed locally at the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, the Warner Theatre, DAR Constitution Hall, the Lincoln Theatre and, most frequently, Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University. The chorus performed at President Clinton‚Äôs second inauguration in 1997. In 1998, the chorus toured three Scandinavian capitals. While there, GMCW was received by Sweden‚Äôs Princess Christina to thank members for singing in support of Noah‚Äôs Ark, a Swedish AIDS services organization. During its 20th-anniversary season in 2000‚Äì2001, GMCW performed at Carnegie Hall and Boston‚Äôs Symphony Hall in joint concerts with the gay men‚Äôs choruses of Boston and New York City. In December 2002, GMCW performed as part of the televised 25th annual Kennedy Center Honors in tribute to Elizabeth Taylor. The chorus has commissioned original works for men‚Äôs chorus, such as Changing Hearts in 2004 and Songs of My Family in 2007. Both works were featured on CD releases subsequent to their inaugural performances on stage. GMCW performs three subscription concerts annually: holiday-themed (December), spring (March) and summer (June), which opens Washington‚Äôs annual week-long Capital Pride celebration. In addition, in 2007 and 2008, the chorus performed a non-subscription concert of classical fare in February, between the holiday and spring concerts. There are occasional smaller, also non- subscription productions, such as an auditioned Cabaret concert in October or November. The chorus makes appearances at local community events, including programs for PFLAG, Whitman-Walker Clinic and the Human Rights Campaign. The chorus sponsors five small ensembles: Potomac Fever, an a cappella close- harmony group, Rock Creek Singers, a chamber choir, GenOUT, an LGBTQI supportive chorus for DC area youth, Seasons of Love, a gospel choir, and 17th Street Dance, a dance troupe. These ensembles serve as representatives of the larger chorus at community functions, and each produces an annual concert.

Official Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C. logo June 28, 1981: After the national tour performance of the San Francisco Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus at the Kennedy Center 10 days earlier, Marsha Pearson had distributed fliers announcing a meeting to organize a gay men‚Äôs chorus. The meeting occurred in the old Gay Community Center at 1469 Church Street in Northwest Washington with 18 men, and the GMCW was born. Jim Richardson became the new organization‚Äôs Interim Director with the first rehearsals being held at the center, and later at the First Congregational Church in downtown Washington. Sept. 23, 1981: At the invitation of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, GMCW‚Äôs debut performance occurred at a reception at the District Building, to mark the opening of the National Gay Task Force‚Äôs Washington office (later the NGLTF). Also that month, GMCW established its management umbrella, incorporating the Federal City Performing Arts Association (FCPAA), as a non-profit educational organization whose goal was ‚Äúto provide first-rate music in performance by and for Washington‚Äôs gay and lesbian community and the community-at-large.‚Äù Dec. 12, 1981: With nearly 90 members, the chorus performed its first holiday concert, jointly with the DC Area Feminist Chorus and Different Drummers, at the First Congregational Church to a standing-room-only audience of close to 1,000.

Oct. 15, 1989: The Chorus was allowed to participate in the AIDS Healing Service at the Washington National Cathedral under its own name after a significant struggle for recognition. GMCW was asked to participate in the 1988 service, only to have the invitation ‚Äúrescinded because the Episcopal hierarchy deemed us too ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô,‚Äù according to one member. (While they did participate, it was not under the GMCW name.) Chorus leadership pursued the issue in 1989 and the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church yielded. Jan. 19, 1997: The chorus performed an 11-number set at the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs American History Museum on the eve of the 53rd Presidential Inaugural ‚Äì the first time a gay choral group was invited to participate in such a national event.

The season ended with a concert featuring a special guest, Tony Award winner Jennifer Holliday, and premiering Alexander‚Äôs House, a one-act work by composer Michael Shaieb telling the story of disparate parts of a gay man‚Äôs family ‚Äî including his lover and friends and a young-adult son he had left behind ‚Äî coming together as they cope with his death. Oct. 24, 2011: The chorus hosted a party at the Hotel Helix in honor of the release of FCPAA Board of Directors member Paula Bresnan Gibson‚Äôs Voices From a Chorus. The book was the result of 14 months of research and work, during which time Paula interviewed 65 members and supporters of the chorus. Everyone who took the time to speak with Paula was featured and quoted in the book. For many months thereafter, Paula would go to book stores for live readings and discussions with customers. In July 2012, Paula and a panel of chorus members spoke during GALA Festival 2012 in Denver. To date, copies of the book are provided for free to all incoming members of the chorus. June 2, 2012: The chorus‚Äôs 31st season had begun in December 2011 with a successful holiday extravaganza, Red & Greene, featuring special guest Ellen Greene. The Kids Are All Right, performed in February 2012, featured the Pittsburgh-based LGBT youth performing arts collective Dreams of Hope. In March, the Chorus performed an elaborately-staged production of Richard O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs countercultural classic The Rocky Horror Show, which included audience call-outs from the film. GMCW‚Äôs small ensembles Rock Creek Singers and Potomac Fever united for the first time in many years for a single concert, Together Again, in April. The season concluded with the June 2012 performances of Heart Throbs, an energetic salute to the men of pop music. A month later, along with the small ensembles‚Äô own appearances, the Chorus performed Alexander‚Äôs House as the first of a special series of morning ‚ÄúCoffee Concerts‚Äù at GALA Festival 2012 in Denver. June 1, 2013: The Chorus‚Äôs 32nd season performances began in December 2012 with Winter Nights, which featured special guest the Virginia Bronze handbell ensemble. For the February 2013 concert, My Big Fat Gay Wedding, the Chorus hosted not just a special guest, gay folk singer and former member of Chanticleer Matt Alber, but also staged a wedding. A live-auction bid for the opportunity had been offered the year prior, during the 2012 Spring Affair fund-raiser. Dixon Charles and board member J.T. Hatfield Charles won the auction and were wed on stage by Chorus member and registered marriage officiant Patrick Nelson. In March, the Chorus performed a full-scale production of the 2007 Broadway musical Xanadu, based on the 1980 film starring Olivia Newton-John. In April, GMCW‚Äôs small ensembles Rock Creek Singers and Potomac Fever performed in the concert Side by Side. The season‚Äôs final√© included the June 2012 performances of Seven, a sexy, ebullient celebration of the seven deadly sins. June 26, 2013: Chorus members assembled in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, at the direction of Associate Music Director Thea Kano, in reaction to the Court‚Äôs rulings eliminating key provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and allowing a lower court‚Äôs ruling on California‚Äôs Proposition 8 to stand, thus allowing the law banning same-sex marriages in California to end. In front of press and hundreds of well-wishers, the Chorus performed ‚ÄúMake Them Hear You‚Äù (from the musical Ragtime) and ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù The performances were recorded on video, both by amateurs and professionals, and aired on local and national news broadcasts. May 18, 2014: A bittersweet but significant moment occurred as the Chorus closed its 33rd season at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall with special guest Laura Benanti, who had joined the chorus 12 years earlier at the same venue. At that time, Jeffrey Buhrman was ending his second season as artistic director of the Chorus. On this day, in the performance of A Gay Man‚Äôs Guide to Broadway, he closed his 14th and final season, which had begun with a festive holiday show, Sparkle, Jingle, Joy, with guest Matt Alber, and continued with Passion, Von Trapped (a gay interpolation of The Sound of Music) and the small ensembles‚Äô concert Forte, performed at the Mead Center for American Theater, home to Arena Stage. In A Gay Men‚Äôs Guide to Broadway, as many Chorus and audience members fought back tears, Burhman was honored by the Chorus and Benanti and given an extended standing ovation, and Washington, D.C., mayor Vincent Gray declared it ‚ÄúJeffrey Burhman Day.‚Äù Notes and references   Further reading  *Harmanci, Reyhan.

Dr. Daines focused national attention on childhood obesity as a public health issue and oversaw implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, also known as the Berger Commission, which restructured institutional health care. He promoted the development of primary care and patient-centered medical homes and hailed the Adirondack Medical Home initiative in the Adirondacks of northern New York as a national model. He established a new office in the State Health Department to focus on the development and implementation of electronic health records and other health information technology to improve health care delivery in the state. In 2009, Daines criticized nutritionist and activist Gary Null for his remarks as a keynote speaker at a political rally against mandatory vaccination of health care workers against H1N1 influenza at the New York State Capitol in Albany, New York.Charles Scirbona, \\"Health workers angry over mandatory swine flu shots: DOH commissioner says vaccinations are safe,\\" Legislative Gazette, October 6, 2009, found at Legislative Gazette website. Accessed October 6, 2009. Daines said, \\"Like any number of things he‚Äôs wrong about, he‚Äôs wrong about that.\\" A former Scoutmaster who was an Eagle Scout, Dr. Daines conducted physicals for scouts and promoted youth health throughout his life. During his tenure as State Health Commissioner, he traveled to all 62 counties of New York State to promote New York's Prevention Agenda toward the Healthiest State and highlight local public health activities, often accompanied by his father, Newell. These activities included dropping rabies vaccine baits from a helicopter over northern New York; hunting disease-carrying mosquitoes in Cicero Swamp near Syracuse; tragging for ticks to highlight the prevention of Lyme Disease; promoting pet rabies clinics; highlighting low-fat, nutritious foods served in restaurants; supporting smoke-free outdoor community areas and parks; highlighting fresh fruits and vegetables available through community gardens and local farms; showcasing community efforts to promote physical activity, and encouraging New Yorkers to drink water and low-fat milk in place of high-calorie sugary beverages to prevent overweight and obesity. He was featured in several YouTube videos promoting obesity prevention. In a farewell message to employees of the New York State Department of Health in December 2010, Dr. Daines quoted Hippocrates: \\"Art (of medicine) is long. Life is short, opportunity fleeting, experiment perilous, judgment difficult.\\" Daines died at age 60 on February 26, 2011 of a sudden cardiovascular event while working at his farm in Dutchess County, New York. He and his wife of 36 years, Linda, also shared an apartment in Manhattan. He was the father of three children, William, Katherine and Andrew.\\"Richard F.

There are two breeds of Braque fran√ßais, both from the south of France, the Braque fran√ßais, type Gascogne (French Pointing Dog - Gascogne type, larger size) and the Braque fran√ßais, type Pyr√©n√©es (French Pointing Dog - Pyrenean type, smaller size) They are popular hunting dogs in France, but are seldom seen elsewhere.  History  The original Braque fran√ßais type of pointing dog has existed since the fifteenth century. Over the centuries the dogs were taken to other countries and were crossed with other breeds. When a search was made at the end of the nineteenth century to find the original dogs, two separate regional varieties were found. They may be descended from the Old Spanish Pointer or Pachon Navarro, and the now extinct Southern Hound. The first breed club was formed in 1850, and the standards for both breeds were written in 1880. It is recognised in its home country by the French Kennel Club (Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine, S.C.C) and internationally by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. The S.C.C. prohibits inbreeding or linebreeding and will not register any dog with common ancestors in the first three generations of its pedigree. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the Canadian Kennel Club in Canada and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. recognise them. The Canadian Kennel Club recognises one breed, the Braque Fran√ßais (Gascogne) in its Sporting Dogs Group and the United Kennel Club recognises both breeds, in its Gundog Group, with the names Braque Francais De Grande Taille and Braque Francais, De Petite Taille - petite taille (smaller size) means the Pyrenean is smaller than the Gascogne, and does not mean that it is a little dog. The breeds are also recognized by many minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses under various versions of the names, and promoted as rare breeds for those seeking unique pets.  Hunting use  The Braque fran√ßais breeds are not just pointers, but versatile hunting dogs that can retrieve, flush, and even trail game in all sorts of terrain.Club du Braque fran√ßais, breed club in France The Pyr√©n√©es is a quick dog that can move fast without sprinting, while the Gascogne is a slower moving dog.  Appearance  Both breeds of Braque fran√ßais are medium to large sized dogs with long legs and long drop ears. The coat is short, and chestnut brown or white speckled with brown in colour, often with one or more large brown spots. The head is usually brown. The Gascogne is about taller at the withers than the Pyrenean. = Differences = *The Braque fran√ßais, type Pyr√©n√©es dogs are at the withers, females slightly smaller), giving the impression of \\"a German shorthaired pointer shrunk down to Brittany size\\".Braque Francais, The French Pointer In North America, by Chad Mason, Gun Dog Magazine, August, 2004 online The larger Braque fran√ßais, type Gascogne dogs are (females smaller) *The coat of the Gascogne is thick, while that of the Pyr√©n√©es is described as \\"finer and shorter\\" than the Gascogne.Breed standard, Braque fran√ßais, type Pyr√©n√©es The Pyr√©n√©es is usually more mottled brown on the body. *The head of the Pyr√©n√©es is slightly broader, and the ears are not as long. On the Gascogne, if the ears are pulled forward, they will reach the tip of the nose. The Gascogne has slightly pendulous lips, making the muzzle appear square; the Pyr√©n√©es muzzle looks more narrow. Faults (elements of appearance that indicate that the dog should not be bred) in both breeds include no tail (anury), split nose or depigmented nose, syndactyly (toes grown together), surplus toes, or absence of toes.  Health  No specific diseases or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. =Temperament= Ideal Braque Francais temperament is described as \\"friendly, sociable, gentle and submissive\\" and, as a soft breed, should not be subjected to harsh training methods. Temperament of individual dogs can vary, and all dogs must be well socialized with people and other animals at an early age in order to be a good pet.

He lived in Paris between 1912 and 1913, where he was influenced by the work of Aristide Maillol and Auguste Rodin. After serving in the German army during World War One, where he was badly wounded, he became a professor of sculpture at the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr Freie und Angewandte Kunst, Berlin (1923).

For the Reich's Exhibition of 1937 in D√ºsseldorf he produced two large equestrian statues for the fair's portals, which resulted in Scharff being classified as a degenerate artist. He continued to work in secret during World War Two, and after the war he became a professor at the Landeskunstschule in Hamburg.

Although the current church building dates to 1867, a church has been located in Willenhall since c. 1313, where a chaplain is mentioned in one of the Paget deeds. The current parish priest is Revd Sue Boyce. History The original church is believed to have survived until 1748, by which time it had fallen into decay. It was described by Dr. Wilkes, a local antiquary, that the building was unsafe to allow people to congregate there. A new church was constructed in its place in 1750, although the ancient tower remained and in 1788, another storey was added to it. Inside this extension, a peal of six bells made by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester were installed. The church building was square in plan and was built of red brick. A chancel was located on the east side of the church. It consisted of 620 seats and an organ by James Chapman Bishop which was installed in 1837. In about 1850, it was decided that a new church should be sought and in a vestry meeting in 1853, W. D. Griffin, a Wolverhampton-based architect, provided designs to alter the church. It was decided that the scheme was too costly and Griffin was told to design a new church in the Gothic style. Construction commenced in 1866 and was completed the following year, with the entire scheme costing ¬£6,700. It was consecrated by Dr. John Lonsdale, Lord Bishop of Lichfield on 18 July 1867. In 1898, the church received a new organ from Hill Norman and Beard to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1900, the first school building was constructed. In 1911, the interior was renovated and oak choir stalls provided. The church was again renovated in 1927, with the addition of a vestry and side chapel, a new high altar of the English pattern and an oak carved pulpit. A mission church of St Giles, dedicated to St Matthias, was built in Shepwell Green in 1907 but then shut in the 1980s. The St Giles parish, assigned to the church, was created in 1848, before which the church had served as a chapel of ease to St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton. The first burials took place in 1727. The original peal of bells were recast and rehung in 1937. A further two bells were also added in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of King George V. On 31 July 1986 the church was granted Grade II listed status. The famous Rock Band of the Seventies \\" Slade \\" used to rehearse at the Youth Club next to the Church Architecture The church is faced in red sandstone and has a tiled roof. The church tower is located to the northwest and is tall. It has angle buttresses and a parapet in the centre. The bell openings and west doorway to the tower are moulded. Inside, nave has four-bay arcades of pointed arches chamfered in two orders. The columns have foliated capitals and are of four clustered shafts, except for the eastern bay, which is wider and is separated from the others by a round column. The nave roof trusses have tie-beams, king- posts rising to the ridge, and arch-braces rising from the tie-beams to meet the king-posts below the ridge. The chancel arch is moulded. Between the south chapel and the chancel is a three-bay arcade with round piers and foliated capitals. =Memorials= The east window was fitted in 1867 by Ralph Dickenson Gough. A memorial window to him was erected in 1886. In 1895, a choir aisle was added in memory of Rev G.H. Fisher, MA, who was the vicar at the church from 1834-1894.

He was known as the Prince of Lamballe from birth. He pre-deceased his father, and died childless. Biography Louis Alexandre was born on 6 September 1747, at the H√¥tel de Toulouse (now the seat of the Banque de France, in the 1st arrondissement of Paris), the Paris residence of his family. His father, the Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthi√®vre, was the only legitimate child of Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, the youngest legitimised son of King Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. His mother, Princess Maria Teresa Felicity of Modena, the daughter of the Duke of Modena, also a descendant of Madame de Montespan, and related to the House of Orl√©ans. The prince de Lamballe, as he was known all his life, was the couple's only surviving son. He was one of seven children. At the death of his older brother Louis Marie de Bourbon, the Prince of Lamballe became the heir to the Penthi√®vre fortune, much of which had been extorted by Louis XIV from his childless cousin la Grande Mademoiselle, and bestowed upon Louis XIV's legitimised elder son, Louis Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine. His title, prince de Lamballe, came from one of the seigneuries owned by his father; it was neither a sovereign princedom nor a legal title. Rather, it was a titre de courtoisie. His mother died in childbirth in 1754 at the age of twenty-seven. =Marriage= His father chose his bride, the Italian born Princess Maria Teresa Louisa of Savoy. The wedding celebration lasted from 17 January 1767, until 27 January with feasts in Turin and Nangis. Prior to the wedding, Louis Alexandre eager to see his future bride, went secretly where Maria Teresa was staying. He met her disguised as a simple country servant and offered her a bouquet of flowers in his \\"master's\\" name. During the wedding ceremony the next day, the princess was shocked to discover that the humble man from the previous day was in fact the prince himself. After the ceremony, for their honeymoon, Louis Alexandre and his bride stayed at the Ch√¢teau de Nangis. His father had specifically chosen Maria Teresa as his son's wife due to her renowned piety and beauty. He thought that such a spouse would help make his son change his libertine lifestyle. Princess Maria Luisa was the sixth child of the Prince of Carignan and his German wife Landgravine Christine Henriette of Hesse-Rotenburg, the sister of the late Princess of Cond√©. After three months of happiness, Louis Alexandre, a jaded hedonist, soon tired of his young wife and resumed his life of d√©baucherie. He eloped with Mademoiselle de La Chassaigne, an opera dancer, five months into his marriage. At one point, Louis Alexandre even sold his wife's diamonds to raise money to pay his debts. Death After a dissipated short life, Louis Alexandre died on 6 May 1768, sixteen months after his marriage, of a venereal disease at the Ch√¢teau de Louveciennes in the arms of his ever dutiful wife. He died without any issue.Lenotre, G., Le Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet, six si√®cles d'histoire, Calman- L√©vy, Paris, 1930, reedited by Deno√´l, Paris, 1984, chapt.

In 1783, the duc de Penthi√®vre sold the domain of Rambouillet to his cousin, King Louis XVI. On November 25 of that year, in a long religious procession, Penthi√®vre transferred the nine caskets containing the remains of his parents, the comte and the comtesse de Toulouse, his wife, Maria Teresa d'Este, and six of their seven children, from the small medieval village church of Rambouillet, to the chapel of the Coll√©giale Saint-√âtienne in Dreux.G.

Born in Cork, Burns was introduced to hurling in his youth before later coming to prominence at underage levels with the St. Finbarr's club. An All- Ireland medal winner at senior level as captain, Burns also won three Munster medals and five championship medals. Burns made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty when he first linked up with the Cork under-21 team. An All-Ireland medal winner in this grade, he later made his senior debut during the 1974-75 league. Burns went on to play a key role for Cork in defence during a hugely successful era, and won three All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals, one National Hurling League medal plus Oireachtas and Wembley Tournament medals. Throughout his inter-county career Burns made 26 inter county appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1980 championship. Burns also had a distinguished inter- varsity hurling career, winning a Fitzgibbon medal and acting as selector with UCD in the 1970s. He later played with UCC. In retirement from playing Burns became involved in team management and coaching. He has served as manager of the Cork minor team on a number of occasions, guiding the team to All-Ireland success in 1998. On retirement from the Barrs he continued to play with Carraig na bhFear where he now lived. He coached Carraig to their first East Cork title in 2008. He also coached the local Rockb√°n camogie team to county titles on two occasions. In the 1980s Burns initiated a project to produce a 'Hurling Coaching Manual'. Those involved included Pat Daly, (Croke Park), Ned Power,( Waterford) and Brendan O' Sullivan (Kilkenny). The Manual and a follow up booklet were the coaching materials for the Croke Park coaching initiatives in the 1990s. Burns also served on the Croke Park 'Hurling Committee' for two terms in the 1990s. During their term the back door was introduced for beaten provincial finalists and work initiated on the standardisation of sliotars and blood substitutions. He also served on the ' Urban Development Committee', Croke Park Playing career =Club= Burns played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the club. In 1974 Burns was a key member of the starting fifteen as St. Finbarr's returned to the top table of Cork hurling once again. In spite of being regarded as underdogs in the championship decider against Blackrock, Con Roche gave a masterful display in helping \\"the Barr's\\" to a 2-17 to 2-14 victory. It was Burns's first championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents in the subsequent provincial decider. A low-scoring 0-7 to 0-3 victory gave Burns his first Munster medal, however, the game was tinged with sadness for St. Finbarr's as an horrific shin-bone injury brought Bernie Scully's career to an end. Burns was off the starting fifteen for the club's subsequent All-Ireland triumph having suffered a broken hand on Fitzgibbon duty with UCD. In 1977 a 1-17 to 1-5 trouncing of north side rivals gave Burns his second championship medal. He also captained the side. A comfortable 2-8 to 0-6 defeat of Sixmilebridge in a replay after a nerve-wracking draw, saw him win his second Munster medal. He later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Rathnure, the Wexford and Leinster champions, providing the opposition. The first-half was a disaster for St. Finbarr‚Äôs as a gale-force wind resulted in the Cork side trailing by 0-8 to 0-1. The second thirty minutes saw \\"the Barr‚Äôs\\" take control with Jimmy Barry-Murphy scoring the deciding goal. A 2-7 to 0-9 victory gave Burn his second All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. 1980 saw Burns add a third championship medal to his collection as Glen Rovers were accounted for on a 1-9 to 2-4 score line. He later picked up a third Munster medal as Roscrea fell narrowly by 2-12 to 1-14. A record- equaling third All-Ireland medal proved beyond St. Finbarr's who were beaten by Ballyhale Shamrocks in the decider. However the Barrs bounced back to win the County in 1981. A County championship final defeat of Blackrock in 1982 brought Burns's championship medal tally to five. He retired from senior club hurling following defeat to Patrickswell in the Munster Club Championship. Burns gave a man of the match performance in his final game for the Barrs and was recognised by the club with the award of Clubman of the Year for 1982. Burns was also a footballer of distinction. He played minor and under 21 football for Cork and captained the Barrs to victory in the inaugural Under 21 County title in 1973. He won two All Ireland Club football medals with the club. After 1982 Burns continued to hurl in the junior grade with Carraig na bhFear where he now lived, finishing his playing career as a goalkeeper in the 1990s. =Inter-county= Burns first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork under-21 team as an unused substitute in 1972. The following year he made his under-21 debut in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Waterford. Burns later won a Munster medal following a 4-11 to 2-7 defeat of Limerick in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Wexford. A 2-10 to 4-2 victory gave Burns an All-Ireland medal. Burns joined the Cork senior hurling team in 1975 and was an unused substitute for Cork's Munster final triumph over Limerick. He made his debut as a substitute in Cork's subsequent All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Galway. 1976 saw Burns win his first Munster medal as Limerick were beaten by 3-15 to 4-5. He was an unused substitute for Cork's subsequent All-Ireland victory over Wexford. After playing little part in the 1977 championship campaign, Burns was at right corner-back for the following year's provincial decider. A 0-13 to 0-11 defeat of Clare in a dour game gave Burns his second Munster medal on the field of play. He was a sub for the subsequent All-Ireland victory over Kilkenny. Two years later in 1980 Burns won a National Hurling League medal following a 4-15 to 4-6 defeat of Limerick in a replay of the decider. He was an unused substitute for the subsequent championship and retired from inter-county hurling at the end of the season. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Burns remained involved in the game of hurling. He was the coach of the Cork minor hurling team in 1998 and guided the team to both Munster and All-Ireland honours in his first year in charge.

(1802) is a collection of nine observational letters written by American writer Washington Irving under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. The letters first appeared in the November 15, 1802, edition of the New York Morning Chronicle, a political-leaning newspaper partially owned by New Yorker Aaron Burr, and edited by Irving's brother, Peter. The letters were printed at irregular intervals until April 23, 1803. The letters lampoon marriage, manners, dress, and culture of early 19th century New York City. They are Irving's d√©but in print. Letters to the Morning Chronicle =Letters 1 and 2: Marriage and manners= Irving's first Oldstyle letter appeared in the November 15, 1802, edition of the Morning Chronicle. In his first letter, Irving mocked the current trends in dress and fashion, training most of his criticism on young men and their \\"most studied carelessness, and almost slovenliness of dress,\\" who are more interested in themselves than in the unfortunate \\"belle who has to undergo the fatigue of dragging along this sluggish animal.\\"Irving, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 3-4 The signature in all capital letters at the end of the piece was not Irving's own, but rather the first of many pseudonyms Irving would adopt throughout his literary life, Jonathan Oldstyle.Ibid. A second letter followed on November 20, this time poking fun at the \\"strange and preposterous ‚Ä¶ manner in which modern marriages are conducted.\\"Ibid, 5-7. Describing the marriage between Oldstyle's aunt Barbara and an ironically-named Squire Stylish, Irving juxtaposed modern manners against old etiquette, concluding that no one could read such a comparison of old versus new, \\"and not lament, with me, the degeneracy of the present times ‚Äî what husband is there but will look back with regret, to the happy days of female subjugation[?]\\"Ibid. =Letters 6, 7 and 8: Theatrical controversy= Oldstyle's commentary on the theater riled some in the New York theater district, but when Irving trained Oldstyle's fire on local critics ‚Äî specifically William Coleman at the Evening Post and James Cheetham at the American Citizen ‚Äî tempers finally flared.Jones, 21-22 The ruckus began with Irving's January 17, 1803, letter, his sixth, in which \\"Quoz\\", a new character introduced by Irving as a friend of Oldstyle's, took a backhanded shot at critics for taking all the fun out of the theater: \\"The critics, my dear Jonathan, are the very pests of society ‚Ä¶ they reduce our feelings to a state of miserable refinement, and destroy entirely all the enjoyments in which our coarser sensations delighted.\\"Irving, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 20 Five days later, in his seventh letter, Irving had Oldstyle complain about the play \\"The Wheel of Truth,\\" knowing it would provoke a response from Coleman and Cheetham, who had been feuding publicly about the authorship of the play.Explanatory Notes, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 47 Irving's letter had the desired effect, as Cheetham and Coleman elevated their attacks on the play's author, its actors, and each other.Ibid Delighted with the reaction, Irving responded in mock innocence on February 8 that he was \\"perfectly at a loss\\" as to what all the fuss was about, and couldn't resist giving Oldstyle the last word, concluding that all the bickering had \\"awakened doubt in my mind respecting the sincerity and justice of the Critics.\\"Irving, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 27-31 =Letter 9: Dueling= Irving's final letter appeared two months later, the gap between appearances likely an indication of Irving's growing lack of interest in the exercise.Jones, 22 In his letter of April 23, 1803, Irving ‚Äî writing again as Quoz ‚Äî discussed the practice of dueling, which had recently been formally outlawed in New York. Declaring the practice of dueling with pistols \\"unceremonious,\\" Quoz recommends instead that duelists draw lots to see who gets to have a brick dropped on his head from a window. \\"If he survives, well and good\\", Quoz says, \\"if he falls, why nobody is to blame, it was purely accidental.\\"Irving, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 34 Quoz even suggests that dueling be licensed by \\"the Blood and Thunder office\\" of the state as an official event, where the public can watch, as \\"this would be a valuable addition to the list of our refined amusements.\\"Ibid, 35 Public reaction The Oldstyle letters were well received in New York‚Äîand despite the use of the pseudonym, Irving's identity as Oldstyle was not a secret.Jones, 20 The public enjoyed them, and Chronicle co-publisher Aaron Burr was impressed enough to send copies of the first five letters to his daughter Theodosia, remarking that they \\"would not, perhaps, merit so high an honour as that of being perused by your eyes and touched by your fair hands, but that [they are] the production of a youth of about nineteen, the youngest brother of Dr. Peter Irving of New York.\\"Memoirs of Aaron Burr, with Miscellaneous Selections of His Correspondence, ed M.L. Davis (New York, 1837); cited in Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 40n5 Irving also had an admirer in Charles Brockden Brown, who unsuccessfully tried to track down Oldstyle to ask his assistance with The Literary Magazine, and American Register that Brown would shortly be editing in Philadelphia.Jones, 21 William Dunlap, manager of New York's Park Theater, also thought highly of Oldstyle, later calling Irving's letters \\"pleasant effusions,\\" but noted politely at the time that the irritation Oldstyle was provoking in his actors was \\"excessive\\". Even William Coleman at the competing Evening Post thought Irving, for all his Oldstyle bluster, had talent as a critic.Historical Note, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 41 Publishing history While Oldstyle marks Irving's first foray into print, Irving would always look back on the nine letters as \\"crude and boyish.\\"Pierre M. Irving, Life and Letters of Washington Irving, I,48 To Irving's embarrassment, several letters were reprinted in pamphlet form in New York and London in 1824 following the success of The Sketch Book.Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, Gent. By the Author of The Sketch Book. With a Biographical Notice. New York and London, 1824,)Washington Irving and the House of Murray, ed. Ben Harris McClary, (Knoxville, Tenn., 1969), 53 Irving would not include any of the Oldstyle letters in the Author's Revised Edition he put together for publisher George Putnam in the 1850s. The first five letters finally appeared in Putnam's 1866 edition of Spanish Papers and Other Miscellanies, and were reprinted regularly up to the end of the nineteenth century. All nine letters were eventually included in the sixth volume of the 30-volume The Complete Works of Washington Irving, collecting Irving's works, letters, and papers. The Oldstyle letters reprinted in the Library of America edition of Irving's works are based on that text.Textual Commentary, Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, 50-55 Literary tradition Observational letters, like Irving's Oldstyle letters, are a tradition that date in America as far back as the 1720s, when Benjamin Franklin wrote similar letters to the New-England Courant under the name of Silence Dogood. Franklin had borrowed the form from Joseph Addison, who Franklin admired, and who was known for the gentlemanly \\"Mr. Spectator\\" essays he wrote in the Guardian, Tatler and The Spectator in London in the early eighteenth century. Such essays had been a staple of colonial newspapers, and usually featured an observer ‚Äì- normally a bachelor, with a personality that differed from that of the writer ‚Äì- who commented, either directly or indirectly, on public truths.

Production The documentary was conceived by Kerri Gawryn as a graduate thesis project at San Francisco State University, as a collaborative project that would not employ traditional techniques. Rather than simply filming her subjects, she wished them to actively share in the process. Preparing in 2005, Gawryn worked with a mentor whose own studies centered on homelessness and conducted interviews and research. This led to Gawryn's creating the 'Exposing Homelessness Project' as a photography workshop, an art show and finally, the 20-minute documentary. The film documents the processes of M. Meissen, Br√©yon Austin, and Liz Olsen, three formerly homeless women who took part in the photography workshop. The three had been given 35mm cameras and instructed in the art of black-and-white photography. They were then instructed to draw upon their lives and personal experiences and use photography to share insights into homelessness. Reception Reviewer Stephanie Wright Hession of San Francisco Chronicle made positive note of the photographic work when she wrote that Meissen's photography was magical, Austin's was poignant, and Olsen's was haunting.

It was originally published in French in the year 1983 and in English, by Cinebook in 2016. The comic is an adaptation of the 1971 film Daisy Town.  Summary  A young town in the Far West, Daisy Town, attracts many criminals who spread fear and chaos in its streets. Barely arrived in town, and preceded by his reputation, Lucky Luke agrees to take on the role of sheriff in order to combat the crime. Shortly after having fulfilled this task with flying colors, the Dalton brothers arrive and decide to make this city their own, and for that they would resort to numerous ploys essentially aimed at terrorizing the population. They are however systematically defeated by Luke, who ends up driving them out of the city, covered in tar and feathers. It is then that the Daltons are captured by the Indians. Seizing the opportunity, Joe Dalton then tries to inspire the Indian chief's hatred of Daisy Town, so that he digs up the hatchet. The Indians therefore decide to go into battle against the city, while keeping the Daltons prisoners. Lucky Luke decides to take matters into his own hands to defend Daisy Town, and the intervention of the cavalry (just in time) makes it possible to stop the fight and make the Indians flee. The story ends with the discovery of gold in the mountains; gold towards which all the inhabitants rush, making Daisy Town a ghost town.  Characters  * The Daltons: Joe, William, Jack and Averell. They try to have an important position to direct the city, but are chased out by Lucky Luke. To take revenge, they go to the Indians so that there is a war between them and the inhabitants of Daisy Town. * Indians: Start a war against the \\"pale faces\\". * The mayor: Convinces Lucky Luke to stay in his city to keep order. * Bones: The undertaker, always happy with the disputes that brought him his \\"clientele\\".  Notes  In one panel at the beginning of the album, an error appears in the drawing. Lucky Luke's revolver is no longer in his belt, but he also does not have it in hand. Panel 23B nods to the album Ghost Town through the teacher from Daisy Town who stops in the middle of a triangle to rush to dig for gold. The Gold Hill school in Plate 17A of Ghost Town presents the same design after it was abandoned for the same reasons. The title of the lesson \\"The triangle\\" is however inscribed there.

He was born in Sangi, a small village in Mehar Taluka, then part of Dadu District. Life Abro studied in a number of schools in Larkana and Hyderabad. He passed his matriculation from Bombay University in 1941 and later, became a student at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh, Gujarat. In 1944 he went to Bengal and worked as a volunteer at relief camps for famine affected areas. He also worked as an activist with the Khaksar Movement. He took a degree in law in 1948 from Shahani Law College in Larkana and started working as a lawyer. Abro entered public service in 1952 and was posted as sub-judge in a number of places in Sindh. In the latter part of his career, he served as a judge in the labor court and as secretary to the Provincial Assembly of Sindh. He remained active on the literary front with the Sindhi Adabi Sangat (the organization of Sindhi writers with members all over Sindh). Work Abro's first short story was published in the year 1949 and was followed by a some others. Pishu Pasha aroused much debate and discussion, and this was the name given to the collection of nearly a dozen short-stories published in 1959. This nearly brought to a close Jamal Abro's work as a short story writer and was followed by a long gap of silence. An invitation to contribute a story for a university magazine being edited by Shaikh Ayaz, (the leading Sindhi poet who was a close friend) led him to write his first story in fifteen years. This story focused on karokari (the ritual murder of a woman accused of immorality), written as only the author of \\"Pirani\\" could have.

Conceptually, the West Bridge parallels and complements the decentralization represented by the North Bridge and the South Bridge. Most notably, it has been used by Research in Motion to permit extremely high data transfer rates in its BlackBerry devices.EETimes - Under the Hood: Blackberry Wins Handset Data-Rate Bakeoff Overview While the North Bridge focuses on memory control and the South Bridge focuses on \\"slower\\" capabilities of the motherboard, the West Bridge focuses on peripheral control. The new architectural modularization opens the potential for increased system performance. Being directly connected, peripheral control can be handled wholly and independently through a West Bridge's controller, leaving a processor offloaded and free to focus on other data intensive operations. Not only in increasing performance of the system via the processor, a West Bridge companion chip may itself serve directly as a peripheral accelerator. Etymology The term West Bridge was first introduced by Cypress Semiconductor, which designs products to provide optimal performance and connectivity in the embedded world. The name was chosen deliberately to be a meme consistent with the North Bridge and South Bridge concepts. \\"West Bridge\\" refers both to the architectural scheme in general and to the product family with which it was introduced, by Cypress. File:WestBridgeLogo.png  Interface Support  Interfaces change all the time towards faster, lower power, fewer pins, and newer standards, making it a difficult task for processors to follow and integrate them. A prime function of West Bridge devices is to enable connection to these varied interfaces. An example of such an interface is NAND Flash, which keeps evolving with new generations of Multi-Level Cell NAND. A West Bridge device might handle the MLC NAND management and enable lowest-cost memory support for a main processor, which otherwise would only support NOR or Single-Level Cell NAND. Some commonly supported interfaces of West Bridge companion chips are: * Mass storage  GPIO  MMC+  SD v1.1  SD v2.0  SDIO  CE-ATA  MLC NAND  SLC NAND  Full NAND Management * Processor  SRAM  SPI  ADMUX  NAND  NOR * USB  USB 2.0 at 480 Mbit/s  Applications  The West Bridge architecture is relevant to a broad range of applications. Common applications include: * Handsets * Portable Media Players * Personal Digital Assistants * Portable Navigation Devices * Digital Cameras * Printers * Point-of-sale terminals * Set-Top Boxes * Security Dongles  References   External links  * Embedded.com - West Bridge-arrive at improved high-speed USB in multimedia handset design * EdaGeek.com - Cypress West Bridge Antioch Controller Ranks First in Benchmarks Category:Motherboard Category:Computer peripherals Category:Embedded systems ","title":"West Bridge"},{"id":"16713352","text":"Chorley Old Hall is a moated manor house on the B5359 road to the southwest of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, England. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and the moated site is a scheduled monument. It is the oldest inhabited country house in Cheshire and consists of two ranges, one medieval (built around 1330) and the other Elizabethan (built in the mid-16th century). History The original part of the house was built around 1330 by Robert de Chorley. By 1523 the house was owned by the Davenport family and during the middle of the 16th century they constructed a half-timbered house adjoining the existing building's north-western corner. In the early 17th century the house was owned by the Stanley family who carried out alterations around 1640 and built a bridge across the moat. The two houses were joined by a brick link in the late 18th or the early 19th century. In 1915 the house was fully restored and further renovations were carried out in 1975. Architecture The house is L-shaped with a south and west ranges. The south range is the oldest part, which is built in buff sandstone rubble with some later ashlar and brick. It has a Kerridge stone-slate roof and a stone chimney. The range is in two storeys and has three bays, each with a gable. In the upper storey of each bay is a five-light window, in the lower storey of the left bay is a four-light window and in the lower storey of the right bay is a six-light window. All these windows are stone and are mullioned and transomed. In the middle bay is an arched doorway. The timberwork in each gable is different; in the left bay it is heavy with close studding and a middle rail, in the middle bay the timberwork is light, and in the right bay it is herringbone. The west range is timber-framed on a stone plinth with a Kerridge stone-slate roof, a stone ridge and a massive lateral stone chimney. It has two storeys and two bays with a central gable. In the left bay is a five-light window in each storey and the right bay has a four-light window in the upper storey with a door in the lower storey. All these windows are wooden, mullioned and transomed. The timber decoration consists of chevrons on the ground floor, and roundels and cross motifs above. External features The house is surrounded by a moat which widens at the northeast corner where there are two ornamental islands. South of the moat are fishponds. The bridge over the moat, and the gate piers and wing walls to the bridge are both listed Grade II.

This typical action does not mean the holdovers from the Spitzer administration will be replaced, and Paterson said that \\"having the letters gives him the flexibility to make changes if he decides to\\". Paterson is responsible for appointing his Executive Chamber. These appointments do not require the confirmation of the New York State Senate. Most political advisors report to the Secretary to the Governor, while most policy advisors report to the Director of State Operations, who also answers to the Secretary to the Governor, making that position, in practice, the true Chief of Staff and most powerful position in the Cabinet. . In the Executive Chamber of Eliot Spitzer, the literal Chief of Staff was in charge of the Office of Scheduling and held no authority over other cabinet officials. Paterson has thus far taken a different approach, appointing Jon R. Cohen as titular Chief of Staff, although his function will be as a policy advisor. The governor is also charged with naming the heads of the various departments, divisions, boards, and offices within the state government. These nominees require confirmation by the state Senate. While some appointees may share the title of commissioner, director, etc., only department-level heads are considered members of the actual state cabinet, although the heads of the various divisions, boards, and offices may attend cabinet level meetings from time to time.

The museum was in a renovated historic building, which is also the location of the Miotte Foundation, which was committed to archiving and protecting the works of Jean Miotte and providing new scholarship and research on L'Art Informel. Miotte's collected works are conserved as a legacy for New York, where he has kept a studio in SoHo since 1978. Rotating selections of Miotte's work are shown at the museum on a regular basis, as are selections from the museum permanent collection, which contains 500 works, including paintings, etchings, sculpture, ceramics, tapestries, and works on paper, primarily focusing on L'Art Informel and Abstract Expressionist artists from Europe and the United States, including Pol Bury, Mimmo Rotella, and Jean-Paul Riopelle. The museum focused on 20th and 21st Century including artists who have been exposed more in their home countries than the United States. It was committed to an exploration of \\"art within a context,\\" offering a program of exhibitions inspired by current social, political, and cultural events. \\"Insight\\" was a series of small exhibitions and creative projects showcasing new talent by providing a forum for emerging artists. \\"The Project Room for New Media\\" was an incubator of new ideas, showcasing groundbreaking concepts in all art mediums and emphasizing the intersection of the arts through technology.

All public programs take place within the exhibition galleries. The museum offers docent-led exhibition tours, and the CAM Store offers publications including rare art books, periodicals on contemporary art, exhibition catalogs, and limited editions. It also features artist multiples and a selection of gifts. The museum and shop closed by December 31, 2011. The closing followed lengthy financial difficulties which eventually led to the sale of the building. A search is underway for a new home for the museum and Miotte Foundation, preferably in Manhattan, but a new European location is possible. The building is currently occupied by Hewlett-Packard.

Vaults. The Assumption of the Virgin Cathedral (Spanish: ) is a Renaissance-style, Roman Catholic cathedral located in Santa Mar√≠a Square, opposite the Town Hall and the Episcopal Palace, in the center of Ja√©n, region of Andalusia, Spain. The current cathedral was conceived in the 16th century to replace the previous 15th century Gothic temple. Construction lasted for several centuries, despite the original idea was kept. The capitular room and the sacristy stand out, which are the masterpiece of Andr√©s de Vandelvira, and one of the most important works of the Spanish Renaissance. Also outstanding is its main facade, one of the main works of the Spanish Baroque, built after the consecration of the temple in 1660 based on the design of Eufrasio L√≥pez de Rojas. Likewise, the neoclassical choir stands out due to its beauty and the large number of seats that make it one of the largest in Spain. Once the building works were completed, they continued in the following centuries, mainly in the interior decoration and the chapels. Furthermore, as a consequence of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, consolidation works were necessary on the north facade, as well as the construction of the Sagrario church. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary since the consecration, in 1246, of the old Mosque of the Muslim city, after its conquest by the holy king Ferdinand III of Castile. Inside it, among other works of art and religious objects, the relic of the Holy Face or La Ver√≥nica , specifically the true face of Jesus Christ, which could be captured on the canvas in which Saint Veronica dried her face during his passion. It‚Äôs kept in the Main Chapel, and a public veneration of the faithful is exposed every Friday. In 2008, the procedure for the cathedral of Ja√©n to be declared World Heritage Site, considering that it served as a model for the construction of other cathedrals in Spain and the Americas. On January 27, 2012 the ¬´Ja√©n Cathedral (extension of the Renaissance monumental complex of √öbeda and Baeza)¬ª was inscribed on the Spanish Indicative List of World Heritage Site, in the category of cultural property (No. ref 5667). History The cathedral stands on a site once occupied by a mosque. Construction began in 1249 atop the ruins of the mosque. The church was damaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions during the following two centuries until the sixteenth century, when several architects, Andr√©s de Vandelvira being the most important one, built the biggest part of the cathedral. It was consecrated in 1724. Statue of Andr√©s de Vandelvira next to Ja√©n Cathedral. The more distinctive architectural element is its fa√ßade, designed by Eufrasio L√≥pez de Rojas and sculpted by Pedro Rold√°n. The cathedral houses, with other artworks, a depiction of the Veil of Veronica. Around 1545 the young Francisco Guerrero was the maestro de capilla. This cathedral is on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Church of the Sagrario  Main facade of the Church of the Sagrario. The Church of the Sagrario (Spanish: ) is a building attached to the north facade of the Cathedral, made due to the unevenness and damage caused by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. The project for this work was designed by the Madrid architect Ventura Rodr√≠guez in 1764, although it was executed by his nephew Manuel Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez. It was inaugurated in 1801 and was consecrated on March 22 of that year.

Early life Eames was the youngest daughter of Lorenzo and Katie Bridenstine, who had four more children. She grew up in Hoisington, Kansas. As a child she would be in every play she could. Her mother, who gave poetry readings, painted china and theorems, insisted that each of her children learn a musical instrument. Kathryn learned how to play the violin, something which she'd keep doing, with the violin she was given as a child by her father, until she was very old. As a young bride she had an automobile accident, recuperating from which gave her some extra time to enroll in classes at the University of Arizona where she chose drama, thinking she might enjoy writing a play someday. Instead, she moved quickly into acting. In 1940, she won the National Collegiate Players Award for her portrayal of Lillom in The Typewriter. The award included a chance to train in White Plains, New York with Madam Tamara Daykarhanova and Michael Chekhov who gave her a scholarship to continue study in the fall. Acting career Kathryn chose her mother's maiden name for her stage name, packed her bags, and left home to pursue her acting career. Her first professional appearance was in the Broadway production of Winged Victory. For over 50 years, she appeared on Broadway, Off Broadway, on radio, television and film. She worked in regional theatre, stock packages, dinner theatre and industrial shows. She had a role in Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre. Her last work in Broadway and theatre was in 1992, in Democracy and Esther at the Triangle Theater. She continued to act in commercials and plays such as The Last Resort well into her 80s. Kathryn toured in The Cat and the Canary, Anniversary Waltz, Marat/Sade, and Morning's at Seven which played in Stephens Auditorium at Iowa State University. She was a guest artist in various university productions including Henry IV (parts 1 and 2), Le Roi se meurt, and Ah! Wilderness. She was able to work with quite a few notable actors during her career. Eames often worked with Groucho Marx, who would always ask her to play opposite him whenever he performed in Time for Elizabeth. She played with Shirley Booth in The Torchbearers, with George Montgomery in Toys in the Attic and with Rita Moreno in I Am a Camera. She was also featured with Kaye Ballard, Eddie Bracken, Tom Ewell, Virginia Mayo, Ian Keith, Robert Alda and Gloria DeHaven. =Later life= Kathryn returned to Iowa State University, where a theatre scholarship would be established in her name, in 1992 as artist in residence. There she taught students how to deal with things such as auditions and working in television. Death Kathryn died at age 96 on December 12, 2004 in a nursing home in Joplin, Missouri. She was cremated and her ashes were placed with her brother's in Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Personal life She was a member of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Her residence was an apartment in New York City she acquired in the 1940s. Despite the fact that she did not have many major roles, she could support herself almost entirely through acting because of her unusual versatility and willingness to explore new avenues for performance as well as the discipline and energy she gave to her work. Age wasn't something which could refrain Kathryn from doing certain activities. In her 60s, she enrolled in tap dancing lessons and in her 70s, she took French lessons.

He made two appearances for England in 1880, scoring once. Career Brindle was born in Darwen, Lancashire and played junior football in the local area before signing with his local club, who were then one of the major forces in the game. He helped them to win the Lancashire Cup in its inaugural season of 1879-80 defeating Blackburn Rovers 3‚Äì0 in the final. In March 1880 he became the first Darwen F.C. player to represent England. Having successfully negotiated his way through a North v South trial match at the Oval on 6 March, he made his debut in a friendly game against Scotland, played at Hampden Park, Glasgow on 13 March 1880. The match ended in a 5‚Äì4 victory for the Scots (the most goals England have ever scored in a game and lost).Scotland 5 England 4, 13 March 1880 (Match summary) Two of England's goals came from Charlie Bambridge, whereas Scotland's scorers included a hat-trick from George Ker. Two days later, he played his second (and last) England match, when they met Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham. Six players made their England debut in this match which England won 3‚Äì2 with two goals scored by Francis Sparks of Clapham Rovers. Brindle scored the opening goal in the 50th minute, but had to leave the game 15 minutes later due to injury, and England played on with ten men.Wales 2 England 3, 15 March 1880 (Match summary) He was the first full- back to score a goal for England from open play, which caused a small sensation at the time, as defenders rarely ventured into the opponents' half of the field. Doubt has been cast on the attribution of the goal to Brindle; a Welsh newspaper report of the time claims that this was an own goal by goalkeeper, Harry Hibbott. In 1881, he was a member of the Darwen team which reached the FA Cup semi-finals, when they were beaten 4‚Äì1 by the eventual winners the Old Carthusians. In the book \\"An English football Internationals Who's Who\\" written by Douglas Lamming, he describes the Darwen left full-back as: \\"a powerful strong kicking back and a real workhorse\\".Quoted at www.darwenfc.com During the mid-1880s, he left Darwen and moved to Blackburn Olympic.

Nature is well preserved in and around Drumsha, mainly due to the lesser impact of humans. However, the village - and the region as a whole - suffer from a lack of water. Soil is generally very dry and not fertile.

Caillois interprets many social structures as elaborate forms of games and much behaviour as a form of play. Caillois builds critically on the theories of Johan Huizinga, adding a more comprehensive review of play forms. Caillois disputes Huizinga's emphasis on competition in play. He also notes the considerable difficulty in defining play, concluding that play is best described by six core characteristics: * It is free, or not obligatory. * It is separate (from the routine of life), occupying its own time and space. * It is uncertain, so that the results of play cannot be pre-determined and so that the player's initiative is involved. * It is unproductive in that it creates no wealth and ends as it begins. * It is governed by rules that suspend ordinary laws and behaviours and that must be followed by players. * It involves make-believe that confirms for players the existence of imagined realities that may be set against 'real life'. This 'escapist' definition has been criticized, for example in Sutton-Smith's (1997) review of play the idea that individuals in a leisure-based Western culture are 'free' to play is questioned in light of an apparent obligation to spend leisure time 'wisely'. Similarly, we might consider that play forms are subject to considerable social pressures and we might note the economic significance of leisure and media as forms of play. The result is that despite Caillois' attempt at a thorough review, definitions of play remain open to negotiation. Caillois argues that we can understand the complexity of games by referring to four play forms and two types of play (ludus and paidia): * Agon, or competition. E.g. Chess is an almost purely agonistic game. * Alea, or chance. E.g. Playing a slot machine is an almost purely aleatory game. * Mimicry, or mimesis, or role playing. * Ilinx (Greek for \\"whirlpool\\"), or vertigo, in the sense of altering perception, dizziness, disorder, or loss-of-control. E.g. taking hallucinogens, riding roller coasters, children spinning until they fall down. Games and play combine these elements in various ways. Examples: * Poker features both alea, the random shuffling of cards, and agon, the strategic decisions of discarding cards and betting. * Collectible card games combine alea (the random shuffling of decks and the distribution of cards in booster packs), agon (competition with rules and strategies) and mimesis (cards refer to imaginary beings the player controls in a fictional world). * Dancing is an ilinx activity, which can be combined with mimesis to portray characters, or with agon in competitive dance. * Spectator sports combine the agon of the players with mimesis on the part of the spectators, who self-insert and identify with certain players on the field. Caillois also places forms of play on a continuum from ludus, structured activities with explicit rules (games), to paidia, unstructured and spontaneous activities (playfulness), although in human affairs the tendency is always to turn paidia into ludus, and that established rules are also subject to the pressures of paidia. It is this process of rule-forming and re-forming that may be used to account for the apparent instability of cultures. Caillois also emphasizes that paidia and alea cannot coexist, as games of chance are inherently games of restraint and waiting for an external event. Likewise, ludus and ilinx are incompatible, as there are no structured rules in the state of disorientation. Any rules applied are solely to put a brake on the ilinx so as not to turn it into panic. Like Huizinga, Caillois sees a tendency for a corruption of the values of play in modern society as well as for play to be institutionalised in the structures of society. For example agon is seen as a cultural form in sports, in an institutional form as economic competition and as a corruption in violence and trickery; Alea is seen as a cultural form in lotteries and casinos, as an institutional form in the stock market and as a corruption in superstition and astrology; mimicry is seen as cultural form in carnivals and theatre, as institutional form in uniforms and ceremonies and as corruption in forms of alienation; and ilinx is seen as cultural form in climbing and skiing, as institutional form in professionals requiring control of vertigo and as corruption in drugs and alcoholism.

The test enables the assessment of a broad range of academics skills or only a particular area of need. The WIAT-II is a revision of the original WIAT (The Psychological Corporation), and additional measures. There are four basic scales: Reading, Math, Writing, and Oral Language. Within these scales there is a total of 9 sub-test scores. History The first WIAT was published in 1992 and was standardised in the UK and published as the WORD, WOND and WOLD. It was revised in 2001 with the UK version following in 2005. Each revision has brought with it several updates and changes. The WIAT-II contains the basic contacademically. There are a small number of differences between the versions of the subtests in the UK and US. These include changes to picture items, the replacing of Americanisms and simple spelling differences. The WIAT-III US edition was published in 2009 for use with those aged 4 through to 50 years 11 months. It includes 16 subtests divided between Oral Reading, Math Fluency and Early Reading Skills. Test Format Reading * Word Reading: assesses pre-reading (phonological awareness) and decoding skills (naming letters, phonological skills [working with sounds in words], reading words from lists). * Reading Comprehension: assesses types of reading comprehension skills taught in the classroom or used in everyday life (matching words to pictures, reading sentences aloud, orally answering oral questions about reading passages, silent reading speed). * Pseudoword (phonetic) Decoding: assesses the ability to apply phonetic decoding skills. (Reading nonsense words aloud from a list [phonetic word attack]). Math * Numerical Operations: evaluates the ability to identify and write numbers ( e.g. counting, and solving paper & pencil computations). * Math Reasoning: assess the ability to reason mathematically ( e.g. counting, identifying shapes, and solving verbally framed \\"word problems\\" [presented both orally and either written or in illustration]). Written Language * Spelling: evaluates the ability to spell (written spelling of dictated letters, sounds and words that are read in sentences). * Written Expression: assesses the writing process (writing letters and words as quickly as possible, writing sentences, and writing a paragraph or essay). Oral Language * Listening Comprehension: measures the ability to listen for details (multiple-choice matching of pictures to spoken words). * Oral Expression: assesses general ability to use oral language effectively (repeating sentences, generating lists, describing scenes and pictured activities). The WIAT-III US consists of 16 subtests including several not featured in the second edition: Oral Reading Fluency, Math Problem Solving, Math Fluency Addition /Subtraction /Multiplication, Early Reading Skills, Alphabet Writing Fluency, Sentence Composition and Essay Composition. The test takes 45‚Äì90 minutes to administer depending on the age of the participant. The mean score for the WIAT-II is 100 with a standard deviation of 15, and the scores on the test may range from 40 to 160. 68% of participants in the UK standardisation sample obtained scores of 85-115 and 95% obtained scores of 70-130. Psychometric Properties * Internal consistency ranges from 0.80-0.98. * Test-retest reliability ranges from 0.85-0.98. WIAT‚ÄìII has been empirically linked with the WISC‚ÄìIV, the WPPSI‚ÄìIII, and the WAIS‚ÄìIII. These relationships provide valid discrepancy scores to allow comparisons between achievement and ability. The WIAT-II UK was standardised between 2003-2004 as part of the WISC-IV standardisation with 892 individuals aged 4‚Äì16 years 11 months (US norms are available up to age 85). The UK project was conducted at City University by Professor John Rust and Professor Susan Golombok. The WAIT-II standardisation also includes several special group studies including those with learning difficulties, ADHD, emotional disturbance, hearing impairments, speech and language impairments and those who are classed as gifted. The WIAT- III US was standardised on 3,000 students and adults aged 4‚Äì19:11. Linking studies were carried out with the WAIS-IV, WISC-IV, WPPSI-III, WNV, and DAS-II with correlations ranging from .60-.82. Special group studies include those with learning difficulties in reading, writing and math, expressive language disorder and mild intellectual difficulties. Uses The WIAT-II is suitable for use in clinical, educational and research settings. It can be used to identify the academic strengths and weaknesses individuals possess as well as inform and aid intervention planning. An individually administered achievement test such as the WIAT-II can be used in a variety of settings where there is concern over educational progress. The WIAT-II can provide meaningful information to assist with diagnostic, eligibility, placement, and intervention decisions. Best practice suggests the results obtained from the WIAT-II should be interpreted in combination with the evaluation and review of the individual‚Äôs background, personality, current emotional functioning, and attention and motivation levels. Like all assessment instruments, the WIAT-II has certain limitations. Academic achievement can be conceptualised and assessed in many different ways. As a result, it is impossible to develop an instrument that assesses all components of achievement within the constraints of a typical standardised assessment situation. The WIAT-II measures aspects of the learning process that take place in the traditional academic setting in the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, and oral language. Although the WIAT-II item content encompasses a wide range of skills and concepts, it was not designed as a measure of academic giftedness in older adolescents or adults. Translations There have been several adaptations of the WIAT-II for use with; Australian, New Zealand, Canadian and French Canadian populations.

The station started broadcasting in 1983 as the first American Indian-owned radio station in the United States. Owned and operated by Lakota Communications, KILI serves 30,000 people on the three reservations, along with the large American Indian urban community in Rapid City, using a translator in the Mount Rushmore State's second-largest city. It seeks to preserve Native American culture and instill pride in the peoples' unique heritage. History The station was founded in 1983 by members of the American Indian Movement, \\"the very first Indian-controlled, Indian-owned and Indian-run radio station in the U.S.,\\" said activist Russell Means in 2006. In mid-2006, the station was off the air for several weeks when its transmitter was hit by lightning on April 15, sustaining more than $200,000 in damage. As a non-profit endeavor, KILI is supported by public grants and tribal government funding. It is governed by a board of directors composed of community leaders, such as Nellie Two Bulls. Known as \\"Grandma Nellie\\", she was active at the local and national level as a strong proponent of the Lakota culture, beloved as a storyteller and singer prior to her death on February 18, 2007 at age 81. On December 29, 2008; KILI announced on its website that the station will be powered by a wind turbine. Programming KILI broadcasts 22 hours daily in the Lakota language, as well as in English, from its studios on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Programs include: Morning Wakalyapi Show, an all-Lakota-language show by Francis Thunder Hawk, News of the Lakota Nation, live American Indian music performances in the evening, and frequent public service announcements. One of its popular programs is the Blues Disc Jockey, hosted by Bryant High Horse on Sunday mornings. A Rapid City middle school teacher and guidance counselor during the week, he mixes blues tunes with humor on the air. High Horse, whose Lakota name is \\"Oyate Nawicajin\\" (meaning \\"Stand for his People\\"), is one of a group striving to preserve the Lakota language so that Lakota youth may speak and write their native language fluently.

Background The Maryland General Assembly has charged the commission to \\"adopt existing sentencing guidelines for sentencing within the limits established by law which shall be considered by the sentencing court in determining the appropriate sentence for defendants who plead guilty or nolo contendere to, or who were found guilty of crimes in a circuit court.\\" The commission was after several studies over a period of time showed the defendants in some of the state's less populated areas got harsher sentences than those in the rest of the state. There was also some concern over racial disparities in sentencing in criminal cases. The MSCCSP can set guidelines that are advisory, Maryland judges are not required to adhere to the guidelines; judges in the federal system generally are. The MSCCSP was established in 1999, it collects sentencing guidelines worksheets and automates the information; monitors sentencing practices, including judicial compliance with the guidelines; and, as necessary, adopts changes to the guidelines. The Commission integrates correctional options into the guidelines and establishes criteria for determining which defendants should be eligible for correctional options. Commission members *Howard S.

Portland: Timber Press. / Description The trunks are small, very spiny, and high climbing, becoming bare with age. All species form dense clusters with undivided or bifid juvenile leaves which become pinnate in maturity, with leaf sheath spines, leaflet cirri, and spiny petioles, all adapted for climbing. The leaflets are few to many, with one, two, or more folds, entire, acute, linear or sigmoid, and regularly arranged along the rachis. As hapaxanths, the inflorescence emerges at the top of the stem, amongst reduced leaves, with male and female flowers, on a once-branched spike.

The industrial park, planned and funded the year before, was built coincidental to expansion of the nearby Cargill Malt plant and construction of the power/steam plant was predicated on a co-located ethanol plant. After construction was completed in 2011, the power plant was idled due to the recession, and need for a second steam partner (Cargill Malt being the first), after plans for the original ethanol plant fell through. In 2013, Great River Energy began construction on its own co-located ethanol plant, which would utilize the extra steam capacity of the power plant. The economic upturn and the promise of a second end-user for waste steam prompted the power plant to begin commercial operations in 2012. Construction of the ethanol plant was finished in July, 2015. The construction of the ethanol plant was financed, in part, with a $75,000,000 EB-5 investment, managed by CMB Regional Centers. The ethanol plant began production in June, 2015, and produced 65 million gallons of ethanol in its first year.

He wae an elite actor of the Royal Dramatic Theatre and belonged to the pioneer generation of actors there. Life Samuel Ahlgren was born to the clerk Lars Ahlgren and Elisabet Fredrika Fredriksson and married Albertina Griberg in 1793. He initially worked as a clerk. =Career= He was engaged by Fredric Ristell in the newly founded Swedish language Ristell theatre in Bollhuset in 1787. Samuel Ahlgren was described as a beauty with a pure and clear voice, was recommended for his clear pronunciation and for his posture and played both hero and villain, though he was criticized for overacting because of his hot temperament. Because of his good looks, he was often given the parts of lover. His most acclaimed part was Axel Oxenstierna in Drottning Kristina by Gustav III of Sweden (1790). Among his other parts was Soliman in Soliman II eller de tre sultaninnorna by Martin Krause in the 1789‚Äì90 season, Appius in Virginia by Paykull and Johan Gyllenstjerna in Siri Brahe och Johan Gyllenstierna by Gustav III of Sweden the 1790‚Äì91 season. When the theatre of Ristell went bankrupt in 1788, the Royal Dramatic Theatre was founded by king Gustav III of Sweden, which was to be managed by a board of directors composed by the actors themselves under the supervision of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. The first supervisor from the academy was the nobleman Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and the cooperation between him and the actors was stormy. Armfelt felt contempt for the acting profession, often made use of disciplinarian punishments and lacked patience for the conflict which often affected the board meetings, and Ahlgren and Abraham de Broen were the actors who were often in conflict with Armfelt. Armfelt wrote to a friend: :\\"It is only with the utmost severity I am able to govern this rabble, and as soon as they tried to defy me, I beat de Broen at the stage with a cane and slapped Ahlgren, and I was so determined to continue with this way of rule, that I would have cut off their ears, if any of these gentlemen dare talk to me about rights.\\"Henrikson, Alf, Fram till Nybroplan: om Kungliga Dramatiska teatern, Wiken, H√∂gan√§s, 1988 (in Swedish) To the king, however, Armfelt reported his great success in his rule over the theatre. King Gustav III of Sweden was aware of the low status of the profession of acting, and therefore often gave the actors formal titles to rise their status. Samuel Ahlgren was accordingly given the title royal quarter master of the court. Armfelt was quickly replaced as the representative from the Academy and \\"director\\" of the theatre, but the conflicts between the appointed directors and the actors continued, represented by Ahlgren and De Broen. In 1794, Ahlgren challenged the Academy's representative, the nobleman Claes R√•lamb, to a duel and was taken to the regent, Duke Charles, who wanted to but him in jail. This incident caused Ahlgren to be fired from the Royal Dramatic Theatre, despite him, and then his wife, kneeling to the regent. He was then employed at the Stenborg theatre, where he was enthusiastically welcomed: many actors from the Royal Dramatic Theatre left for the Stenborg Theatre during periods of conflicts with the management, such as Marie Louise Marcadet also did in 1795. Samuel Ahlgren returned to the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1796. He retired in 1815.

Early years Brown was born in Bath, and moved to London as a boy, stuffing propaganda leaflets into bombs meant for Nazi Germany towards the end of World War II. He was educated at Luton Grammar School, and joined the Royal Air Force for his national service, working as a photographer. Journalist Brown began his reporting career in Luton and Bristol before moving to Fleet Street in the mid-1950s where he joined the Daily Mail. During the late 1950s he covered the Hungarian uprising (in 1956) and the Algerian War of Independence. In 1958 he was awarded Reporter of the Year. Brown secured the first Western interview with Egyptian president, Gamel Abdel Nasser, and was a frequent drinking companion of Kim Philby in the Middle East prior to the latter's 1963 defection to the Soviet Union. He also interviewed the dissident Soviet writer Boris Pasternak, who at the time was under surveillance, in 1959. He subsequently smuggled two of Pasternak's poems back to the UK, one of which was immediately published in the Daily Mail. Brown earned a reputation as an adventurous cutting-edge reporter, but developed something of an extravagant lifestyle, and often left behind large unpaid bills on his foreign trips, according to colleagues. He rode on the first nuclear-powered submarine, and travelled to the South Pole with Sir Vivian Fuchs. In 1960 Brown returned to Britain as chief reporter for the Daily Mail, working to uncover corruption in Scotland Yard, and a major espionage case at the Portland naval base. In 1962 Brown separated from his wife Caroline Gilliat (daughter of the British filmmaker Sidney Gilliat) and their two small children, Amanda and Toby. The marriage ended in divorce. The daughter, now Amanda Eliasch, ex-wife of Johan Eliasch, is a photographer and has recently published a book on poetry and photography entitled Cloak and Dagger Butterfly, and British Artists at Work, with Franca Sozzani of Italian Vogue. The son, Toby, is a chairman of a leading hockey club in Wiltshire. In 1962 Brown moved to the United States, spending a year at Stanford University's Hoover Institution as a visiting fellow. He covered the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and worked in Australia for a television station belonging to Rupert Murdoch. He also worked in Singapore and Malaysia. Brown settled in Washington, D.C., later moving to northern Virginia. He began a 37-year relationship with Joan Simpson Halphen, a woman whom he had met in Paris, and utilized her considerable wealth to begin a second career as a major book author and historian, specializing in espionage, World War II, and Cold War themes. Brown died of dementia and pneumonia-related causes in Warrenton, Virginia, USA on 14 July 2006, at age 77. Joan Simpson Halphen predeceased him by four months. His two children survive him - writer and film director Amanda Eliasch and Toby Brown. He also has one illegitimate child born in 1965, the result of an affair with a young Australian woman, Sandra Janet Tillet. They were to be married but she considered him \\"unreliable\\" and returned to Australia. He made one attempt to gain custody of the child and was blocked. The child was adopted out and remained in Australia. His daughter Amanda Eliasch was encouraged by him to write ‚ÄúThe Gun, the Cake and the Butterfly‚Äù. He requested her to write 5,000 words about her life; later she turned it into a film and a book of poetry. Author and historian Brown's first major work to attract widespread attention was Bodyguard of Lies (1975), which examined the strategical elements of World War II, including codebreaking and its effect on the war's outcome. He followed up on this theme with a book, The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan, about William J. Donovan, the director of the American Office of Strategic Services during World War II; the Office of Strategic Services later evolved into the Central Intelligence Agency. Another espionage-related effort was a 1987 biography of Sir Stewart Menzies, who served as head of British MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service) during World War II. The book was titled C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill. His book Treason in the Blood: H. St. John Philby, Kim Philby, and the Spy Case of the Century, published in 1994, examined the interconnected lives of the famous British spies Kim Philby and Harry St. John Philby, son and father. His final 1999 book Oil, God and Gold: The Story of Aramco and the Saudi Kings, examined the Aramco company in Saudi Arabia.

Conservation plans The completed park will contain of developed parkland among four parks, with dedicated to riparian habitat restoration and over five miles (8 km) of pedestrian/biking trails. When completed, the restoration work and park enhancements will showcase the riparian habitat and improve recreational opportunities for residents and tourists. The park plan was designed with a strong conservation-oriented approach in order to protect and enhance the river, integrating the natural processes that shaped the landscape. The park is envisioned as a setting to learn about the Tuolumne River, natural river processes, native plants, and local wildlife habitat. Small and large group gathering areas, trails, interpretive signage, and a restored landscape will provide and unparalleled opportunity for outdoor study and recreation. The park will provide a mixture of active and passive recreational zones, including play fields and picnic areas, outdoor performing arts, kayaking, nature interpretation, and bicycling.Tuolumne River Regional Park (this link is wrong!) History The Riparian forest habitat of the Tuolumne River became a recreational center for the residents of Modesto following the founding of the city in 1870. While initially used for swimming and fishing, the concept of building a formal park along the river can be traced to the 1920s. In 1933, these early plans resulted in the construction of Dennett Dam and the Lake Modesto at the location of the current TRRP Gateway site. The dam and lake were destroyed in a 1940 flood, though portions of its foundation remain in the river today and are slated for removal.Denett Dam: Foundation Remains, structure long condemned With the start of World War II, plans for the site were largely set aside, and much of the land reverted to agriculture. This remained largely unchanged until the early 1970s when the TRRP was formed. Since that time, several formal parks have been built and the TRRP joint power authority has been acquiring land and funding to complete the project. Construction is underway on new sections of the park, and planning is ongoing for the redevelopment of existing park sites and river side habitat restoration. Existing sections The Tuolumne River Regional Park includes several park areas already completed and open for public use. When completed, the TRRP trail system will also link with the adjoining Dry Creek park system and the scenic four miles (6 km) of trails and developed parks available in that system and maintained by the City of Modesto. Mancini Park ‚Äì Located along the south shore of the Tuolumne River bordering Ceres, Mancini Park was developed on land donated by conductor Frank Mancini. This large park is the subject of current redevelopment efforts, and will be connected to the TRRP trail system through the installation of a pedestrian/bicycle bridge across the river. This park offers walking, bicycling, picnic, and children's play opportunities. Beard Brook Park ‚Äì Located along Dry Creek just upstream from the Tuolumne River, Beard Brook Park offers a developed play area and baseball fields. Legion Park ‚Äì Established in the 1970s, this sprawling park contains a mixture of mature riparian forest, outdoor recreation areas, and picnic areas. Legion Park is envisioned as the educational center of the park and will receive a restored wildflower meadow, a recreation and kayaking beach, and a new trail network. Bellenita Park ‚Äì Bellenita, is a small lightly developed neighborhood park set back from the river's primary flood channel. This park will be redeveloped and integrated into a larger regional sports complex extending from Thomas Avenue to Sutter Avenue in the unincorporated county areas south of Modesto. Future sections  Gateway Park ‚Äì Located at the foot of downtown Modesto, the Gateway Park is a former orchard at the confluence of Dry Creek and the Tuolumne River. This park will contain a mixture of developed parkland, restored riparian terraces, and recreational opportunities.Modesto Gateway Park Information Airport Park ‚Äì The airport area will place emphasis on the bicycle and pedestrian trail, and enjoyment of the beauty and habitat value of this mature riparian corridor. RiverWalk Trail ‚Äì This seven mile (11 km) long trail, and the ribbon of riparian parkland surrounding it, will link the larger formally developed parks along the length of the TRRP project. Governance The Tuolumne River Regional Park is directed through the use of a Joint Powers Authority between Stanislaus County, the city of Ceres, and the city of Modesto. The TRRP is overseen by the TRRP Commission, which includes elected representatives from the associated governments, and the TRRP Citizens Advisory Committee, which includes citizen representatives appointed by the governments involved in the JPA. TRRP is a member of the Tuolumne River Coalition. The TRC represents various public agencies, non-profit organizations and special interest groups dedicated to the enhancement and preservation of the lower stretch of the Tuolumne River from LaGrange Dam to the confluence of the Tuolumne and San Joaquin rivers.

It is discovered that the recent outbreak of famine and plague in Deltora is a result of beasts called the Four Sisters, who magically poison the land. Only dragons can kill them, and they are believed to be extinct. However, Doran the Dragonlover convinced seven of them, one from each territory, to go into hibernation. The Sisters live at the easternmost, northernmost, westernmost, and southernmost points of Deltora. Setting out for Dragon's Nest, the easternmost point in Deltora, the companions discover a Capricon named Rolf captured by the Granous, riddle- loving monsters. Capricons once lived in a great city called Capra, where the town of Broome now stands, but it was destroyed by dragons after the Capricons angered the dragons by stealing their eggs, among other thing. Rolf claims to be the only one left. The companions meet the now-awakened Topaz Dragon, Fidelis, who they previously encountered in hibernation on their way to the underworld in the previous series. He refuses to accompany them, since Doran made the dragons swear not to enter each other's territory while they hibernated, so as to prevent them from taking advantage of each other's slumber. The companions travel on and reach Broome, where they meet the warrior woman Lindal. She guides them to Dragon's Nest, where they find the Sister of the East. Rolf reveals himself to be the Sister's Guardian, having served the Shadow Lord in exchange for magical power and the promise of one day ruling the East, (he is the heir of Capra, and believes it to be his right) and is killed by the newly awakened Ruby Dragon, Joyeu, who destroys the Sister.

Plot After destroying the Sister of the West, Lief, Barda, and Jasmine return to Del, the southernmost point in Deltora, to find the Sister of the South. They find that someone is poisoning people at the palace, and a bizarre beast attacks them several times. After Josef dies from poison, they discover that an addition to the Palace Chapel was forcibly added by the Chief Advisors, and that this is where the Sister is. Nevets kills the mysterious beast just as the Topaz Dragon arrives to destroy the Sister. It is discovered that Paff, Josef's new assistant, was the Guardian and was poisoning the people and projecting the beast similarly to Kirsten's specter. She kills herself out of grief. Just as it seems the quest is finished, it turns out that Josef had deduced a terrible secret: the Shadow Lord had a contingency plan. The Sisters' magic, poisoning the land, was also imprisoning a far worse threat: a creature called the Grey Death, a flood of grey liquid that kills everything it touches. Imprisoned at Hira (a.k.a. the City of the Rats), in the center of the land, now it is rising to destroy the land. However, the Shadow Lord did not count on the dragons working together. With the Opal Dragon, Hopian, now awakened, the seven dragons kill four of the seven Ak-Baba and destroy the Grey Death with their fire. The epilogue claims that this victory will be celebrated by a festival called Dragon Night, and that the heroes will marry, have children, and live the rest of their lives peacefully and happily. It is also hinted that the dragons will repopulate.

It differed from traditional slot car sets in that the cars were powered independently by a pair of AA batteries, rather than by an electrical connection to the track. The cars ran on slotted plastic track which was snapped together in various layouts, ranging from a simple oval to elaborate patterns, some featuring jumps and hazards (\\"Motorific Torture Track\\"). Switches were available; they were designed so that a regardless of the direction from which a vehicle entered the switch, it could exit through either of the other two tracks, and so that as the vehicle passed through the switch, it would reverse the position of the switch, so that if it entered again through the same branch, without the position being manually changed, it would take the opposite path. After removing and inverting the detachable slot-car pin, the cars could also be run on the floor, with the front wheels steerable into one of three set positions (left, center, right), held by small detents on the reverse side of the pin. Although some playsets were marketed to feature competitive play between two operators (\\"Racerific\\"), in truth there was little allowance for competition since there was no operator control over speed. Motorific vehicles and accessories remain popular as collectibles, particularly with baby boomer toy aficionados. Marketing Ideal introduced the Motorific line in 1964 as \\"The New Quick-Change Motor Toy\\",Ideal Toy Corporation v. The United States at Public.Resource.org offering a variety of popular car body styles that were interchangeable with common snap-on chassis and electric motors. Each of the three elements were sold separately and as sets in various combinations, as well as being packaged with a variety of track layouts. The interchangeable bodies rode on a plastic chassis, with a removable \\"CU-24\\" motor. It was powered by two AA batteries which mounted in the chassis. An \\"On-Off\\" switch was on the bottom of the chassis. A removable metal conversion pin would slide on the front part of the chassis, in order to make the car usable on a Motorific (or regular slot car) track. Motorific tracks were produced in three different types: Torture Tracks, Action Highway Sets and Racerific Sets. The initial release in 1964 included Torture Tracks, the largest of which were the Giant Detroit and the GTO. \\"Action Highway\\" track sections included an intersection with a traffic signal on one corner: it could be set to allow vehicles to take either straight path through the intersection (it did not permit turns), while physically blocking the slot for the other straight path; the signal was geared to rotate, presenting a green indication to the open path, and a red indication to the blocked one. Another section was a construction zone with an animated flagman (controlled by a concealed magnet on an arm under the track): when a vehicle entered the track section, a turntable built into the track would act as a treadmill, causing the flagman to move across the road before the vehicle was allowed to proceed. Yet another section was a trailer terminal, with various mechanical devices that would semiautomatically hitch or unhitch a semi-trailer, and reverse the direction of the tractor_unit. There was also a collapsing bridge section, complete with a detour. A special custom edition of the Motorific Torture Track was sold through Flying A (now Getty) gas stations in 1966, consisting of three individual sets with custom Flying A signs for the hazards. In the first two years of distribution, there were 18 different Motorific car body styles offered for sale. Subsequently, a large number of styles became available in a \\"Motorific Custom Cars\\" line.DavesHobby.net The original models included the Thunderbird, Continental, Corvette, Rolls Royce, Mercury, Ford Truck, Imperial, Cadillac, Ford Wagon, Grand Prix, Impala, and Jaguar XKE. Later releases included the Aston Martin, Barracuda, Riviera, Camaro, Duesenberg Phantom, Dune Buggy, Ferrari Berlinetta, 1957 Chevrolet, Ford Hot Rod, Mustang, Karmann Ghia, Mercedes Benz, Cougar, Woody Wagon, and Triumph TR-3. The \\"Racing Car\\" series included the Chaparral, Ferrari 250, Ford J, Ford Mark I, Mako Shark, and Porsche GT. This series featured a beefier chassis than the original cars, with larger wheels and tires. Ideal later introduced a smaller-scale car line more suited to racing (\\"Mini-Motorific\\"), as well as sets featuring Motorific trucks (\\"Action Highway\\") which ran on wider-sized track, and a line of motorized boats (\\"Boaterific\\"). The \\"Mini- Motorific\\" line included the Bonneville Racer, Chaparral D2, Charger, Custom Rod, Delta Duo, Ferrari Special, Firebird, Ford Allegro, Ford GT Mark IV, Mangusta, Plymouth GTX, Police Car, Porsche 907, Shelby Mustang, Stingray, and Wrecker. The chassis on the Minis were diecast, and used a smaller version of the motor, now referred to as \\"CU-25\\". The conversion pin was now built into the chassis, and folded up when not in use. The \\"Motorific Truck\\" series included the Fire Patrol Pumper, Mighty Hauler Dump Truck, Mighty Mixer Cement Truck, Refrigerator Van, Tri-Cola Delivery, Thruway Service Wrecker, Stake Truck, Highway Maintenance, Troop Transport, and Tractor Trailer. A line of \\"Computer Cars\\" were also introduced late in the production run. Unlike the other cars, they did not run on a track. They were designed to run only on the floor. An interchangeable plastic cam in the bottom of the model car would change the direction the car traveled. The cams were for Figure 8, Slalom, Square, and Dog Bone. Three orange barrels were included with the cars to navigate around. The chassis was a combination of the past designs. It was a full size motorific body with a diecast chassis, but used the smaller \\"CU-25\\" motor from the Mini line. The bodies used were re-issues of older motorific styles, but had new color schemes and a \\"Computer Car\\" decal on the roof top of each car. The \\"Computer Car\\" series included the Camaro, Mustang, Ferrari, Triumph TR-3, Jaguar XKE, and the Barracuda. U.S. Customs appeal In 1970, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals denied Ideal's request to have Motorific plastic car bodies and chassis reclassified as \\"parts\\" rather than toys. Such a reclassification would have significantly reduced the importation tariff charged to Ideal (10%-17%, versus 35%). The appeal document revealed the company's two-year sales unit figures for Motorific: in 1964, Ideal sold 935,928 chassis; 1,761,186 car bodies; and 695,805 electric motors. In 1965, they sold 3,749,561 chassis; 4,260,793 bodies; and 3,937,201 motors.

On June 29, 2005, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Gradually, the system organized on July 2 and formed a broad low pressure area. The system continued to organize, and it became a tropical depression on July 4. Tracking westward, it became a tropical storm on July 5 and a hurricane on July 7. Dennis rapidly intensified to attain Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall on Cuba. The storm weakened to Category 1 status before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying to a Category 4. Dennis weakened before the cyclone made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 10, then tracked over southeast Alabama. Dennis had moderate effects in the state, primarily from flooding.

His remarks include the following observations. > In my work I use mostly what may be called classical materials (stone, wood, > clay, bronze, metal. etc.) because these are almost abstract and amorphous. > Their identity resides mainly in their structure (except for metal). This > allows me to model them the way I want while respecting their character. > > I want to realize what I call \\"inhabited forms\\"forms that contain energy, > as if they could breathe and live by themselves. This is a personal attitude > of mine, both classical and modern, as I don't wish to be part of any > official fashion or artistic movement. > > My subjects have no clear borders. They are connected to each other. My > basic themes: nature; landscapes that accommodate and oppose human creation; > an architecture of the \\"spirit\\"; skeletons and enveloping skin; the > evocation of a feeling or a sound or a privileged location; landscapes with > flat areas and mountains, rough or modelled, with erosion that is natural or > artificial, accomplished by nature or man. > > I am lately working on a series of variations on a theme. In Between Three > Points [2000] I explored the idea of reading a sculpture in time, as in a > work of music. The work is built from three pieces that... tell the story of > the creation of a form in three chapters: (1) the beginning, birth, or > underground level, (2) the initiation, or earth ground level, and (3) the > rebirth or result tending toward the sky. The form is not completely free to > grow as it will, but is constrained and guided by internal tectonic > pressures and external atmospheric pressures. The sculpture can be read in > two directions at the same time: horizontally between the three parts and > vertically between the ground and the sky.... > > In Between Earth and Sky [2002] the idea is the same but expressed more in > the vertical direction. We have axels between two points, places where > passage can take place. The axels stand as almost human figures between the > matter and spirit, between the underground (hell) and the sky.... > > The surface of my forms is worked in the same way: smooth areas in > opposition to rough ones and simple, almost geometrical, forms facing > multifaceted, chaotic accumulations of shapes. Simplicity strikes me as > dangerous. It's wrong to try to understand things by eliminating the details > instead of understanding the whole in its complexity. I think the details > create the whole.2\\\\. Ariel Moscovici. Artistic statement. Supplied by the > sculptor to Alton Thompson, March 2008. > Moscovici's images, though modern, may be described as postmodernist in the sense that they are more archetypal than abstract. Raymond Crampagne describes their effect in a publication by the Chateau le Puget Art Gallery: > The works are not a reflection of geometrical forms in a timeless space. > They have a temporal dimension relating not to history or mythology but to a > world that existed before both; even so, this world forms the essence of > both history and myth. This is a world constantly engaged in struggle. The > protagonists in the conflict, humanity and nature, operate in a world of > opposites: smooth and rough, gloss and matte, geometrical and irregular, > concave and convex, straight and curved, round and square, polished and > rough, full and empty, imprint and excrescence, horizontal and vertical, > mass and surface. For Moscovici this conjunction of opposites is > characteristic of our species' relationship with nature. Though we are > ourselves part of nature, we exert our will over matter and impose our own > vision, eventually transforming nature to reflect our innermost being. > > Like Rimbaud seeking to write the silences, seize the inexpressible, and > freeze whirlwinds, Moscovici seeks to translate into images the fundamental > rhythms of existence and the mysteries of nature.... > > Moscovici displays a profound humanism whose expression is anything but > extravagant. The means are simple. The eye and the spirit are called inward. > ... Here one is facing an uninhabited habitat, a dwelling lacking practical > purpose. Only the eye of the beholder will enter and find refuge and, in > solitude, dream of habitation.Printed catalogue, Ariel Moscovici Sculptures, > Chateau Le Puget Art Gallery, Alzonne 11170.

It was established in 1927 with one issue per year as the Atlanta Historical Bulletin. In 1937, the journal began publishing three or four issues annually. At least one issue per year was published during World War II. By the middle 1950s, the publication again failed to have issues available each year. There were no issues between 1957 and 1965, with nearly a decade represented by Vol. X. Things proceeded smoothly from 1966 until the 1990s, except for no issues during the year 1974. There were occasional combined issues (1-2 or 3-4) too, and Volume XLV is particularly spotty signaling a major slowdown. The issue dated Spring 1978 changed the name to The Atlanta Historical Journal and the issue dated Spring 1987 finally changed the name to Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South, then edited by Bradley R. Rice. with a similar design to the previous volumes. The issue marked Fall 1993 announced the opening of the new museum at the history center and presented a new logo, design, and layout for the magazine which continued into 2006. The last issue was Vol. 48 No. 1, dated Spring 2006. Franklin M. Garrett's death in March 2000 may have contributed to the current slowdown. Beginning with the resumption of the Bulletin in 1965 with issue No.39, a chapter or two from Franklin Garrett's book Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of its People and Events was included in each issue up to the last issue of 1973 by which time they had reprinted chronologically to 1872 - almost the entirety of Volume I.

Slingsby was born 6 November 1894 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, the son of Reuben and Charlotte Slingsby, his father was a Builder, Carpenter and Joiner. Slingsby joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1914 as a gunner/observer. On one sortie the pilot was killed. Slingsby climbed out of his gun position and into the pilot's cockpit and regained control of the aircraft. He flew the aircraft back to the British lines. For this, he was awarded the Military Medal. After he left the service, now the RAF, in 1920, he bought a partnership in a wood- working and furniture factory in Queen Street, Scarborough. Slingsby was a founder member of Scarborough Gliding Club, one of the first British gliding clubs in February 1930. By the end of that year, it had 40 active flying members. The first gliders were built in his factory in Queen Street, Scarborough. This was transferred to the town's abandoned tram sheds, before a completely new factory was built in Kirbymoorside in 1934 and he abandoned furniture-making. His first glider, in 1931, was a Falcon, which was a British version of the RRG Falke, built by Rh√∂n-Rossitten Gesellschaft and designed by Alexander Lippisch. In 1933, Slingsby started producing RFD Daglings, as the Type 3. The initial wave of interest in gliding in Britain tailed off and by 1932 Scarborough Gliding Club was in financial trouble. It merged with another club, and further mergers produced the Yorkshire Gliding Club, based at Sutton Bank, near Thirsk. Philip Wills and Fred Slingsby negotiated the lease of the land at Sutton Bank. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Slingsby changed production, initially building rudders for the Avro Anson although they sold a few gliders for radar experiments. Eventually an order was received for the design and production of the Hengist troop carrying glider. In addition, Slingsby received orders for primary training gliders for the Royal Air Force's Air Training Corps (ATC). With the Hengist and training glider orders along with the repairs and manufacturing of spare parts, the Slingsby company was kept busy throughout the war. Anticipating the end of the war and the need for better training gliders for both the ATC and private clubs, Slingsby designed and built both a tandem and a side-by- side prototype glider to meet this need. This later design became the Slingsby T.21B Sedbergh. Other gliders followed (see Slingsby Aviation) until the company was merged into the Vickers Group during late 1969. Fred Slingsby was awarded the Paul Tissander Diploma by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale in 1957. Family life Slingsby married Florrie Wade in Cambridge in 1918. He died aged 78 on 21 May 1973.

The demolition plans were met with dismay by travel journalists, like Tyler Br√ªl√©, who called the original \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"one of the most loved modernist hotels in the world\\". Others lamented the irony of the iconic building and its \\"Orchid Bar\\", a favorite meeting place for the foreign diplomats from the many embassies nearby, being demolished at a time when shows like Mad Men have made the modernistic style of the 1960s highly fashionable again. The outcry helped raise awareness of the significance of the original design, and many interior elements of the lobby were painstakingly transferred to or recreated within the new exterior by Yoshio Taniguchi, the son of the original designer. The hotel grounds also host the Okura Museum of Art, which houses a collection of Japanese and East- Asian Art amassed by industrialist ≈åkura Kihachir≈ç. In a reference to the three Edo era branch houses of the Tokugawa clan, the Imperial Hotel Tokyo, Hotel Okura Tokyo, and Hotel New Otani Tokyo are often referred to as one of the of Tokyo.  In fiction  The hotel appears in Haruki Murakami's novel, 1Q84, and in Eric Van Lustbader's The Ninja. In Ian Fleming's novel You Only Live Twice, James Bond stays at the Okura while in Tokyo.

United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. The law criminalizes promoting the entry into or exit from the country of persons for the purpose of facilitating prostitution, with penalties of up to three years in prison and a fine of $827 . Sanctions are increased in a number of circumstances, including cases in which the victim is a minor, violence or intimidation is used, deception or abuse of authority is involved, the victim is related or under the tutelage of the perpetrator, or advantage is taken of a victim's circumstances or handicap. The law criminalizes the prostitution of children and corruption of minors, and the age of consent for sexual relations is 14. The law criminalizes obtaining sexual services from a minor in exchange for money or other considerations. Most trafficking victims were minors trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Within the country, victims reportedly were trafficked from rural areas to urban areas such as Santiago, Iquique, and Valparaiso. Law enforcement authorities stated that small numbers of victims were trafficked to the neighboring countries of Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia, as well as to the United States, Europe, and Asia. Victims reportedly entered the country from Peru, Paraguay, Colombia, and Bolivia, although it was difficult to distinguish trafficking victims from economic migrants. Anecdotal reports suggested that young women were the primary targets for trafficking to other countries. Traffickers reportedly used newspaper advertisements for models and product promoters to lure girls, ages 11 to 17, into prostitution. Law enforcement agencies indicated that traffickers looking for children also targeted economically disadvantaged families, convincing the parents that they were giving the child the opportunity for a better life. An antitrafficking coordinator in the Interior Ministry worked with the Public Ministry to gather information on new cases investigated and prosecuted. From May 1995 through March, 83 new cases were opened, with 5 pending active investigations and 1 prosecutions initiated by the year's end. Most trafficking-related cases dealt with commercial sexual exploitation of minors. The Public Ministry investigated 11 cases of cross-border trafficking in persons from January to November, compared with seven cases in all of 1995. Additionally, the PICH sex crimes and cybercrime units worked with the Ministries of Justice and Interior to address trafficking. The government cooperated with Interpol on law enforcement activities. The Ministry of Labor performed regular worksite inspections, responded to specific complaints, and maintained offices in each region and throughout the Santiago Metropolitan Region to identify potentially abusive situations and inform workers of their legal rights. The Public Ministry trained hundreds of law enforcement agents to recognize and investigate potential trafficking and trained prosecutors to prosecute cases more effectively. SERNAM raised trafficking awareness and provided information on victim's rights and the prosecution of traffickers to 100 officials and 160 civic activists in the border cities of Iquique and Arica. The government made substantial efforts to assist trafficking victims during the year. Child victims trafficked into sexual exploitation received counseling, psychological and health care, and educational courses in NGO-operated centers for abused and exploited children. The government gave two million dollars to 16 NGOs that implement victim-assistance programs in 12 different districts. Police officials who identified child trafficking victims referred them to family courts for placement in protective custody with foster families, relatives, or shelters and put victims in contact with NGOs. SENAME worked with 75 local offices, with international organizations, including the International Organization for Migration, and with NGOs to ensure that minors involved in possible trafficking situations were not returned to abusive or high-risk situations. The government also worked with Bolivian and Argentine authorities to coordinate the safe repatriation of foreign victims. Trafficking victims may remain in the country during legal proceedings against their traffickers. Victims may also bring legal action against traffickers and seek restitution. The government had no residence visa program for foreign trafficking victims; however, at least one victim was granted temporary residence to avoid returning her to potential re-victimization in her home country.

(1 September 1883 ‚Äì 3 June 1941) was a British writer and pacifist. Life to 1918 He was born in Northumberland Park, Tottenham, Middlesex.AIM25: University College London: Plowman Papers He left school at 16, and worked for a decade in his father's brick business.Gai Eaton, The Richest Vein: Eastern Tradition And Modern Thought (2005), p. 128. He became a journalist and poet. In 1914 he married Dorothy Lloyd Sulman. From the beginning of the First World War Plowman felt morally opposed to the fighting ‚Äì \\"insane and unmitigated filth\\" ‚Äì but on Christmas Eve 1914 he reluctantly volunteered for enlistment in the Territorial Army, Royal Army Medical Corps, 4th Field Ambulance. He later accepted a commission in the 10th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, and serving at Albert, close to the Somme on the Western Front, he suffered concussion from an exploding shell. Deemed to be affected by shell shock, he was sent home to convalesce at Bowhill Auxiliary, a branch of Craiglockhart, where he was treated by W. H. R. Rivers, although he did not meet either of Rivers' two most celebrated patients, Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. While recovering, he produced a poetry collection, A Lap Full of Seed, and an anonymous pamphlet, The Right to Live, inveighing against the kind of society that made war inevitable.Jonathan Atkin, A War of Individuals: Bloomsbury Attitudes to the Great War (2002), p. 108. Having been granted a further month's home service in January 1918, he wrote to his battalion adjutant asking to be relieved of his commission on the grounds of religious conscientious objection to all war. He was arrested and tried by court martial on 5 April 1918 for refusing to return to his unit, his trial being covered in the Labour Leader. Having been dismissed from the Army, albeit without punishment, he was on 29 June 1918 served with notice of call- up as a conscript, but successfully applied to Hampstead Military Service Tribunal for exemption as a conscientious objector.Dorothy Plowman (Ed), Bridge into the Future, Letters of Max Plowman, Dakers, 1944, pp 125-130 In July 1918 Plowman gave a positive review in the Labour Leader to Siegfried Sassoon's anti-war poetry collection Counter-Attack.Jean Moorcroft Wilson, Siegfried Sassoon 1886‚Äì1918 (1998), p. 467. It was in response to a request in a letter from Plowman that Sassoon campaigned for Philip Snowden in Blackburn, in the December 1918 General Election.Jean Moorcroft Wilson, Siegfried Sassoon 1918‚Äì1967 (2003), p. 30. His memoir of the war A Subaltern on the Somme was published in 1928, under the pseudonym \\"Mark VII\\". The Adelphi In 1930 Plowman joined John Middleton Murry and Richard Rees in developing The Adelphi as a socialist monthly; Murry had founded it in 1923 as a literary journal (The New Adelphi, 1927‚Äì30); Rees edited it from 1930 to 1936, when he withdrew on account of Murry's commitment to pacifism, which increasingly became the magazine's theme; Murry resumed editorship until 1938, when Plowman took on the role.Magazine Data File The Adelphi was closely aligned with the Independent Labour Party;Peter Sedgwick: George Orwell ‚Äì International Socialist? (1969) Jack Common worked for it as circulation promoter and assistant editorArchives Hub: Jack Common Papers in the 1930s.

In 1929 George Orwell had sent The New Adelphi an article. Plowman sent Orwell books to review, founding an important friendship; and Rees was Orwell's literary executor. Plowman later got to know Orwell better through Mabel Fierz.Peter Stansky and William Abrahams, The Unknown Orwell (1972), p. 224. Orwell described Plowman as \\"pugnacious\\",Jeffrey Meyers, Orwell (2000), p. 93. and although one writer has suggested that Orwell was still in agreement with Plowman's pacifism in early 1938,Meyers, p. 181 another has pointed out that Orwell supported the International Brigade in Spain and \\"was often rude about pacifists [although] he had good friends who were pacifists\\".Peter Davison (ed.) Orwell's essays, journalism and letters, in letter to Peace Pledge Union, 4 December 1995, PPU Archives Later that year Plowman introduced Orwell to Leo Myers, and set up a secret gift of ¬£300 from Myers so that Orwell and his wife could travel to Morocco, to restore Orwell's health.Gordon Bowker, George Orwell (2003), pp. 240‚Äì2.

Ward formed the 'Adelphi Players' in 1941, who used the Adelphi Centre for rehearsals.Davies, p. 3. By 1937 the commune had collapsed, and the house, 'The Oaks', was turned over to 64 Basque refugee children under the auspices of the Peace Pledge Union; they remained until 1939.Langham Basque Colony, Colchester Plowman was attracted into organising for pacifism in the later 1930s by Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard. He was the first General Secretary of the Peace Pledge Union 1937‚Äì1938. Murry, to whom Plowman was now close, became a pacifist after a diversion into communism. Plowman emphasised the importance of the individual conscience in an age of totalitarianism: > I am confident that if a man surrenders his conscience to his idea of > community, or to his Fuhrer, it doesn't must matter whether he calls himself > Communist or Fascist-he has foresworn the element in himself which alone can > keep society human.

According to the 2012 census, 2,000,000 people declare having indigenous origins. Many Chileans are of partially indigenous descent, and the term and its legal ramifications are typically reserved to those who self-identify with and are accepted within one or more indigenous groups. The Mapuche, with their traditional lands in south-central Chile, account for approximately 85% of this number. There are also small populations of Aymara, Quechua, Atacame√±o, Kolla, Diaguita, Yaghan, Rapa Nui and Kawaskhar in other parts of the country,Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. as well as many other extinct cultures such as Cacahue, Chango, Picunche, Chono, Tehuelche, Cunco and Selknam.  The Indigenous Law  Cultural distribution of Indigenous Chileans Following the return to democracy, Patricio Aylwin's Concertaci√≥n government established a Comisi√≥n Especial de Pueblos ind√≠genas (Special Commission of Indigenous People), whose report provided the intellectual framework of the \\"Indigenous Law\\" (ley ind√≠gena) or law n¬∞ 19 253, promulgated on September 28, 1993 by Aylwin.LEY N¬∫ 19.253 - LEY IND√çGENA The Indigenous Law recognized in particular the Mapuche people, victims of the Occupation of the Araucan√≠a from 1861 to 1883, as inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included Aymaras, Atacame√±as, Collas, Quechuas, Rapa-Nui (inhabitants of Easter Island), Y√°manas, Kawashkars and Diaguita (since 2006). Despite this state proclamation of indigenous rights, conflicts brought by land-occupations and Mapuche's claims lead to state repression and the use of the anti-terrorist law against Mapuche activists, a law voted by the military junta. The law established the National Corporation for Indigenous Development (CONADI), which included directly elected indigenous representatives, advised and directed government programs to assist the economic development of indigenous people. It also gives indigenous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions and provides for bilingual education (legalizing Mapudungun language) in schools with indigenous populations. Approximately one-half the self-identified indigenous population remained separated from the rest of society, largely due to historical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. Both internal factors and governmental policies limited the ability of indigenous people to participate in governmental decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. Indigenous people also experienced some societal discrimination and reported incidents in which they were attacked and harassed. A 2003 Ministry of Planning survey reported that indigenous people earned 26% less than nonindigenous citizens for similar work. Chile is one of the twenty countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upholds rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.  Social and economical status  In 2005, CONADI regularized the property titles to approximately of land that were restored to 300 Aymara families in the north. However, some observers criticized a lack of transparency in CONADI's land restoration processes and favoritism of the Mapuche over other indigenous groups. The Ministry of Education provided a package of financial aid consisting of 1,200 scholarships for indigenous elementary and high school students in the Araucania Region during 2005. The government also implemented the Indigenous Scholarship Program that benefited 36,000 low-income indigenous elementary, high school, and college students with good academic performances. =The Mapuche conflict= As of 2009, there were instances of violent confrontations between indigenous Mapuche groups and landowners, logging companies, and local government authorities in the southern part of the country. The actions took the form of protests and, occasionally, instances of rock throwing, land occupations, and burning of crops or buildings. Many of these actions were initiated by the Coordinadora Arauco Malleco (CAM), an indigenous group that has been accused of terrorist acts. Three CAM-related Mapuches and a non-indigenous sympathizer remained imprisoned in a 2001 arson case in which antiterrorism penalties were applied. The four initiated a hunger strike in March, demanding the terrorism convictions be voided to allow their release on parole. In April the court acquitted two other individuals of all charges, criminal and terrorist, in the same case. In September the Senate rejected a proposed law to allow the release of the four imprisoned on terrorist charges. Government-sponsored legislation which would clarify the application of the antiterrorism law remained pending at year's end. The government did not act on a United Nations special rapporteur's 2003 recommendation that there be a judicial review of cases affecting Mapuche leaders. The government had not applied the antiterrorism law in Mapuche- related prosecutions since 2002. However, it began again to apply this law in August, 2009, as the Mapuche conflict deepened following several acts of occupation and arson, as well as the killing of a Mapuche activist.Chile: muerte ahonda crisis con mapuches, http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2009/08/090813_2233_mapuches_chile_jg.shtml References Chile ","title":"Indigenous peoples in Chile"},{"id":"16715537","text":"ƒårnotiƒçe () is a settlement near ƒårni Kal in the City Municipality of Koper in the Littoral region of Slovenia.Koper municipal site It includes the hamlets of Na Placu () near St. Paul's Church, Na Vr≈°iƒçu () in the center of the settlement, and lower-lying Na Kri≈æcah ().

Police and military personnel may not organize collectively. Members of unions were free to withdraw from union membership. The law prohibits closed union shops.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Right to organize and bargain collectively The law allows unions to conduct their activities without interference, and the government protected this right in practice. Temporary workers‚Äîthose in agriculture and construction as well as port workers and entertainers‚Äîmay form unions, but their right to collective bargaining is limited. Intercompany unions were permitted to bargain collectively only if the individual employers agreed to negotiate under such terms. Collective bargaining in the agricultural sector remained dependent on employers agreeing to negotiate. While employees in the private sector have the right to strike, the government regulated this right, and there were some restrictions. The law permits replacement of striking workers, subject to the payment of a cash penalty that is distributed among the strikers. Public employees do not enjoy the right to strike, although government teachers, municipal and health workers, and other government employees have gone on strike in the past. The law proscribes employees of 30 companies‚Äîlargely providers of such essential services as water and electricity‚Äîfrom striking. It stipulates compulsory arbitration to resolve disputes in these companies. There was no provision for compulsory arbitration in the private sector. Strikes by agricultural workers during the harvest season were prohibited. Employers must show cause and pay severance benefits if they dismiss striking workers. Labor laws applied in the duty-free zones; there are no export processing zones. Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and there were no reports that such practices occurred. The Labor Code does not specifically prohibit forced or compulsory labor by children, and child prostitution remained a problem. Prohibition of child labor The law restricts child labor, but it was a problem in the informal economy. The law provides that children between the ages of 15 and 18 may work with the express permission of their parents or guardians, but they must attend school; 15-year-old children may perform only light work that does not require hard physical labor or constitute a threat to health and childhood development. Additional provisions in the law protect workers under age 18 by restricting the types of work open to them (for example, they may not work in nightclubs) and by establishing special conditions of work (they may not work more than eight hours in a day). The minimum age to work in an underground mine is 21; special regulations govern the ability of 18- to 21-year-olds to work at other types of mining sites. Ministry of Labor inspectors enforced these regulations, and while compliance was good in the formal economy, many children were employed in the informal economy. From January through November, the Ministry of Labor imposed some form of sanctions in 93 cases involving violations of child labor laws. There were reports that children were trafficked (see Human trafficking in Chile). A 2004 survey by the Ministry of Labor and the International Labor Organization reported that in 2003 approximately 200,000 children between the ages of five and 17 worked, and 3 percent of all children and adolescents worked under unacceptable conditions. Among working children, those between the ages of five and 14 worked an average of 18.5 hours a week, and adolescents worked an average of 39.5 hours. In August 2005, the SERVICIO NACIONAL DE MENORES (SENAME)http://www.sename.cl/ released a report indicating that, as of September 2004, there were 1,123 cases of children and adolescents involved in the worst forms of child labor. Of this number, approximately 68 percent were boys; 75 percent were 15 years or older; and 66 percent did not attend school. Fifty-eight percent of the individuals were involved in hazardous activities such as mining or working with chemicals or toxins, 24 percent in commercial sexual exploitation, and 14 percent in illegal activities. The government devoted adequate resources and oversight to child labor policies. SENAME, in coordination with labor inspectors, has a system for identifying and assisting children in abusive or dangerous situations. The Ministry of Labor convened regular meetings of a tripartite group (business- labor-government) to monitor progress in eradicating child labor. SENAME operated rehabilitation and reinsertion programs in 75 municipalities for exploited child workers. SENAME also implemented public educational programs to create awareness about child labor and its worst forms. Acceptable conditions of work The minimum the Ministry of Labor, was responsible for effectively enforcing minimum wage and other labor laws and regulations. The law sets the legal workweek at six days or 45 hours. The maximum workday length is 10 hours (including two hours of overtime pay), but positions such as caretakers and domestic servants are exempt. All workers enjoy at least one 24-hour rest period during the workweek, except for workers at high altitudes who may exchange a work-free day each week for several consecutive work-free days every two weeks. The law establishes fines for employers who compel workers to work in excess of 10 hours a day or do not provide adequate rest days. The government effectively enforced these standards. The law establishes occupational safety and health standards, which were administered by the Ministries of Health and Labor and effectively enforced. Insurance mutual funds provide workers' compensation and occupational safety training for the private and public sectors. The law protects employment of workers who remove themselves from dangerous situations if labor inspectors from the Labor Directorate and occupational safety and health inspectors from the Chilean Safety Association determine conditions that endanger their health or safety exist. Authorities effectively enforced the standards and frequently imposed fines for workplace violations.

Therefore, very little Luxembourg wine is seen outside Luxembourg and Belgium. In terms of volume, the wine production in Luxembourg is dominated by a number of winemaking cooperatives. The cooperatives in Greiveldange, Grevenmacher, Remerschen, Stadtbredimus and Wellenstein source their wines from over 800 hectares of vineyards (almost two thirds of Luxembourg's vineyard surface) and sell their wines under the common name of \\"Vinsmoselle\\". In addition, they operate a sparkling wine plant in Wormeldange, which produces wines under the label Poll-Fabaire.Vinsmoselle.lu: Our vineyards and estates, accessed on April 1, 2008  Wine styles  The location of the wine-producing region within the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, along river Moselle Luxembourg mainly produces dry white wines and sparkling wine under the designation Cr√©mant. There are also some ros√© and red wines made, as well as some sweet wines.Institut Viti- Vinicole Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg: Produkte, accessed on April 1, 2008 In contrast to the downstream German wine region Mosel, Luxembourg has very little tradition of producing semi-sweet or sweet wines, despite a significant similarity in terms of grape varieties. Rather, the wines of Luxembourg have been produced as a kind of cold climate version of traditional, dry Alsace wines.  Grape varieties  Grapes left hanging on the vine in Luxembourg to produce ice wine. Common grape varieties in Luxembourg, and the vineyard surface they covered in 2006, are:Le Portail des Statistiques du Luxembourg: Superficies viticoles selon les diff√©rents c√©pages 1975 - 2006, accessed on April 1, 2008 * M√ºller-Thurgau, usually under the name Rivaner: 377.1 ha (29.0%) * Auxerrois blanc: 184.2 ha (14.2%) * Pinot gris: 177.5 ha (13.7%) * Riesling: 165.8 ha (12.8%) * Pinot blanc: 143.1 ha (11.0%) * Elbling: 122.9 ha (9.5%) * Pinot noir, the only red wine grape above 1%: 88.2 ha (6.8%) * Gew√ºrztraminer: 18.8 ha (1.4%) * Chardonnay: 14.8 ha (1.1%)  History  After World War I and the end of the Zollverein, Luxembourgish viticulture faced a difficult situation. Under the Zollverein, Luxembourgish wine producers had been content to produce a maximum quantity of low-quality wine such as Elbling, to be exported to Germany where it would be blended with wines of the Rhine. The establishment of a customs barrier between the two banks of the Moselle disrupted this situation. With the loss of the German market, Luxembourgish viticulture had to adapt itself. The existing grape varieties had to be gotten rid of, to be replaced by varieties that would yield quality wines. Elbling made way for Riesling-Sylbaner, Riesling, Pinot, and Auxerrois. At the same time the vine-growing surface area was substantially reduced, getting rid of the low-quality sites. The surface area went from 1,645 ha in 1914 to 1,000 ha in 1939. Winemaking cooperatives were created to facilitate the sale of the grape harvest. An \\"Institut vini- viticole\\" was created in Remich in 1925, to conduct research and advise wine- makers. In 1935 the label \\"Marque Nationale\\" was introduced to guarantee a consistent quality. This process of adaptation can be considered completed by the mid-1930s. On average two-thirds of produce were now consumed domestically, while the rest was exported, mostly to Belgium. The Moselle area was the only region of the country which had opted for Belgium over France as an economic partner in the referendum of 1919. During 1983-1987, 57% of produce was exported, four-fifths of this to Belgium.  Classification  The back label of a bottle of Auxerrois wine from Luxembourg. Note the Marque Nationale and the Grand Premier Cru designation. All official wine designations in Luxembourg are French language terms. One single appellation is used for all of Luxembourg: Moselle Luxembourgeoise. This designation, usually referred to as the Marque Nationale (national seal), indicates that the wine is made entirely from Luxembourgian grapes and fulfills certain requirements. The Marque Nationale was introduced in 1935.Institut Viti- Vinicole Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg: Qualit√§tsweine, accessed on April 1, 2008 Wines allowed the national seal can also carry three additional quality designations: Vin class√©, Premier Cru or Grand Premier Cru, which have been used since 1959. These designations are awarded the individual wine after tasting by an official committee, which rates the wines on a 20-point scale. * Wines that score less than 12 points are denied an official classification, and may not display the Marque Nationale. * Wines that score a minimum of 12.0 points may be sold as Marque Nationale - Appellation Contr√¥l√©e. At this level, the wine can be evaluated before it is bottled. * Wines that score 14.0-15.9 points after being bottled (i.e., at a second evaluation) are allowed the designation Vin class√© in addition to Marque Nationale - Appellation Contr√¥l√©e. * Wines that score a minimum of 16.0 points after being bottled are allowed the designation Premier Cru. * Wines that are allowed the Premier Cru designation may be submitted for a third tasting, and those wines which score a minimum of 18.0 points in this tasting are allowed the designation Grand Premier Cru. Since the terms Premier Cru and Grand Cru are used in France to classify vineyards or wine estates, it has been suggested that the different use of these terms in Luxembourg is somewhat confusing to the consumer. There are three different classifications for sweet \\"specialty wines\\", differentiated by means of production:Institut Viti-Vinicole Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg: Spezialweine , accessed on April 1, 2008 * Vendanges tardives is a late harvest wine, either naturally sweet or affected by botrytis. * Vin de glace is an ice wine, made from grapes harvested in the frozen state. * Vin de paille is a straw wine, made from dried grapes. The exact requirements with regard to must weight is different for the three categories and depends on the grape variety, but falls in the range 95 to 130 degrees Oechsle. Cr√©mant de Luxembourg Sparkling Cr√©mant de Luxembourg. The Cr√©mant de Luxembourg designation for sparkling wine is also awarded within the framework of the Marque Nationale, meaning e.g. that only domestic grapes are allowed in the production. Therefore, in difference to the classification used for French cr√©mants, Cr√©mant de Luxembourg is a special type of wine within the Moselle Luxembourgeoise appellation, rather than an appellation in its own right.Institut Viti-Vinicole Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg: Cremant , accessed on April 1, 2008 Some sparkling wine produced in Luxembourg is just labelled Cr√©mant and does not display the Marque Nationale. Such sparkling wines are produced partially or entirely from imported grapes, must or base wine.

It is less than 5 km from the Italian town of Muggia near Trieste, about 2.5 km from the Italian-Slovenian border, 6.5 km from Koper, and 33 km from the nearest Croatian town, Buje. In the entire municipality both Slovenian and Italian are official languages. Geography The town of Ankaran is located at the south end of the Muggia Peninsula (sometimes also called the Ankaran Peninsula) at the northwest end of Istria, and extends across the territory of former village of Ankaran, Valdoltra, and Debeli Rtiƒç. It is the northernmost of all the coastal settlements of the Slovenian Riviera and one of the last settlements in Istria before the Karst region. In ancient times it was one of the most important routes along the Adriatic coast. The Mediterranean climate allows grape and olive cultivation. Name Ankaran was attested in written sources in 1700 as Ancaran. The Slovenian name is borrowed from Italian Ancarano (dialect Ancar√†n), which is derived from the name Ancharius and therefore means 'property of Ancharius'. Additional settlements in Italy with the same name origin include Ancarano, Ancaiano (in Tolentino), and Ancharano (in Tuscany).Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 46. During Roman times, the area of today's Ankaran was probably known as Ultra‚Äîliterally, 'across (the bay)'‚Äîreferring to the perspective from Koper.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 1. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. p. 125‚Äì126. History In the Roman Empire, an outpost named Ancarano, whose ruins are still visible in Bo≈æiƒçi, was established next to a road that ran from Trieste (Tergeste) through ≈†kofije, between Tinjan Hill and the Milje hills through Bivje (where ruins of it are still visible) towards central Istria. Artifacts found below Srmin Hill during excavations date from Roman, or possibly even Ancient Greek times. In the 9th century a Trieste bishop ordered a small church to be built in Gasello dedicated to Saint Apollinare del Gasello. In 1072, Bishop Adalger gave the church of Saint Apollinare with surrounding properties to the Benedictine Monastery of Saint Niccolo of Venice. The Benedictines expanded their territory toward Koper and down to Poreƒç throughout the western part of Istria. The monastery was expanded several times, and later renamed to San Niccolo (). Gradually a few farms emerged around the main complex, and the monastery itself promoted grape and olive cultivation. The San Niccolo wines were sold to the Duchy of Milan and trading was conducted in the 16th century even to the German lands as Lacrimae Christi wines. Apparently the monastery also produced olive oil because olive oil storage tanks were found near today's Hotel Convent. In 1572 a Guelf-style belltower was built on the complex itself, and the church gained a new name: San Niccolo d'Oltre, later San Niccolo d'Oltra, to distinguish it from its Koper counterpart. In 1630 and 1631 the plague greatly reduced the population in the broader area and caused mass abandonment of the monastery complex, with the last ordained monk leaving in 1641. Bishop Zenon complained of alleged immoral behaviour of the monks residing there. From that point on, the buildings served only as a residence for the Benedictine Order. San Niccolo also served as an artwork storage facility from the 14th to 18th century, when the works mysteriously disappeared after official dissolution of the monastery by the Venetian Republic in 1774. In the same year it was purchased the Madonizza family of Koper and remade into their summer residence. During Napoleon's Illyrian Provinces, a military hospital was established and later the Austrian Empire remade the settlement into a therapy center for their naval officers. In 1818 a book was published in Regensburg by Heinrich Hoppe and Friederich Hornschuh praising the local climate as being effective for recovery from injuries and illnesses. Because of the increased popularity of the facility, a well was built on the outer terrace in 1835 by Bonifazio (from Piran) and Dominic (from Korte). In 1880, three arches with a stairwell were built on the front entry of the complex to offer visitors a better view of the courtyard. From that point until the First World War, it mainly offered healthcare services. In 1909, the Valdotra Sanatorium for pulmonary tuberculosis and a seaside convalescent hospital for children were built. This was renovated by the American Red Cross after the war, and in 1925 some capacities of San Niccolo were used as a hotel, together with the playgrounds and the San Niccolo swimming site. After the Second World War, the Hotel-Camp Adria Complex was built near the monastery, and the building of the seaside convalescent hospital for children was occupied by the Valdotra Orthopedic Hospital. At Debeli Rtiƒç another facility for treating young people was established. The Ankaran Hospital also owned some premises in the tuberculosis sanatorium, but moved to the Izola Hospital in 1985. On the basis of this activities and business, many residential buildings for workers began appearing around these facilities, especially after the Second World War, and gradually the settlement began to thrive.http://obcina- ankaran.si/?p=173Slovenian Tourist Board site's info on Ankaran Tourism The mild climate sparked the development of health resorts in the late 19th century. Tourism begun to develop when the monastery was converted into a hotel. The Ankaran's camping site was claimed to be the most clean among camping sites on Slovenian coastline. By the St. Katerina is a learning trail, including the only salty meadow in Mediterranean. Valdoltra Orthopedic Hospital In 1884, the Society of the Friends of Children (, ) was established in Trieste, with the aim of aiding poor and ill children. The society opened a preschool in Trieste, established food distribution in schools, administered of vacation camps (such as the one in Hrpelje, opened in 1899), and was engaged in other activities, but its main concern was ill children. Its summer treatment facilities for ill children were insufficient for effective treatment, and so it began searching for new facilities nearby in 1904, after closing the Saint Andre facility in Trieste in 1903. When searching for facilities, the fate of the society was uncertain until the Society for the Fight against Tuberculosis (, ), also from Trieste, offered its property in Ankaran for rebuilding the treatment programme, while the Austrian Red Cross supplied two mobile units. For the first 20 years the facilities were run by Emilio Comisso, a pioneer in orthopedic treatment, together with 64 other employees. In 1912 there were three doctors, twenty nurses and eight nuns, and six families were in charge of growing food. In 1914 the complex already had 300 beds. Both world wars severely harmed the treatment facilities and, after the dissolution of Free Territory of Trieste into Italy and Yugoslavia, major renovations and upgrades took place. After Slovenia gained independence 1991, treatment thrived, with 50% of all state orthopedic activities being carried out at Valdoltra. Various new cooperation with international centres emerged, and the facility gradually even became an educational centre. Today, Valdotra is the headquarters of the Valdoltra Orthopedic Hospital, which also has a centre for sports rehabilitation. Navy home The Slovenian patrol boat Ankaran In the part closest to the Port of Koper, the Slovenian Naval Barracks (in the former tuberculosis sanatorium building) became the home base of the Slovenian Navy in 1999. In 1996, after the lifting of the United Nations embargo, Slovenia purchased a Super Dvora Mk II class patrol boat patrol boat and named it after Ankaran.

Preserved wolf in the National Museum of Ireland ‚Äì Natural History The grey wolf (Canis lupus) was once an integral part of the Irish countryside and culture, but are now extinct. The last wild wolf in Ireland is said to have been killed in 1786, 300 years after they were believed to have been wiped out in England and 100 years after their disappearance from Scotland. Folklore and mythology Depiction of the Werewolves of Ossory, from Topographia Hibernica by Gerald of Wales, c. 1200 Wolves feature prominently in Irish mythology. Airitech was a mysterious creature whose three daughters were werewolf-like creatures, eventually killed by Cas Corach. The Irish word for wolf is Mac T√≠re meaning literally the Son of the Country(side) and association with human transformation linger, and whilst some consider this is imported there are many references in Irish mythology to lycanthropes and changing to other animal forms. The Morr√≠gan was said to take on the form of a red-furred wolf, particularly in her battle with the hero C√∫ Chulainn. Mac Cecht killed a wolf feeding on a still-living woman on a battlefield. Cormac mac Airt was said to have been raised by wolves, and that he could understand their speech. Four wolves would accompany him in his rebellion against Lugaid mac Con, and he would later be accompanied by them until the end of his life. The Annals of the Four Masters claims that, in AD 690, \\"It rained a shower of blood in Leinster this year. Butter was there also turned into lumps of gore and blood, so that it was manifest to all in general. The wolf was heard speaking with human voice, which was horrific to all.\\" One tale describes how in AD 1182, a priest travelling from Ulster into Meath encountered a talking wolf, which revealed itself to be a man of Ossory, whose ancestors had been cursed to turn into wolves every seven years and return to their human form after another seven years had passed. The wolf explained that his wife, who was also under the curse, was dying, and he pleaded with the priest to give her the viaticum. The priest complied, and was later put on the right road to Meath by the grateful wolf. History = In prehistory = The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is a canine of the order Carnivora, an apex predator largely feeding on ungulates. The earliest radiocarbon date for Irish wolf remains come from excavated cave sites in Castlepook Cave, north of Doneraile, County Cork, and dates back to 34,000 BC. Wolf bones discovered in a number of other cave sites, particularly in the counties of Cork, Waterford and Clare indicate the presence of wolves throughout the Midlandian ice age which probably reached its peak between 20,000 BC and 18,000 BC. By about 14,000 BC Ireland became separated from Great Britain, which, itself, still formed part of mainland Europe, to become an island. Wolves were one of just a few species of land animal in Ireland that survived through the Nahanagan Stadial, a cold period that occurred between 10,800 BC and 9500 BC. Wolves were a major part of Ireland's postglacial fauna, as evidenced by their prominence in ancient Irish myths and legends, in a number of place names (both Irish and English), in archaeological sites, along with a considerable number of historical references. The ringforts, a common feature of the Irish landscape, were built partly as a defence against wolves and to protect livestock, over the period 1000 BC to AD 1000. = Evolution = According to the Annals of Loch C√©, the poet C√∫√°n √∫a Lothch√°in (died AD 1024) was \\"slain by the men of Tethfa. God performed a ‚Äòpoet's miracle,' manifestly, on the party that killed him, for they died an evil death, and their bodies were not buried until wolves and birds preyed upon them.\\" Among one of the earliest historic references to wolves attacking people in Ireland occurs in the Annals of Tigernach under the year AD 1137: The Blind one of ... that is, Giolla Muire, was killed by wolves. Under the year AD 1420 in the Ann√°la Connacht is the statement \\"Wolves killed many people this year.\\" In AD 1571, as a result of its comprehensive destruction by \\"James Mac Maurice ... (and) ... the warlike troops of the Clann-Sweeny and Clann-Sheehy\\", Kilmallock \\"became the receptacle and abode of wolves\\" In AD 1573, the aftermath of the battle of Bel-an-Chip was described - \\"Noisy were the ravens and carrion-crows, and other ravenous birds of the air, and the wolves of the forest, over the bodies of the nobles slain in the battle on that day.\\" In AD 1581 William Odhar O Carroll was put \\"unsparingly to the sword, and detested (the thought of) shewing him quarter or mercy. They slew him, and left his body under the talons of ravens and the claws of wolves.\\" In the aftermath of the Desmond rebellion, the body of a Dr. Saunders was found in Desmond in early AD 1583 who perished miserably, having fallen a victim to famine and the effects of exposure to the weather, and whose body was discovered partially devoured by wolves (pp. 72‚Äì73,) In the aftermath of the wreck of the Spanish Armada in AD 1588, Francisco de Cuellar turned to check upon a companion only to find him dead. There he lay on the ground with more than six hundred other dead bodies which the sea cast up, and the crows and wolves devoured them, without there being any one to bury them. (p. 23,) The port books of Bristol record between a yearly average of between 100 and 300 wolfskins exported from Ireland throughout the 1500s and a total of 961 skins in a single year. Pilib √ì S√∫illeabh√°in B√©irre (c. AD 1590 ‚Äì 1660), writing of Ireland and particularly Munster after the end of the Nine Years' War, described the aftermath: THUS the war was finished. Ireland was almost entirely laid waste and destroyed, and terrible want and famine oppressed all, so that many were forced to eat dogs and whelps: many not having even these, died. And not only men but even beasts were hungry. The wolves, coming out of the woods and mountains, attacked and tore to pieces, men weak from want. The dogs rooted from the graves rotten carcases partly decomposed. And so there was nought but abundance of misery ... Throughout most of the first half of the 17th century, Ireland had a substantial wolf population of not less than 400 and maybe as high as 1,000 wolves at any one time. One of the nicknames used for Ireland at this time was ‚Äúwolf-land‚Äù. =Extermination= The first instance of legislation against Irish wolves dates back to 1584 when John Perrot, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, ordered Robert Legge to come up with a scheme to encourage the destruction of problem wolves. Further records of legislation occur in 1610 and 1611. In 1614, an Englishman named Henric Tuttesham was offered ¬£3 for every wolf that he killed. The wolf population at the time was high enough for Tuttesham to be authorised to keep four men and 24 hounds in every county for seven years, a total of 128 men and 768 hounds. The bulk of anti-wolf legislation occurred during the decade following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. A number of writers from this time period suggest that as a result of ongoing military campaigns in Ireland, particularly the Cromwellian wars of AD 1641-1652 and the devastation of much of the country and, with increasing numbers of farmed animals, wolf numbers were increasing and seen as a threat to business. The level of rewards and bounties established by Oliver Cromwell's regime attracted a few professional wolf hunters to Ireland, mostly from England. Politically, the prospect of numbers of armed Irish roaming around the country hunting wolves was not acceptable, given the ongoing conflict between the Irish and the new English settlers, so it was seen as much safer for the English authorities to encourage men from their own country to deal with the wolf problem. The problems caused by wolves were considered serious enough by Cromwell's government to impose a ban on the exportation of Irish Wolfhounds. In AD 1652 the Commissioners of the Revenue of Cromwell's Irish Government set substantial bounties on wolves, ¬£6 for a female, ¬£5 for a male, ¬£2 for a subadult and 10 shillings for a cub. In the same year, measures were taken for the destruction of wolves in the Barony of Castleknock, county Dublin. A grand total of ¬£243 5s 4d was paid for wolf kills in Galway, Mayo, Sligo and part of Leitrim formerly within the precinct of Galway in AD 1655 or AD 1665, depending on the author. Between the period July 1649 and November 1656 the total amount of bounty paid out for wolf kills in Ireland as a whole was ¬£3,847 5s. Galway, Mayo, Sligo and part of Leitrim had proportionately more wolves than the rest of the country, given that large tracts of this area were relatively untouched by humans. A Captain Edward Piers was leased land over a five-year period in Dunboyne, County Meath on the condition that he kill 14 wolves and 60 foxes. In the 1690s Rory Carragh was hired to kill the last two wolves in one part of Ulster and was equipped with a boy and two wolf dogs. The last reliable observation of a wolf in Ireland comes from County Carlow when a wolf was hunted down and killed near Mount Leinster for killing sheep in 1786. =Reintroduction= Captive wolves currently reside at Dublin Zoo and the Wild Ireland nature reserve on the Inishowen Peninsula. In 2019, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan called for the reintroduction of wolves to help rewild the countryside and control deer numbers; however the Irish government has no plans to do so at this time .

Mission statement  \\"The mission of the American Board of Professional Psychology is to increase consumer protection through the examination and certification of psychologists who demonstrate competence in approved specialty areas in professional psychology.\\"  History  = 1947-1999 = The American Board of Professional Psychology was founded and incorporated in 1947, as the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology (ABEPP). When established, ABEPP replaced a committee that was formed by the American Psychological Association (APA) to explore the development of a credentialing body for individual psychologists. According to Bent, Goldberg & Packard, APA had come to realize that a membership organization, such as itself, could not advocate for its members at the same time that it performed certification functions designed to protect the public. Determining that a distinction should be made between basic and advanced levels of competence, ABEPP focused its attention to the latter and identified three fields of certification ‚Äì Clinical Psychology; Personnel-Industrial (later becoming Industrial Psychology, and then Industrial/Organizational Psychology); and Personnel-Educational (later becoming Counseling and Guidance, and then Counseling Psychology). In order to recognize those psychologists already working in applied and practice areas, persons deemed to have sufficient experience and training (and awarded Bachelor of Arts degrees prior to December 31, 1935) were allowed to be \\"grandfathered\\" without examination. Those requiring examination were administered both written and oral components. In 1968, the current name ‚Äì American Board of Professional Psychology ‚Äì was adopted, and a fourth specialty ‚Äì School Psychology ‚Äì was introduced. In 1972 multimember regional boards were implemented ‚Äì Northeast, Midwest, Mideast, Southeast, Intermountain West and Far West. In 1974, the ABPP Board of Trustees (BOT) authorized the establishment of the National Register of Health Service Psychologists. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, new specialty boards were recognized ‚Äì Clinical Neuropsychology (1984), Forensic Psychology (1985), Family Psychology (1991) and Health Psychology (1991). As new specialties were introduced, each seated a trustee on the BOT. As the 1990s progressed, additional specialties were identified ‚Äì Behavioral Psychology (1991), Psychoanalysis in Psychology (1996), and Rehabilitation Psychology (1997). Specialty Academies were also introduced as definitive membership organizations for specialists certified by ABPP. = 2000-Present = During the early 2000s, ABPP implemented several initiatives to further its mission. The Early Entry Option was created for graduate students, interns, and residents to start the board certification process early in their careers. In 2008, ABPP began to convene an annual conference with workshops. As a means of raising funds to support education on board certification, the American Board of Professional Psychology Foundation was formed in 2010. In 2015 ABPP seated its first Early Career Psychology (ECP) trustee. Maintenance of Certification was implemented in 2015, requiring that psychologists board- certified on or after January 1, 2015 undergo a formal review, ensuring their commitment to lifelong learning. Psychologists who received their board certification prior to 2015 received the option to opt-in to maintenance of certification or to waive the requirement.  Certification Requirements  There are various requirements to obtain the ABPP certification, which are referred to as diplomas in the specialized area. The minimum requirements include: * A doctoral degree * Licensure within the psychology field * At least five years of experience In addition to the minimum requirements, there are also additional specializations demonstrated by the candidate. The candidate must also demonstrate the following: * Specialized Training * Evidence of substantial experience * Continuing education in one of the thirteen specialty areas A review of the candidate's work as well as an oral examination are also required to obtain ABPP certification. Some specialties require an additional written exam in addition to the oral component.  Recognized Specialties  In 2018, ABPP recognizes the following psychology specialties (year of affiliation with ABPP in parentheses): * Behavioral & Cognitive (1992) * Clinical Child & Adolescent (2003) * Clinical Health (1991) * Clinical Neuropsychology (1984) * Clinical (1947) * Counseling (1947) * Couple & Family (1990) * Forensic (1985) * Geropsychology (2014) * Group (1997) * Organizational & Business Consulting (1948) * Police and Public Safety (2011) * Psychoanalysis (1996) * Rehabilitation (1997) * School (1968) * One subspecialty is also recognized under the umbrella of Clinical Neuropsychology ‚Äì Pediatric Neuropsychology.

He was born in Pavilly and died in Boulogne-Billancourt. Significantly, in his role as a judge at European Court of Justice, he gave the landmark decision in the case of Costa v ENEL, establishing the supremacy of EU law over member state's law. Biography After studying at college Jean-Baptiste-de-La-Salle in Rouen, he studied law at the University of Rouen and became a lawyer in Rouen and the Paris Court of Appeal in 1932. He was the president of the Youth People's Democratic Party in 1936, and a Lieutenant at Fort Saint-Cyr in 1939, whereafter he became actively involved in the Resistance; He was a member of the steering committee of the Resistance movement. In 1958, he was elected in the first constituency of the Hautes- Alpes.A member of two constituent national assemblies, he was elected MRP of the Seine, and retained his mandate during the three legislatures of the Fourth Republic. He chaired the MRP group of the National Assembly and he was also a member of the Association of MRP until his death. He served as judge on the European Court of Justice from 1962 to 1976, and as President of the Court from 1967 to 1976. In the fourteen years which he spent in Luxembourg as a European judge, Lecourt had a major impact on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.William Phelan, Great Judgments of the European Court of Justice: Rethinking the Landmark Decisions of the Foundational Period (Cambridge, 2019) In 1964, he was rapporteur in the famous Costa vs ENEL case, in which the Court of Justice ruled that European law had primacy over national law. Lecourt was intimately convinced that taking this step was a necessity for the Court of Justice and that the European judges had an active role to play in the creation of an ‚Äòever closer union among the peoples of Europe‚Äô. In order for them to take on this responsibility, it was clear that they had to convince national courts to collaborate. Soon after his election as president, Lecourt consequently developed a vast communication strategy, which aimed at convincing national judges of the benefits of the preliminary ruling mechanism, a procedure through which they could ask the European judges questions regarding the interpretation of the European Treaties.Robert Lecourt (1908 - 2014) http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/37169 On retirement from the Court, Lecourt published \\"L'Europe des Juges\\" (Bruylant, 1976), an account of the major decisions and principles of European law targeted at national lawyers and judges.

Name Ko≈°tabona was attested in written sources in 1620 as Costabuona, and in 1763‚Äì87 as Costabona. The Slovene name Ko≈°tabona is borrowed from Italian. The name is a compound of costa 'slope' and bona 'good, fertile', referring to its physical location on a fertile promontory. Another theory, based on oral tradition, claims that in Late Antiquity Ko≈°tabona was the site of a Roman fortress named Castrum Bonae guarding the trade route through the Dragonja Valley, and that the name is derived from this. However, Italian has no co- reflex derived from this noun (cf. Italian castellum 'castle'), and the expected Italian reflex of Latin castrum would be castro, not costa (cf.

She is known for curating the exhibition Black Eyes and Lemonade (1951) and her book The Unsophisticated Arts (1951).  Early life and education  Barbara Jones was born in Croydon, Surrey. She was an only child. Her father had a saddlery and harness business at a time when Croydon was still a rural suburb. Her first sketchbooks were filled with horses and farm machinery.Barbara Jones, A Snapper Up of Unconsidered Trifles, Ruth Artmonsky, p.15 Her background was a comfortable, middle class one. She attended Coloma Convent Girls' School, Croydon High School, from May 1924 to July 1930, and then Croydon Art School, [1931-1933]. From Croydon she went on to the Department of Engraving at the Royal College of Art but felt unsuited so transferred to the Department of Mural Decoration in her second year. She was taught by the likes of Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. She graduated in 1937. She sought commissions but realised that building up work to be free- lance would take time so took a part-time teaching post. Following the outbreak of the Second World War she accompanied the school where she was teaching on its evacuation to Luton.Artmonsky, p.20  Early career  During World War II Jones was associated with the Recording Britain project of the Pilgrim Trust while the War Artists' Advisory Committee also purchased a work by her. The Architectural Press commissioned her to illustrate a booklet, Bombed Churches as War Memorials (1945) and Jones was further asked to write illustrated articles for the Architectural Press's Architectural Review.Artmonsky, p.25 After the war, Jones created murals for the 1946 Britain Can Make It exhibition, and the 1947 Enterprise Scotland exhibition She also worked for P&O;, creating murals for the passenger liner ships SS Orcades, SS Oronsay, SS Orsova and SS Oriana, as well as for hotels, restaurants, exhibitions and schools. Jones also worked on the children's television series The Woodentops. Most of the works, because of the nature of where they were created, have now disappeared. However many books containing her artwork remain, in the form of dust-jackets and illustrations.  Black Eyes and Lemonade  In 1951 Jones co-curated (with Tom Ingram) Black Eyes and Lemonade, an exhibition of craft, folk, and popular objects at the Whitechapel Gallery. Originally, the idea for the exhibition was proposed by the Society for Education in Art (SEA) to explore the qualities of folk art in Britain and its value in art education and was to be titled \\"British Popular Art\\". However, the project that Jones planned put folk art in dialogue with consumer objects‚Äîsome of which were mass-produced‚Äîto explore the \\"bold and fizzy\\" characteristics of contemporary popular art in Britain at that time.Jones, Barbara (1951). Typed note as part of exhibition planning. Whitechapel Gallery Archive, wag/exh/2/17/4. London: Whitechapel Gallery. Cited in Catherine, Moriarty (2018). \\"Popular Art, Pop Art, and 'the Boys who Turn out the Fine Arts'\\". In Massey, Anne; Seago, Alex (eds.). Pop Art and Design. London: Bloomsbury Academic, p. 28. In this way, Black Eyes and Lemonade, amongst other work by Jones, made public many of the ideas that would later become important for the emergence of pop art in Britain. Objects displayed in the exhibition included horse brasses, corn dollies, canal boat artwork, ship's figureheads, and the outfits of Pearly Kings and Queens, alongside more contemporary cultural artefacts including the Idris Talking Lemon, beer mats, pest control adverts and shop posters.  Artistic networks  Jones was a Fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists (SIA), editing the society's journal from 1951‚Äî1953. In 1969 she was made the society's Vice-President. She was also a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and a member of the Society of Authors. She was said to belong to that group of Royal College of Art artists and illustrators, more well-known than she, who were her contemporaries: John Piper, Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious and Edward Ardizzone. When she was at Croydon High School she made friends with a girl called Joyce Drew who became architect and town planner Jane Drew, and it seems they influenced each other in their careers. In 1941 (9 April, at Luton Registry Office), Jones married the artist Clifford Barry, whom she had met while at the Royal College of Art.Clifford Barry designed posters for London Transport in 1937bible of british taste barbara jones article By the end of the war they had moved back to London, first to Croydon, then to Hampstead, first living at Sheriff Road, and ultimately at 2 Well Walk, which was to be Jones's base for the rest of her life. A five floor property, overlooking Burgh House, the house provided \\"a space for projecting her personality, for building an environment in which she felt free and creative to develop herself and her art without the constraints of 'convention' or 'good taste'.\\"Artmonsky, p.20-21 Over the decades Jones lived in, and let out, various parts of the house. By the late 1960s she had had a two-floor studio built in the garden and lived in the basement of the house.Artmonsky, p.21 Jones's marriage to Clifford Barry did not last, both seeking other partners. Barry moved out of the Hampstead home and Tom Ingram replaced him. Ingram was cited in the 1951 divorce. Jones remained close to Clifford Barry, who took up residence in nearby Belsize Park.

It was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt. The 341st was one of the first USAAF squadrons to be equipped with the P-47. After an extended period of training in the northeast United States, the squadron deployed to Archer Field (Archerfield Airport), Brisbane, Australia in June 1943. Began long-range missions to strike at Japanese targets in New Guinea. In mid-June the 341st made the 1,200-mile flight from Brisbane to Port Moresby, New Guinea. The unit operated from New Guinea and Noemfoor until November 1944, flying patrol and reconnaissance missions and escorted bombers to targets in New Guinea and New Britain. In 1944 the 341st began to attack airfields, installations, and shipping in western New Guinea, Ceram, and Halmahera to aid in neutralizing those areas preparatory to the US invasion of the Philippines. When U.S. troops landed on Luzon the squadron in process of conversion from P-47's to P-51 Mustangs, began operation from San Marcelino airstrip a few days after the landing at San Marcelino and Subic Bay.

It was organized and re-designated as the 141st Strategic Fighter Squadron at Mercer Airport, Trenton, New Jersey and was extended federal recognition on 26 May 1949. The 141st Strategic Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 341st. The squadron was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was assigned to the 108th Strategic Fighter Group. In the late 1940s, the new Strategic Air Command (SAC) was manned by personnel of the wartime Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. During World War II they usually encountered swarms of enemy fighters and knew the importance of having fighter escorts. In the postwar era, SAC had fighter wings placed under their own operational control. The squadron trained in escorting SAC's B-29 and later B-50 and B-36 strategic bombers. The unit was called to active federal service on 1 March 1951. The squadron was sent to Turner AFB, Georgia where it continued its mission to provide fighter escorts to SAC bombers on training missions. In December 1951 it was moved to Godman AFB, Kentucky where it replaced a unit deployed to England. It was released from active duty and returned to New Jersey state control on 10 November 1952. 141st TFS F-84F Thunderstreak 51-9396 about 1960. Republic F-105B AF Serial No. 57-5829.

In 1955, the Mustangs were retired and the squadron entered the jet age, with the arrival of the North American F-86E Sabre. The parent 108th FIW was transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) in 1958, being re-designated as a Tactical Fighter Wing. The 141st Tactical Fighter Squadron transferred its interceptors and received and F-84F Thunderstreak fighter-bombers. At the height of the Cold War in 1961, the squadron was again federalized as a result of tensions concerning the Berlin Wall. 28 F-84F's of the 141st TFS and officers and airmen from all three squadrons of the 108th TFW were deployed to Chaumont-Semoutiers AB, France on 16 October with the last aircraft and personnel arriving on 6 November. The ground units deployed by sealift, with the deployed elements reaching Chaumont by 17 November. In France, the deployed elements were assigned to the Provisional USAFE 7108th Tactical Wing on 20 November due to the reduced strength of the 108th TFW in Europe. The primary mission of the 7108th was to provide close air support to the Seventh Army in Europe under the direction of Ground Forward Air Controllers. To accomplish this mission, up to 30 sorties were flown each day. The deployment to France ended in October 1962 and the unit returned to New Jersey state control, leaving the F-84Fs in France. Upon return from France, the squadron was moved from Trenton to McGuire AFB due to air congestion in the Philadelphia area. At McGuire AFB, the squadron was re-equipped with North American F-86H Sabres. Beginning in 1965, the Sabres were retired and the squadron began to receive the F-105B Thunderchief. The 108th TFW was the first Air National Guard unit to fly twice the speed of sound. In May 1981, the F-4D Phantom II replaced the F-105s, and in 1985, they were upgraded to the F-4E Phantom II. With the end of the Cold War, the parent 108th Tactical Fighter Wing was re-aligned to a KC-135 Stratotanker Air Refueling Wing. The F-4s were retired and the squadron was re-designated as the 141st Air Refueling Squadron. Also, as part of the conversion of the wing to the Objective Wing organization, the 108th Tactical Fighter Group became the 108th Operations Group, to which the 141st ARS was assigned. The 141st ARS was certified combat ready on 3 December 1992. The very next day it was tasked with its first operational deployment ‚Äì nothing less than spearheading and establishing the U.S. ‚Äì Somalia air bridge for OPERATION RESTORE HOPE. It deployed an air refueling detachment to Moron Air Base, Spain. In September 1994, for over 30 days, five aircraft deployed to Pisa Airport, Italy for DENY FLIGHT. The 108th replaced the 126 ARW of the Illinois Air National Guard. The 108th ARW was the first Air National Guard unit to take full responsibility during that period. In 2007, the 141st ARS began retiring its KC-135E aircraft and transitioning to the KC-135R.

It was assigned to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey and was equipped with the KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft. The squadron was inactivated in 2008 following the retirement of the wing's KC-135E aircraft. It was later reactivated as the 150th Special Operations Squadron (150 SOS), equipped with the C-32B aircraft.http://www.americanspecialops.com/usaf-special- operations/aircraft/boeing-c-32b/ History Established at Newark Airport, New Jersey, on February 1, 1956. Initially equipped with C-46 Commando aircraft, performing primarily tactical transport missions from Newark in the northeast. In 1963, retired the C-46 and was re-equipped with the C-121 Constellation long distance transport, primarily for passenger movements to Europe, also flew to the Caribbean and to Japan, Thailand, South Vietnam, Australia and the Philippines during the Vietnam War. In 1965, the unit relocated to McGuire AFB, New Jersey. The Constellations were retired in 1973, being replaced with the C-7 Caribou light transport, which was withdrawn from service in the Vietnam War. The C-7s were used for carrying small payloads in combat areas with rough airstrips. In 1977, upon receipt of Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, the unit became the 150th Air Refueling Squadron. It was the first air refueling unit in the United States to launch tankers to establish the now famous U.S.-Saudi Arabia \\"Air Bridge\\" during Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. Hours after President Bush ordered U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf, 150th aircrews were refueling fighters and cargo transports winging their way nonstop from the U.S. to the Persian Gulf. Shortly thereafter, and again, prior to certain units personnel being activated, the 150th deployed aircraft, aircrews, maintenance and support personnel to Saudi Arabia. It also provided urgently needed medical, security police and support personnel to U.S. air bases to assist active duty personnel and serve as \\"back-fill\\" for those already rushed to the combat theater. On 1 October 1993, the 170th Air Refueling Group was consolidated with the senior 108th Air Refueling Wing at McGuire AFB for budgeting reasons. The 170th Air Refueling Group was inactivated, however, the 150th Air Refueling Squadron remained active, being assigned to the 108th Operations Group as its second KC-135 Squadron (along with the 141st ARS). In September 1994, for over 30 days, five aircraft and 300 members deployed to Pisa, Italy for Operation DENY FLIGHT. Supported by 15 active duty Air Force personnel, the squadron was the first Air National Guard unit to take full responsibility during that period.

Though the definition of a long poem is vague and broad, the genre includes some of the most important poetry ever written. With more than 220000 (100000 shloka or couplets) verses and about 1.8 million words in total, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata is the longest epic poem in the world.Spodek, Howard. Richard Mason. The World's History. Pearson Education: 2006, New Jersey. 224, 0-13-177318-6 It is roughly ten times the size of the Iliad and Odyssey combined, roughly five times longer than Dante's Divine Comedy, and about four times the size of the Ramayana and Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. In English, Beowulf and Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde are among the first important long poems. The long poem thrived and gained new vitality in the hands of experimental Modernists in the early 1900s and has continued to evolve through the 21st century. The long poem has evolved into an umbrella term, encompassing many subgenres, including epic, verse novel, verse narrative, lyric sequence, lyric series, and collage/montage. Definitions =Length and meaning= Lynn Keller describes the long poem as being a poem that is simply \\"book length,\\" but perhaps the simplest way to define \\"long poem\\" is this: a long poem is long enough that its bulk carries meaning. Susan Stanford Friedman describes the long poem as a genre in which all poems that are not considered to be short can be a considered a part. These overly inclusive definitions, though problematic, serve the breadth of the long poem, and have fueled its adaptation as a voice for cultural identity among marginalized persons in Modern and Contemporary poetry. Only a broad definition can apply to the genre as a whole. In general, a poem is a \\"long poem\\" when its length enhances and expands upon the thematic, creative, and formal weight of the poem. Though the term \\"long poem\\" may be elusive to define, the term is now finally getting the attention it deserves. The genre has gained importance both as a literary form, and as a means of collective expression. Lynn Keller solidifies the genre's importance in her essay, \\"Pushing the Limits,\\" by stating that the long poem will always be recognized as a notable genre of importance in early twentieth-century American literature. Purposes =Tale of the tribe= A long poem often functions to tell a \\"tale of the tribe,\\" or a story that encompasses a whole culture's values and history. Ezra Pound coined the phrase, referring to his own long poem The Cantos. The long poem's length and scope can contain concerns of a magnitude that a shorter poem cannot address. The poet may see himself or herself as the \\"bearer of the light,\\" to use Langston Hughes' term, who leads the journey through a culture's story, or as the one who makes known the light already within the tribe. The poet may also serve as a poet-prophet with special insight for their own tribe. In Modern and Contemporary long poems the \\"tale of the tribe\\" has frequently been retold by culturally, economically, and socially marginalized persons. Thus, pseudo- epic narratives, such as Derek Walcott's \\"Omeros,\\" have emerged to occupy voids where post colonial persons, racially oppressed persons, women, and other people who have been ignored by classic epics, and denied a voice in the prestigious genre. =Revisionary mythopoesis= Various poets have undertaken a \\"revisionary mythopoesis\\" in the long poem genre. Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a \\"fundamental re-vision,\\" and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman). These \\"re-visions\\" may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition. This revision is noted especially by feminist critical work that analyzes how women are given a new voice and story through the transformation of a previously \\"masculine\\" form. =Cultural commentary= Lynn Keller notes that the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and historical material. Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling in order to prove a point. Then there are those who go a step further and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach. Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history. Concerns and controversies =Fears of the writer= Long poem authors sometimes find great difficulty in making the entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound is an example of this dilemma, with his poem The Cantos.Keller 1993 As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole. Poets attempting to write a long poem often struggle to find the right form or combination of forms to use. Since the long poem itself cannot be strictly defined by one certain form, a challenge lies in choosing the most effective form.Miller 1979 =Generic conundrums= Lyric intensity Some critics, most emphatically Edgar Allan Poe, consider poetry as a whole to be more closely tied to the lyric. They complain that the emotional intensity involved within a lyric is impossible to maintain in the length of the long poem, thus rendering the long poem impossible or inherently a failure.Poe 1850 In his article \\"The long poem: sequence or consequence?\\" Ted Weiss quotes a passage from M. L. Rozenthal and Sally M. Gall's \\"The Modern Poetic Sequence\\" inspired by Poe's sentiments, \\"What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones.... It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal-necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the Paradise Lost is essentially prose‚Äîa succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably,with corresponding depressions‚Äîthe whole being deprived, through the extremities of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect. In short, a poem to be truly a poem should not exceed a half hour's reading. In any case, no unified long poem is possible.\\"Weiss 1993 Multivocality One genre theory claims that once a poem takes on multiple voices, it becomes a novel. Many long poems do make use of multiple voices, while still maintaining all the element of a poem, and therefore cause even more confusion when trying to define their genre. Naming and subgenres Critic Lynn Keller also expresses concerns about the genre in her essay \\"Pushing the Limits.\\" Keller states that because of the debate over and prevalence of subgenres and forms within the overarching genre of long poem, critics and readers tend to choose one subgenre, typically the epic form, as being the \\"authentic\\" representative form of the genre. Therefore, this causes the other equally important subgenres to be subject to criticism for not adhering to the more \\"authentic\\" form of long poem. Other critics of the long poem sometimes hold the belief that with long poems, there is no \\"middle ground.\\" They view long poems as ultimately being either epics or lyrics. Many critics refer to the long poem by various adjective-filled subgenre names that often are made of various components found within the poem. These can lead to confusion about what a long poem is exactly. Below you will find a list describing the most common (and agreed upon) subgenre categories. Advantages of the genre The long poem genre has several advantages over prose and strictly lyric poetry. The most obvious difference between the long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse. Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem. However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage‚Äîif a poet can write a long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy. The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige. Long poems have been among the most influential texts in the world since Homer. By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes. Additional benefits of the long poem: *The long poem provides the artist with a greater space to create great meaning. *A long poem allows the author to be encyclopedic in their treatment of the world, as opposed to the potentially narrow focus of the lyric. *A long poem poet can work on a long poem their entire life, weaving in their impressions gleaned from the span of several generations (and historical events); it can be an ongoing work. *A long poem can encapsulate not just traditional poetry, but incorporate dialogue, prose passages, and even scripting. *A reader can absorb an entire world view from a long poem. Female authors in the genre Elizabeth Barrett Browning was one of the first female authors to attempt an epic poem. In her article \\"Written in blood: the art of mothering epic in the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning\\", Olivia Gatti Taylor explores Browning's attempt to write an authentically feminine epic poem titled Aurora Leigh. Taylor posits that Browning began this process with the structure of her poem, \\"While earlier epics like the Aeneid and Paradise Lost have twelve books, Aurora Leigh was conceived as a nine-book epic; thus, the very structure of the work reveals its gestational nature. According to Sandra Donaldson, Barrett Browning's own experience at age forty-three of \\"giving birth and nurturing a child\\" greatly influenced her poetry \\"for the better\\", deepening her \\"sensitivity\\". In modern times, Lana Del Rey is known to have deep poetry mostly composed of long poems recently published in her book Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass. The book contained 13 Long poems. Genealogy The most important \\"parent genre\\" to the long poem is the epic. An epic is a lengthy, revered narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation. The term \\"long poem\\" includes all the generic expectations of epic and the reactions against those expectations. Many long poem subgenres share characteristics with the epic, including: telling the tale of a tribe or a nation, quests, history (either recitation or re-telling in order to learn from the past), a hero figure, or prophecies. Other subgenres of the long poem include lyric sequence, series, collage, and verse-novel. What unites each of these subgenres under the heading of long poem is that their length has importance in their meaning. Each subgenre, however, is unique in its style, manner of composition, voice, narration, and proximity to outside genres. Sequence poetry uses the chronological linking of poems to construct meaning, as each lyric builds on the poems previous to it. Examples include Louise Gl√ºck's The Wild Iris, and older sonnet cycles, such as Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella or Dante's Vita Nuova. Serial lyrics similarly depend on the juxtaposition and dialogue between individual lyrics to build a greater depth of meaning. Narrative poems rely heavily on Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or overlapped to create second- generation subgenres. The blurring between the lines of the subgenres is what makes the long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity in the use of the form. Subgenres =Epic= The first page of the Beowulf manuscript. Beowulf was one of the first long poems in English. Critic Joseph Conte describes the epic as a long poem that \\"has to have grand voice and purpose. . . it has to say something big.\\" Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a \\"quasi-circular quest-journey structure\\" that she says is present in the long poem Song of Myself by Whitman. Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a \\"specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed,\\" unlike a more traditional long poem. Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic. A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in Helen In Egypt by H.D. Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, Helen In Egypt is about the psychological journey of Helen. Other characteristics of the epic include a hero figure, myths, and quests for the characters. Many such characteristics are seen in various long poems, but with some changes. For example, Helen In Egypt brings mythic revision, or revisionary mythopoesis, into play. Even though it includes the myth from the epic, the revised telling of the myth makes the long poem stand out as its own form. Additionally, one cannot look at the epic as a single, unified form of inspiration for long poems. As Keller points out, certain long poems can have roots in very specific epics instead of the overall epic category. The long poem Omeros by Derek Walcott has drawn mixed criticism on whether it should or should not be tied to the traditional epic form. Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics. Omeros tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests. On the other side of the argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that Omeros has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast. By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off Omeros from any ties to the epic whatsoever. Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer. In Omeros there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc. In interviews, Walcott has both affirmed and denied that Omeros is tied to the epic form. In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem. In Omeros Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might only think of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre. Based on this criticism of Omeros it is clear that the generic identity of a long poem greatly contributes to its meaning. Because long poems are influenced by many more strictly defined genres, a long poem revising strict generic rules creates striking contrast with epic-genre expectations. Keller also notes that she agrees with critic Susan Friedman when Friedman expresses her concern that the long poem associated with the epic has been \\"the quintessential male territory whose boundaries enforce women's status as outsiders on the landscape of poetry.\\" Considering that there are many long poem authors that are women, one cannot fully associate the long poem with the epic genre. However, the typical exclusion of women in the epic tradition is for many female authors what makes the long poem an appealing form for laying cultural claim to the epic. Control of or at least inclusion in the creation of a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil‚Äôs Aeneid is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good and the bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets. If the long poem is considered an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic to tell the story of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott‚Äôs Omeros is an excellent example of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people. Likewise H.D.‚Äôs revision of the story of Helen of Troy in Helen is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility of tradition and history paired with the obvious dependence on them. =Lyric sequence= A lyric sequence is a collection of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics. Critic Lynn Keller lends some insight to the lyric sequence by placing it in opposition to the epic: ‚ÄúAt the opposite end of the critical spectrum are the treatments of the long poem that do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric. =Lyric series= The lyric series is a genre of poetry in which the seriality of short (but connective) lyric poems enhances the long poem's meaning. Seriality may contribute narrative coherence or thematic development, and it is often read in terms of the poem's productive process, i.e. how the poem \\"produces its own experience\\"(Shoptaw). Each lyric poem is distinct and has meaning in itself, yet it functions as an integral part of the series, giving it a greater meaning as within the long poem as well. Deborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian Laurie examine the work of Oton de Grandson in the lyric series, or \\"ballad series\\" form. Grandson wrote several sets of short love lyrics, using the series form for narrative coherence and thematic construction, as well as to examine different aspects of a single narrative. George Oppen's Discrete Series relates its poetic seriality to the mathematic concept of a discrete series. Langston Hughes' Montage of a Dream Deferred qualifies as a serial lyric as well as a montage. =Collage/Montage= The best-known and most highly regarded example of a collage long poem is T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land. Critic Philip Cohen describes Eliot's use of the collage in his article \\"The Waste Land, 1921: Some Developments of the Manuscript's Verse\\": \\"Eliot gradually created a more modernist poem, one which resembles a cubist collage: satiric narratives were abandoned in favor of first of dramatic poetry and then of a bold amalgamation of genres. The speakers shifted from omniscient narrators to a variety of separate-person voices and then to different voices of one shadowy character.\\" The collage combines seemingly disparate parts or \\"fragments\\" of different voices, pieces of mythology, popular song, speeches, and other utterances in an attempt to create a somewhat cohesive whole. The best known Bengali long poem is JAKHAM (The Wound) written by Malay Roy Choudhury of India during the famous Hungryalist movement in 1960s. A montage is similar to a collage in that it consists of many voices, most famously portrayed in Langston Hughes' Montage of a Dream Deferred. The poet provides a comprehensive portrait of 20th century Harlem through the use of numerous different voices and thus creates a cohesive whole through this fragmentary lens. What is perhaps the most debatable characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view. This debate is clearly visible within Langston Hughes' Montage in the question of who the primary voice belongs to and what is added by having Harlem shown through multiple people, as opposed to Hughes simply speaking from his own understanding of what makes Harlem. =Verse-narrative= A verse narrative, as one might expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to its place in the flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative. As one of the main subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least attention because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of a Lyric Sequence or a Lyric Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition. =Romantic long poem= The critic Lilach Lachman describes the Romantic long poem as one that, \\"questioned the coherence of the conventional epic's plot, its logic of time and space, and its laws of interconnecting the narrative through action.\\" Examples of the Romantic long poem is Keats' long poem Hyperion: A Fragment (1820), William Wordsworth's Recluse (Including the Prelude (1850), and The Excursion), and Percy Bysshe Shelley's Prometheus Unbound. The Romance long poem contains many of the same components of the Romance Lyric. Michael O'Neil suggests that \\"much romantic poetry is torn out of its own despair\\" and, in fact, can exist as the tremulous fusion between \\"self-trust and self-doubt.\\" =Meditations= Meditations are reflective thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can be somewhat fragmented, yet their connectivity is what makes the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre is based on meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely on the use of multiple voices. In her essay \\"The Twentieth Century Long Poem,\\" Lynn Keller states that a more philosophical influence on these meditative long poems deals with relating imagination to reality, specifically in long poems by Wallace Stevens. Keller notes, \\"Uninterested in American landscape, American history, modern mechanical triumphs, or the urban scene, his process-oriented long poems are speculative philosophical works exploring the relation of imagination to reality and the imagination's role in compensating for the loss of religious belief.\\" W. H. Auden's New Year Letter is an example of a long- form meditative poem.

Segovia Cathedral is the Gothic-style Roman Catholic cathedral located in the main square (Plaza Mayor) of the city of Segovia, in the community of Castile-Leon, Spain. The church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was built in a Gothic style in the mid-16th century. History The massive cathedral was built between 1525-1577 in a late Gothic style, outdated elsewhere in Europe. The previous cathedral of Segovia had stood adjacent to the Alcazar, and had been used by the royal armies in defending the latter against siege. The rebellious Comuneros were intent on taking the Cathedral to protect its holy relics, and to use its position against the walls of the Alcazar in order to defeat its defenders. In a famous exchange, prominent city officials urged the comuneros to halt their attacks on the church, saying they should consider the injustice of razing so sumptuous a temple while making war against those who, serving their king, defended his Alcazar. But their plea fell on deaf ears, and the comuneros replied: la Iglesia era de la Ciudad (the Church belonged to the City).Historia de la insigne ciudad de Segovia, Volumen 3. By Diego de Colmenares, page 60 After a bitter siege lasting months, the cathedral lay in ruins. Overall view of the Cathedral of Segovia, Castilla y L√©on, Spain and the surrounding Jewish Quarter of the city (la Juder√≠a) Due to fears of a repeat assault, the cathedral was relocated to the present site and built using a design by the Trasmeran mason named Juan Gil de Honta√±√≥n, and the work was continued by his son Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n. The building's structure features three tall vaults and an ambulatory, with fine tracery windows and numerous stained glass windows. The interior is characterized by unity of style (late Gothic), except for the dome, built around 1630 by Pedro de Brizuela. The Gothic vaults are 33 meters high by 50 meters wide and 105 long. The bell tower reaches almost 90 meters. The current stone spire crowning the tower, dating from 1614, was erected after a major fire caused by a thunderstorm. The original spire, entirely Gothic, was built of American mahogany, had a pyramidal structure, and was the tallest tower in Spain. Among the most prominent chapels are that of the Sant√≠simo Sacramento, with a Reredo by Jos√© de Churriguera, the Chapel of San Andr√©s, with a Tryptich of the Deposition by Ambrosius Benson, the Chapel of Piety with the Entombment by Juan de Juni, ; and the chapel of the Deposition with the recumbent Christ by Gregorio Fern√°ndez.

It is adorned with the Segovian Saints Frutos, Geroteo, Valent√≠n and Engracia. The choir has gothic seating.

Marezige is a sprawling settlement, 10 km from Koper. There are vineyards with Refosco and Malvasia grapes, and olives. Name The origin of the name Marezige is unknown. It is probably a secondary borrowing from a Romance name that was originally borrowed from Slavic, and may be derived from a person name. History The municipality of Marezige was founded on August 24, 1898 and it belonged to the province of Istria. It consisted of three cadastral municipalities: Marezige, Tru≈°ke, and Bor≈°t. The economic development of Marezige was supported by the creation of a savings bank and a loan bank. After the First World War, Istria was annexed by Italy. The authorities persecuted the Slovenian population and closed Slovenian schools. On May 15, 1921, a group of locals challenged the fascists in Marezige. The Municipality of Koper celebrates its municipal holiday in commemoration of this event, and the primary school in Marezige was named after Ivan Babiƒç, who led the rebellion.

It is located on the northernmost edge of the Istrian peninsula, on the border with Italy, on a small hill overlooking the Gulf of Trieste.Koper municipal site It has a small border crossing with Italy, connecting it with the nearby village of Belpoggio in Noghere (), south of Trieste, which used to be a hamlet of Plavje (until 1954). Since Slovenia's accession to the European Union and the Schengen area, customs and immigration checks have been abolished at the Italian-Slovenian border. Geography and climate Plavje is located on a small slope overlooking the Gulf of Trieste and Koper Bay. It is located on the border with Italy, which runs on the northern edge of the village. It has good road connections to Koper and Trieste because it is located above the highway connecting the two cities. It enjoys a mild climate, safe for the strong bora wind that frequently blows in the winter. History During most of its history, Plavje was part of the municipality of Muggia. From the 14th century until 1797 it was part of the Republic of Venice. Between 1805 and 1813, it was under Napoleonic French rule. After Napoleon's defeat, it was included in the Austrian Empire, as part of the Margravate of Istria within the Austrian Littoral. According to the last Austrian census of 1910/1911, the village had 771 inhabitants, of which 78.3% were Slovenes and 18.5% Istrian Italians.http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:836 The rest were mostly Croats and Italians from the Kingdom of Italy. In 1907, a Slovene language primary school was opened in the village. In November 1918, the village was occupied by Italian troops and officially annexed to Italy in 1920. During World War II, partisan anti-Fascist guerillas were active in the area. The first cell of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People in Slovenian Istria was organized in Plavje in early December 1941. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, it was occupied by Nazi German forces and included in the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast. Many locals were arrested and sent to prisons and Nazi concentration camps. In 1944, around 20 women from the village, were accused of collaboration with the Yugoslav partisans and were rounded up and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The village was liberated by the Yugoslav People's Army on May 1, 1945. In early June 1945, the Yugoslav Army retreated east of the Morgan Line, and Plavje was occupied by British and American troops. The village was thus placed on the very border between Yugoslav and Anglo-American occupation zones, and became a centre of smuggling. Between 1947 and 1954, Plavje was part of Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste. It remained under Anglo-American occupation until 1954, when it was ceded to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, thus cutting off its connections with the settlements of Muggia, Dolina and Trieste, which were left in Italy. Since then, it has been gravitating towards Koper. A local border crossing with Italy was opened northwest of village in 1955. In 1991, it became part of independent Slovenia. During the Ten-Day War of 1991, some intensive fighting took place close to the village, at the international border crossing between Rabuiese, Italy and Spodnje ≈†kofije, Slovenia. Since 1991, it has mostly become a bedroom community of Koper, with most locals daily commuting to the town for work. Economy Plavje is an important center of local olive oil production. It also produces some quality wines, especially Refosco and Malvasia. Nevertheless, agriculture is a part- time activity because most of the people commute to Koper for work. Culture and traditions The great majority of the population of the village are Slovenes, and they speak the Ri≈æana subdialect of the Istrian dialect.

Name Socerb was attested in written sources in the 14th century as propre Sanctum Servulum (and in 1763‚Äì87 as St. Servolo). The Slovene name is derived from *S«´t-Serb: a combination of *s«´t- 'saint' (ultimately from Latin sanctus) plus *Serb (from Servu(lus), the name of a local saint, or from Servus, a 5th-century martyr in Thuburbo Majus).
