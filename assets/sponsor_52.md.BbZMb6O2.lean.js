She is an officer of the Order of Canada and a recipient of the Governor General‚Äôs Award.  Early life  Rita Letendre was born the eldest of seven children to Anne-Marie Ledoux and H√©liodore Letendre in Drummondville, Quebec. Despite her father working as a mechanic and obtaining trucking contracts when possible, life for them was difficult and the family lived in poverty. Following a serious injury to one of her fingers in 1931, Letendre was sent to live with Marianna Ledoux, her maternal grandmother, in Saint-Francois-du-Lac. There, she thrived in a more relaxed atmosphere where she could play, read, pick flowers, take boat rides and more importantly, escape her turbulent home life. The planned visit was to last for a year but continued until she was old enough to attend school. At school, Rita was fascinated, this being her first opportunity to be stimulated intellectually. In 1935, the family moved to Saint-Majorique-de-Grantham, near Drummondville, where integration to the community was difficult ‚Äì here, she and her siblings (being of Abenaki heritage on their father‚Äôs side) experienced the prejudices experienced by many First Nations children that were incessant and often violent. Although she learned to defend herself well, she ultimately preferred solitude. To escape the hate that surrounded her, she created her own happier worlds, drawn in her schoolbooks. In 1941, the family moved back to Drummondville where she enrolled in her first year of high school but before she could return for a second year, the family moved to downtown Montreal and Letendre had to stay home to take care of her five younger siblings while both of her parents took jobs for the war effort. This period of her life was a blessing in disguise; she continued drawing in the evenings, she was able to devour books as fast as she could get her hands on them, she discovered Opera on the radio which became a lifelong love, and she discovered famous master works of art in books at the library which she had heard about on the radio. By 1946 she was desperate to escape her family duties; first taking a factory job, then working as a restaurant cashier, she left home to live with her boyfriend with whom she had a son, Jacques. It did not last and Rita separated from Jacques' father ‚Äî Jacques was eventually raised by his maternal grandmother.  √âcole des Beaux-Arts  RL-51 - Very early small format abstract painting by Rita Letendre, 1951 Sunforce ‚Äì Hard edge style mural by Rita Letendre, 1965. Sunrise ‚Äì Pastel on paper by Rita Letendre, 1989. The Beginning of Days ‚Äì Recent abstract style painting by Rita Letendre, 2007. At age 19, while working at a restaurant in mid-town Montreal, a patron had seen some of the sketches she was working on when business became quiet and was struck by her talent. Practically insisting she enrol in the √âcole des Beaux- Arts (of which Letendre had never heard), he picked her up at home, took her to the school and stood at the bottom of the steps ensuring she entered, then continued to stand there long enough for her to be asked if she was enrolling ‚Äì the answer was \\"Yes\\". After several questionnaires and a practical exam, she was accepted. It was there that she met friends Gilles Groulx, and Ulysse Comtois who was to be her boyfriend and partner for over 15 years. There she worked in a very academic atmosphere for a year and a half. In 1950 she went to view an art show \\"L‚ÄôExposition des Rebelles\\" (despite being largely condemned by her professors) and befriended the show organizer Jean-Paul Mousseau ‚Äì this was her introduction to the circle of Borduas and the Automatistes. Soon thereafter, she left l'Ecole des Beaux-Art.  The Automatistes  Paul-√âmile Borduas (the main force behind the libertarian manifesto Refus Global) was probably the greatest influence to Rita‚Äôs life as a painter ‚Äì he believed self-knowledge was the key to producing highly personal work. Borduas was described by her as being \\"very nice, very intelligent, and very sensitive ‚Äì he respected people\\". When she was mocked for painting figurative images, Borduas would defend her insisting figurative painting or non-figurative painting was still painting.‚ÄúMore than meets the eye: Rita Letendre can tell you where the partridge is‚Äù, Quest, John Lownsbrough, 1982 By 1951 Letendre had abandoned figuration and threw herself wholeheartedly into painting in abstraction. She began showing with the Automatistes in store windows and on fences in St-Louis Square in Montreal and lived mostly on beans and spaghetti.  The Plasticiens  Her first official group show was in 1955 at the Henri Tranquille bookstore in Montreal alongside other first and second generation Automatistes. Eventually her work was noticed, most notably by artist/art critic Rodolphe de Repentigny (the major force behind the Plasticiens who espoused the philosophies of Piet Mondrian and the virtues of geometric form in art).‚ÄùManifeste des Plasticiens‚Äù, Repentigny et al.,1955 Impressed by the structure and form in the works of the Plasticiens, Letendre began changing her style to a more geometric one, employing more structured colour fields, zones of energy, thus temporarily abandoning the purely instinctual approach of Automatisme. She showed at Espace 55 with the Plasticiens ‚Äì the exhibition was shown in Quebec, Montr√©al, Rimouski and Toronto ‚Äì the same year she had her first solo show at L‚ÄôEchourie in Montreal.  Zen and Abstract Expressionism  In the late 1950s, having internalized the ideas of the Plasticiens, she abandoned the confines of geometric works and began studying the ideas of Zen and Confucius; these ideas began to translate into her paintings characterized by lines and strokes in black and white. She was also struck by the work of the Abstract Expressionists in New York and in particular, impressed by the work of Franz Kline. Many of these elements and themes would be revisited in the works that soon followed, increasing in gestural quality and characterized with heavy impasto with a palette knife or spatula. Her production began to increase and Letendre began to come into her own, winning first prize in the Concours de la Jeune Peinture in 1959 and the Prix Rodolphe-de-Repentigny in 1960. This prize (worth $300) and the additional sales that followed enabled Letendre to quit her job and paint full-time ‚Äì it also allowed her to buy more paint and canvas than she dreamed possible.‚ÄúMore than meets the eye: Rita Letendre can tell you where the partridge is‚Äù, Quest, John Lownsbrough, 1982 Armed with better paint, more colors and more material, she began painting larger works in explosions of violent color ‚ÄúRita Letendre ‚Äì Sous la Ligne du Feu‚Äù, Jean Sarrazin, Le Nouveau Journal 1961 and won second prize in the painting category in the Concours artistiques du Qu√©bec in 1961. Her compositions were intensely personal, more carefully planned; she began anchoring masses with carefully visualized gestures which would often take hours to visualize and execute.\\"World of Art - Letendre‚Äù, Robert Fulford, Toronto Star, March 24, 1962 Having secured a Canada Council grant in 1962, she travelled with Ulysse Comtois throughout Europe for the next year and a half. This was a productive period and she sent large groups of works home; the beginnings of her hard edge style also began, where more well defined masses or wedges would evoke vibration, movement and collisions. In Italy she showed at Spolete, won a gold medal at Piccola Europa in Sassaferator, and met Russian-born sculptor Kosso Eloul. On Eloul‚Äôs invitation to work in one of his studios, she travelled with Ulysse Comtois to paint in Israel.  Hard Edge  In 1964, her works became considerably simplified, more focused on geometric shapes and movement. She travelled to Paris for 3 months and ended her relationship with Ulysse Comtois; by the end of the year she was in a new relationship with Kosso Eloul. When he took a teaching position at California State College at Long Beach in March 1964, Letendre went with him. In California, two key opportunities availed her. The first was a commission to paint Sunforce a large mural executed on a campus building. Sunforce represents a critical turning point in her technique. In the context of California with its Light and Space Group, her impasto work may have seemed to make no sense. Also, due to the massive scale of the mural, her current impasto technique was impractical and she was forced to adapt to the flat plane of the mural surface. In Sunforce, the image suggests a large mass that drops, and continues to drop as though it would continue through the bottom and off the painting. The second, was the opportunity to learn printmaking, lithography and eventually silk screen, a technique conducive to hard-edge shapes. The couple left Los Angeles in 1969, alternating their time between New York and Toronto (which would continue until 1975) and the demand for her work increased. In New York, galleries were purchasing entire series‚Äô of 100 prints outright. One day in 1971 someone suggested she might obtain a better effect on her long lines/rays if she used an airbrush; hesitant at first, she began using it more and more, then eventually used it all of the time. She found that airbrush brought her something new, something that neither oil, nor acrylic, nor the millions of lines she had made in the 1970s had succeeded in bringing her. The popularity of her work continued with many public and private commissions for large scale works and murals including one covering the top six stories of the Neill-Wycik college residence at Ryerson University in Toronto, the first of its kind in Canada. She was also commissioned to design a huge coloured skylight for the ceiling of Glencairn (TTC) subway station in Toronto entitled Joy; it was eventually removed at Letendre‚Äôs request because the panels had faded after being exposed to many years of sunlight. In 1973, she began to soften some of the edges in her works, a trend that would continue the next few years; this resulted in a myriad of horizontal landscape compositions often containing a few or even only one thin hard edge line.  Pastel  She began experimenting with pastels in 1980 and produced a remarkable series in 1982 inspired by the nearby Nevada landscape while staying with her husband in Beverly Hills as he recovered from heart surgery. Pastels and the techniques she developed with them afforded her an opportunity to create a soft edge effect in landscape like compositions using a completely different medium.  Reversion to oil and current work  By 1995 she worked in heavier oils again, abandoning the airbrush completely, and controlled her gestural compositions with brush, palette knife and her bare hands. Her husband, Kosso Eloul, died later that year, and she took a long break from painting.‚ÄùRita Letendre‚Äôs Paintings Take You to a Higher Elevation‚Äù, Bernard Mendelman, The Suburban, 1997. In the summer of 1997 she returned to painting and continued to show and develop her style. After having sold her house in Toronto, she moved back to Montreal in 2004. She went on to be awarded the Order of Canada in 2005, an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Montreal and the Governor General‚Äôs Award in 2010 and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. At 87, Letendre has continued to produce and show works created as recently as 2014. In 2017 her work was included in the exhibition, The Ornament of a House: Fifty Years of Collecting at the Burnaby Art Gallery Her work also appeared in an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2017, Fire and Ice, which was said to be long overdue.

History In 1896, Loyola College was founded by English-speaking Canadian Jesuits. It was the English-speaking section of Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie de Montr√©al and split off to become its own institution.

In 1966, a new church was built as a separate structure apart from the college. In 1968 discussions begun to merge Loyola College with other colleges. This resulted with the creation of Concordia University on 24 August 1974. In 1982, Loyola High School moved to new building and the Jesuits handed over administration of the church to the Archdiocese of Montreal who continue to serve the parish.Chronology from Jesuits in Canada, retrieved 25 March 2014 Ignatian Centre Ignatian Centre Next to the church is the Ignatian Centre. The building itself dates back to 1910. St. Ignatius church is situated in what used to be the house's garden. It was the first building on West Broadway Street. After the First World War the Jesuits bought the building as a residence for teachers on the upper floor and an elementary school on the ground floor. With the merger of Loyola College to form Concordia University, the building ceased to have a purpose. In 1976, the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Montreal, Leonard Crowley asked the English-speaking Jesuits to create a spirituality centre and promoted the benefits of spiritual direction to local the English-speaking population. That year, the house was renovated at a cost of $40,000 to turn it into a spirituality centre.History from IgnatianCentreMTL.ca, retrieved 25 March 2014 The centre offers prayers guides, direction in Ignatian spirituality and a 'daily life' program.

Arnold, a former Enron trader and American hedge fund manager, and his wife Laura Arnold. The organization was founded in 2008, the same year that the Arnolds signed the Giving Pledge, a pledge by some high-net-worth individuals to donate a large fraction of their income to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes. The foundation has funded a wide range of interventions, including Oregon's open primary ballot, health (opioids, contraceptive choice and access, drug prices, commercial sector prices, complex care), education reform, efforts to end public pensions, a data-first approach to criminal justice, and improving reproducibility and transparency in science through the funding of open science and metascience. The organization has also been described as \\"another example of billionaire donors becoming ever more sophisticated about using private wealth to influence public policy‚Äîwielding exponentially more power in American life than ordinary citizens of more modest means.\\" History and controversy Arnold started donating to the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) in 2004 with a gift of $30,000 which was then based in Houston, and two years later he and his wife pledged $10 million to help KIPP expand to other cities. Other multi- million gifts followed to other education programs, for example to Washington, D.C. city schools for merit pay, to Teach for America, and to StudentsFirst. Since 2008, the foundation has invested more than $1 billion in a variety of political initiatives, focusing on pensions, pretrial and criminal justice, prescription drug prices, the quality of academic research, combating predatory higher education practices, the evaluation of social programs, school system governance, and electoral reform. In the period 2011‚Äì2016, LJAF made $684 million in grants, distributed as follows: $75 million for criminal justice, $206 million for education, $147 million for evidence-based policy and innovation, $1.5 million for planning, $81 million for research integrity, $5 million for science and technology, $56 million for sustainable public finance, and $112 million for new initiatives. In August 2012, the foundation launched the Giving Library to help other philanthropists make their gifts more efficient and effective. This data-driven approach has caused major controversies: *In 2013, LJAF starting making a web-based tool available to assist courts in better assessing whether to release people on bail or keep them imprisoned after they are arrested but before the trial begins. The foundation was sued by the families of two victims, the perpetrators of which were released due to this \\"public safety assessment tool. One released murderer had \\"violated two probations. He was a convicted felon. And he had a gun charge just five days before the murder.\\" Despite this, the foundation \\"plans to make the tool available nationwide via an undisclosed national technical systems provider.\\" *In 2016, the foundation funded continuous aerial surveillance of Baltimore, Maryland. The Baltimore Sun reported that the foundation donated $360,000 to fund a controversial surveillance program in Baltimore that conducted secret, warrantless aerial surveillance of Baltimoreans on behalf of the Baltimore Police Department. The BPD conducted the surveillance without informing elected officials or the general public, suspending the program after public revelation. *In 2019, the Metropolitan Crime Commission released a report calling the \\"public safety assessment tool\\" a \\"waste of money\\" and concluded that the tool \\"underrates the risk offenders pose to public safety.\\" In August 2019, Arnold Ventures recruited GOP operative Kevin Madden as head of advocacy. Madden is a former press secretary to disgraced House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and national spokesperson for both of Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns Areas of focus The Arnolds have used an investment management approach to giving, and as of 2013, the foundation targeted some of its giving to low risk, well-established institutions to help maintain their efforts and most of its giving to higher risk efforts that the Arnolds view as having a higher potential to drive change over the long term. =Criminal justice= In the period 2011‚Äì2016, LJAF allocated $75 million in grants for its criminal justice initiative. An overview of criminal justice reform in the United States by GiveWell listed the Arnold Foundation as one of the top foundations in the United States working in the area, along with the Open Society Foundation, The Pew Charitable Trusts Public Safety Performance Project, the Ford Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, the Public Welfare Foundation, and the Smith Richardson Foundation. Anne Milgram worked as the Attorney General for the state of New Jersey where she worked to bring data to bear on the New Jersey state justice system and became a professor at New York University; she was recruited by the foundation to become its vice president for criminal justice. In a 2013 TED talk, she explained her work at LJAF creating tools to capture and use data to make the justice system more effective and efficient, which she called \\"Moneyballing crime\\". This was not well received. The Leadership Conference Education Fund had 120 criminal justice organizations sign a statement pushing for the halt of pretrial risk assessment instruments, stating \\"although they may seem objective or neutral ‚Äì threaten to further intensify unwarranted discrepancies in the justice system and to provide a misleading and undeserved imprimatur of impartiality for an institution that desperately needs fundamental change.\\" Despite this uncertainty, the foundation also funds the Data Collaborative for Justice. =K-12 education= According to their list of grants, they have spent $206 million on grants related to education, including supporting donating to a new fund led by the disgraced Mike Feinberg, founder of KIPP, after allegations of sexual abuse. In May 2012, Reuters reported that the Laura and John Arnold Foundation had committed $20 million over a five-year period to an initiative called StudentsFirst, led by Michelle Rhee, who used to head the Washington D.C. public school system. StudentsFirst reported its spending shortly thereafter. On June 26, 2012, the foundation launched the ERIN Project, a tool to help analyze the national K-12 education landscape. During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, the foundation announced that it would be donating $10 million in emergency funds to the Head Start program so that some 7,000 kids from low-income families could continue to receive educational services. The programs were at risk because their Federal grants were up for renewal after October 1. The federal government reinstated Head Start funding in a deal approved by Congress on January 13, 2014. Laura and John Arnold are listed as one of the biggest benefactors to the Wikimedia Foundation.Wikipedia 15 Contributors Retrieved January 15, 2016. =Public accountability= The foundation has funded various politically-oriented 501(c)4 organizations, including Engage Rhode Island. Many of these organizations advocate pension fund reform, encourage state and local governments to reduce benefits to workers and to invest assets in riskier investments such as hedge funds. Some have criticized the foundation's efforts, saying that hedge fund managers (like John Arnold) collect generous sums in fees for managing the funds, while the workers are left with reduced pensions. LJAF's attempts at pension reform have been met with hostility, and critics have argued that they have bought out groups such as the Pew Charitable Trust, the Public Broadcasting Service, and the Brookings Institution. LJAF has, in particular, generated controversial media coverage in connection with its funding of initiatives favoring pension reform. In March 2014, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that Pensions and Investments had asked the Pew Charitable Trust to stop taking money from LJAF because of LJAF's support for pension reform. In July 2014, the Arnold Foundation donated $2.8 million to the Center for Public Integrity to launch a new project focused on state campaign finance. According to the International Business Times, \\"as CPI was negotiating the Arnold grant, Arnold‚Äôs name was absent from a CPI report on pension politics.\\" Arnold has spent at least $28 million on a campaign to roll back pension benefits for public workers. Despite this spend,‚ÄúWhen people hear of an effort to get rid of pensions,‚Äù says Bailey Childers of the National Public Pension Coalition (NPPC), which is supported by unions, ‚Äúthe source is almost always John Arnold.‚Äù =Research integrity= One of the first projects funded by the foundation was research into obesity, which was drawn to Arnold's attention when he heard an interview with Gary Taubes on the EconTalk podcast. Subsequent conversation between Arnold and Taubes led to the foundation funding the Nutrition Science Initiative in San Diego, where Taubes and Peter Attia are trying to find the cause of obesity. The foundation backs the Action Now Initiative (ANI), a 501(c)4 organization which in turn funds The Nutrition Coalition (TNC), which works to reshape the process by which the Dietary Guidelines for America are formulated. TNC backed Nina Teicholz's disputation of the role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease, expressed in an article for The BMJ, and through lobbyists arranged for her to meet with government officials to advance an ultimately successful campaign to insert a request for a National Academy of Medicine review of the guideline process. In 2013, the foundation funded the launch of the Center for Open Science with a $5.25 million grant and by 2017 had provided an additional $10 million in funding. It also funded the launch of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford at Stanford University run by John Ioannidis and Steven Goodman to study ways to improve scientific research. It also provided funding for the AllTrials initiative led in part by Ben Goldacre. LJAF has published guidelines, based on the Open Science Framework, that anybody seeking research funding from them must follow. As of 2017 it had given around $80 million in grants under its \\"Research Integrity\\" initiative.

Preferring calcrete, limestone outcrops and soils, the species often forms pure communities, or grows in association with Colophospermum mopane, Rhigozum virgatum, Phaeoptilum spinosum and Acacia nebrownii. It is parasitised by several Tapinanthus spp. The specific name honours James Edward Alexander, the Victorian soldier and explorer, while the generic name refers to leaves and flowers arising from below the paired, decussate, opposite spines. Leaves are tufted (fascicled) or opposite, and densely tomentose and grey. They are simple and elliptic to obovate, up to 4 cm long, and with coarsely dentate or scalloped margins. The white or pink flowers, produced after rain, are about 10 cm in length, fragrant, showy or specious, 5-lobed, and with a yellow throat. Inside the tube there is a broad, villous band below the origin of the filaments. The calyx is tubular with linear teeth, and slit on one side. The fruit is a flattened, woody capsule, some 10 cm long, warty and splitting or dehiscing across the flat faces into two equal parts. Old fruits are pendant and produce a characteristic clicking sound in light breezes, caused by the castanet-like tapping of the two hollow parts. Seeds are papery and winged.\\"Wild Flowers of the Limpopo Valley\\" - vd Walt, Retief, Marais (2009) Descriptions of this species appeared in \\"Ann. Nat. Hist.\\" ii. (1839) 375;‚Äî\\"Proc. Linn.

Ranjana‚Äôs performances bear the signature of a distinctive style because of her extensive training in Chhau, Kathak and Manipuri as well. It has widened her knowledge and understanding of Indian classical dance. Such a background has led her to boldly explore and reach out to other creative expressions such as authoring a book ‚ÄúOdissi, The Dance Divine‚Äù, which was released on the 13 February, 2007. The book not only delves into the evolution and aesthetics of Odissi dance but also introduces to the readers the architect and contemporary gurus and eminent dancers of this living tradition, Odissi. Padmashree Ranjana Gauhar who received her training under the legendary Guru Mayadhar Rout and Ms. Aloka Paniker, is a graduate in Philosophy Honours and a postgraduate in English Literature. Not surprisingly, her education and creative skills saw her rise in name and fame in her pursuit of art at a pace few can match. Her talent in blending the traditional with the contemporary, her imagery, which is both innovative and individualistic, has made Ranjana all the more appealing to the audience at home and abroad. Gaiety, grace and strength are the hall marks of Ranjana‚Äôs performances, compelling the spell-bound audiences to describe her recital as an experience in sublime spiritual odyssey. Ranjana has also produced and directed a number of ballets depicting modern and mythological themes. Ranjana has travelled with her art of Odissi dance across the length and breadth of the country.

He was aligned with Father Le Loutre throughout Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War. The British killed his father when he was younger, which he tried to avenge by killing one of Jean- Baptiste Cope‚Äôs prisoners. Peace Proposal (1754) He also sought to support Le Loutre, John Hamilton, and Mi‚Äôkmaq attempts to have the British acknowledge their land claims early in 1755. When this initiative was rejected and Fort Beausejour fell, Laurent joined Father Manach and Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert‚Äôs armed resistance against the British. Battle at St. Aspinquid's Chapel Tradition indicates that during the French and Indian War, Lahave Chief Paul Laurent and a party of eleven invited Shubenacadie Chief Jean- Baptiste Cope and five others to St. Aspinquid‚Äôs Chapel in present-day Point Pleasant Park to negotiate peace with the British.Awalt basis his account on the basis stories from 17 separate Mi'kmaq accounts from 11 different locations in Nova Scotia (See Don Awalt.The Mi‚Äôkmaq and Point Pleasant Park. 2004 ). Chief Paul Laurent had just arrived in Halifax after surrendering to the British at Fort Cumberland on 29 February 1760.See In early March 1760, the two parties met and engaged in armed conflict.None of the oral accounts give the exact date of the battle. Awalt is left to speculate about the date of the battle, which he asserts might be in May 1758 just before the siege of Louisbourg. The evidence contradicts this assertion and suggests that the date was more likely March 1760. The two main players of the conflict - Paul Laurant and Jean-Baptiste Cope - both could not have been in Halifax in 1758 as indicated. Laurent was not seeking peace in 1758. Throughout the war Laurent fought the British and did not surrender until 29 February 1760 at Fort Cumberland. The only evidence of Chief Paul being in Halifax after 1755 is when he travels there over the following weeks to sign a peace treaty on March 10, 1760 (See ; also see March 10, 1750. Chief Paul and Governor Lawrence. Andrew Browns Manuscripts. British Museum. Nova Scotia Archives as cited by Daniel Paul. We were not the Savages). Further, Cope could not have died before the Siege of Louisbourg because French Officer Chevalier de Johnstone indicated that he saw Cope at Miramichi after the Siege of Louisbourg when Johnstone was en route to Quebec (See Johnstone, p. 46). Chief Paul Larent's party killed Cope and two others. Chief Cope‚Äôs party killed five of the British supporters. Shortly after Cope's death, Mi'kmaq chiefs signed a peace treaty in Halifax on 10 March 1760. Chief Paul Laurent signed on behalf of the Lahave tribe and a new chief, Claude Rene, signed on behalf of the Shubenacadie tribe.See Daniel N. Paul erroneously asserts that \\"the record shows Cope was still alive in the 1760s, which indicates he may have lived to a ripe old age\\" (See Daniel Paul). The last record of Cope is by Johnstone (1758). The Chief of the Shebenacadie was replaced in 1760, indicating that Cope was dead.Paul Laurent's biographer Michael Johnston notes that another chief from La Heve signed another treaty with the English on 9 Nov. 1761. (During this time of surrender and treaty making, tensions among the various factions who fought the British were evident. For example, a few months after the death of Cope, the Mi'kmaq militia and Acadian militias made the rare decisions to continue to fight despite losing the support of the French priests who were encouraging surrender.)

The company was founded as Grupo Leche Pascual in 1969 by Tom√°s Pascual. It changed name as Calidad Pascual in January 2014. Grupo Leche Pascual logo used until January 2014.  History  In 1969, Leche Pascual was born in Aranda de Duero, Burgos, the result of the entrepreneurial and innovative vision of its founder, Don Tom√°s Pascual Sanz. Since its birth, the company has offered new products year after year. Pioneer since its inception, Pascual was the first company to market long-lasting milk in the Spanish market. He also introduced the brik packaged milk. Later it was the first brand to release skim milk and then semi-skim milk. Shortly after the company begins a stage of diversification, going from being a company that only produced milk to gradually enter other sectors. Thus, with the purchase of the Bezoya, Agua de Card√≥ and Zambra springs, the group positioned itself strongly in the mineral water market. The launch of the Zumosol brand quickly made the company the leader in the juice market. Shortly after came the turn of butter, cream and milks with juice through the launch of Bio Frutas (today, Bifrutas), creating a new category of functional foods. Another of the company's great technological innovation milestones was the launch of the ultrapasteurized liquid egg, the risk of salmonella disappearing completely. In 1994, Pascual began its international expansion, focused mainly on the export of pasteurized yogurts and long-lasting desserts. Pascual obtained in 199 the Grade A approval granted by the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for the export of pasteurized yogurts to the United States, becoming the first company, outside the United States, to achieve the highest quality certification of the administration American The entry into the 21st century begins with the launch in 2002 of Vivesoy, soy-based drinks and juices, creator of a new category of vegetable drinks in the Spanish consumer market, while in 2003 M√°sVital, the first food, was born Pascual prebiotic. In 2005, Pascual once again pioneered the launch of the first aseptic PET plastic bottle for packaging of Uperisada Milk, ensuring the same quality in this new packaging as tetra brik. That same year, it launched its new product line Zumos Pascual, the first freshly squeezed orange juice on the market that does not need cold thanks to the latest technology in its production. 2006 is remembered for the death of Don Tom√°s Pascual Sanz, founder of the company, producing a generational change in ownership with the incorporation to the presidency of his eldest son Tom√°s Pascual G√≥mez-Cu√©tara, who had been occupying the position of CEO since 1996 . The Tom√°s Pascual Sanz Institute sees the light in 2007, an entity designed to maintain the legacy of the founder in pursuit of health and quality of life, having since focused its activity on the dissemination of healthy habits, nutrition and health until 2017, year of celebrating its X anniversary. A year later, Pascual's effort to advance in the management of its human resources is endorsed with the EFR certification, Family Responsible Company. 2010 stands out for the acquisition of Mocay caff√© to develop the Pascual hotel offer. During this stage, the company continues to focus on improving its management systems with the integral quality as a flag, as guaranteed in 2012 obtaining the seal of European excellence 400 + EFQM In 2013 Pascual created the company Qualianza, as a distribution company for its products as well as the brands with which it reaches alliances. In this way, Qualianza Integral Distribution Services will allow the company's commercial activity to be extended. The launch of the DiaBalance food product range for diabetics is also taking place, as a result of the partnership with Esteve Laboratories. Likewise, Pascual obtains the Five Star Ecostar environmental certification for its sustainable fleet, as well as the ‚ÄúEquality in the Company‚Äù badge of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality. 2014 marks a before and after with the presentation of the company's new corporate identity, becoming known as Paschal Quality. The following year, Pascual Quality reinforces its commitment to hospitality, one of its strategic commercial channels, with the launch of ‚ÄúExtra Creme‚Äù Easter milk, a specialized milk for the hospitality channel. 2016 was the year in which Pascual Quality extended its conception of innovation to the whole society through its Pascual Startup initiative, which supports Spanish entrepreneurs with ideas related to the agri-food sector. On the other hand, in the month of October, Pascual Quality enters the Royal Order of Sports Merit for its support of the Olympic sport. As for the launches, examples such as the new 0% Skimmed Easter Milk, ColaCao Shake or the new Zero Forks attest to the commitment to innovation. The year 2017 is a period of change, of consolidation of leadership, with a new organizational structure and advances in the objective of digital transformation and the extension of an innovative culture throughout the organization. The challenges are not only to value the products, but also all the initiatives focused on improving the value chain and relations with all the company's stakeholders through an ethical, responsible and excellent management.

Lorenz Natter Life Lorenz was born 21 March 1705 at Biberach in Suabia. There he for six years was in business as a jeweller, and then worked for the same period in Switzerland, where he had relatives. At Berne he was taught by the seal-cutter Johann Rudolph Ochs. He then went to study in Italy, and at Venice took up gem-engraving. On coming to Rome Natter was, on his own account, employed by the Chevalier Odam to copy the Venus of Vettori, to make a Danae of it, and put the supposed engraver's name Aulus to it. For this engraved stone, as well as for others copied by him from the antique, Natter found purchasers. At Florence he was employed by Baron Philipp von Stosch. In 1741 or earlier, Natter came to England to work as a medallist and gem- engraver, bringing with him from Italy a collection of antique gems and sulphur casts. In 1743 he visited, in company with Martin Tuscher of Nuremberg, Denmark, Sweden, and St. Petersburg. Christian VI of Denmark gave him a room in his palace, where he worked at gem and die cutting for nearly a year. He was well paid, and presented by the king with a gold medal. Horace Walpole wrote that Natter visited Holland in 1746. He returned to England in or before 1754, and appears to have remained there till the summer of 1762. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1755, and of the Royal Society in 1757.Royal Society database, Natter; Lorenz (1705‚Äì1763). Lorenz Natter, coronation medal of George III of England According to Rogers Ruding, Natter was employed as engraver or assistant-engraver at the English Royal Mint at the beginning of the reign of George III. In the summer of 1762 Natter went to work in St. Petersburg, and died there of asthma, late in the autumn of 1763. Works Natter's talents as a gem-engraver were praised by Goethe, and Charles William King called him \\"one of the greatest of the modern practitioners of the art\\". His first productions were mainly seals with coats of arms. Writing in 1754, he said that he was always willing to receive commissions to copy ancient gems, but stated that he never sold copies as originals; his productions were often signed. His usual signature on gems was NATTEP or NATTHP. He also often signs YŒîROŒ£ or YŒîROY, a translation of the German word natter, a water-snake. Georg Kaspar Nagler in his K√ºnstler- Lexikon, and Heinrich Bolzenthal,Heinrich Bolzenthal, Skizzen zur Kunstgeschichte der modernen Medaillen-arbeit (1840), p. 251 followed in Edward Hawkins's Medallic Illustrations, gave Natter's forenames as \\"Johann Lorenz\\"; Natter on his gems and medals and on the title-pages of his publications used only the Christian name \\"Lorenz\\" (or Laurent, Laurentius, etc.). In Florence from 1732 to 1735 Natter had as patron Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, for whom he made a portrait of the Grand Duke himself, and one of Cardinal Alessandro Albani. In 1733 he made at Florence a portrait-medal of Charles Sackville, Earl of Middlesex. This is signed L. Natter F. Florent. Natter himself does not mention visiting the Netherlands, but he was patronised by William IV of Orange and his family, and made for them portraits in intaglio and portrait-medals. At this period Natter was attacked by Pierre-Jean Mariette in Trait√© des pierres grav√©es (1750), as a self-conscious forger. During Natter's two visits to England he was patronised by the royal family, and in 1741 made the medal \\"Tribute to George II\\". He was supported by Sir Edward Walpole and by Thomas Hollis. He engraved two or three seals with the head of Sir Robert Walpole, and produced a medal of him with a bust from John Michael Rysbrach's model, with on the reverse a statue of Cicero with the legend, \\"Regit dictis animos\\". This medal was engraved in The Medalist (Hawkins), with the legend altered to \\"Regit nummis animos\\". Natter, when at Count Moltke's table in Denmark, mentioned this alteration, and some one suggested \\"Regit nummis animos et nummis regitur ipse\\", a motto which was later engraved on the edge of some specimens of the medals, one of which went to the British Museum. For Hollis, Natter engraved, for ten guineas, a seal with the head of Britannia, and also a cameo of \\"Britannia Victrix\\", with a head of Algernon Sydney on the reverse. He also engraved a portrait of Hollis in intaglio, and a head of Socrates in green jasper which Hollis presented to Archbishop Thomas Secker in 1757. Gems engraved by Natter were described by Erich Raspe in his Catalogue of the Tassie Collection.Among them were: No. 1706, pl. xxv., \\"Birth of Athena\\"; No. 9116, pl. li., \\"Bust of Paris in Phrygian Cap\\", apparently copied from a fine silver coin of Carthage (Barclay Vincent Head, Guide to the Principal Coins of the Ancients, iii. C. 41); No. 11043, \\"Head of Augustus\\"; No. 15787, onyx cameo with portrait of the Marchioness of Rockingham; Nos. 15785‚Äì6, cameos of the Marquis of Rockingham. Among Natter's imitations of the antique was his copy of the Medusa, with the name Sosikles, at that time in the cabinet of Tiberius Hemsterhuis, a correspondent of Natter's. He also copied the \\"Julia Titi of Evodus\\". A description of his works preserved in the Imperial Cabinet at St. Petersburg was given in J. Bernoulli's Travels, iv. 248. =Books= Natter published in 1754 A Treatise on the Ancient Method of Engraving on Precious Stones compared with the Modern, London; it was also published in French in the same year as Trait√© de la m√©thode antique de graver en pierres fines. In Natter gave practical instructions in gem-engraving, and strongly advised beginners to copy from the antique. Godefrid Kraft of Danzig is mentioned by him, as a pupil of his in engraving. The Treatise did much for his reputation, but in financial terms proved troublesome. Natter also worked for the Dukes of Devonshire and Marlborough. For George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough he drew up a catalogue of the Bessborough gems, which were incorporated with the Marlborough cabinet. This was published in 1761 as Catalogue des pierres grav√©es tant en relief qu'en creux de Mylord Comte de Bessborough, London, with plates.

His main research field were the crustaceans (Crustacea). From 1928 to 1951 he was director of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano. Career Parisi was born in Taio. As a student at the University of Innsbruck, he was involved in a 1904 revolt by Italian students, who asked for an Italian-speaking university in Trieste, which was at that time under Austrian sovereign. Parisi was arrested, sentenced to three months in jail and then banned from all Austrian universities. Then he moved to Turin, where he graduated in natural sciences in 1908. In 1910 he became assistant in the Zoological Department of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano, where he took over the management in 1921. In 1928, he was the successor of Ettore Artini (1866-1928) as the museum director, a post he held until his retirement in 1951.Daniela Pessani, Tina Tirelli, Carlo Froglia: Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturali. Atti IX Colloquium Crustacea Mediterranea.Torino, September 2‚Äì6, 2008, Torino 2011, p 238 (biography) Parisi studied a large collection of Japanese decapods (Decapoda), which the museum acquired from Alan Owston (1853-1915), a British merchant and collector of natural history objects based in Yokohama. He described 23 new taxa of decapods in the Zoological notices I decapodi giapponesi del museo di Milano, published from 1914 to 1919 in the Museum Journal. A further seven taxa first described by Parisi come from the Mediterranean and other regions. During air raids of Allied forces to Milan in August 1943, the museum was severely damaged by firebombs, whereby an important part of the collections and the library get lost. Parisi's office was also destroyed. From a collection of benthic decapods, Parisi collected during a cruise to the Red Sea in 1923 and 1924, just a few glasses were saved, as well as a brief note on the mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda) collected during this expedition, which was published in 1940.Parisi, Bruno, 1940.

After the war Parisi devoted to the reconstruction of the museum, where he was actively supported by his successor Edgardo Moltoni. In 1924, Italian zoologist Oscar de Beaux commemorated Parisi in the epithet of Parissi's slit-faced bat (Nycteris parisii).

In 1945, he founded Horiba Radio Laboratory, now Horiba Ltd., a manufacturer of advanced analytical and measurement technology. Masao Horiba received several awards from the Japanese government including a national Blue Ribbon Medal, and was the first non-American to receive the Pittcon Heritage Award.  Early life and education  Masao Horiba was born on December 1, 1924, in Shimogy≈ç-ku, Kyoto, Japan. He was the second son of Shinkichi Horiba, a chemistry professor at Kyoto Imperial University, and his wife Mikiko. As a child, Horiba suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. He attended Kyoto Teachers' School's Elementary School and Konan Junior High and Senior High Schools in Kobe, Japan. Originally interested in mathematics and astronomy, Horiba was introduced to nuclear physics by one of his high school teachers at the Konan Boys' High School. He received a B.S. in physics, and hoped to study nuclear physics with Bunsaku Arakatsu at Kyoto University. However, further study in nuclear physics was not possible in post-war Japan. The American authorities had banned such study, and instruments and testing devices had been removed or destroyed.  Establishing a company  Horiba, who was in his second year at Kyoto University, left the university in 1945 to start his own business, Horiba Radio Laboratory (HRL). In addition to producing electronic parts and repairing electronic instruments, they reconditioned batteries. The power distribution system after the war was unreliable, so there was a strong demand for storage batteries for electric lights that could be used in the case of blackouts. Horiba acquired discarded storage batteries and selenium rectifiers which the company Nihon Denchi had produced for wartime use. Sales of Horiba's reconditioned \\"Teidento\\" batteries were a profitable source of income for the Horiba company. One of the instruments that Horiba produced and repaired was an electric-pulse oscillator, used in brain surgery. When an oscillator stopped working in the middle of an operation, Masao Horiba was called upon to make emergency repairs. He got the instrument working so the surgeons could finish the operation, and then took the instrument home to examine it in more detail. Examination of the components showed that an electrolytic capacitor had failed. When it proved difficult to buy low-cost reliable replacements, Horiba started producing electrolytic capacitors. By integrating quality control into the production process, he was able to produce high-quality products. He partnered with an investor but their plans to build a capacitor plant fell through when the Korean war caused Japanese metal prices to rise. One of the instruments needed for the capacitor manufacturing processes was the pH meter. Imported pH meters tended to be unreliable, possibly because of Japan's hot and humid climate. They were also expensive. Rather than buy imported pH meters, Horiba had built his own pH meters for capacitor testing. He saw a potential market for reliable, low-cost pH meters in Japan's food and chemical industries, and partnered with Kitahama Works, a major scientific instruments company, to sell them. The pH meters were sold to fertilizer plants throughout Japan to monitor pH levels in the production of ammonium sulfate fertilizer for use in rice production. In 1953, \\"Horiba Radio Laboratory\\" was renamed \\"Horiba Ltd.\\" Technology development Masao Horiba continued to look for new opportunities for his company. After investigating gas chromatography, Horiba decided instead to develop instruments for infrared analysis. The Horiba company already had some experience in creating synthetic single crystals for use in infrared instruments. With support from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the first Horiba IR infrared- based gas analyzer was sold in 1958, followed by a model for industrial use in 1962. Masao Horiba visited the United States in 1958 as part of a study tour for delegates approved by the Japan Productivity Center. He was particularly interested in seeing the National Bureau of Standards. During this trip, he also met representatives of Hitachi, Ltd., beginning a relationship with the Hitachi company. The next major product developed at the Horiba company resulted from the work of Masahiro Oura, a young researcher who saw the potential for an auto-emissions measurement instrument. Masao Horiba supported the project once he learned that Oura had orders from several major automobile manufacturers. The company's MEXA-1 air emissions analyzer, which came out in 1964, was the first in a series of analysis devices of increasing sensitivity. The MEXA-1 became important for the company's international expansion. In 1970, Horiba partnered with (and later acquired) Olson Laboratories, expanding into Europe and the UK. In 1975, a MEXA analyzer was sold to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Horiba model MEXA-200 infrared CO analyzer was adopted by the EPA for the regulation auto emissions. MEXA systems were bought by Mercedes-Benz in Germany, and Renault in France. Writing and lecturing In 1978, at the age of 53, Horiba became chairman of the company, passing the role of president to Masahiro Oura. In 1992, Oura was succeeded by Atsushi Horiba, Horiba's son. Horiba actively promoted venture capital investment, particularly in the Kyoto area, as an adviser to the Advanced Software Technology and Mechatronics Research Institute of Kyoto (ASTEM), one of the largest start-up incubator organizations in Japan. He was a representative of the Japan Association of New Business Incubation Organization (JANBO) which was established in 1999 as a nationwide network for the support of new businesses in Japan. He served as the chairman of the Innovation Initiative Network Japan (Innovation-Net) established in 2009 to revitalize regional economies by promoting collaboration between industries and universities. Masao Horiba was also a founder and past president of the Association of Asian Business Incubation (AABI) which encourages support of initiatives throughout Asia, not just in Japan. Horiba wrote and lectured on business and management. He published several books, including Keiei Kokoroe- cho (The Management Handbook) and Iyanara Yamero (Joy and Fun). Horiba promoted the corporate philosophy of Omoshiro Okashiku or Live Merrily and Cheerfully. He advocated that work should be meaningful and fulfilling, and that employees should be encouraged to be creative, take risks, and question accepted practices. Employers are encouraged to \\"let the nail stand out\\", a significant departure from the Japanese adage that \\"The nail that stands out gets beaten down.\\" Awards The Masao Horiba Awards were established through the Horiba company to recognize young scientists in analytical science, outside the group companies, \\"who are devoting themselves to research and development of innovative technology in analysis and measurement.\\" In 1982, Horiba received the Blue Ribbon Medal of Honor from the Government of Japan, awarded to individuals who have made significant achievements in public service or public welfare. In recognition of his entrepreneurship and contributions to scientific instrumentation and to society, Masao Horiba was awarded the Pittcon Heritage Award in 2006, at the Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy and the Chemical Heritage Foundation. The award is given to those \\"whose entrepreneurial careers shaped the instrumentation community, inspired achievement, promoted public understanding of the modern instrumentation sciences, and highlighted the role of analytical chemistry in world economies.\\" Masao Horiba is the first non- American to receive the Pittcon Award. On July 14, 2015, Horiba died in his sleep at the age of 90.

It was first produced by the Theatre Guild and presented October 10, 1927 ‚Äì August 1928 at the Guild Theatre in New York City. Featuring a cast of African Americans at the insistence of its authors‚Äîa decision unusual for its time‚Äîthe original production starred Frank Wilson, Evelyn Ellis, Jack Carter, and Rose McClendon. Porgy marked the Broadway directing debut of Rouben Mamoulian. The play ran a total of 55 weeks in New York, and the original cast toured the United States twice and performed for 11 consecutive weeks in London. The play tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black beggar who lives in the slums of Charleston, South Carolina. It relates his efforts to rescue Bess, the woman he loves, from Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and a drug dealer called Sporting Life. The play is the basis of the libretto of the opera Porgy and Bess (1935). History DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, authors of the play Porgy A descendant of Thomas Heyward, Jr., DuBose Heyward was from an old, white family in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1925, he published his first and best-regarded novel, Porgy,(Edwin) DuBose Heyward 1885‚Äì1940. Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, November 5, 2003. which was inspired by a news story and drawn from his sympathetic observations of African American culture.Dorothy (Hartzell Kuhns) Heyward 1890‚Äì1961. Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, March 3, 2000. The book was a best seller. Porgy was one of a number of works portraying black life written by white authors, but it was infused with human understanding at a time that such an approach was new. Heyward's wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward, roughed out a stage adaptation of the novel that persuaded her husband of the story's dramatic possibilities. They wrote the play together, strengthening the character of Bess, incorporating folk songs, and creating a more upbeat ending that shows Porgy following Bess to New York. Just as the novel had been one of the first to regard African American culture seriously, Porgy was the first authentic presentation of black culture on the Broadway stage. The Heywards insisted that an African American cast perform the play, providing much-needed employment for black actors and offering white audiences a mature view of African American life. DuBose Heyward credited the actors‚Äîmany of whom had theatre experience going back generations‚Äîas collaborators whose contributions transformed the drama on the stage. Production Sponsored by the Theatre Guild, Porgy was given its premiere on Broadway, running October 10, 1927, to August 1928, at the Guild Theatre and the Republic Theatre.Republic Theatre, The New York Magazine Program. Porgy, week beginning July 2, 1928. Porgy then went on tour‚Äîfor nine weeks in Chicago, 11 weeks in London, and in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Washington, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and others in the northwestern United States and Canada. The show returned to New York, running September 13 to October 1929 at the Martin Beck Theatre. After a total of 55 weeks in New York, all of the original principal cast members of Porgy toured the nation once again, performing from October 14, 1929, into January 1930. Porgy marked the Broadway directing debut of Rouben Mamoulian. Settings were designed by Cleon Throckmorton.

It serves the parish of Fawsley under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Peterborough. It was built in the 13th century and is a Grade I listed building.  History  The current church dates to the 13th century. It is thought to have been established in 1209 on the site of a former wooden Saxon church, as a chapel under St. John the Baptist Church in Blisworth. This lasted until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when the Knightley family demolished most of the village to enclose land for sheep farming. The church was protected from demolition by the fact that it had had land granted to it to establish a chantry in Bedfordshire. In 1690, the chancel was rebuilt and later, the church had effigies of the Knightley family installed after a number of them were buried in the church. The church was granted Grade I listed status in 1968 and was amended in 1987. Aided by its isolated location, a considerable amount of the copper covering was stolen ITV News feature from the roofs in 2015, causing some rain damage internally. Fund raising to replace the temporary plastic sheeting is well underway. =Tower and Bells= The tower contains a ring of four bells, which are the oldest ring of four bells that all came from the same foundry at the same time. Casting of the bells is ascribed to W. Chamberlain of London in about 1440. The inscriptions cast on the bells are: ::Treble: SANCTE BOTOLFE ORA PRO NOBIS ::2. IN MULTIS ANNIS RESONET CAMPANA JOHANNIS ::3. SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENDICTUM ::Tenor: JOHANNES EST NOMEN EIUS All four bells also have three identity stamps: :North‚Äôs # 18 a cross inscribed in a quarter ihu.merci.ladi.help on an octagonal base :North‚Äôs # 19 crossed keys, fish, bell, tea pot, sheaf of corn in the quarters on a shield :North‚Äôs # 20 letter m with mast and streamer and sideways ‚ÄúY‚Äù on a shield All bells retain their cast canons. The timber frame dates from the early C17, and was repaired by John Taylor & Co in 1965/6 when the four bells were quarter turned, renovated with new independent crown staples, new fittings for swing chiming consisting of seasoned elm headstocks, wrought iron levers, steel gudgeons, fully enclosed ball bearings, clappers with new joints and ball bearing rollers. In 1992 the frame was strengthened further by volunteers to a design by Eayre and Smith Ltd to allow for full circle ringing and the necessary additional fittings provided. A service of thanksgiving was held on September 26, 1992. =Washington family= In 1720, the coat of arms of the Washington family was noted as being carved into the stone outside the entrance, possibly because Reverend Lawrence Washington, the great-great grandfather of United States President George Washington, owned the estate in the area that included the church. The shield was later hidden behind stones but was rediscovered in 1885 and protected with a glass case. The church also has stained glass windows bearing the Washington family coat of arms which were removed from Sulgrave Manor, the Washingtons' ancestral home.

He served as president of the American Council on Education and as chief of the higher education branch of the Office of Education before becoming the first salaried, full-time chancellor at the University at Buffalo. Capen led the university between 1922 and 1950. Early life and career Capen was the son of Elmer Hewitt Capen, the third president of Tufts College. He completed undergraduate studies and an M.A. at Tufts. While at Tufts, Capen was class president, vice-president of the school's publishing association, a fraternity member and an assistant manager for the football team. He earned a second M.A. at Harvard University and a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. During his doctoral studies, he took a one-year leave from Penn to study at the University of Leipzig. During his early academic career, Capen taught German at Clark College. Capen was a higher education specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Education between 1914 and 1919. He served as president of the alumni association at Tufts between 1914 and 1916. Between 1919 and 1922, Capen served as the first director of the American Council on Education. He was installed as chancellor of the University at Buffalo on October 28, 1922. Capen took the position at Buffalo less than two years after the school had completed a $5,000,000 endowment campaign. Capen was its first salaried and full-time chancellor. Upon his installment, Capen was looked upon as a nationally known education expert. At his presidential inauguration, Capen expressed his philosophy of equal access to education. \\"I do not hold with those who would limit the number of college students on the basis of any distinctions of race or sex or creed or social standing. There is but one justifiable basis on which a university in a democratic community such as this can choose those who are to become members of it, the basis of ability,\\" he said. At that time that Capen took the position at Buffalo, news sources noted his comments on the state of American colleges. Capen said that most colleges were overcrowded and that they were largely doing the teaching that should have taken place in high schools. Tufts named Capen a life trustee in 1931. Capen delivered a 1939 speech, \\"Seven Devils in Exchange for One\\", in which he criticized regional education accreditation agencies. He said that the agencies were too numerous and that they often cost schools money because they evaluated based on things other than intellectual quality. In planning for the use of education in World War II, Capen was critical of the way that educated men had been drafted into military assignments during World War I, which he said made little use of their individual intellects. Capen died in 1956 after a lengthy illness. Personal Capen Hall, University at Buffalo Capen married Grace Duncan Wright. She was the daughter of Carroll D. Wright, the first president of Clark College. Grace Wright was the 1929-1930 president of a Buffalo women's social club known as the Twentieth Century Club. In 1934, Capen was one of three founders of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. Later life and legacy The University at Buffalo honored Capen with the dedication of a campus building, Capen Hall. The university has established the Samuel P. Capen Chair of Poetry and the Humanities. The Samuel P.

Education and career Werthmann studied philology at the Paris-Lodron University in Salzburg and received the title ‚ÄòMag. phil.‚Äô at the end of her studies. From 1989 onwards, she worked in the education system and later on, among others, as translator and interpreter in specialised areas - economics, medicine and tourism.  Politics  During the European elections in 2009, Werthmann candidated with Hans Peter Martin and was placed on number three on his list. Martin, as well as the other three members of parliament did not belong to any groups in the European parliament. Media reports spoke about an alleged letter of renunciation presented to Werthmann, according to which she should waiver her parliamentary seat. However, Werthmann allegedly declined to sign the waiver. In July 2010, Werthmann left the delegation of Hans Peter Martin's list after conflicts with Martin about the lack of transparency in the party's finances. On 5 July 2012, Werthmann joined the liberal group of the European Parliament. The Liberal Forum had planned on running for the European elections in 2014 with Werthmann as leading candidate. On 27 March, it was announced that Werthmann would candidate independently for the Alliance for the Future of Austria during European elections 2014 and consequently, she was excluded from the ALDE group. In turn, DDr. Ulrike Haider-Quercia stepped back from her top candidature and Werthmann stepped up and took her place as leading candidate for the independent \\"List Mag. Werthmann\\". However, the Alliance for the Future of Austria was not re-elected into parliament during European elections held on the 25 May 2014.  Parliamentary work  Werthmann is a member of the committee of petitions, the budget committee and part of the delegation for the relationship with south-Asian countries. She is also a representative member of the committee for female rights and gender equality. Further, she drafted two reports and was involved as shadow rapporteur for nine other reports. In addition, she wrote 27 opinions and 37 (joint) motions for resolution. In the course of the seventh legislative period, she put forth 616 parliamentary questions to the European Commission, the European Council and the High Representative. Concerning her work in the budget committee, Angelika Werthmann's main focus is in the areas economics, financial investments to reduce joblessness, education and mobility, lifelong learning, health and the European globalisation adjustment fund.

All information had been brought to the attention of the committee of petitions by (former) partners/spouses of Danish citizens and the violation of basic, human, children's and female rights can be traced back to the ‚ÄúParental Responsibility Act.‚Äù These violations of rights have been experienced to 90 per cent by women and mothers of Danish descent and to 10 per cent by women, mothers as well as father of non-Danish descent. In February 2014, before the end of the legislative period, several parental parties involved spoke again in front of the committee of petitions. On the committee for women's rights and gender equality, Angelika Werthmann particularly stands up for equality between men and women in the work place and equal remuneration for the same work. Further, she wrote the report on ‚Äúwomen with disabilities.‚Äù http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fNONSGML%2bREPORT%2bA7-2013-0329%2b0%2bDOC%2bPDF%2bV0%2f%2fEN Another topic important to Angelika Werthmann is the fight against female genital mutilation.

Career = Early career = Cerutti began his career as an engineer for French company Bouygues Construction in Saudi Arabia, where he was based for nearly two years. = IBM = He moved to IBM in 1986 starting out in sales engineering and sales management. He remained at IBM for more than 20 years. At IBM, he was promoted to his first management position in 1996 as the director of Personal Systems Group for Western Europe. Over the following decade, Cerutti ascended the ranks of IBM, and worked in roles that were particularly international. In 1998, he became executive assistant to the chairman and CEO, Lou Gerstner. In 2000, he moved to IBM Global Services, the leading market services provider in Europe, first as general manager for Western Europe and then for the whole EMEA region. He managed tens of thousands of employees in 17 different sectors. In 2005, Cerutti became IBM's general manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa. According to his former IBM colleagues, Cerutti starkly contrasted with the company's generally diffident management style, and preferred to clearly outline strategies for his teams. = NYSE-Euronext = In 2009 Cerutti left IBM to join NYSE Euronext, the global exchange group, as president and deputy CEO. He was also CEO of Euronext NV, the European subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, and chairman and CEO of Euronext Paris. In 2010, he was appointed as board member of the group. He undertook one of his first notable projects as a member of the board: compliance with the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. According to him, this directive decreased transparency in financial markets by allowing the creation of alternative exchange platforms at a time when ‚Äúthe need for transparence has never been so acute.‚Äù In November 2013, he moved up from deputy CEO of NYSE to become the CEO of Euronext. In June 2014, he oversaw Euronext's IPO as an independent company after it separated from parent company ICE. As CEO of Euronext, he turned around the strategy of the group, moving away from the legacy of his predecessor, Jean-Fran√ßois Th√©odore. In September 2014, he embarked on a program to increase operational savings by ‚Ç¨60 million over the next three years, with the goal of achieving a 5% annual revenue growth and improve the company's long-term EBITDA margin from 42% to 53%. Cerutti has also spoken against the European Commission's proposal of a financial transactions tax, arguing that \\"the political intention of creating such a tax is a noble one, but the current form of the proposal is counter- productive [‚Ä¶] this tax is truly the last thing we need now.‚Äú He has also spoken out in favor of increased market regulation and transparency as the main way of reducing risk. During his time as CEO, Euronext once again became independent and had an IPO in its own markets.

He was the heir and founder of the Lucien Barri√®re group, one of the largest group of casinos, luxury hotels, resorts and restaurants. Biography He was born in the French Ard√®che region from a modest, goat raising family. In 1962, he was chosen by his uncle Fran√ßois Andr√©, who had no direct descendants, to succeed him as head of several successful companies specializing in the operation of casinos and luxury hotels. The casinos of Deauville, Cannes and La Baule and the hotels Normandy Barriere, Royal Barriere and the Hotel du Golf Barriere de Deauville were among the best known assets of the company. In 1959, he became the general manager of the group. For thirty years he developed the successful Barriere empire following the same policy as his predecessor: luxury, sophistication, perfection, elegance, refinement, friendliness and cultivating the French joie de vivre. He married Martha Szentgy√∂rgyi (died 11 October 2008), a Hungarian dancer. Martha had a daughter from a previous marriage, Diane, born in 1957, which he adopted and raised as his own. He taught her the know-how of the trade, before designating her as the sole heir of his luxury empire. In 1962, he founded the Lucien Barri√®re group, one of the first French companies charged with managing casinos and luxury hotels. In 1975, Lucien Barri√®re sponsored the creation of the American Film Festival in Deauville, alongside the major proponents of this idea, the Mayor of Deauville Michel d'Ornano, Andr√© Halimi and Lionel Shushan. In 1990, he died at Caen University Hospital of cardiac arrest at the age of 67, following complications resulting from a coronary angioplasty carried out by Professor Grollier. Diane, married to the notary Dominique Desseigne, succeeded her adoptive father as head of the group and pursued the same successful policy as her predecessors. In July 1995 she was the victim of a serious plane crash that left her quadriplegic, and later died in May 2001 at 44 years.

Later he practised in Dublin. In 1786 he was one of seven architects who were consulted on additions to the House of Commons, and he and another carried out the execution of James Gandon's design for the work. In December 1788, William Burton Conyngham commissioned Murphy to make drawings of Batalha Monastery in central Portugal. He was back in Dublin in 1790, and was in England at the end of the year. In 1802, he went to Cadiz, where he remained for seven years studying Moorish architecture, with some diplomatic duties. Settling again in England in 1809, Murphy took out a patent in 1813 for a method of preserving timber and other substances from decay. He spent his time in preparing his notes on Moorish architecture for the press, but died on 12 September 1814 in Edward Street, Cavendish Square, London (later Lower Seymour Street), when only part of his major book had been published.

The company belongs to the Ministry of Industry and Construction Operation of Turkmenistan.New Ministry of Industry and Construction Operations of Turkmenistan It is headquartered in Ashgabat.  History  = Russian Empire = In September 1880, the first section of the railway was built from the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea to the Mollagara. In October 1881, the railway was built to the village of Kyzyl-Arvat. In the years 1885-1886 was continued the construction of the second section of the railway to the large settlements of Turkmenistan: Geok-Tepe, Ashgabat, Tejen, Mary, Chardzhou, which ended at the Amu Darya river. At the end of 1887, a wooden bridge with a length of more than 2 km was built across the Amu Darya, which allowed the construction of the third section of the road to begin. In 1901, a wooden bridge was destroyed by flood waters. In its place, at the same time, a new metal bridge was built on stone supports. In 1888, the railway continued to Samarkand and in 1898 brought to Tashkent. In 1894-1895, the Krasnovodsk section of the railroad was built. Thus, the Trans-Caspian Railway, which played an important role in the development of the economy of Central Asia, including pre-revolutionary Turkmenistan, begins from the harbor of the Caspian Sea - the Krasnovodsk Bay. The route from Krasnovodsk to Tashkent was called the Central Asian Railway. = Soviet Union = In 1922, on the instructions of Vladimir Lenin, work began on the design of Soviet diesel locomotives for operation on waterless sections of Central Asia. In 1931, the Krasnovodsk-Chardzhou railway was switched to diesel traction. In 1955, all railway traffic in the Turkmen SSR was completely transferred to diesel traction. A very important role was played by rail during the Second World War. During the battles near Stalingrad and the Caucasus (from August 1942 to February 1943), the Krasnovodsk port and Ashgabat railway station became the only transport arteries connecting Baku, Transcaucasia and the Black Sea with the whole country. They ensured the transfer of the army, a huge flow of military equipment and equipment to the North Caucasian and Transcaucasian fronts. For the selfless work of the railway of the Turkmen SSR, the passing Red Banner of the People's Commissariat of Railways of the USSR was repeatedly awarded. In the post-war period, the improvement of the technical equipment of the railway network of Turkmen SSR, its carrying capacity and capacity continued. At almost all stations and crossings, comfortable passenger buildings, platforms and canopies were equipped. Air conditioning wagons were also commissioned, creating favorable microclimatic conditions for passengers. Turkmen railways became one of the first in the USSR, on which the main diesel traction was introduced. In the early 1980s, the Mary-Kushka line was brought to the Afghan village of Torghundi . = Independent Turkmenistan = thumb The T√ºrkmendemir√Ωollary formed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is one of the inheritors of the Soviet Railways. The railway's most important station is Ashgabat railway station, the central station of the capital. After the collapse of the USSR, the construction of new lines again intensified, which was caused by the fact that the previous routes were broken by sections that became part of the Uzbek railways. During the period after the collapse of the USSR, a number of new trunk lines were opened in Turkmenistan: Takhiatash (Uzbekistan)-Kunya-Urgench-Saparmurat Turkmenbashi, Turkmenabad-Atamyrat- Kerki√ßi, Tejen-Sarakhs (Iran), Ashgabat-Da≈üoguz, which made it possible to connect disparate sections of the railway network into a single whole. In October 2013, the new building of the Ministry of Railway Transport of Turkmenistan was opened on Archabil Avenue. Since February 7, 2020 T√ºrkmendemir√Ωollary Agency is in the department of new Ministry of Industry and Construction Operations of Turkmenistan.

Railways projects  =Links to Iran= In 1996, Mashhad‚ÄìSarakhs extension connected Iran to Turkmenistan,as part of the Silk Road railway to link to the landlocked Central Asian Countries.Former states of the Soviet Union have railways using a Russian gauge,thus the Iranian Railways maintain break-of- gauge services at borders to Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan,and beyond brief wide-track rail segments to the border crossing. = Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan- Iran railway (part of the North-South Transport Corridor) = T√ºrkmendemir√Ωollary is engaging on a major railroad project to link China and Southeast Asia to Europe for a length of 3,900 kilometres (2,400 mi). Currently is run the railway through Turkmenistan to Iran. Iran is linked to Turkey and Europe's standard gauge system. In May 2013, a new rail link opened between Uzen (Kazakhstan) and Serhetyaka (Turkmenistan), crossing the border at Bolashak. The railway is 146 km long and cost 65bn tenge. The railway is Russian gauge; there would be a break of gauge when the railway reaches the Iranian border. In December 2014,a rail line from Iran opened to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The opening of the line marks the first direct rail link between Iran,Kazakhstan and China and upon completion of the Marmaray rail project direct rail transport between China and Europe(while avoiding Russia)will be possible.Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran Railway to Open Today, by Onur Uysal, http://railturkey.org/2014/12/03/kazakhstan-turkmenistan-iran- railway/ = Afghanistan‚ÄìTurkmenistan rail service = A 10-kilometer long line extends from Serhetabat in Turkmenistan to the town of Torghundi in Afghanistan. An upgrade of this Soviet-built line dating back to the 1960s, using Russian gauge, began in 2007. In April 2016, an agreement was reached for a technical feasibility study for a proposal to extend this line approximately 100 km to the city of Herat, where it could connect to the standard-gauge line to Iran that is being built. In accordance with earlier decisions, the line is likely to be standard gauge, with break of gauge at Torghundi. In April 2018 it was decided by the Turkmen government to build a railway from Galkynysh Gas Field in the direction of Afghanistan, towards Torghundi.https://www.azernews.az/region/141734.htmlhttp://orient.tm/en/2018/04/12/6314.html Another rail line was opened further east in November 2016, connecting Aqina in Faryab province via Imamnazar with Atamyrat/Kerki in Turkmenistan. A planned extension to Andkhoy is under proposal.

The \\"Chin-nga\\" at Singjamei and \\"Cheirao Ching\\" at Chingmeirong are such hillocks that are specially prepared for these hillock climbing ritual. Toy shops, eateries, and other varied small shops will line the road to the hillock on that day to attract the ritual climbers to buy their items. The Ching KƒÅba is usually done during the afternoon to early evening, before the sun sets. Traditional activities performed prior to the festival Spring cleaning activities will be seen in all the families of the Meitei people prior to the festival. They will clean all things, including clothes, utensils, all household items, unused items around the house, etc. It is also traditional to buy new clothes to wear on the new year. It is also traditional that a married woman should present a gift, usually a piece of cloth, to her father and brothers prior to the day of the festival.

He was a monk at Hilandar.  Life  Little is known about his life. He first appears in 1526 when he transcribed a prayer book in which he is desperate about the end of the world coming in near future. Until 1569 he lived in Kratovo, at the time an important town and mining center, where he was a priest (pop). After that date we find him in Craiova in Wallachia where in 1580 he signed one Evangelion as ‚ÄúPriest Jovan, a Serb from the town of Kratovo‚Äù (Srbin od mesta Kratova).–â. –°—Ç–æ—ò–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ, –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏ –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ –∏ –ù–∞—Ç–ø–∏—Å–∏, vol.

Priest Jovan's work coincided with two important events. One was the renewal of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá in 1557 that gave impetus to larger artistic production. The second was the restoration of Ottoman interest in mining, the fact that boosted production in Kratovo and other important mines.

This was, in all probability, an order by local authorities of Kratovo, needed to renew their production according to the wants of the Ottoman administration.

Born in Workington, Cumbria he played in the Football League for Workington, Sheffield United and Rotherham United, spending the majority of his career in Sheffield where he made over 230 appearances for United. Playing career Flynn began his senior career with his home town club of Workington, with whom he made his league debut as a 17-year-old amateur in December 1966. Having made occasional first-team appearances for the following eighteen months, Flynn was released in the summer of 1968. Flynn had intended to move to South Africa but a car accident delayed the move and Workington, having changed their manager, offered Flynn a new contract, prompting him to stay in England. Flynn was spotted playing in Workington's reserves by Sheffield United's then general-manager John Harris and the club duly signed him for ¬£5,000 in July 1969. Initially used as cover for Dave Powell he gradually began to make more appearances as Powell suffered from injury problems. By April 1971 Flynn had cemented his position as first-choice in central defence, partnering Eddie Colquhoun. Flynn remained a mainstay of United's defence until 1978 when he was given a free transfer to nearby Rotherham United. Having spent two seasons with Rotherham, Flynn moved to non- league Spalding United in 1980 where played for another two years until retiring in 1982.

However, in recent years, it has become controversial both in South Korea and around the world, due to animal rights and sanitary concerns. According to some sources, consumption of dog meat is becoming less common in modern-day South Korea, especially among younger people, and the practice is declining. Estimates of the number of animals consumed vary widely. According to the Korean Animal Rights Advocates (KARA), approximately 780,000 to 1 million dogs are consumed per year in South Korea. Sales at Moran Market have been declining in the past few years and were down to about 20,000 dogs per year in 2017. South Korea's Statistical Information Service 2015 agriculture census reported a total of 24,671 facilities holding 521,201 dogs, though this figure includes both animals raised for the pet industry and those raised for meat consumption.Korean Statistical Information Service: Farm Households Raising Livestock/Total Head, In 2018, the Taepyeong-dong complex, which served as a slaughterhouse for hundreds of thousands of dogs on a yearly basis, was closed by the South Korean government. This move came five years after a vote by the city council of Seongnam, the city where the slaughterhouse was located.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-23/south-korea-closes-its-largest- dog-meat-slaughterhouse/10548032 In June 2018, a South Korean municipal court ruled that killing dogs for their meat was illegal, though this does not make it illegal to consume dog meat.  History  As a general practice, dog meat has never been a mainstream part of the Korean diet throughout the nation's history. The consumption of dog meat can be traced back to antiquity in isolated cases, and dog bones were excavated in a neolithic settlement in Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. A wall painting in the Goguryeo tombs complex in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site dating from the 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse (Ahn, 2000). Starting in the Silla Dynasty (57 BC ‚Äì 935 AD) and then during the Goryeo Dynasty (AD 918‚Äì1392), Buddhism was the state religion and eating beef was considered immoral and was at first discouraged and then banned (cows were regarded as human work companions). In general, animal life was regarded as sacred and eating meat was minimized; however, eating seafood remained common. During the latter part of the Goryeo Dynasty, the practice of eating dog meat was introduced by the nomadic Khitans, who as war refugees spilled into Goryeo during the Mongol invasions. The invading Mongols lifted the beef ban and legalized the consumption of meat during their rule. During the Joseon Dynasty (AD 1392‚Äì1910), the minority Khitans eventually assimilated into the social structure as the \\"Baekjeong,\\" the first butcher class, occupying the lowest class of society. The Joseon government assigned the Baekjeong the task of addressing the feral dog problem, and thus dog meat became a food item for the poor (and lower classes). During the Joseon Dynasty, certain government officials argued that dogs were human companions and wanted to ban the consumption of dog meat. In approximately 1816, Jeong Hak-yu, the second son of Jeong Yak-yong, a prominent politician and scholar of Joseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongga Wollyeongga (ÎÜçÍ∞ÄÏõîÎ†πÍ∞Ä). This poem, which is an important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farming families did during each month of a year. In the description of the month of August, the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cakes, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002). Dongguksesigi (ÎèôÍµ≠ÏÑ∏ÏãúÍ∏∞), a book written by Korean scholar Hong Seok-mo in 1849, contains a recipe for Bosintang including a boiled dog, green onions, and red chili pepper powder. 2008 Seoul Shinmoon article There is a traditional anniversary in South Korea called Sambok (‰∏â‰ºè), during which Koreans in the modern day eat Baeksuk, a chicken soup with rice and herbs. However, some South Koreans choose to consume Bosintang instead, a soup containing dog meat.  Current situation  Dog meat sold at Gyeongdong Market, Seoul, South Korea In 2014, 329 restaurants served dog meat in Seoul, and the numbers are continuing to decline each year. Some restaurants are reporting declines in consumption of 20‚Äì30% per year. Dog meat is often consumed during the summer months and is either roasted or prepared in soups or stews.Kim, Tae-Yi, Reuters, \\"Dog on the menu in Korea to beat the heat \\", Yahoo! News, 14 July 2011; retrieved 15 July 2011. The most popular of these soups is Gaejang-guk, a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. This is thought to ensure good health by balancing one's \\"ki\\", or the vital energy of the body. A 19th- century version of Gaejang-guk (Í∞úÏû•Íµ≠) explains the preparation of the dish by boiling dog meat with green onions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots.Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 84‚Äì85. On December 13, 2016, the termination of dog slaughter and the closure of slaughtering facilities at Moran Market was announced by the local government and vendors' association. The decision was reached in an effort to mitigate the negative views of the market by remodeling it as part of a city project. All of the dog slaughtering facilities in the market were planned to be removed by May 2017 and the vendors were to be aided financially by the government in the process. Inspired by this decision, protesters gathered at Gupo Market in Busan in February 2017, calling for the closure of the dog meat vendors there. The Gupo Market is of similar size to the Moran Market and has been around since the Joseon Dynasty. In recent decades, the number of dog meat vendors in the market has decreased to only 22 due to the efforts of the government trying to improve the image of the city for tourists. In July 2019 animal groups in South Korea including KARA, KAWA, Busan KAPCA and Humane Society International/Korea assisted the Busan mayor in closing down Gupo dog meat market. The authorities plan to replace it with a public park. https://www.hsi.org/news-media/south-korea-shuts-down-gupo-dog-meat-market/ On November 21, 2018, South Korea closed the country's main dog slaughterhouse, known as Taepyeong-dong.https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/asia/south-korea-dog- slaughterhouse-intl/index.html The slaughterhouse was located in Seongnam. The Seongnam city council, which voted in 2013 to close the slaughterhouse, will turn the area into a community park. Dogs used for meat The primary dog breed raised for meat is a non-specific landrace commonly named as Nureongi (ÎàÑÎ†ÅÏù¥), or Hwanggu (Ìô©Íµ¨).Dog Meat Foods in Korea, Ann, Yong-Geun, Korean Medical Database Nureongi are not the only type of dog currently slaughtered for their meat in South Korea. In 2015, The Korea Observer reported that many different pet breeds of dog are bred to be eaten, including, for example, labradors, retrievers, and cocker spaniels, and that the dogs slaughtered for their meat often include former pets. Humane Society International/Korea has been working cooperatively with dog farmers since 2015 to help them close their farms, and rehome the dogs. As of August 2020 HSI has closed down 16 dog meat farms and rescued more than 2,000 dogs. The charity documents every farm closure to show the conditions, and it is clear that all breeds of dog are found on these facilities including golden retrievers, beagles, poodles and huskies alongside tosas and jindos.name=Humane Society International url=https://www.hsi.org/news-media/closing-south-koreas-dog-meat-farms/ According to the Korean Animal Rights Advocates (KARA), there are approximately 3,000 dog meat farms operating across the country, many of which receive dogs as overflow from puppy mills for the pet industry. With declining demand for dog meat in Korea, a more serious problem now is excess dogs stemming from the puppy mill industry. The majority of dogs are slaughtered by electrocution, though some are hung or beaten over the head before exsanguination, even though such practices are illegal under the 2007 Animal Protection Act. In 2015, it was reported that when retrievers are sold as meat dogs, they cost over 200,000 Korean Won (¬£140 British pounds or $180 US dollars). Legal status Between 1975 and 1978, dogs had the full legal status of livestock animals in South Korea, but the legality of the dog meat trade is now highly disputed. South Korea adopted its first Animal Protection Law in May, 1991. Currently, Article 7 of the Animal Protection Act does not explicitly prohibit the slaughter of dogs for food; however, it \\"prohibits killing animals in a brutal way\\". In addition, it \\"forbids killing the dogs in open areas such as on the street or in front of other animals of the same species\\". The controversy over dog meat has led to lobbying for/against regulation by charities such as NoToDogMeat, as well as differing interpretations of existing laws. Dog meat is subject to the Food Sanitation Act/Food Hygiene Act of 1962, which simply defines food\\" as \\"all foodstuff, except taken as medicine\\". However, unlike beef, pork, or poultry, dog meat is excluded from the list of livestock under the Livestock Processing Act of 1962,In August 1975, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (now the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) included dog in the legal definition of livestock under the Ministerial Ordinance of the LPA (then the Livestock Hygienic Treatment Act). But in June 1978, ‚Äúdog‚Äù was deleted from the list of livestock. (Kim, R. 2008) which is \\"the principal statute governing hygienic slaughtering of livestock and processing of meat.\\" Hence, dog meat farming is under-regulated compared to that of other stock animals. As a result, there are no regulations requiring the humane slaughter of dogs for meat. The controversy over dog meat consumption often centers on the slaughtering methods employed, which include electrocution, strangulation by hanging, and physically beating the dog to death. Some dogs are still alive when they are blow-torched or thrown into boiling water to remove their fur. Some people believe that dog meat should be expressly legalized so that only authorized preparers can deal with the meat in more humane and sanitary ways, while others think that the practice should be banned by law. In 2008, the Seoul Metropolitan Government proposed a recommendation to the national government to add dogs to the list of livestock whose slaughter is regulated by law.\\"Seoul Categorizing Dogs as Livestock\\" Kim Tae-jong, Korea Times. 2008-03-24 However, activist groups attacked the proposal as legitimizing or legalizing the trade in dog meat. The city dropped the proposal, but an official from the national government was quoted as saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the sole idea of the city. We have not been consulted at all .... I don‚Äôt think we are planning to even consider this option.‚Äù \\"Dogs may be designated as livestock\\" Brian Lee, Korea Joong Ang Daily. Apr 12, 2008 In June 2018, the municipal court of the city of Bucheon ruled that killing dogs for their meat was illegal. The landmark decision came after much criticism from animal advocates in the country. The court case was brought forward by animal rights group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth (Care) against a dog farm, which they said was killing animals without a real reason.

Doosan Encyclopedia International scrutiny During the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South Korean government urged its citizens not to consume dog meat in order to avoid bad publicity during the games, along with a request to butcher shops not to hang dog carcasses in the windows. It also closed all restaurants serving Gaejang-guk to better improve the country's image to Western visitors. A 1998 Salon article reported that despite officially being banned by the government for a decade, nearly 20,000 restaurants at the time were still serving dog meat. South Korea's successful bid to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1996 prompted a new wave of criticism against its dog meat culture. Activists argue that as whale meat consumption declined in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics, South Koreans should reduce their consumption of dog meat. The controversy surfaced again in 2001 during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The organizers of the games, under pressure from animal rights groups such as PETA, demanded that the Korean government re-address the issue. Brigitte Bardot, a prominent head of a French animal rights organization which is named after her, launched a campaign during the 2002 FIFA World Cup to have dog meat outlawed in Korea. She encouraged people to boycott the games if the government did not outlaw the sale of dog meat in restaurants in Seoul. In October 2018, a leading Egyptian MP (Margaret Azer) suggested that Egypt export stray dogs for meat consumption to countries like South Korea as a solution to the problem of overpopulation of stray dogs in the country. Azer's statements sparked a wave of criticism among animal rights advocates and rescuers in Egypt, although no such plans were ever proven to be in place. Humane Society International http://www.hsi.org is one of the leading international charities working in South Korea to end the dog meat trade, working in partnership with other local Korean groups such as KARA and KAWA. Their dog meat farm closures and associated dog rescues gather much global media interest, and receive support from notable international celebrities such as Ricky Gervais, and Simon Cowell who donated ¬£25,000 to help the charity close a dog farm.https://www.hsi.org/news-media/cowell-donation-uk-092718/ Controversy In Korea, some people eat Bosintang (literally \\"invigorating soup\\"), believing it to have medicinal properties, particularly as relates to virility. In South Korea, dog meat is also believed to encourage one's energy or virility, and usually consumed during the intense Korean summer, whereas in China dog meat is consumed in the winter months under the belief that it increases warmth. There is no scientific evidence to support any purported health benefits from consuming dog meat. Many Korean Buddhists consider eating any kind of meat an offense. In recent years, some South Koreans have changed their attitudes towards eating dog meat as a matter of \\"personal choice\\" to considering it an \\"unnecessary cruelty.\\" Animal rights activists in South Korea protest against the custom of eating dog meat.Activists protest against dog meat eating, BBC Since 1988, international animal welfare activists ‚Äì most notably, French actress Brigitte Bardot ‚Äì have campaigned against dog meat consumption in South Korea. However, Korean nationalists on the internet have argued that a double standard exists, accusing non-Korean animal welfare activists of forcing \\"Westernization\\" on South Korea.America‚Äôs Dog Meat Double Standard A 2007 survey by the South Korean agriculture ministry showed that 59% of South Koreans aged under 30 would not eat dog. Some 62% of the same age group said they regard dogs as pets, not food. Many young Koreans think those who eat dog are anachronists.Young Koreans turn their noses up at dog dinners By Daniel Jeffreys in Seoul,3 August 2007, independent.co.uk The charity NoToDogMeat (World Protection For Dogs And Cats In The Meat Trade) opposes the consumption and trade of dog meat in South Korea, viewing it as an unregulated industry, with conditions it views as unsanitary and cruel. Korea Animal Rights Advocates (KARA) estimates that approximately 1 million dogs are consumed per year in South Korea. Several organizations, such as In Defense of Animals, KARA, Guardians of Rescue, and koreandogs.org, are petitioning the South Korean government to ban dog meat consumption. Since 2002, as the outcry has grown, the number of dogs raised as livestock and the number of dog farms have declined rapidly.As the outcry grows, dog meat sales decline More recently, a June 2018 survey by Gallup Korea showed that 70% of South Koreans say they will not eat dog meat in future.http://www.topstarnews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=454226#08e1 Korean Americans have used lawsuits against public figures who mention this stereotype regarding South Korean cuisine. During the 2002 Winter Olympics, TV host Jay Leno joked that the South Korean skater Kim Dong-Sung would eat his dog. The MCIC Group filed a class-action lawsuit against Leno on behalf of 50,000 Korean Americans, demanding an apology and monetary damages. The animal welfare advocacy group Animal Welfare Institute has called for letters of protest about the dog meat trade to be sent to the South Korean president and ambassador to the United States prior to South Korea hosting the 2018 winter Olympics. The charity World Dog Alliance raised a successful online petition in 2012 calling for the UK Government to intervene and oppose the cruelty. In 2015, the issue was finally debated in the House of Commons Chamber. A second debate on South Korea's dog meat trade in the UK Parliament was held on September 12, 2016, by the Petitions Committee, following an online petition which was started on petition.parliament.uk. Change.org has over 450,000 signatures on a petition to boycott the 2018 Winter Olympics. In 2018 Humane Society International/Korea, Korea Animal Rights Advocates (KARA), and petition site Care2 hand-delivered a petition of 1 million signatures to the President‚Äôs residence, the Blue House, in Seoul, with a letter urging him to initiate a phase-out of dog meat farms.https://www.hsi.org/news- media/petition-korean-dog-meat-trade-082018/ Numerous activist groups have documented cases in South Korea and China of dogs being beaten, burned, electrocuted, and boiled alive. It is often said that in some Asian countries where dog meat is eaten, there is a myth held by some that the more adrenaline a dog produces due to distress just prior to being killed, the more tender the dog meat will be for consumption. Until November 2019, there was no scientific evidence to evaluate welfare conditions of dogs in the South Korean meat trade. However, new scientific evidence published in The Journal of Animal Welfare suggested that dogs farmed for meat in Seoul suffer. The researchers, Natalie Maxwell, Neil Evans and Callum Buchanan, aimed to assess whether dogs from meat farms in Seoul, South Korea, exhibited higher concentrations of cortisol in hair, in comparison to pet dogs. Scientists found that farmed dogs had over twice as high levels of cortisol in hair compared pet dogs, suggesting that dogs on meat farms experience chronic physiological stress. The results, therefore, support the need for changes in the regulations, policy and legislation surrounding the farming of dogs for meat.http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/187460/  See also  * Nureongi * Taboo food and drink * Animal welfare and rights in South Korea  Notes   References  =Sources= * Ahn, Y.

History  Access to Music was founded in 1992 by John Ridgeon to promote and improve popular music education in the UK. The first Access to Music head office was in Leicester. The music school formed a partnership with Leicester College followed by partnerships with regional colleges. The second Access to Music centre opened in Bristol in 1999 and the York and London branches opened in 2002. The first Access to Music award ceremony, hosted by Sir George Martin, took place in London in 2003. Subsequent award ceremonies took place in various locations around the country, including O2 Academy Birmingham and Liverpool Sound City, and have been hosted by BBC Radio DJs Lauren Laverne and Edith Bowman. The music college expanded to Brighton and Lincoln in 2004 with centres opening in both cities. In 2009, Access to Music was acquired by Armstrong Learning, a Manchester-based education and training provider. In 2011, the head office re- located from Leicester to Birmingham, with an administrative centre established in Manchester. In 2011, Access to Music launched a new centre in Darlington based at The Forum Music Centre which later closed. In 2013, the college in Norwich moved from its King Street location to Epic Studios. The York centre created and organised Access to Music's first trade fair at York St John University in early April 2014 and Access to Music presented a Masterclass at the first Brighton Music Conference, an electronic music event. In the summer of 2014 plans were finalised for a new centre in Manchester, opening in early October. The centre was situated in the basement of the St. James's Buildings on Oxford Street, the former location of the music venues Jilly's Rockworld and Music Box. In September 2017, Access to Music released its 2018 further education prospectus under a new brand name of Access Creative College. It updated its website shortly afterwards. The name change was introduced to reflect a broader curriculum offer covering the wider creative industries, including games development, digital media, marketing, events and drama. In February 2020, Access to Music launched a new joint venture partnership with South Essex College to take over the delivery of apprenticeship training for the creative industries on a national basis, under the National College Creative Industries brand.  Courses and accreditations  Access to Music delivered courses at both Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE) levels. It also designed its own FE music curriculum in partnership with Rockschool, the UK‚Äôs only rock and pop accrediting body and Edexcel. The HE curriculum was designed in conjunction with RNCM and BCU.

She was born and died in Stockholm, Sweden. In addition to her short stories and novels, Isaksson also wrote scripts for films and plays. Early life and education Isaksson was born in Stockholm in 1916, the daughter of Knut Lundberg and Greta Brasch, who was a member of the Immanuelkyrkan church; this gave Isaksson's upbringing a strong religious character, something that marked her early novels. Isaksson graduated from high school in 1937; she then began studying philosophy. The next year she married David Isaksson. She was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of philosophy in 1978. Career In 1940 Isaksson debuted with the novel Tr√§det and in 1952 she got her public breakthrough with the novel Kvinnohuset, which was made into a film by Erik Faustman. Ingmar Bergman adapted her novel Det v√§nliga, v√§rdiga (1954) in 1958, and after that he hired Isaksson to write the screenplay for the film Jungfruk√§llan (1960). Her novel Kl√§nningen was adapted by Vilgot Sj√∂man in 1964, Paradistorg became a movie in 1977, directed by Gunnel Lindblom, and Bergman made a television movie of the novel De tv√• saliga (1962). Several of Isaksson's novels of the 1950s are marked by religious problems, as ultimately in Havet and Dit du icke vill, where 17th century witchcraft trials in a village in Dalarna are portrayed of the bases of contemporary protocols. In her previous books she had written primarily about religious tensions and conflicts. In later novels she also directed analysis against erotic motifs, world problems, women's issues, and parenting. Isaksson remained married to David Isaksson until 1963, when she married secondly the author Erik Hjalmar Linder. Together with Linder, she wrote a two-part biography of the author and journalist Elin W√§gner called Elin Wagner, amazon with two breasts, 1882-1922 (Bonnier, 1977) and Elin Wagner, daughter of Mother Earth, 1922-1949 (Bonnier, 1980). In 1994, Ulla Isaksson's autobiography Boken om E was published. This is largely about how she saw her husband Erik Hjalmar Linder suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Boken om E was adapted for the screen in 2001, directed by Bille August, and entitled En s√•ng f√∂r Martin. Isaksson died on 24 April 2000, before the adaptation of Boken om E. =De tv√• saliga (The two blessed), 1962= The book portrays a couple whose love, in combination with psychosis and religious blindness, causes them to go under. The frame story, about a psychiatrist who reads journals concerning this \\"case\\", is following another marriage. The book's core question is what actually determines if a relationship based on love is healthy or sick. It is a classic case description, created using hospital records, letters, and recollections. De tv√• saliga was made into a movie by Ingmar Bergman, and released in 1986. =Kvinnohuset (The women's house), 1952= Kvinnohuset is about a shared housing unit for single working women. A chain of human destinies that cross and touch each other, and where the common denominator is that they are all women living in the same house. A special house for single self-sufficient women, with a doorman for help. The topic of the day is the young theater student Eva Lind, who is about to move in. Most tenants know she is the theater decorator Trygve Krook's mistress. Krook has got an apartment for her in the house, where his wife Anna also lives. The other women living in the house have a hard time understanding her toleration and her indifference to the husband's doings. Kvinnohuset was made into a movie in 1953 and was the first of Ulla Isaksson's novels that was adapted. =Paradistorg (Paradise square), 1973= Paradistorg is the name of a summerhouse in Vaxholm. There, four generations find refuge. But the idyll of the Stockholm archipelago is mined and false security. Families have different ways of living, and old conflicts clash with new, which results in individuals and generations turning against each other. =Boken om E (The book about E), 1994= Ulla Isakssons autobiographical account of how her husband Erik Hjalmar Linder suffered from Alzheimer's disease.

Located in the south-eastern border of the historic center of the city, the arch marks the beginning of one of the routes climbing to the sanctuary of St. Mary of Monte Berico (built in the early 15th century). The path, called the \\"Scalette\\", is a series of stairs with 192 steps. That was the only point of access from the city to the sanctuary before the building of the arcades by Francesco Muttoni in the mid-18th century. Drawing by Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi, 1776 The origins and authenticity of the arch are unclear. The date of construction, set to 1595 (15 years after Palladio's death), is certain, like the identity of the patron, the Venetian captain Giacomo Bragadin. There are documented demands of the monks of the sanctuary, dating from 1574-1576, asking the community for financial support for the restoration of the entire path of stairs, but there is no evidence that the arch was included in the general renewal process, which involved the sanctuary itself.

Lee and starring Florence Vidor and Gary Cooper. Written by Julian Johnson, Donald W. Lee, and Doris Anderson, based on the 1927 novel Doomsday by Warwick Deeping, the film is about a woman who marries a wealthy landowner to escape her life of poverty, leaving behind the handsome farmer she truly loves. Produced by Jesse L. Lasky, Rowland V. Lee, Hector Turnbull, and Adolph Zukor for Paramount Pictures, Doomsday was released on February 18, 1928 in the United States. Plot In Sussex, England after the Great War, former aristocrat Mary Viner (Florence Vidor) and her father, retired sea captain Hesketh Viner (Charles A. Stevenson), live in a small humble cottage on Doomsday, a large and valuable farm property owned by a wealthy landlord named Percival Fream (Lawrence Grant). Mary is attracted to another tenant at Doomsday, Arnold Furze (Gary Cooper), a young ex-officer and farmer who works the land with pride as if it were his own. Soon she and Arnold fall in love, but she longs to escape her oppressive poverty. Meanwhile, the self-made wealthy landlord Percival develops an attraction to Mary and hopes to marry the former aristocrat as evidence of his rising social status. One day middle- aged Percival makes his intentions known to Mary, who cannot resist his palatial home and the lifestyle he offers her. Despite her love for Arnold, she selfishly agrees to marry Percival. After the wedding, they leave Mary's infirm father in the care of a nurse and sail to the Continent and spend the next year living abroad. During that time, Percival gives her jewelry and expensive dresses, but does not give her the love she desires. He treats her as just another one of his belongings to display in front of his friends. Eventually, Mary discovers that the lifestyle she chose has not brought her happiness and that her loveless marriage to Percival was a mistake. After she learns of her father's death, she asks Percival for an annulment. Left with no money and no place to live, Mary ends up at Arnold's cottage and humbly offers to work for him as a housekeeper. Still feeling betrayed by Mary's earlier rejection of their love, Arnold cautiously accepts her offer, but for the next six months, he treats her in an insensitive and overbearing manner. Gradually, their love is rekindled, Arnold atones for his harsh behavior, and the two once again find happiness in each other. Cast * Florence Vidor as Mary Viner * Gary Cooper as Arnold Furze * Lawrence Grant as Percival Fream * Charles A. Stevenson as Capt. Hesketh Viner * Tom Ricketts as Percival's Butler * Frederick Sullivan as Percival's Associate Production The screenplay for the film is based on the 1927 novel Doomsday by Warwick Deeping. Critical response Doomsday received poor reviews upon its theatrical release. In his review for the New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that despite the \\"praiseworthy acting\\" of Florence Vidor, Gary Cooper and Lawrence Grant, the film was \\"somewhat lethargic, ineffectual and shallow\\" and \\"sadly lacking in dramatic tension\\". Hall holds the director responsible for most of the film's shortcomings. Hall concludes that Cooper's acting is \\"wonderfully natural\\" and gives the character \\"an ingratiating personality\\". Vidor is \\"equally competent\\" in her performance, but is undermined by Lee's \\"unimaginative direction\\".

A driven shield is often referred to as a driven guard, especially when applied to PCB traces. Description It is used in situations where the tiny leakage of current through the insulating surfaces of a wire or PCB board would otherwise cause error in the measurements or functionality of the device. The basic principle is to shield the sensitive wire by surrounding it with a conductor that is held at the same voltage as the wire. If they are at the same voltage then there will be no current between the sensitive wire and the shield. This is typically achieved using a voltage buffer/follower that matches the guard voltage to the wire voltage. The leakage from the shield to other circuit elements is of little concern as it is being sourced from the buffer which has a much lower output impedance. The technique is used in equipment such as ECGs, sensitive photomultipliers, electrostatic sensors, and precision low-current measurement where leakage current would alter the measurement. Any situation in which the source to be measured has a very high output impedance is vulnerable to leakage current and if sufficient insulation is not practical then a driven shield will improve performance. Coaxial cable is well suited for use as a guard; if electromagnetic shielding is also required then triaxial cable should be used as depending on the type of buffer circuit any noise on the guard may be amplified in the output. The limiting factor for this method is the input impedance of the voltage buffer, the JFET or CMOS op-amps typically used may have input impedances of many teraohms which is sufficient for most applications. Care must also be taken to ensure there are no unexpected paths by which leakage current may be encountered as this will defeat the system, and extra care must be taken in the design of the amplifier/buffer circuit to prevent oscillation as the guard, especially if it is used over a coaxial cable, may have a strong capacitive coupling to the input.

He was born in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. His nickname is Dickie, and he was sometimes advertised as Dickie Camacho. Professional boxing career Camacho began his professional boxing career, after a stellar amateur career, when he fought another debutante, Reynaldo Vazquez, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, August 27 of 1988. Camacho won by a four-round decision. On October 6 of that year, Camacho fought undefeated (2-0-1) Jose Luis De Jesus in Guaynabo, winning by a four-round split decision. Less than a month later, he scored his first knockout win, beating Luis Vargas on November 3, by a third-round knockout, in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico. Camacho rested during 1989, then returned in 1990, first taking on Ray Ortega, 0-0-1, on May 12 of that year in San Juan, winning by a four-round unanimous decision. He followed that win up with a second-round knockout of Evy Vazquez, who was 0-5 coming in, at the Olympic Auditorium in Miramar, Santurce, Puerto Rico, on June 2. On August 4, 1990, Camacho fought Miguel Santos, 1-7-1, at Pedrin Zorrilla Coliseum in San Juan, winning by technical knockout in four rounds. One month and eleven days later, on September 15, he returned to action at the same coliseum, this time meeting Julio Cesar Acevedo, 3-3-1, and winning by eight round unanimous decision. On October 20 of that year (1990), he had a rematch with Jose Luis De Jesus, by then 5-2-2, at the Pedrin Zorilla Coliseum, knocking De Jesus out in three rounds. Camacho finished 1990 by fighting Julio Cesar Acevedo in a rematch, this time for the vacant Puerto Rican Light- Flyweight title. Acevedo had not fought since their first match and was 3-4-1 coming in. Acevedo caused a mild upset by knocking Camacho out in round twelve, handing Camacho his first loss as a professional. This bout also took place at the Pedrin Zorrilla Coliseum. Camacho's next fight was his third rematch encounter in a row. Despite sporting a record of only 2 wins, 9 losses and 1 draw, Miguel Santos was allowed to compete with Camacho for the vacant Puerto Rican Flyweight championship, therefore, on March 21, 1991, at San Juan, Camacho won the national title by outpointing Santos over twelve rounds. Camacho then fought well-known Puerto Rican Angel Rosario, who had just come off a world title fight loss to Jose Ruiz. On April 27, 1991, at San Juan, Rosario, 11-6-1, outpointed Camacho over ten rounds. Camacho's Puerto Rican Flyweight title was not on the line that night. Camacho took the rest of 1991 off, then began his 1992 professional boxing campaign with a twelve-round unanimous decision victory on March 27 over undefeated Eduardo Nazario (5-0-1) to retain the Puerto Rican national Flyweight title, at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He followed that victory with a win on May 21 over 3-9-1 Luis Ramos, over eight rounds by unanimous decision, also at San Juan. World champion Mexican Eduardo \\"Eddie\\" Vallejo had a record of 3 wins and 5 losses, with 1 win by knockout, having fought seven of his eight fights after moving from Tamaulipas, Mexico to Tyler, Texas. Despite having a negative win-loss record, after his knockout win over Jesus Vera, he was given an opportunity to fight Camacho for the World Boxing Organization's vacant Light-Flyweight title. Camacho-Vallejo took place on July 31, 1992, at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan. Camacho became the WBO world Light-Flyweight champion by knocking Vallejo out in round six. Camacho then took off almost one entire year before returning to the boxing ring. His next bout was a non-title bout against Carlos Juan Rodriguez, 8-4. Fought at Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, this was Camacho's first fight abroad as a professional fighter. He beat Rodriguez by a ten-round unanimous decision on July 21, 1993. Next, he had a rubber match with Julio Cesar Acevedo, on September 25 at Guaynabo, avenging one of his earlier losses by knocking Acevedo out in eight rounds, in another non-title affair. On February 2, 1994, Camacho defended his title for the first time, against future world champion Paul Weir, 7-0 coming in. He retained the title against Weir with a 12-round unanimous decision at Kelvin Hall, in Glasgow, Scotland. His next fight was televised on ESPN on July 15, 1994, as he faced former and future world champion and future hall-of-famer Michael Carbajal at the America West Arena, only a few blocks away from Carbajal's house at Phoenix, Arizona. In this fight, the referee Tony Gibson, slipped and almost fell out of the ring in round four. Carbajal beat Camacho by a twelve-round unanimous decision to take the WBO title away from the Puerto Rican. Career decline Camacho lost his next three fights, effectively completing a four fight losing streak (which started with his title losing effort against Carbajal). These included a challenge of World Boxing Board Flyweight champion Marc Johnson by knockout in eight, exactly one year after the Carbajal fight, on July 15, 1995, at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California, (as part of the Saman Sorjaturong-Humberto Gonzalez undercard), a challenge of World Boxing Union Light-Flyweight champion Nungdiaw Sakcharuporn on January 27, 1996, at the Bansaen Stadium, Chonburi, Thailand, when he was beaten by ninth-round technical knockout, and a loss to WBA Fedelatin Light-Flyweight monarch Gilberto Gonzalez, 7-1-1, by a fifth- round technical knockout at Miami, Florida, March 23, 1996. Camacho retired after the loss to Gonzalez, but then returned on March 4, 1999, defeating Miguel Del Valle by eight-round decision. This turned out to be Camacho's last career victory, and he subsequently lost to Leo Gamez by an eight-round knockout at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, May 29, 1999, for the WBA's interim Super-Flyweight title, then to Gerson Guerrero by a first-round knockout at Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio, California, for the vacant North American Boxing Federation's Flyweight title on May 19, 2001, and to Miguel Del Valle in a rematch, May 25, 2002, at the Acropolis in Manati, Puerto Rico, by a twelve-round unanimous decision for the WBC's CABOFE Flyweight championship.

The neighboring fjords to Randers Fjord are, Mariager Fjord, 15 km to the north, and, Horsens Fjord, 50 km to the south. Angling Voer, anglers herring, spring 2013 Anglers from Denmark, as well as from other countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, travel to Voer in Randers Fjord to catch herring in the season. The season starts in spring and continues throughout summer and autumn. At Voer there is a reed free stretch of bulwark in connection with a shipping channel close to the shore, where the water gets deep fast making it suitable for angling. This relatively deep and narrow stretch also tends to concentrates shoals of herring. Access by car is easy, with space for parking along a dam and unpaved road following the shore a couple of kilometers down from Voer. For anglers the small marinas a couple of km up from Voer in, Uggelhuse, are also interesting, as fresh water fish, not least, perch, can gather in the marinas to avoid salt water intrusion from the sea in combination with incoming tides. Usually the tidal difference in Randers Fjord is less than 30 cm ‚Äì one foot. At Voer lies the Coast and Fjord Centre, (Kyst- og Fjordcentret, in Danish) a nature centre with exhibitions, conference- and accommodation-facilities aimed at informing and teaching about nature and outdoor activities related to Randers Fjord, including the fjords history. At the visiting centre it is also possible to rent boats and to participate in waders-based sessions in the fjord, aimed at various kinds of groups, such as school-classes.

He served under the regime of Napoleon, and as a prefect under the Bourbon Restoration. He was a Deputy from 1827 until 1837, when he was made a Peer of France. He was Minister of Education in 1836 and Minister of Finance in 1840. Early years Privat Joseph Claramont, Count Pelet de la Loz√®re, was born on 12 July 1785 in Saint- Jean-du-Gard, Gard. He was the oldest son of Jean Pelet de la Loz√®re (1759-1842), a deputy to the French National Convention, and of Marie Antoinette Rodier. Joseph Pelet joined the administration in the year VIII as a supernumerary at the Ministry of Interior. He was appointed auditor to the Council of State and Director of the Crown Forests in 1806. He was made Master of Requests in 1811 and administrator of the domaine extraordinaire in 1814. Bourbon Restoration During the Bourbon Restoration Pelet served from 24 February 1819 until 1823 as Prefect of Loir-et-Cher. He was dismissed in 1823 by Jacques-Joseph Corbi√®re due to suspicion of being a liberal, and perhaps also for being a Protestant. On 17 November 1827 he was elected deputy for the first district of Loir-et-Cher (Blois) and for the 2nd district of Loir-et- Cher (Vend√¥me). He chose to represent Blois. He took his seat on the center- left, and voted against the cabinet of Jules de Polignac. Pelet was reelected for Blois on 12 July 1830. July monarchy A later portrait of Pelet Pelet strongly supported the July Monarchy of 1830. He was reelected to Blois on 5 July 1831 and again on 21 June 1834. After the Cabinet of √âdouard Adolphe Mortier was dissolved in February 1835 due to internal divisions, Marshal Soult was invited to form a new cabinet. He offered a post to Pelet, but Soult's proposed cabinet was blocked by the personal influence of king Louis Philippe. Pelet was appointed Minister of Public Education on 22 February 1836 in the First cabinet of Adolphe Thiers. The Pelet Law encouraged communes to have at least one primary school for girls. The Thiers cabinet was dissolved on 6 September 1836 due to a serious disagreement between the king and his advisers over policy regarding Spain. On leaving office Pelet became a leading member of the opposition to the government of Louis-Mathieu Mol√©. In October 1837 he was promoted to the Chamber of Peers. As a peer Pelet supported the regime, but sometimes expressed independent views. The Mol√© government fell in April 1839, followed by a prolonged ministerial crisis. On 1 March 1840 Thiers was again called upon to form a cabinet from the center-left, and Pelet de la Loz√®re was given the Finance portfolio. On 21 October 1840 he resigned due to a crisis in Eastern affairs. He remained in the House of Peers until the February Revolution of 1848 returned him to private life. Joseph Pelet de la Loz√®re died on 9 February 1871 in Villers-Cotter√™ts, Aisne, aged 85.

In that era, named highways were being marked as automobile travel increased, and the advent of numbered highways eventually loomed. The marker was placed at the junction of what is now US Route 1 and Cedar Lane (Virginia Route 623), between Richmond and Ashland, in 1927.

These aircraft are Lear 35, Piper Navajo Chieftain, IAI Westwind Jet and Pilatus PC-12. = Air Ambulance Electronic Health Records = Emed has established the very first EHR for the country of Jamaica. They began this project to help doctors move from paper based workflows to electronic health record based systems on Jan 3rd 2010. The reason for the push to help doctors with medical records was to save more lives and have an accurate trail of medical data to ensure each patient was treated properly.  Air Ambulance Health Tourism  EMed has partnered and assists several large hotels, resorts and cruise lines to provide tourists with emergency air ambulance services in so doing they create a network to provide emergency services that were not available before. Several large companies have been instrumental in helping EMed help more people get the medical services. EMed is the center of health tourism for helping people who have an emergency medical condition fly to their home hospital and doctor's care. Air Ambulance has become EMedical Jamaica's primary business helping several tourists per month fly to their home to receive medical treatment. Most recently the Jamaican Port Authority asked EMed to set up an emergency access office to provide ground and emergency air ambulance evacuations.

Constable. p 249, History The castle was built by Thomas Menzies, a former Provost of Aberdeen, as an L-plan tower house. In 1700 it was extended to the present T-plan. The north wing was used as a parish school between 1716 and 1789. After years of neglect the tower has now been restored. The house has been altered internally. Structure The main part is an L-plan castle; the 1700 addition was the west wing, at the north gable, which has two storeys and an attic. The original house has three storeys and a circular stair tower. This tower is corbelled out heavily in the re-entrant angle from the second floor. It is topped with an oversail from the roof of the south wing. There are angle turrets with conical caps on the top storey. Variations of cable moulding in diminishing courses terminating as foliated stop decorate the corbelling. At the foot of the circular wing, in the re-entrant angle, is the entrance. There is a vaulted basement. The stair in the main wing rises only to the first floor, ascent to the upper levels is by the south wing stair. Another entrance, in the main front, and flanked by slit vents, gives access to the basement. There are four different types of shot-holes, providing a wide range of fire-angles. In the front elevation there is an enlarged 1st floor window under relieving arch which lights the first floor hall. A similar window in the south gable has been blocked. There is a second floor window in the front elevation, while other windows are very small and are randomly sited. The monogram of Thomas Menzies of Durn is carved on the south west turret. The 1700 addition has three entrances, the main one being on the first floor, approached by an external forestair. The roof is of Banffshire slate. It is a category A listed building.

In 2004, he was appointed by then- President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to the position of chief of staff of the army. On 15 September 2013, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense. Gaid Salah was promoted to the rank of General in 1993. He was married and father of seven children. Gaid Salah served as Algeria's de facto leader in 2019. Biography On 26 March 2019, after months of unrelenting anti-Bouteflika protests, Gaid Salah compelled President Bouteflika to resign. The president handed over his resignation under intense public pressure after having announced that he was seeking reelection for a fifth term. Later, in an effort to ease public tension, General Gaid Salah ordered the arrest of the president's brother and close adviser, Said Bouteflika, alleging that he was conspiring with two former intelligence chiefs, retired General Toufik Mediene and General Tartag, to make changes in the leadership of the armed forces, including the removal of Gaid Salah himself from his top position. In an effort to remove opposition, General Gaid Salah ordered the arrest of two former prime ministers as well as other former ministers and several business leaders who were close to presidential advisor Said Bouteflika. His actions at that point gained him a lot of public support. The anti-corruption activity that started in the second quarter of 2019 was used by the Algerian anti- government movement as an opportunity to demand that the military hand over power to a civilian government, a demand that was rejected by General Gaid Salah. Instead, General Gaid Salah said that only a presidential election could bring the country out of its political crisis. Death Gaid Salah suffered a heart attack on the morning of 23 December 2019 and was rushed to a military hospital in Algiers, where he died a few hours later. He was 79 years old. His last public appearance was four days earlier when he received the National Order of Merit from President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. After his funeral, he was buried on 25 December 2019 at El-Alia cemetery, Algiers.

Muus was an 1879 court case in Holden Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota. Divorce in Minnesota's nineteenth century Norwegian-Lutheran community was a rarity. Legal separation between a leading pastor and his wife was unheard of. But an 1879 court case in Holden Township led to both those outcomes, and triggered a public debate about married women's legal rights. Background In summer 1859, Lutheran minister Bernt Julius Muus and his wife Oline arrived in Goodhue County's Holden Township. Muus was to serve Lutherans in Holden, located north of Kenyon in the midst of a growing Norwegian American community. Bernt and Oline had married in Norway shortly before their departure for America. Muus, born in 1832, was six years older than his bride. An honors graduate of the University of Christiania, he came from a line of leading Norwegian clergymen. Oline Pind Muus's family was part of Norway's upper class. She received an excellent education. Oline displayed interest in her husband's work and was a devout Lutheran. Her background made her a worldly, spirited person. A contemporary noted that Oline yearned for more than a life among sturdy but uneducated farmers. Reverend Muus, deeply religious and uncompromising in matters of faith, impressed those who met him. Nevertheless, the minister's unbending pietism and stern manner earned him critics. Followers who strayed from the path he laid out could expect severe rebukes. In ministerial matters, however, he often displayed kindness to those in need or distress. Muus believed in education for the children of his parishioners, but preferred it to be based on his Lutheran standards. He created twenty parochial schools for immigrant children. Muus was a founder of St. Olaf College at nearby Northfield and became its first president. While Muus dealt with challenges presented by American culture, his marriage to Oline floundered. Life in remote Holden was difficult compared to Oline's comfortable youth. Her husband had little time for her and their children. During winter, Bernt allowed only a single room and the kitchen to be heated. When Oline broke her leg in 1877 while pregnant with their sixth child, Bernt advised her to let \\"patience be your liniment.\\" On the November 1878 day her husband dedicated St. Olaf's Old Main building, their ailing twelve-year-old son died of typhus. As Oline's spiritual leader, Bernt denied her communion for what she considered trivial matters. He also stopped her from going back to Norway to visit her family, saying that wives with such demands should be sent to St. Peter (an asylum for the insane). Prior to Oline's request to travel, Bernt had visited Norway alone. Case In early December 1879, Oline brought suit against Bernt. To better support their children, she wanted access to an inheritance left by her father. Bernt had taken the funds, believing they were his to control. In a time when a married woman's legal rights were still precarious, a wife's lawsuit against her clergyman husband stirred public interest. Decision The court ruled that the statute of limitations had run out on the first of Oline's two estate payments. Bernt could keep the initial sum but would have to repay her the second portion, around $1,118. On May 5, 1882, in the case Oline Muus vs. Bernt J. Muus, 29 Minn. 115 (12 N. W. Rep. 343), the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the lower court's original ruling. Aftermath Back in Holden, Oline faced the censure of church members. She claimed that her treatment amounted to \\"torture-a- plenty.\\" A formal March 1881 meeting was held to determine if Oline should be ousted from the church for disobeying her husband. She argued that a wife did not owe blind obedience to her husband. She stated that if God had created women to be slaves, he would not have given them intellect and spiritual ability. Bernt also faced questioning from the membership. An estimated one thousand people attended a February 1880 meeting held mainly to consider dismissing him. During an 1882 gathering, the congregation voted seventy-three to thirty-seven to retain him. Oline Muus left the Holden congregation and moved to Minneapolis. Courts granted her a limited divorce on January 20, 1883. She received $150 per year for ten years as alimony. Bernt was given custody of the children, who were still minors. In 1896, Oline moved to Fruithurst, Alabama, where she owned and operated a hotel. She died there on September 4, 1922. Pastor Muus suffered a stroke in the early 1890s that left him partially paralyzed. A neighbor described him as a \\"sad, lonesome man.\\" Muus decided to return to Norway, where he died on May 25, 1900. Notes References *Appel, Livia and Theodore C.

As a result, no train plied on the route for many years. In 1982, Martin's Light Railways initiated resumption of train service on this line and took up restoration work. However, in 1984, they decided to close down permanently. It was nationalised and taken over by Indian Railways in 1986. Nitish Kumar, then the railway minister laid the foundation stone for the new railway line in 1998. This section has about 144 bridges and 36 level crossings. Hilsa will be the crossing station of this single line section. It was inaugurated in 2003 by Nitish Kumar.

All programming content is now shared to both areas. It is the only AM station in the Smooth radio network to have its own content, a local four-hour weekday show, as all other Smooth AM stations, as added to the network in 2014, carry the London network FM content, opting out only for local news and advertising breaks. The local show on Smooth Wales was carried over from the station's previous incarnation as Gold. History =Prior to 1999= The two stations now broadcasting as Smooth in Wales were originally the AM frequencies of separate ILR stations in North and South Wales. CBC launched to Cardiff in April 1980, and Marcher Sound broadcast to Wrexham and Deeside from September 1983. Both launched with FM and AM transmission. Initially, each station broadcast its own local programmes on both frequencies but, later, following the lead of Capital Radio in London and others, split their transmissions: CBC, which became Red Dragon in 1985, split off its AM frequencies as Touch Radio in 1990, and at around the same time Marcher Sound's AM franchise became Marcher Gold. The stations continued to exist as separate entities throughout this era. =1999-2007: joining networks= Both Touch Radio and Marcher Gold would later go on to join network services after their parent stations were absorbed into larger entities. Capital Radio Group purchased Red Dragon and Touch Radio in 1999, and as a result the AM service joined the Capital Gold network, which was also being rolled out to other AM stations owned by the group. (Red Dragon on FM would retain its local programming and identity until becoming part of the Capital network in 2011.) Marcher Radio Group, meanwhile, was taken over by the GWR Group in 2000, and the Marcher Gold service on 1260 AM joined GWR's Classic Gold network, initially as 'Classic Gold Marcher' and latterly as 'Classic Gold 1260'. The Classic Gold station group was sold by GWR to UBC in 2002, though operationally little changed. On-air, the amount of local programming for Wales was reduced as the stations began to carry more of the networked programmes being broadcast from London (Capital Gold) and Dunstable (Classic Gold). =2007-2014: Gold era= Following the merger of Capital Radio Group and GWR Group in 2005, forming GCap Media, ownership of Capital Gold stations, including that of the South Wales service, transferred to the new company. GCap then re-purchased the Classic Gold station network from UBC to regain control of the AM stations which had existed as sister stations to the ex-GWR FM stations, including the former Classic Gold Marcher. On 3 August 2007, the Classic Gold and Capital Gold networks were combined into a single Gold network, broadcasting mostly from London, with four hours a day of local content to each station, broadcast between noon and 4pm, and this was generally voice-tracked rather than live. Both Gold services in Wales now received a single Gold programme for Wales in the slot, taking London content at other times. Ofcom would later introduce content-sharing guidelines for AM stations, allowing all AM services to share programming with their sister services provided that at least ten hours a day of content came from within the nation (England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) to which the station was broadcast, although stations which had already been given permission to carry less than ten hours from their nation could retain their existing provision; this allowed Global Radio, who had purchased GCap (and by extension Gold) in 2008, to drop local programming on the Gold stations in England from June 2010, whilst continuing to provide the four-hour daily opt-out for Wales as previously constituted. =2014: Relaunch as Smooth Radio= On 24 March 2014, most Gold AM frequencies in England were turned over to Smooth Radio, following Global Radio's acquisition of Real and Smooth Ltd. The Gold stations in England which changed over simply swapped out Gold network programming for that of the London Smooth service, retaining local news and advertising opt- outs, whilst the regional Smooth FM stations regained local breakfast and drivetime shows. In Wales, a local show was retained in the former Gold timeslot of midday to 4pm, opting out of the final hour of the Kate Garraway morning show and the entire networked afternoon show, however as of August 3, 2015 the show has opted out the final hour of Paul Phear's afternoon show and the entire drivetime show; networked content from Smooth's London service is carried at other times, including breakfast and weekend. The programme has since reverted to its former timeslot. Frequencies *1260 kHz AM - Wrexham and Deeside *1305 kHz AM - Gwent *1359 kHz AM - Cardiff *DAB - south-east Wales; north-west Wales Although available on AM in the area, Smooth Wales is not currently carried on DAB in Northeast Wales/West Cheshire. The DAB service to south-east Wales was turned over from Gold to Smooth at the same time as the AM service was, and DAB transmissions to northwest Wales began when the new local DAB multiplex was switched on in December 2014.

It is a dramatization of the downfall of the Michele Sindona's financial empire and of the subsequent Giorgio Ambrosoli's murder in 1979. The film won the David di Donatello for Best Producer and a special David di Donatello given to Placido for the \\"recognized narrative, artistic and civil value of his work\\". Plot The film takes place in Milan in the seventies and tells the story of the lawyer Giorgio Ambrosoli and his investigations into the illicit financial activities of the Sicilian banker Michele Sindona, of whose banks he had been appointed liquidator. In 1974, the lawyer Giorgio Ambrosoli was appointed liquidator of the Italian Private Bank: forty, a fair, honest man in love with his wife Annalori and three children - Filippo, Francesca, Umberto - he got to work, while outside clients and depositors riot over their accounts. An indefatigable worker, Ambrosoli does not yet know in what tangle of mysteries he finds himself and what challenge he has taken on: the Bank, based in Milan, is in fact owned by the Sicilian Michele Sindona, an ultra-powerful financier. The \\"map\\" of the banks and companies it owns is very dense, in Italy and beyond the border. Sindona has fled to New York and from the Hotel Pierre gives his orders: the mafia supports him and huge amounts of money come out of Italy, or re-enter in obscure money laundering operations, or spread like a metastasis in the great Sicilian empire, who has built close relationships not only with other financial men, but with politicians and industrialists. Ambrosoli is helped by Silvio Novembre, Marshal of the Guardia di Finanza, who from a collaborator becomes his friend, while the internal environment of the bank opposes the liquidator and the Bank of Italy itself does not seem to offer him all the necessary support. When wrongdoings, tortuous turns, bogus companies and documentation flaws are discovered for operations of enormous proportions, Sindona, furious, goes on the attack. There will be citations against Ambrosoli, telephone threats and various blandishments, but the lawyer does not yield: he presents his report, which is a real indictment, he refuses to change the conclusions, because - honest as' it is - it seems monstrous and intolerable to him that the State should intervene with payments at its own expense. Meanwhile, the names of politicians at the top are in circulation, such as corrupt or protectors of Sindona who has connections everywhere. Ambrosoli's family life itself has become more than tiring: his wife is alarmed, the children no longer see their father, who luckily found an honest and tenacious collaborator in November. After being invited, in 1978, to testify before the New York Grand Jury, returning to Milan Ambrosoli now has behind him the deadly hatred of Sindona, whose judicial position in the United States is compromised. The mafia itself abandons the financier to his fate, who gives the order to eliminate the Milanese lawyer. Renewed telephone threats do not prevent Ambrosoli from fulfilling his task. Returning home one evening (by the way he has never been given an escort), while his family members are on Lake Como, Joseph Aric√≤, an Italian-American hitman, kills him with four revolver shots.

Located in a rural area once known as Mosquitoville, this c. 1785 wood frame house was built by Timothy Bancroft, who operated a sawmill nearby that was one of the town's major industries for nearly a century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Timothy Bancroft House stands in what is now a rural and isolated area of northern Harrisville, near the end of Bancroft Road. Set on a rise overlooking the former mill site, it is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. An older ell extends to the east, with its own central chimney. The styling of the house is Greek Revival, with wide cornerboards and a gabled hood over the entrance. A shed-roof porch extends across the front of the ell. Timothy Bancroft is believed to have built the ell of this house in about 1785; the larger main block was probably added in the mid-19th century. During the 19th century, the Bancroft mill complex was at the center of a community known variously as Mosquitoville and Mosquitobush. The complex included a number of additional buildings, and the busy mill supplied wood products to the textile mills in Harrisville center, and was a major local employer. The mill burned in 1875. The house was subsequently used as housing for another nearby sawmill, and then as a summer residence.

The statue has been grade II listed since 8 June 1982. Standing at the boundary between Birmingham and Edgbaston, it was sculpted by John Thomas, whom Sir Charles Barry had employed as stone and wood carver on the former King Edward's Grammar School at Five Ways. He died before completing the memorial, which cost ¬£1000. Some time around 1975, the figure of Sturge's left hand fell off.The source says \\"right hand\\", but images clearly show the left hand missing; the right hand is on the bible, so not detachable Sturge is posed as if he were teaching, with his right hand resting on a Bible to indicate his strong Christian faith. He wears a lapel-less coat of a style favoured by contemporary Quakers. Lower on the plinth, he is flanked by two female allegorical figures: one representing Peace holds a dove and an olive branch, with a lamb at her feet, symbolic of innocence; and the other, Charity, offers comfort and succour to two Afro-Caribbean infants, recalling the fight and victory over slavery. Around the crown of the plinth are inscribed the words \\"Charity, Temperance and Peace\\" (the word \\"Temperance\\" is on a gadrooned basin, which used to dispense drinking water), as well as Sturge's name and his date of death. The figures and pedestal (still the original) are in Portland stone. In 1925 the monument was moved a short distance, to its current position, and a bronze plaque was affixed to the memorial to tell passers-by more about its subject. The inscription reads (all in capitals; punctuation added for readability): In 2006-2007 the Birmingham Civic Society, Birmingham City Council, and the Sturge family restored the statue for the 200th anniversary of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. This included the provision of a replacement for the missing hand. On 24 March 2007, the city held a civic ceremony to formally rededicate the statue. The Lord Mayor of Birmingham, councillor Mike Sharpe, unveiled a new interpretation board giving details of Sturge's life. The work is now in the care of Birmingham City Council.

In its first season under head coach Bill Reid, the team compiled a 12‚Äì0 record, shut out nine of 12 opponents, and outscored all opponents by a total of 254 to 24. When Harvard met Yale at season's end, it was considered to be for the national championship by the contemporaneous media. Harper's Weekly (photo below) and the Chicago Tribune recognized the team as national champions. In addition, the team was retrospectively named as the national champion by two selectors, the Billingsley Report and Parke H.

Three other selectors, the Helms Athletic Foundation, Houlgate System, and the National Championship Foundation retrospectively named Michigan as the 1901 national champion. A modern authority on college football rankings said, \\"Indeed, had there been an AP poll in 1901, Harvard would have been #1 by a landslide.\\" Nine Harvard players received first-team honors from Walter Camp (WC) or Caspar Whitney (CW) on the 1901 All-America team: * Fullback Thomas Graydon (WC-1, CW-1); * Halfback Robert Kernan (WC-1, CW-1); * Halfback A.

It is now the Harrisville Inn. Built about 1842, it is one of the best-preserved 19th century connected farmsteads in the town. The property is also notable for its association with Arthur E. Childs, who purchased the property to serve as the estate farm for his nearby Aldworth Manor summer estate. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Persia Beal House stands in a rural setting west of the center of Harrisville, on the north side of Chesham Road between Nelson and Aldworth Manor roads. It is a connected farmstead, with a 1¬Ω-story Cape on the right end, a two-story ell joining it to a three-story barn, and a single-story ell extending further to the left from the rear of the barn. The Cape section has a gabled wall dormer with three sash windows above a five-bay facade. The main entrance is at the center of that facade, sheltered by a gabled Victorian-era porch. There are secondary entrances in the ell and the barn, which have been adapted to serve hospitality functions. The barn is one of the largest 19th-century barns in the town. The house was built about 1842 by Persia Beal, a farmer. In 1905 his farm was purchased by Arthur E. Childs, a businessman from Worcester, Massachusetts. Childs used the house as quarters for the caretaker of his summer estate, Aldworth Manor, which occupied the lands north and west of this property, and used its farmland as the estate farm. The property was sold by Childs in the 1930s.

Most of the assigned schools provided phase III advanced single-engine flying training for Air Cadets, from which the graduates would attend Replacement Training schools operated by one of the numbered air forces in single-engine fighters. From there they would be deployed overseas to the combat theaters as replacement pilots. The command also operated several specialized schools at Jackson, Tuskegee, Spence and Clewiston. Jackson Army Air Base was the home of the Royal Netherlands Flight Academy, which trained pilots for their air force. It also had a two-engine school for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber training for Dutch pilots. Riddle Field at Clewiston, Florida was a contract pilot school which taught both primary and basic flight training. Tuskegee Field, Alabama was exclusively for black air cadets, who received their basic and single-engine advanced training by black Army instructors after graduating from the primary school at Moton Field, operated by the Tuskegee Institute. As training requirements changed during the war, schools were activated and inactivated or transferred to meet those requirements.Manning, Thomas A.

The church, rising from the coast and pointing its tower towards the heavens, has been a beacon for those travelling at sea. It has more supporters all over the world than any other church in Iceland and is often referred to as the 'miracle church' with the locals' longstanding belief that it has profound, divine powers.Gu√∞r√∫n Rannveig Stef√°nsd√≥ttir, \\"Strandarkirkja, √°heitasta√∞ur √≠ nor√∞ri\\", Church of Iceland  History  Front view of Strandarkirkja The Church was originally built sometime in the 12th century. The story relates that there is one night when a group of sailors tried to navigate back to Iceland in a storm. The southern coast of Iceland is notorious for its hidden reefs and rough coast. The distressed sailors prayed to God for a safe return and vowed to build a church wherever they landed. When they ended their prayer an angel, seemingly made of light, appeared before their bow. The angel guided them through the rough surfs and led the crew into a bay for safe landing. The sailors, making good on the promise, built a wooden church at the site and named it Strandarkirkja. The bay nearby is named Angel's Bay (Engilsv√≠k in Icelandic) to commemorate the incident.Magn√∫s Gu√∞j√≥nsson, Strandarkirkja √≠ Selvogi, 3rd ed. Reykjav√≠k, 2001 Many miracles have been attributed to Strandarkirkja and there was a time when it was one of the richest churches in Iceland from the donations of Icelanders coming from all over the country in hopes of having their prayers and wishes realized.P√©tur P√©tursson, Kristni √° √çslandi, Reykjav√≠k, 2000 = The Estate of Str√∂nd = In earlier times Str√∂nd (Coast in Icelandic) was a rich farm, where both sea and land gave generously.Konr√°d Bjarnarson and Rev. Magn√∫s Gu√∞j√≥nsson, Strandarkirkja The pastures were rich, consisting of good land facing south for grazing sheep and sheltered from the cold northern wind by the mountain Hl√≠√∞arfjall 5-6km north of Selvogur. The good fishing grounds were also not far away so the farmers in Selvogur reaped from both the land and the sea. In addition to this there were mentions of farmers collecting timber from woods nearby and having the right to collect eggs and kill birds in the sea-cliffs at Kr√≠suv√≠kurberg. { class=\\"wikitable floatleft\\" + Census Population of Selvogur, 1703-2015 http://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__menning__5_trufelog/MAN10297.px/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=6ffa2c02-bac9-4199-bd4f-d95201730e51, Statistics Iceland. - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year !! scope=\\"col\\"  Inhabitants - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1703  154 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1729  120 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1801  115 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1901  115 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1920  114 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1930  100 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1990  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2010  13 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2015  14 } = Selvogur = Lands√Ωn in front of Strandarkirkja. Strandarkirkja served as the parish church of the community of Selvogur (Seal Cove in Icelandic). In the early days of Icelandic settlement the area had numerous substantial farms. The town is first mentioned in Sturlunga Saga, where Gissur √ûorvaldsson allows Dufgusi √ûorleifsson take up residence there in the summer of 1238.\\"Sturlunga saga\\", in: Rudolf Simek and Hermann P√°lsson, Lexikon der altnordischen Literatur, Kr√∂ners Taschenausgabe 490, Stuttgart: Kr√∂ner, 1987, , pp. 339-41 Over the years, the town began to decline as wind and water erosion began to cause a collapse of the farming culture. The population has dwindled substantially as people started to move into cities, dropping to little more than 110 at the turn of the 20th Century and to 14 people in 2015.\\"Strandarsokn\\", http://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__menning__5_trufelog/MAN10297.px/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=6ffa2c02-bac9-4199-bd4f-d95201730e51, Statistics Iceland. Selvogur remained one of the most isolated settlements in the region, with electricity not being available in the area until 1970.

In addition, masses are also held by the parish priest on Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost.

Background A descendant of Sir Christopher Packe, Pack was the son of the Very Reverend Thomas Pack, Dean of Ossory in the east of Ireland. His mother was Catherine, daughter and heiress of Denis Sullivan of Berehaven, Ireland. His tomb is in St. Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny, Ireland near Kilkenny Castle. Military career He saw service in Flanders in 1794, was on the Quiberon expedition of 1795, and in Ireland of the suppression of the 1798 rebellion. He commanded the 71st Foot during the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. Tomb of Sir Denis Pack, Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny His regiment was incorporated to the forces of General William Beresford when he led the first British invasion to Buenos Aires in June of that year. Their regiment contributed more than half of the invading troops, and with them Beresford occupied Buenos Aires without greater resistance. However, in the second week of August 1806, Santiago de Liniers, would begin one of the most important events of Argentine History, reconquering the city and overcoming the English. Its officers and troops were taken prisoners and interned in different localities of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata. General Beresford, together with Colonel Pack, were housed in the Villa of Luj√°n. Both soldiers fled later to Montevideo, aided by local independentists. Once in Montevideo, Pack joined the division of General Robert Craufurd to join the second invasion to Buenos Aires, although he had taken the oath never to take up arms against Spain. Pack violated his oath, taking active part in the occupation of Colonia del Sacramento, which made the attack by Colonel Francisco Javier de El√≠o fail. He accompanied Craufurd in the battle of Corrales de Miserere and in the attack on the city of Buenos Aires. He occupied with the men at his command the Church of Santo Domingo, where the local resistance forced him to rest; There he found the flag of his beloved Regiment 71. But, despite his efforts, he was overcome by the tenacity of the attack by the Buenos Aires regiments. He tried to abandon his position and the city, but the Buenos Aires forces gathered around him, and he must finally surrender. The people were looking for Pack to execute him for perjury, but the Dominican friars protected him until he was delivered to General John Whitelocke, at the beginning of the English retreat. In 1806, he was in the Peninsular in 1808, and the Walcheren expedition in 1809. During the Peninsular War he was present at the battles of Roli√ßa, Vimiero, A Coru√±a, Busaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca, Vittoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. His Peninsular Gold Medal had seven clasps.Bob Burnham: The British Army Against Napoleon, p259 Pack was promoted to major-general in 1813 and commanded (1810‚Äì14) the Oporto Brigade of the Portuguese Army in Spain. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 and commanded the 9th Brigade of Sir Thomas Picton's 5th Division at the Battle of Waterloo. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Plymouth and General Officer Commanding Western District in 1819.

This act became law during the 113th United States Congress. Congress considered several other bills that would provide aid to Ukraine around that same time, including S. 2124, a Senate bill with the same name, and the Ukraine Support Act. Background The 2014 Ukrainian revolution began with civil unrest in Kiev, Ukraine, as part of Ukraine's ongoing Euromaidan protest movement against the government. The conflict escalated rapidly, leading to the downfall of the government of President Viktor Yanukovych and the setting up of a new government to replace it within a few days. Yanukovych fled to Russia, and is wanted in Ukraine for the killing of protesters. The conflict continued with the 2014 Crimean crisis when Russian forces seized control of the Crimea region. The 2014 Crimean crisis began in late February 2014 in the aftermath of the Ukrainian Revolution, when‚Äîafter months of protests by Euromaidan and days of violent clashes between protesters and police in the Ukrainian capital Kiev‚Äîthe President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, fled the capital on February 21.

However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said President Yanukovych was illegally impeached and that Russia continues to regard him as Ukraine's legitimate president.United Nations News Centre - UN Security Council action on Crimea referendum blocked Russia describes the Yatsenyk government as \\"self-proclaimed\\" and the events in Kiev as a \\"coup d'etat\\".

Beginning on February 26, pro-Russian forces gradually took control of the Crimean peninsula. Russia claimed that the uniformed men were local self-defense forces, but they are generally claimed in Western media to be Russian military personnel without insignia. On 28 February, President Barack Obama's statement was released warning Russia not to intervene in Crimea. The statement said that President Obama is \\"deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine.\\" It added that \\"any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe\\" and that it would be \\"a clear violation of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international laws.\\" On 1 March, Obama held a phone conversation with Putin and said that the Russian invasion was a \\"violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity ... [and a] breach of international law.\\" He warned of \\"greater political and economic isolation\\" and threatened to withdraw the United States from the 40th G8 summit chaired by Russia. Barack Obama talks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, March 1, 2014 Secretary of State John Kerry then labeled and condemned Russia's \\"invasion\\" of Ukraine on March 2 in an interview for Face the Nation. He called it an \\"incredible act of aggression,\\" and said that \\"you just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext.\\" On 3 March, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden announced that the United States would not send a presidential delegation to the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi (which was to be led by Tammy Duckworth), \\"in addition to other measures we are taking in response to the situation in Ukraine.\\" As with the British boycott effort, it will not affect the country's participation in the Games themselves. On 6 March, Obama signed Executive Order 13660, Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine, authorizing sanctions against persons who, being determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State, have violated or assisted in the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. On March 11, the Supreme Council of Crimea and the City Council of Sevastopol adopted a joint resolution expressing their intention to unilaterally declare Crimea's independence from Ukraine as a single united nation with the possibility of joining the Russian Federation as a federal subject. In a referendum on March 16, officials said that nearly 96% of those who voted in Crimea supported joining Russia.Crimea Applies to Join Russia Election officials said the turnout was a record high,Crimea referendum: Voters 'back Russia union', BBC, March 16, 2014 although many Tatars and opponents of the referendum were reported to have boycotted the vote.Crimea election chief reports 95% vote to secede, half of ballots counted CBC Retrieved on March 16, 2014 On March 17, the Crimean parliament officially declared its independence from Ukraine and requested to join the Russian Federation.Crimean parliament formally applies to join Russia, BBC, March 17, 2014 On March 18, President Putin reclaimed Crimea as a part of Russia on both moral and material grounds, citing the principle of self-determination and Crimea's strategic importance for Russia.Uriel Abulof, Self-Determination, Redux?, Huffingtonpost, March 20, 2014 The Ukrainian parliament has stated that the referendum is unconstitutional.

Provisions of the bill According to the Congressional Research Service report, the initial House version of the bill would make \\"specified funds under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and prior Acts for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs available to Ukraine for loan guarantees.\\" The bill would state that such amounts shall not be considered 'assistance' for the purpose of provisions of law limiting assistance to such country. The bill provides only for loan guarantees, not actual loans themselves. Senators Bob Menendez and Bob Corker propose to amend the bill to include provisions about sanctions. Procedural history H.R. 4152 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 5, 2014 by Rep. Harold Rogers (R, KY-5). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Appropriations and the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

The Senate did vote to pass the bill by a voice vote on March 27, 2014 after amending it. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on April 3, 2014, making it . Debate and discussion Senator Reid spoke in favor of the bill saying that \\"the people of Ukraine are watching... It's time to send a clear message to Putin that the U.S. condemns the annexation of Ukraine.\\" Speaker of the House John Boehner said that the \\"best thing\\" that the House could do would be to \\"work with the administration, strengthening their hand to deal with what is a very difficult situation.\\" This aid package was considered \\"a rare show of support for President Barack Obama\\" by House Republicans. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor argued that the bill would show that the United States was \\"against this invasion.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Acts of the 113th United States Congress *2014 Crimean crisis *2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine *International reactions to the 2014 Crimean crisis Notes References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4152 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4152 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4152 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4152 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4152 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4152 Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:Russo-Ukrainian War Category:March 2014 events in the United States Category:Ukraine‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014"},{"id":"42315796","text":"The Sustainable City Awards are a national \\"green business\\" awards scheme administered by the City of London Corporation.

It is coordinated by Europeana, as part of a broader program to digitise European cultural heritage. The collection is composed of three major elements. The first, also titled Europeana 1914‚Äì1918, gathers digitised memorabilia and personal stories from individuals, including a series of public workshops where material can be scanned or photographed. The second, Europeana Collections 1914‚Äì1918, is a coordinated digitisation program by ten major libraries across eight European countries. The third element, EFG1914, is a project to digitise a substantial number of wartime silent films through the European Film Gateway. Background The Europeana 1914‚Äì1918 project was publicly announced in 2011, as \\"Europeana Collections 1914‚Äì1918: Remembering the First World War\\", with the goal of digitising over 400,000 source items from thirteen institutions. The original plan called for around 425,000 digitised items from the partner institutions. This would sit alongside 27,000 items (mostly photographs from the UK and France) already in Europeana, and include around 75,000 items already digitised but not yet added to Europeana. The focus was to be on \\"special collections\\" ‚Äì manuscripts, artwork, rare books, maps, music, etc. ‚Äì with the goal that most material provided would be rare or unique. Material would be hosted by the institutions but accessible through an aggregated service, and where possible copyright issues would be resolved to ensure maximal reusability of material. Overall, the project was anticipated to cost around 5.4 million euro, the bulk of which was due to 3.1 million euro in staffing costs at the partner institutions and 1 million in costs for sub- contracted digitisation. (The bulk of digitisation was carried out in-house.) Material from \\"Collections\\" was released to the Europeana site as it was digitised and uploaded, with the first collections (newspapers from Austria and photographs/magazines from Italy) released in March 2012. The first public events to showcase these digitised collections began in 2013, continuing through release in 2014. The public \\"Europeana 1914‚Äì18\\" project opened for online submissions and began the first public roadshow events in March 2011. These events invited members of the public to bring physical artefacts or documents to be digitised, and to record information or stories connected to them. 51 sessions were run across Europe up to December 2013. The public initiative used the Community Collection Model founded by Stuart Lee and Kate Lindsay at the University of Oxford in 2008 and used for The Great War Archive. The University of Oxford was a partner in Europeana 1914‚Äì1918, providing support in the development of the online platform and training to all institutions running roadshow events. Release and reception A postcard sent by Adolf Hitler in 1916, digitised at a public roadshow in 2012. The main public-facing portal for the overall project () was launched at the Berlin State Library on 29 January 2014 by Monika Gr√ºtters, the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media. At the time of launch, the site had around 400,000 digitised items from the partner institutions, alongside 90,000 \\"personal\\" items and 660 hours of film. Public reaction to the collections has often highlighted individual items or small collections. For example, digitised correspondence from the British Library's India Office collections has been used to highlight the involvement of Indian soldiers, particularly on the Western Front; An early find during the public digitisation project was a postcard (right) sent by Adolf Hitler to a fellow soldier while recuperating in hospital, which attracted a great deal of media attention.

The properties, a number of which were built for members of the Thayer family, lie on Mason Road, just north of the town line with Dublin. The most significant property of the six is the Skyfield estate, whose large Georgian Revival mansion was designed by Lois Lilley Howe and built in 1916. The district is also notable as containing archaeological remnants of 18th century farmsteads, for which reason its properties are also listed in the Harrisville Rural District. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Skyfield is a three-story U-shaped brick building, with a long main block and two projecting wings, and was built to replace an earlier Shingle style house. The Skyfield property includes a number of outbuildings, most of which date to the 19th century. These wood frame structures include a barn (since remodeled for year-round residential use), an icehouse, laundry, toolshed, and garage. An 1884 farmhouse, built for the property's caretakers, is situated on the property near Venable Road. left Several houses on Mason Road were built for members of the Thayer family around the turn of the 20th century. The L. H. Thayer House and the S. E. Thayer house, both located on the south side of Mason Road, were designed by the Boston firm of Kendall, Taylor and Stevens, and are among Harrisville's finest examples of Shingle style. A third house, built for L. E. Thayer in 1900, was destroyed by fire in 1975, and replaced by a Post-modern Shingle house with similar massing and sympathetic styling. This third house, along with several of Skyfield's outbuildings, do not contribute to the district's significance.

Personal life Choupenitch is the son of Belarusian-born opera singers who both worked at National Theatre Brno. The unusual form of his name‚ÄìChoupenitch instead of ≈†upeniƒç‚Äìis due to the fact that papers issued to his parents for travelling through Europe used a French spelling. His first sport, basketball, left him frustrated as he seldom got to touch the ball, so his mother took him to the fencing section of Sokol Brno when he was eight. He later learnt that his step-grandmother, Tatyana Petrenko-Samusenko, was a three-time Olympic foil champion for the USSR. Foil was the only option offered at the club, but he later explained that foil is indeed his favourite weapon, being the more realistic and striking the best balance between sabre's speed and √©p√©e's tactics. His first coach was Dmitri Romankov, who also trained Belarusian fencer Siarhei Byk. Choupenitch's other favourite sports are association football and ice hockey. He also plays the piano. He interrupted his studies at the Masaryk University in Brno to focus on sport. In April 2015 he gained a sponsorship from Red Bull. Career Choupenitch won his first international distinctions in 2011 with a gold medal at the Cadet European Championships in Klagenfurt and a bronze medal in the Cadet World Championships at the Dead Sea. As a junior, he earned the silver medal in the 2012 Junior World Championships in Poreƒç and won the Junior World Cup the same year. The next season, he took the silver medal in the Junior European Championships in Budapest and a bronze medal in the World Championships in Poreƒç; he also finished first of the Junior World Cup for the second year in a row. He won in 2014 the Junior European Championships in Jerusalem and earned a silver medal in the Junior World Championships in Plovdiv after losing the final to China's Chen Haiwei. Choupenitch also fences as a senior since 2010‚Äì11. For his first participation in the World Championships in Catania in 2011 he was eliminated in the first round by Japan's Yuki Ota. At the age of 17 he aimed for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but he was defeated by Romania's Radu DƒÉrƒÉban in the quarter-finals of the qualifying tournament in Bratislava. At the beginning of the 2013‚Äì14 season Choupenitch transferred from Sokol Brno to CS Fides in Livorno, Italy, to train under Paolo Paoletti. He reached the final at the A Coru√±a World Cup before being defeated by China's Ma Jianfei and ended up with a silver medal. His victory during the tournament over Olympic champion Andrea Baldini encouraged him to believe he could become a champion in his own right. A few weeks later he lost again against Ma in the Venice Grand Prix, this time in the semi-final, and took a bronze medal. In the European Championships at Strasbourg, he reached the quarter-finals, but was defeated 13‚Äì15 by Great Britain's James-Andrew Davis, who eventually won the gold medal. At the World Championships in Kazan, he lost in the quarter-finals to China's Ma Jianfei, who eventually won the silver medal. Choupenitch finished the season No.5 in world rankings, gaining 76 ranks compared to 2012‚Äì13 season.

It was an ancestor of the present-day Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. History Times Building, 1890s Office and staff, 1885 Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline The Times began publication on 2 February 1880, with Pittsburgh Leader veteran Robert P. Nevin as founder, proprietor and editor. It was issued every morning except Sunday and was Republican in politics. In 1884, Nevin sold out to a company headed by local political boss Christopher Magee. The new publishers attracted subscribers by cutting the price of an issue from two cents to a penny, and by the end of the decade, reported a daily circulation exceeding that of the city's other morning papers. Having outgrown a series of modest quarters, the Times moved in 1892 to its new eight-story Times Building, designed by Frederick J. Osterling in Richardsonian Romanesque style. The structure still stands in downtown Pittsburgh's Fourth Avenue Historic District. The Pittsburg Daily News was launched in 1896 as the sister newspaper and evening counterpart of the morning Times. Half a decade later it was bought and absorbed by the city's leading evening paper, The Pittsburg Press. In 1906, five years after Magee's death, George T. Oliver bought the Times and merged it with the morning paper he already owned, The Pittsburgh Gazette, to form The Gazette Times. The merged publications were compatible in their conservatism, restraint from sensationalism, and Republican political bent. Prior to consolidation, both papers had a similar daily circulation of about 70,000. Anti-Masonic paper An earlier, unrelated Pittsburgh Times existed roughly contemporaneously with the national Anti-Masonic movement of the late 1820s and the 1830s. Founded in 1829 as the (Anti-Masonic) Examiner, it became the Times in January 1831. The paper was established in opposition to Freemasonry and for most of its existence catered to \\"those who prefer the Supremacy of the Laws to the domination of the Lodge.\\" It was issued on a weekly basis, with a short-lived daily edition in 1837. It discontinued publication on , transferring its subscription list and accounts to the Gazette.

A former staff writer for the Irish Independent, O'Doherty worked in a range of areas, including on the criminal justice system and corruption, which allegedly led to her dismissal in 2014. As a political candidate, O'Doherty failed to secure the nominations required to run in the 2018 Irish presidential election, was unsuccessful in the 2019 European Parliament election in Ireland (with 1.85% of first preference votes in the Dublin constituency), and unsuccessful in the 2020 Irish general election (with under 2% of the vote). Her controversial views across a range of subjects have led to a number of legal actions and calls for changes to hate- crime legislation. She has been banned since July 2019 from YouTube for violations of its policies on hate speech. Early life Gemma O'Doherty was born in Ranelagh in Dublin, to Hubert O'Doherty, a pharmacist, and his wife Sheila. O'Doherty has a BA in Politics and an MA in Equality Studies from University College Dublin. She was a teacher before becoming a journalist, and lived in Spain for a number of years. She is the widow of the editor of the Irish Independents Sunday Review, Peter Carvosso. Born in England in 1947, he died of motor neurone disease in January 2015, aged 67; O'Doherty was his second wife. Journalism =Irish Independent (1995‚Äì2014) = O'Doherty joined the Irish Independent in 1995 as a staff writer, later becoming Chief Features Writer. However, her highest-profile work concerned her reporting on Ireland's criminal justice system and on allegations of corruption in the Irish police force. In 2013, Roy Greenslade in The Guardian, at the time she was fired from the Irish Independent, described her as \\"one of Ireland's leading investigative journalists\\", but mentioned concerns over the ethics of her newsgathering methods. Another Irish journalist has questioned the impact of her investigative work and her use of \\"theories of conspiracy\\". In 2010, O'Doherty wrote an article highlighting issues in the investigation into the 1985 death of a priest, Niall Molloy, after a society wedding in County Offaly that included senior Irish political figures, and the collapse of the subsequent manslaughter trial. Her work led to the reopening of the case. According to O'Doherty, her research had \\"exposed a cover-up of staggering proportions involving several institutions of the State and the Catholic Church.\\" However, in 2015, a follow-up Garda review of the case concluded that the original Garda investigation was correctly concluded. In 2013, while investigating the penalty points cancellation scandal, O'Doherty sought to question Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan about the quashing of his own speeding points and called to his private home at approximately 10pm in order to do so, speaking to Callinan's wife. In August 2013, Doherty was fired from the Irish Independent and, though the newspaper rejected any links between the firing and the phone call, editor-in-chief Stephen Rae branded her as a \\"rogue reporter\\" for approaching the commissioner without editorial permission. The Irish National Union of Journalists condemned the dismissal as unfair. O'Doherty lodged a complaint about her dismissal with the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), which was resolved in 2014 with Independent News & Media plc praising her contributions to the newspaper and tendering an unreserved apology, whilst paying her an undisclosed sum. Similarly, she won a defamation case against the Irish Independent at the High Court, where the newspaper stated: \\"Independent Newspapers wish to acknowledge the exceptional work of multi-award winning investigative journalist Gemma O'Doherty for the Irish Independent during the course of a lengthy career\\". = Freelance (2014‚Äì) = Justin Barrett being interviewed by Gemma O'Doherty in 2019. After the Irish Independent, O'Doherty worked freelance, publicly criticising \\"the cosy cartel that exists between the press, power and the police in this country\\". In 2016, O'Doherty produced a documentary, Mary Boyle: The Untold Story, about the disappearance of a child in 1977, which was published on YouTube. The disappearance of Mary Boyle is the longest running missing child case in Ireland, and the documentary implies political interference in the investigation. The documentary led to O'Doherty being sued for defamation by the late Fianna F√°il politician, Sean McEniff, for damages of ‚Ç¨75,000. In 2019, after McEniff's death, a judge granted his estate leave to continue the case. When reviewing Mary Boyle: The Untold Story, The Irish Times expanded on her journalistic career with the Irish Independent and noted that \\"The establishment does not like Gemma O'Doherty\\", and that \\"I have heard political advisers say of her: \\"She just won't let it go.\\" In other words, she's not easily fobbed off\\". In late 2017, O'Doherty wrote an article, published by Village magazine, concerning allegations of long-term child sexual abuse in Terenure College, Dublin, and followed it up in early 2018 with allegations that the Garda√≠ did not act on information they had about issues regarding the college's rugby coach, John McClean. A year later, McClean was formally charged with indecently assaulting nine students in Terenure College over a 17-year period. In August 2019, Village published an editorial on O'Doherty and her relationship with the magazine. It described her as \\"the It girl for Irish extremism: racism, anti-Islamism, homophobia and transphobia.\\" It defended her previous freelance work for the magazine and the publication of articles by her, saying \\"O'Doherty's politics were not offensive until some time after Village published its last piece by her\\" and concluded by stating \\"Meanwhile Village will continue to publish investigative journalism on the basis of the journalism rather than the author, unless the author shows evidence of failing to recognise democratic norms. Once O‚ÄôDoherty revealed herself as racist she was no longer welcome in these pages.\\" Politics =2018 Presidential election= O'Doherty announced on 19 August 2018 she was seeking a nomination to stand for the Irish presidency in the 2018 election on an anti-corruption platform. However, her campaign fell into controversy when during a nomination hearing she stated that there was state collusion in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin, and threatened councillors, including the brother of Veronica Guerin, with libel after her claims were strongly disputed. O'Doherty's claims drew labels of a conspiracy theorist from the Irish media, including Veronica's brother, councillor Jimmy Guerin. On 24 September, Laois County Council became the only council to nominate her as a presidential candidate. Having failed to reach the required four county council nominations by 26 September, she could not stand for election. O'Doherty attributed her failure to secure the political nominations to being \\"blocked by the political elite from contesting\\", which was linked to her campaign against political corruption. =Anti-Corruption Ireland (2019‚Äì)= In February 2019, O'Doherty founded \\"Anti-Corruption Ireland\\", described as a \\"political movement\\", which promotes \\"'truth, justice and integrity in public office', where public servants who abuse citizens' rights and their taxes will lose their jobs, pensions and their liberty\\", and which is based on \\"20 core pillars\\". However, O'Doherty's strong across a range of subjects (e.g. Muslim immigration, HPV vaccine, LGBT rights, and George Soros), including \\"false flag\\" claims regarding the March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, became an issue for the ACI. In March and April 2019, the Imperial and Maritime hotels in Cork, a pub in Sligo and a parish hall in Schull cancelled public meetings that had been booked by ACI. In April 2019, the Ballyvolane House hotel in Cork cancelled another ACI booking, citing O'Doherty's views as the reason. , the ACI is not a registered political party in Ireland. =2019 European elections= On 10 April 2019, O'Doherty announced that she intended standing in May's European Parliament election, in the Dublin constituency. O'Doherty registered as an independent candidate, and not an ACI candidate, as ACI is not a registered political party, with newspapers reporting her saying that she was going to offer Anti-Corruption Ireland to the Irish people, and saying that \\"if they don‚Äôt want it I can say that I tried but they didn‚Äôt want it, they wanted to continue to pursue the death of their country\\", and adding that she \\"can‚Äôt do it on my own\\". However, O'Doherty continued to use ACI branding on some of her European election campaign posters and literature. In May 2019, adverts for O'Doherty and ACI appeared on the sides of Dublin Bus, the public service transport operator, carrying the slogan \\"It is time to take Ireland back\\". The adverts were criticised by LGBT activists and the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU), with the union's General Secretary, Dermot O‚ÄôLeary, writing to Ray Coyne the CEO of Dublin Bus, to say that \\"there is a direct contradiction between the views/principles of the candidate and the indisputable fact that Dublin Bus is a multicultural employer.\\" Dublin Bus's parent company, , subsequently announced it and its subsidiary companies would no longer allow political advertising. O'Doherty's campaign featured live- streamed videos. In one such video, O'Doherty condemned a multi-faith room in Dublin Airport due to a lack of crosses and an altar, and complained that she had been banned from filming in the room, stating that \\"Irish people own the airport\\". The Dublin Airport Authority responded, pointing out that there is a dedicated Roman Catholic church on the grounds of the airport and that O'Doherty had been stopped from filming as \\"a) you had not sought or been granted the required permission to film at the airport b) we do not permit political campaigning on the airport campus c) all mobile phones and devices should be switched off in the multi-faith room.\\" O'Doherty received 1.8% of the first-preference votes, finishing 12th out of 19 candidates in the first count. She was eliminated on the 9th count. =2019 Dublin Fingal by- election= O'Doherty was a candidate in the 2019 Dublin Fingal by-election held on 29 November 2019. She received 1,026 (4.1%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the third count.https://www.rte.ie/news/by- elections-2019/results/#/dublin-fingal Following the election, Minister for Justice Charles Flanagan suggested that the Irish media had given O'Doherty a \\"free pass\\" for her views on immigration, after Fine Gael's candidate for the Wexford by-election, Verona Murphy, had been criticised for linking migration to Ireland with ISIS. =2020 general election= O'Doherty ran as an independent candidate (as ACI is not registered as a political party) in the Dublin Fingal constituency, in the 2020 general election. She secured 1.97% of the first preference vote and was eliminated on the fifth count. Opinions O'Doherty speaking at \\"Make it Happen Women's Day\\", 13 March 2015 O'Doherty has been described as having the views of a conspiracy theorist by several mainstream Irish news outlets, and by UK outlets. As a journalist, O'Doherty won awards for medical reporting. However, she has alleged links between fluoridation and cancer, and alleged that the HPV vaccine is both untested and dangerous. In September 2018, during the presidential election campaign, O'Doherty drew criticism for her claim, described as conspiratorial, that the state colluded in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin. The Irish political satire magazine, The Phoenix, called O‚ÄôDoherty's claim a \\"credibility destroying move\\", and said \\"that ludicrous assertion helped to scupper her bid for a presidential nomination\\". O'Doherty is associated with anti-immigration views, which she defends saying: \\"Because I have always stood up for the poor; I see the inequality. That‚Äôs my academic background,\\" she said. \\"That's why I'm against mass immigration, mass uncontrolled immigration as opposed to controlled immigration.\\" She said that mass uncontrolled immigration drives down wages. O'Doherty has described wind turbines as \\"sinister\\", saying \\"there's a criminal conspiracy to make us think our planet can't cope.\\" =Social media and Twitter ban (2020)= In March 2014, O'Doherty set up a Twitter account. In 2017, the annual \\"#murraytweetindex\\", which ranks the influence of Twitter accounts of Irish journalists, ranked O'Doherty's Twitter account as the 7th most influential overall account, 3rd most influential news category account, and the most retweeted account. By 2018, O'Doherty had fallen out of the top 20 most influential accounts; the \\"#murraytweetindex\\" website ranked her as the 26th-most influential overall account, but she retained her position as the third-most influential news category account. Some of her tweets and YouTube broadcasts have caused controversy, and link to recognised conspiracy theories: * In December 2018, O'Doherty tweeted \\"Wondering what‚Äôs behind the globalists‚Äô plan to fill Europe with migrants? It's nothing to do with compassion for their plight\\", and accompanied the tweet with an image of the Star of David and linked to an article on an \\"alt-right European white nationalist website called Red Ice\\". O'Doherty deleted the tweet after coverage in The Algemeiner. * In December 2018, O'Doherty tweeted \\"Wondering what all the faux concern for migrants has been about of late? Welcome to the gravy train that is #multicultural #Ireland, funded in no small part by the man who wants to destroy our continent, its values and its future. Anything funded by #GeorgeSoros should be shunned\\"; she has tweeted frequently on Soros-linked conspiracies. * In March 2019, O'Doherty tweeted that the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand to have all the hallmarks of a \\"false flag\\" operation to incite fresh [ISIS] attacks. This led to two of the four Laois councillors who endorsed her 2018 presidential nomination saying they would rescind that support now. She has been associated with previous anti-Islamic tweets. * In April 2019, O'Doherty tweeted that the fire in Notre Dame cathedral as \\"an act of war by the state on the Church\\", and that \\"200 years of Free Masonic war on the Church in France is enough to justify our suspicion\\". She has previously tweeted anti-abortion and anti-LGBT views. * In May 2019, O'Doherty's Twitter account was briefly suspended and some of her posts were removed from Facebook, after she posted pictures of primary schoolchildren without permission and in breach of copyright, in posts described as offensive. The Longford Leader quoted one parent, Aneta Safiak, who later confronted O'Doherty, as saying \\"My son in that picture was among those that she called Irish because he is a white, blonde boy. And he is Irish. He was born here. He speaks fluent English and he speaks Irish. And it was so offensive to me because she used him to point out that his [non-white] friends are, in her view, lesser than he is.\\" * In June 2019, during a lengthy discussion on chemtrails O'Doherty called the September 11 attacks \\"scripted\\". * In June 2019, it was reported that science writer and cancer researcher David Robert Grimes had initiated legal proceedings against O'Doherty for defamation, following comments made by her about him on social media. O'Doherty reportedly initiated a counter-claim against Grimes in July 2019. * In August 2019, O'Doherty undertook legal proceedings against Village, reputedly for an editorial published by the magazine earlier that month. * In September 2019, a number of media outlets reported on a tweet (published by O'Doherty and later deleted by Twitter) which led to racial abuse of a County Meath couple who had appeared in an advertisement for the German-based supermarket chain Lidl. The tweet read \\"German dump Lidl gaslighting the Irish people with their multicultural version of 'The Ryans'. Kidding no one! Resist the Great Replacement wherever you can by giving this kip a wide berth. #ShopIrish #BuyIrish.\\" \\"The Great Replacement\\", referred to in O'Doherty's tweet, is a white nationalist right-wing conspiracy theory. According to The Irish Times, O'Doherty threatened legal action against the couple for speaking to the newspaper about the Twitter thread and the impact it had on the couple and their child. Some news coverage associated the events with calls for a review of hate-crime legislation, and the abuse directed at the family was investigated under the Garda S√≠och√°na's diversity and integration strategy (which includes hate-crime). * In July 2020, O'Doherty's Twitter account was \\"permanently suspended after repeated violations of the Twitter rules\\". * In October 2020, a video was circulated by her supporters on Twitter where Ms. O'Doherty claims that The Troubles may have been a \\"staged event\\". =YouTube ban (2019)= In July 2019, O'Doherty's YouTube channel was permanently removed for violations of YouTube policy against hate speech. The Irish Times reported that O'Doherty's account had been suspended the week before after posting a video regarding ethnic minorities in Ireland; however, O'Doherty appeared to evade this ban by using an alternative account. The Times quoted a spokesman for Google saying that \\"both Ms O‚ÄôDoherty‚Äôs accounts have been removed for ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù breaches of its rules\\", and that \\"When users violate these policies repeatedly, such as our policies against hate speech and harassment, or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures, we terminate their accounts\\". Legal actions =Court action against COVID-19 legislation= In April 2020, O'Doherty and John Waters launched a legal action against the laws passed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland. They sought to have part of the legislation declared void in the High Court, describing it as \\"unconstitutional\\", \\"improperly acted\\" and \\"very flawed\\". Waters further stated, as a basis for the claim, that the laws were brought in by a caretaker government, by a D√°il with a limited number of TDs, and enacted by an outgoing Seanad. The action was to be taken against the Minister for Health, and the Attorney General. When the matter was discussed in the High Court later in April 2020, the government's counsel expressed its opposition to the action, stating that the Seanad and Ceann Comhairle would have to be added as notice parties, and requesting that the matter be listed for mention in two weeks. The applicants expressed concerns about any adjournment, and O'Doherty stated that the situation regarding the lockdown was \\"outrageous\\" and that the vast majority of people were unaffected by COVID-19 which she said was \\"no threat to life\\". During the proceedings, up to 100 supporters of O'Doherty and Waters gathered at the Four Courts but were not permitted to enter the courtroom by the judge because of social distancing rules. Garda√≠ later announced that they were investigating the gathering at the Four Courts, stating that they had asked the group to disperse over concerns about social distancing and the rules on non-essential travel. On 28 April 2020, at the next hearing on the matter, Garda√≠ and barriers prevented crowds from entering the court. About forty supporters of the applicants turned up, and no arrests were made. At the hearing, the judge fixed the applicant's appeal for hearing on 5 May 2020. At the meeting, O'Doherty said that the people of Ireland were under \\"mass house arrest\\" and Garda√≠ were \\"using guns\\" to frighten people. On 5 May 2020, there was again a Garda presence outside the Four Courts. In her submission to the court, O'Doherty said that the COVID-19 conditions were comparable to living in \\"Nazi Germany\\". She also said that the basis for introducing the restrictions was \\"scientifically fraudulent\\" and that evidence to that effect would be presented at the full hearing of their action. The State's representation opposed the application for leave, saying that the claims are not arguable. On 13 May 2020, Mr Justice Charles Meehan dismissed the applicant's case. The judge said that the applicant's claims were not arguable and the court could not grant them an application to have their challenge determined in the High Court. He said that the applicants had not provided any facts or expert evidence to support the view that the laws were unconstitutional. The judge also said that the applicants had \\"no medical or scientific qualifications or expertise, [and] relied on their own unsubstantiated views, gave speeches, engaged in empty rhetoric and sought to draw parallel to Nazi Germany which is both absurd and offensive\\". =Defamation action against O'Doherty= In September 2019, independent councillor Jimmy Guerin (brother of Veronica Guerin) took a defamation action against Gemma O'Doherty. Guerin claimed that he was defamed in comments allegedly posted by O'Doherty on Twitter and Facebook. In August 2020, the High Court was told that O'Doherty had been \\"actively trying to evade\\" service of notice of these defamation proceedings. Attempts had been made to serve documents on O'Doherty, but they had not been successful. Guerin's solicitors secured orders against O'Doherty, including one that she had been formally served with the summons outlining the action against her after an ex parte hearing. O'Doherty denied that she had tried to evade service of defamation proceedings, and claimed that the defamation action was vexatious and an \\"outrageous attempt\\" to prevent her from revealing corruption. She sought orders preventing the publishing of her purported home address by the media and to have Jimmy Guerin's action against her struck out. In October 2020, Judge Richard Humphreys ordered that there was to be no publication of O'Doherty's full address and in particular the street name or house-number, house name or her email address. The Judge however stated \\"I want to record clearly that [O'Doherty] has failed to substantiate any of her allegations of wrongdoing made against [Guerins] legal team\\" and awarded costs to Guerin saying that this was to \\"to factor in my disapproval of the unsubstantiated complaints made by the [O'Doherty] against the [Guerin's] legal team\\".https://www.courts.ie/view/judgments/8e7eb9d9-8b18-4e1a-8cf0-5194ceeffaff/d90c0d65-a6c3-40a3-b97b-369d41928a4f/2020_IEHC_490.pdf/pdf Awards * 2000 ESB National Media Awards for \\"Print Campaigning and Social Issues\\". * 2011 GlaxoSmithKline Irish Medical Media Awards for \\"Consumer Print Media\\". * 2011 International Journalism Festival Award for \\"Best Travel Writing\\". * 2018 F√©ile na Laoch (County Cork) as a \\"hero of Irish storytelling\\".

Plot Independent and aggressive, Bok-soon is known around the neighborhood as a \\"psycho bitch\\" because of her weird behavior. She is \\"slow\\" and not very smart due to a developmental disability, but is nonetheless a brave young woman with a happy inner world. Bok-soon manages to make a living by running a street stall at the local market with her younger sister Eun-jeong, whom she loves more than life itself. The name-calling doesn't affect her at all, and she only cares about working hard and saving up money for Eun-jeong's education. Their relatively peaceful life is disrupted when Tae-soo, who lives alone in a deserted forest, kills Bok-soon's beloved sister because Eun-jeong may have stumbled upon the truth of his murderous lifestyle. Bok-soon is completely consumed by her grief, madness and uncontrollable rage. Despite her limited mental ability, she begins planning her revenge, and joins up with Na-ri, a little girl who is being chased by Tae-soo, after he killed her elder sister Yeon-Hee. Tae-soo is a merciless, unpredictable serial killer who commits brutal murders for no reason, then methodically covers up his tracks. He cares deeply for his adoptive family, stepmother Kyeong-ja and older brother Ik- sang, who took him in as a young boy. But it was his family's opportunistic attitude to exploit Tae-soo despite their disgust and fear towards him that only aggravated the loneliness and monstrosity within him. Eventually, Kyeong- ja and Ik-sang secretly bring in some gangsters to her restaurant in an attempt to kill Tae-soo, whom they invited for a meal. With his animalistic senses, Tae-soo escapes death, but ends up getting terribly injured, yet manages to kill them all, his stepmother and her son and apparently Na-ri (whom Tae-soo took along). Bok-soon finds Tae-soo just then, and a deadly battle unfolds between this frail but strong young woman and the bemused, ruthless killer that ruined her life.. After finally stabbing him to death, she finds out that the little girl is alive. Then Yeon-Hee's ex-boss appears, who previously asked Ik-sang to buy Yeon-Hee's phone from its owner, so she can't blackmail him with recorded video showing his abusive behavior towards her. But Tae-soo, asked by his step-brother to make the purchase, kept the money, phone and killed Yeon-Hee instead. Asked by Yeon-Hee's ex-boss to give him the phone, Bok-soon does this and leave the gory restaurant with Na-ri.

The bridge was designed by architect Henry Eyton and constructed in 1869 by Messrs W & T Phillips of London for Sir Shafto Adair, Bt of the Flixton Estate.

He was Minister of Public Works, Agriculture and Commerce (1835‚Äì39) and Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs (1840‚Äì47). Early years Nicolas Ferdinand Louis Joseph Martin was born in Douai, Nord, on 29 July 1790. His parents were Louis Fran√ßois Joseph Martin and Anne Louise Jos√®phe Jacquard. His family was bourgeois and respectable, but not wealthy. He studied at the college of Tournay. He went on to study law in Paris between 1808 and 1811, receiving his doctorate in law at the age of 21. Martin began to practice at the bar of Douai, and soon gained a reputation. He was named in turn municipal councillor, assistant judge, and administrator and vice- president of the Douai hospices. He married Camille Emilie Gautier-Dagoty (1796‚Äì1814). They had one son, Victor, born in 1814. His second wife was Charlotte Lefebvre (1806‚Äì1879). They had two sons and two daughters. He was a supporter of constitutional monarchy, and welcomed the Bourbon Restoration (1814‚Äì1830). However, the regime did not live up to its promises, and Martin joined the loyal opposition. He was strongly opposed to the ordinances of 25 July 1830. July Monarchy After the July Revolution, he ran for deputy for the Nord Department and was elected on 28 October 1830. He sat with the conservative majority. In the legislative debates he took the name Martin du Nord. In the general elections of July 1831 Martin become deputy for the college of Douai extra muros. He continued to be reelected with large majorities for this constituency until his death. On 5 April 1934 he was appointed Attorney-General at the Court of Appeal of Paris. Ten days later Louis-Philippe appointed him Attorney General at the Court of Peers. On 20 September 1836 Martin was appointed Minister of Public Works, Agriculture and Commerce, but due to illness he was not able to take office until 16 October. As minister, he introduced legislation for construction of royal roads, seaports and canals, for establishing railways and for improving navigable rivers. He prepared a draft law for the exclusive application of the metric system, prohibited wool exports, lowered duties on foreign coal and increased incentives for agriculture. On 1 April 1839, he resigned his portfolio and retired with his cabinet colleagues. He was made vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies. On 29 October 1840 he was made Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs, holding office until 15 January 1847. He was removed for \\"health reasons\\", apparently to cover up some scandal. Nicolas Martin du Nord died suddenly on 12 March 1847 at the Ch√¢teau de Lormoy, Longpont-sur-Orge, Essonne.

Background A biography of Sir John, written by Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, that was published in the Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 47 contains much well-referenced information.John de Pulteney However, it is inaccurate in stating the Sir John's wife was a daughter of John de St John of Lageham, for reasons that are set out in detail in two articles by Walter Lee Sheppard Jr. His will identifies Sir John's parents as Adam and Matilda. Marriage and family Sir John married Margaret, daughter of John de Bereford, citizen of London and his wife Roesia. The marriage evidently took place by 13 December 1330, when they arranged for perpetual masses for themselves and ‚Äúfor the souls of John de Bureford late citizen of London and Roesia his wife‚Äù to take place at St Nicholas Shambles, London.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 2 (1330-4), page 22. His association with the de Bereford family went back significantly before 1330, as in July 1318 he was recorded as executor of the will of Roesia de Bureford, late the executrix of John de Bureford, citizen of London.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward II, (1313-1318), page 623.

Shortly after Sir John's death, his widow married Sir Nicholas de LoveyneCalendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 9, No. 183. He was buried in Old St Paul's Cathedral, but the grave and monument were destroyed along with the cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A modern monument in the crypt lists his among the important graves lost. Career Sir John was a citizen of London and a member of the Drapers‚Äô Company. His business activities included the lending of money. For instance, in July 1325, Robert Burdet of Sheepy, Leicestershire acknowledged that he owed ¬£100 to John de Pulteney. In the following month, the Prior of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England acknowledged that he owed John the sum of ¬£800.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward II, (1323-1327), page 488. John also lent money to the King, such as an unstated sum that in June 1329 was outstanding but secured on the customs revenue of Southampton.Calendar of Close Rolls. Edward III, (1327-1330), page 472. He served as Mayor of London in 1331, 1332, 1334 and 1336 and also held the office of Escheator of the City of London. Other roles that he undertook included membership of commissions of oyer and terminer in a number of counties, guardian of the peace for Middlesex and roles in negotiations with Flanders.John de Pulteney Building Projects Sir John invested some of his considerable wealth in notable building projects, including those listed below. He appears to have been particularly active on these matters around 1341; on 6 October of that year, he was granted a licence to crenelate the dwelling places of his manors at Cheveley, Cambridgeshire and Penshurst Kent, as well as his dwelling place in London.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 5 (1340-1343, page 331. * ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôPenshurst Place‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô was built about 1341.

Will His will was made on 14 November 1348 and proved at the Court of Hustings, London. It contained bequests to support chantries in St Paul's Cathedral and prayers for his soul and for the souls of family members and others. These were to be funded from all his tenements and rents in the City and suburbs of London, apart from his principal house where he lived in the parish of St Laurence, Candlewick Street and his tenement called ‚Äúle Coldherberuy‚Äù and his other tenements in the parish of All-Hallows-the-Great. He left his principal mansion to his wife for life or (as actually transpired) until her remarriage, after which it would go to Sir William de Clinton, Earl of Huntingdon during the minority of Sir John's son, after which it would go to the son. The tenement called ‚Äúle Coldherberuy‚Äù was to be sold. Ralph de Stratford, Bishop of London and Sir William de Clinton were named as supervisors of the will. Examples of Sir John's affluence are found in specific bequests to the respective supervisors, which were his ‚Äúfinest ring with a great stone called rubie of great value and beauty‚Äù and ‚Äúa beautiful ring with two great stones called diamauntes, two silver flagons enamelled, a cup, together with a certain spoon and salt-cellar to match‚Äù.

Biography  Son of the Sicilians Antonino Alicata and Luigina Fazio-Allmayer, he was born at Reggio Calabria, where his father was head of the civil engineers. From 1925 he studied at Palermo and then from 1933 in the Liceo classico Torquato Tasso in Rome, where his family had relocated after his father was appointed Inspector of the Ministry of Public Works. With Bruno Zevi, Paolo Alatri, Carlo Cassola and other schoolmates, he founded the Circolo giovanile di cultura moderna (Youth Group for Modern Culture).Fondazione Bruno Zevi In 1936 he enrolled in the Faculty of literature at the Sapienza University of Rome, becoming part of the Gruppo universitario fascista and participating in the student competitions (Littoriali della cultura e dell'arte) organised by fascist students' organisation at Naples in 1937 and at Palermo in 1938, where he came eighth. During these years, Alicata came into contact with many young antifascist students, such as Pietro Ingrao, Carlo Salinari, Mario Socrate, Carlo Muscetta, Aldo Natoli, Lucio Lombardo Radice, Paolo Alatri and Paolo Bufalini. He also collaborated with the Roman newspaper Il Piccolo, Giuseppe Bottai's journal Primato, the literary weeklies Il Meridiano di Roma and La Ruota. He secretly enrolled in the Italian Communist Party in 1940, the year in which he graduated with his these Vincenzo Gravina e l'estetica del primo Settecento (Vincenzo Gravina and the Aesthetic of the early Eighteenth century). He then became the assistant of Natalino Sapegno, who had been his supervisor. In 1941 he became an editor in the Roman office of the publishing house Einaudi with Giaime Pintor and Carlo Muscetta. There he dramatised several stories of Giovanni Verga for the cinema and worked for Luchino Visconti on the film Ossessione (based on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice), which was destroyed in 1943 by the Fascist authorities amid controversy. He married Giuliana Spaini in December 1941. He was arrested the next year and was freed with the fall of Fascism. He participated in the resistance against the German occupiers in Roma, running Il Lavoro italiano the united journal of the labour unions with the Christian democrat Alberto Canaletti Gaudenti and the socialist Olindo Vernocchi. He was secretly among the editors of l'Unit√†, directed by Celeste Negarville. Immediately after the liberation of Rome, he became part of the government of the Comune of Rome. From 1945 to 1948 he directed the Neapolitan newspaper La Voce, in 1946 he was elected as a local councillor for Naples, in 1949 he directed the communist weekly La Voce del Mezzogiorno with Giorgio Amendola. In the election of 18 April 1948 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the district of Napoli-Caserta. Thereafter he was named Regional Secretary of the Communist party in Calabria and became a member of the central committee of the Italian Communist Party. In 1950 he became part of the secretariat of the national committee for the revival of Southern Italy, which set up an investigation of the conditions of the southern people, published in La Voce del Mezzogiorno. He was spokesman for the minority in the Parliamentary commission which discussed the results of the investigation. Re-elected as a Deputy in 1953 and 1958, for the district of Catanzaro-Cosenza-Reggio Calabria, he was also Mayor of Melissa, Calabria from 1953. Against Elio Vittorini he claimed he was convinced the arts ought to help \\"men in the fight for justice and liberty,\\"In ¬´Rinascita¬ª, III, 1946, p. 116. in a polemic continued by Palmiro Togliatti on the theme of the relationship between politics and culture.

He signed the editorial of the first issue of the theoretical journal Critica marxista in February 1963, the same year in which he was reelected as Deputy from the district of Siena. From 1964 he was a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party. In August 1966, he denounced the damage done to Agrigento by real estate speculation and in his final speech in the chamber he accused the managerial class of being incapable of protecting Italy's artistic patrimony.

Mario vs. Donkey Kong, released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance, was followed by March of the Minis for the Nintendo DS, Minis March Again on DSiWare, Mini- Land Mayhem in 2010 for the DS, Minis on the Move for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, Tipping Stars for the Wii U and 3DS in 2015. The latest title, a spin- off centering on Amiibo called Mini Mario & Friends: Amiibo Challenge, was released in 2016.  Development  The history of the series can be traced back to the Game Boy version of the original Donkey Kong. Adding new abilities for Mario and 96 new levels, the game brought new emphasis to the puzzle element of the game's concept. At E3 2002, a title called Donkey Kong Plus was on display . During the show, Plus had a feature that allowed players to design and save their own levels on the GameCube, then copy them to the Game Boy Advance using a link cable. It was essentially an updated version of Donkey Kong '94, but the game had disappeared by the following year. It was replaced with the pre-rendered graphics and gameplay additions of Mario vs. Donkey Kong. The Create-a-Level feature was removed from this version (but appears in its sequel). A level editor still exists within the game's programming, and can be enabled through a modification.  Main games  = Mario vs. Donkey Kong = is a 2004 puzzle-platform game developed by Nintendo Software Technology and released for the Game Boy Advance. The game is the spiritual successor to Donkey Kong, which was released in 1994 for the Game Boy. The game concept revolves around a combination of platform and puzzle elements, challenging Mario to find keys, reach a locked door, and rescue mini-Marios. Mario vs. Donkey Kong was a return to the earlier arcade-style games that incorporated many elements from the Game Boy version. While its style was that of other games, the Rare design for Donkey Kong carried over. Donkey Kong, originally a villain, returns to this role in the game: wanting a Mini Mario clockwork toy, he finds that they are sold out at a local toy store. Enraged, he terrifies the Toads at the factory and steals the toys. This sets up the game's plot, where Mario chases Donkey Kong until he can take the Mini Marios back from Donkey Kong. The game has hidden e-Reader support. Nintendo held a competition in Japan in which cards were distributed to 1,000 participants. Five level cards were released by CoroCoro Comic, and another card was given away at the 20th World Hobby Fair.

In a departure from accepted local viticultural practices, the founders, working under the inspiration of the French explorer Nicolas Baudin, planted the Estate's vineyard on slopes facing south instead of north. Baudin's major scientific expedition to Australia of 1800 to 1803, aboard the corvettes G√©ographe and Naturaliste, had been conducted on the assumption, contrary to established tradition, that the best passage for sailing ships between Cape Leeuwin and Bass Strait was from west to east.

Background In a matchup of two undefeated future hall-of-famers, undisputed heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and the number one-ranked heavyweight George Foreman reached an agreement in November 1972 for a January title fight at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. Frazier was 29‚Äì0 and had won 10 consecutive heavyweight title fights at the time of his match with Foreman, first winning the NYSAC heavyweight title in 1968 and defending that title four times before knocking out Jimmy Ellis to claim the vacant WBA and WBC titles in 1970 that had been stripped from Muhammad Ali. Frazier's most notable defense would come against Ali himself in what was billed as the \\"Fight of the Century\\". After defeating Ali by unanimous decision, Frazier captured The Ring heavyweight title and became recognized as the lineal champion. Between his first Ali fight and his bout with Foreman, Frazier successfully defended his title twice against fringe contenders Terry Daniels and Ron Stander. Following his knockout of Stander, Ali attempted to gain a rematch with Frazier, but Frazier ultimately agreed to face Foreman. The undefeated Foreman had accumulated 37 victories in just four years and was ranked number one by both the WBA and WBC at the time of landing his first title match against Frazier. The fight The fight lasted only two rounds, with Foreman scoring a technical knockout at 1:35 of the second round to dethrone Frazier and become the new undisputed heavyweight champion. Foreman brutalized Frazier for the duration of the fight, scoring six knockdowns over the champion. In ABC's television re-broadcast, Howard Cosell made the legendary exclamation: \\"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\\" Less than two minutes into the fight, Foreman stunned Frazier with a series of punches and then sent him down to the canvas with a right uppercut. Frazier was able to get back up but Foreman would continue his dominance and with seventeen seconds left in the round, Foreman caught Frazier with an uppercut that brought him to his knees. Shortly after Frazier rose from that knockdown, a combination from Foreman put the champion on his back and he barely made it out of the round. Frazier went out for the second round but Foreman knocked him down again shortly after the round began with an overhand right. Foreman scored another quick knockdown, and then dropped Frazier a sixth time with a powerful right. By this time Angelo Dundee, who was at ringside scouting the bout, was pleading for the bout to be stopped. Referee Arthur Mercante, Sr. finally called a halt to the bout after the sixth knockdown, and Foreman was declared the winner at 1:35 of the second round, to become, at the time, the third-youngest heavyweight champion in history (after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali). Aftermath Foreman would successfully defend his titles twice in dominating fashion. First he knocked out Jos√© Roman in the first round on September 1, 1973. He would follow this by knocking out another future hall-of-famer in the second round in Ken Norton. Foreman would lose the titles in his third defense, against Muhammad Ali in one of the most famous fights in boxing history dubbed \\"The Rumble in the Jungle.\\" Frazier would fight seven more times after his first fight with Foreman. He would gain one more chance to recapture the WBA and WBC titles by challenging his rival Ali for a third fight dubbed the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\", but lost when his trainer, Eddie Futch refused to let him come out for the 15th round. Frazier begged Futch to let him continue, and had he gone out for the 15th round, would have been declared the winner as according to Ferdie Pacheco, Ali was begging Angelo Dundee to cut off his gloves, as he didn't want to go out for the 15th round. Frazier's defeat would ultimately lead to a rematch with Foreman in June 1976. In their second fight, Frazier was able to remain more competitive, but Foreman was able to score two further knockdowns and again won by technical knockout, this time in the fifth round. A year later, Foreman lost to Jimmy Young in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a fight to determine the No. 1 contender, and it was after this fight that Foreman had his near-death experience and conversion. He subsequently retired and became a preacher but made a comeback after a decade away from the ring, eventually defeating Michael Moorer to become the oldest heavyweight champion of all time in 1994, at almost 46 years old.

Though its perihelion is farther, has an aphelion only about half of Sedna's. It is the second discovered sednoid, with semi-major axis beyond and perihelion greater than . The similarity of the orbit of to other known extreme trans-Neptunian objects led Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo to suggest that an undiscovered object, Planet Nine, in the outer Solar System is shepherding these distant objects into similar type orbits. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.0, which makes it likely to be a dwarf planet, and it is accepted as a dwarf planet by some. It is expected to be about half the size of Sedna and similar in size to Huya. Its surface is thought to have a pink tinge, resulting from chemical changes produced by the effect of radiation on frozen water, methane, and carbon dioxide. This optical color is consistent with formation in the gas-giant region and not the classical Kuiper belt, which is dominated by ultra-red colored objects.

The characteristics of its orbit, like those of Sedna's, have been explained as possibly created by a passing star or a trans-Neptunian planet of several Earth masses hundreds of astronomical units from the Sun. The orbital architecture of the trans-Plutonian region may signal the presence of more than one planet. could even be captured from another planetary system. However, it is considered more likely that the perihelion of was raised by multiple interactions within the crowded confines of the open star cluster in which the Sun formed.

The graph induced by a well-separated pair decomposition can serve as a k-spanner of the complete Euclidean graph, and is useful in approximating solutions to several problems pertaining to this.  Definition  Visual representation of well- separated pair Let A, B be two disjoint sets of points in \\\\mathbb{R}^d, R(X) denote the axis-aligned minimum bounding box for the points in X, and s > 0 denote the separation factor. We consider A and B to be well-separated, if for each of R(A) and R(B) there exists a d-ball of radius \\\\rho containing it, such that the two spheres have a minimum distance of at least s \\\\rho. We consider a sequence of well-separated pairs of subsets of S, (A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), \\\\ldots, (A_m,B_m) to be a well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD) of S if for any two distinct points p, q \\\\in S, there exists precisely one i, 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m, such that either * p \\\\in A_i and q \\\\in B_i, or * q \\\\in A_i and p \\\\in B_i.  Construction  = Split tree = By way of constructing a fair split tree, it is possible to construct a WSPD of size O(s^d n) in O(n \\\\lg n) time. The general principle of the split tree of a point set is that each node of the tree represents a set of points and that the bounding box of is split along its longest side in two equal parts which form the two children of and their point set. It is done recursively until there is only one point in the set. Let denote the size of the longest interval of the bounding hyperrectangle of point set and let denote the size of the i-th dimension of the bounding hyperrectangle of point set . We give pseudocode for the Split tree computation below. Let be the node for if // is a hyperrectangle which each side has a length of zero. Store in the only point in S. else Compute Let the i-th dimension be the one where Split along the i-th dimension in two same-size hyperrectangles and take the points contained in these hyperrectangles to form the two sets and . Store and as, respectively, the left and right children of . return This algorithm runs in O(n^2) time. We give a more efficient algorithm that runs in O(n \\\\lg n) time below. The goal is to loop over the list in only O(n) operations per step of the recursion but only call the recursion on at most half the points each time. Let be the j-th coordinate of the i-th point in such that is sorted for each dimension and be the point. Also, let be the hyperplane that splits the longest side of in two. Here is the algorithm in pseudo-code: if // is a hyperrectangle which each side has a length of zero. Store in the only point in . else repeat Compute Let the i-th dimension be the one where while and } } Let and be respectively, the left and right children of . if else if until To be able to maintain the sorted lists for each node, linked lists are used. Cross-pointers are kept for each list to the others to be able to retrieve a point in constant time. In the algorithm above, in each iteration of the loop, a call to the recursion is done. In reality, to be able to reconstruct the list without the overhead of resorting the points, it is necessary to rebuild the sorted lists once all points have been assigned to their nodes. To do the rebuilding, walk along each list for each dimension, add each point to the corresponding list of its nodes, and add cross-pointers in the original list to be able to add the cross-pointers for the new lists. Finally, call the recursion on each node and his set. = WSPD computation = Visual representation of a well-separated pair computed with the bounding boxes The WSPD can be extracted from such a split tree by calling the recursive function on the children of every node in the split tree. Let / denote the children of the node . We give pseudocode for the function below. for each node that is not a leaf in the split tree do We give pseudocode for the function below. if and are well-separated with respect to report else if( ) Recursively call and else Recursively call and Combining the -well-separated pairs from all the calls of gives the WSPD for separation . It is clear that the pairs returned by the algorithm are well-separated because of the return condition of the function . Now, we have to prove that for any distinct points p and q in S, there is a unique pair \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} so that (i) p \\\\in A and q \\\\in B or (ii) p \\\\in B and q \\\\in A. Assume without loss of generality that (i) holds. Let u be the lowest common ancestor of p and q in the split tree and let v and w be the children of u. Because of the last assumption, p is in the subtree of v and q in the subtree of w. A call to is necessarily done in . Because, each time there is a recursion, the recursion tree creates two branches that contain all the points of the current recursion call, there will be a sequence of call to leading to having p in A and q in B. Because u is the lowest common ancestor of p and q, calling on the children of a higher node would result of p and q not being in a pair and calling on the children in one of the nodes of one of the subtrees of u would result by p or q not being in any pair. Thus, the pair \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} is the unique one separating p and q. Each time the recursion tree split in two, there is one more pair added to the decomposition. So, the algorithm run-time is in the number of pairs in the final decomposition. Callahan and Kosaraju proved that this algorithm finds a Well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD) of size O(s^d n).  Properties  Lemma 1: Let \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} be a well-separated pair with respect to s. Let p, p' \\\\in A and q \\\\in B. Then, pp' \\\\leq (2/s)pq. Proof: Because p and p' are in the same set, we have that pp' \\\\leq 2\\\\rho where \\\\rho is the radius of the enclosing circle of A and B. Because p and q are in two well-separated sets, we have that pq \\\\geq s\\\\rho. We obtain that: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac{pp'}{2} \\\\leq \\\\rho \\\\leq \\\\frac{pq}{s} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\frac{pp'}{2} \\\\leq \\\\frac{pq}{s} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Leftrightarrow & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & pp' \\\\leq \\\\frac{2}{s}pq \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Lemma 2: Let \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} be a well-separated pair with respect to s. Let p, p' \\\\in A and q, q' \\\\in B. Then, p'q' \\\\leq (1+ 4/s)pq. Proof: By the triangle inequality, we have: p'q' \\\\leq p'p + pq + qq' From Lemma 1, we obtain: \\\\begin{align} p'q' & \\\\leq (2/s)pq + pq + (2/s)pq \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = (1+4/s)pq \\\\end{align}  Applications  The well-separated pair decomposition has application in solving a number of problems. WSPD can be used to: * Solve the closest pair problem in O(n \\\\lg n) time. * Solve the k-closest pairs problem in O(n \\\\lg n + k) time. * Solve the k-closest pair problem in O(n \\\\lg n) time. * Solve the all-nearest neighbors problem in O(n \\\\lg n) time. * Provide a (1-\\\\epsilon)-approximation of the diameter of a point set in O(n \\\\lg n) time. * Directly induce a t-spanner of a point set. * Provide a t-approximation of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree in d dimensions in O(n \\\\lg n) time. * Provide a (1+\\\\epsilon)-approximation of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree in d dimensions in O(n \\\\lg n + (\\\\epsilon^{-2} \\\\lg ^2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon})n) time.

The Center offers art exhibits, classes, lectures, a summer art camp and social events. The building includes a gallery for exhibits, four art studios, two classrooms, and a kitchen for catered events. The Barn Originally called the Resthaven Barn and built in 1924, this creamery preceded the Village of Mariemont and was located in an area called Resthaven Gardens. The Barn was part of a 26-acre farm group and included a health facility. Mariemont founder Mary Emery's benevolent plan was to provide for the retirees of the Emery Industries. In addition to horse stables and cattle pens, there was a hen house, the Presidents‚Äô Nursery containing trees and shrubs from Mount Vernon, and community gardens. Only the Barn and the gardener's cottage remain from the original farm group. In 1940, the Thomas J Emery Memorial voted to discontinue operations and it was transferred to the Village of Mariemont for use as the Maintenance Department. The Village continued to use the building, primarily for equipment storage, although it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Mariemont moved the Maintenance Department in 2005 leaving the Resthaven Barn vacant with an uncertain future. After conducting a village wide survey, a majority of the residents stated that they would not want the barn demolished. However, costs in renovations limited its practicality for a potential purchaser. By October 2006, the Village published a Legal Notice offering the Barn for sale by sealed bidding process. A bid of $50,000 was received from the Woman's Art Club of Cincinnati and it was accepted on April 16, 2007. The 10,000 square foot Barn offered excellent potential for an arts center with space for classes and a permanent art gallery, while at the same time preserving the historical integrity of the building. The Woman's Art Club was founded in 1892 but had never had a permanent home. The Club was determined to restore the building while maintaining all of the original elements and detail. The obtained an architect, John Grier, that served on an area landmark commission and demonstrated experience in historic preservation. With a generous gift from Carl Linder, Jr. Grants and other private donations, Phase 1 was completed and a spacious classroom, small studio and a state-of-the-art gallery had been renovated. The name of the facility changed to Woman's Art Club Cultural Center. An appropriation was made thorough the Ohio Capital Spending Bill and the Ohio Cultural Facilities Commission for the completion of Phase 2. This act made restoring the first floor of the Barn possible.

Kelly Jr. (May 11, 1926 ‚Äì August 9, 2013) was an American politician who served as a Democrat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1959 to 1965 and the Massachusetts Senate from 1965 to 1979. In 1983, he was convicted of extortion. Early life Kelly was born on May 11, 1926 in Worcester, Massachusetts to James and Florence Kelly. During World War II he served in the United States Navy. He attended Becker Junior College and in 1950 earned a Bachelor of Applied Arts from Clark University. While at Clark, Kelly met and married Elisabeth Kelly. He became a Certified Public Accountant and established a practice in Leicester, Massachusetts. Political career Prior to becoming a state legislator, Kelly served one term on the Leicester School Committee and was clerk and treasurer of the Oxford ‚Äì Rochdale Sewer District. In 1958, Kelly was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives by defeating Republican incumbent John E. Riley 6456 votes to 6045. Six years later he ran for the 4th Worcester District Senate seat that was being vacated by Joseph Gibney. He won a five-way Democratic primary with 37% of the vote and won the general election with 66%. From 1965 to 1971, Kelly chaired the Joint Committee on State Administration. In 1966, he also chaired the Special Committee Special Senate Committee to investigate the activities of the commissioner of administration, John J. McCarthy. In this role, Kelly had an opportunity to bring down the administration of popular Republican Governor John A. Volpe. However, Kelly, according to a Volpe aide, assisted the governor's team by keeping them abreast of what was going on behind the scenes and assisting them in planning their strategy. Many, including fellow committee member Beryl Cohen, believed that Kelly leaked a damaging report to the Volpe administration, which gave it time to counterattack. After the investigation, Kelly enjoyed a close relationship with Volpe's Commissioner of Administration and Finance Anthony DeFalco and was able to get patronage from the Volpe's administration. In 1971, Kelly backed Kevin B. Harrington for the Senate Presidency over Ways and Means Committee Chairman James F. Burke. Harrington defeated Burke and chose Kelly to replace Burke as Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful positions in the legislature. During his tenure in the legislature, Kelly was described as businesslike, accessible, and accommodating and was the only legislative leader to openly describe himself as a liberal. He increased funding for existing social welfare programs and budgeted money for new ones, eliminated funding for the Massachusetts State Police's Subversive Activities Control Unit, supported of constructing a new stadium, opposed using state funds to pay for desegregation in Boston Public Schools, and played a major role in establishing the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Kelly was honored by Massachusetts Fair Share, Public Interest Research Group, and Americans for Democratic Action for his work for the poor, elderly, and disabled. In recognition of his power as Chairman of Ways and Means and his effectiveness as a member of the Senate leadership, Kelly was widely known as the \\"Wizard of Oxford\\". MBM Scandal In 1976, federal prosecutors sought to have Kelly named as an unindicted co-conspirator for his role in the MBM scandal. According to Anthony Mansueto, one of MBM's senior vice presidents, Kelly told him that he had talked with Senator Joseph DiCarlo, chairman of a special legislative committee investigating one of the company's contracts, and \\"For $100,000, MBM's problems could be solved\\". However, Judge Walter Jay Skinner ruled that the prosecution had failed to link Kelly to the conspiracy and ordered that all references to him be removed from the indictment (Kelly's name was replaced with \\"John Doe\\" in the indictment). During the MBM investigation, it was also alleged that Kelly had endorsed a $2,000 check from MBM to Boston Mayor Kevin White and that Kelly himself had received a $1,000 from MBM. Campaign contributions from corporations were illegal in Massachusetts. Kelly denied the allegations and the state declined to prosecute. On December 15, 1977, Kelly announced that he would not run for reelection in 1978. He said that although the MBM scandal had no effect on him in his district, it likely meant that he could never advance in the Senate leadership. It was also possible that William Bulger, who was likely to become the next Senate President, would not allow Kelly to remain as Ways and Means Chairman. After his departure from the Senate, Kelly moved to Miami Beach, Florida. Extortion case In 1980, Worcester architect Frank Masiello testified before the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings that his company paid Kelly's accounting firm a $500 monthly retainer after Kelly threatened to have his firm's contracts with the state cancelled. The payments allegedly began in January 1971 when Kelly became chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and ended in September 1976. He also stated that his company paid for Kelly's travel, entertainment, and YMCA memberships. Kelly's firm received a total of $9,500, but never performed any work for Masiello and Associates. James L. Bauchat of Masiello and Associates' parent company Kassuba Development Corp., testified that Kelly demanded $10,000 in exchange for state design contracts. Kelly appeared before the Commission on June 27, 1980, pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer any questions. On September 23, 1980, Kelly was indicted on charges of extorting $34,500 from Masiello and Associates. The indictment was based on the Hobbs Act, which makes it illegal for a public official to solicit money from people trying to influence his official conduct. On September 30 he pleaded not guilty and was released by United States magistrate judge Peter W. Princi on $10,000 bond. His trial began on March 18, 1981 and ended on April 29. After eleven hours of deliberation, the jury remained deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction. Judge Joseph L. Tauro declared a mistrial. Before the retrial, the prosecution attempted to have Tauro removed from the case, citing his pro-defense rulings during the trial and having received assistance from Kelly when Kelly was chair of a committee investigating the Volpe administration and Tauro was Volpe's chief legal counsel. The United States Court of Appeals ruled that there was no legal basis to bar Tauro from presiding over the retrial. Also prior to the retrial, two of the prosecution's witnesses had committed perjury. Kelly's retrial began on November 15, 1982, and ended on December 22. The next day, the jury found Kelly guilty of extortion. On January 20, 1983, Judge Rya W. Zobel sentenced him to two years in prison. He was allowed to remain out of prison until the outcome of his appeal, which was rejected on December 1, 1983. Kelly then sought to have his sentence delayed until April 1984 so he could complete his studies for a master's degree in business administration at Florida International University. The request was denied and Kelly began his sentence in March 1984. He was incarcerated in Federal Prison Camp, Eglin. Personal life Kelly and his wife had eight children (five sons and three daughters). One of his daughters died as an infant. In 1970, Kelly and his wife separated. After their separation, Kelly moved to the Jamaicaway Towers in Boston. While residing in Boston he was known to have breakfast at the Ritz, drive a Mercedes-Benz, go out with young women, and play a daily game of squash at the Harvard Club of Boston. Later life and death Kelly spent his later years in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He died on August 9, 2013 in Aurora, Colorado, from complications following a hip fracture. He was buried in Leicester, Massachusetts, near his parents and daughter.

NASA would use the funding for human exploration of space, the Space Launch System, the Orion spacecraft, the Commercial Crew Program, the International Space Station (ISS), and various technological and educational projects. The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background NASA logo NASA is the agency of the United States government that is responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958. Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic missions such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs. NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2014 would authorize appropriations for FY2014 for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The bill would authorize programs, activities, and reports respecting NASA, including those with regard to human exploration of space, the Space Launch System, the Orion spacecraft, the Commercial Crew Program, the International Space Station (ISS), radioisotope thermoelectric generators, extrasolar planet exploration, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, Near-Earth objects, space weather, the Deep Space Climate Observatory, land imaging remote sensing data, aeronautics research, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, project and program reserves, and orbital debris mitigation. The bill would reaffirm the importance of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. The bill would direct the NASA Administrator to utilize the International Space Station and commercial services for Science Mission Directorate and Space Technology Demonstration missions in low-Earth orbit wherever it is practical and cost effective to do so. The bill would establish a space technology program. The bill would direct the Administrator to: (1) enter into an arrangement with the National Academies for a review of the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, and (2) revise the NASA Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to address the detection and avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts. =Funding details= *$3 billion is authorized to be spent on the International Space Station. *$658 million is authorized to be spent on the James Webb Space Telescope. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on April 29, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4412 would authorize the appropriation of about $17.6 billion for 2014 for activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The amount appropriated to NASA for 2014 is also about $17.6 billion. For the purpose of this estimate, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that no further appropriations will be provided to NASA for fiscal year 2014 and we therefore estimate that no additional discretionary costs would result from enacting H.R. 4412. The CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4412 would increase direct spending by adding about $600 million over the 2015-2024 period to outlays for certain NASA contracts. Because the legislation would increase direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the legislation would not affect revenues. H.R. 4412 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 7, 2014 by Rep. Steven M. Palazzo (R, MS-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the United States House Science Subcommittee on Space. On June 5, 2014 it was reported (amended) alongside Report 113-470. The House voted on June 9, 2014 in Roll Call vote 272 to pass the bill 401-2. Debate and discussion Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), the Chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, supported the bill, saying that \\"this bill provides the necessary funds to push us into the Cosmos and beyond.\\" Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-MS), who introduced the bill, said that \\"American leadership in space depends on our ability to put people and sound policy ahead of politics.\\" Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) praised the bipartisan nature of the bill, arguing that it had been significantly improved over earlier partisan drafts from 2013. The bill included a provision that stops NASA from spending any money on the Asteroid Redirect Mission, instead requiring NASA to report to Congress about expected costs and schedule for that mission.

Her political career is dedicated to issues of feminism, human rights, and public health policy. Previously a cabinet minister and deputy, Chac√≥n has also served on numerous committees and conferences on the national and international level. Personal life Chac√≥n was born in San Jos√© on 11 November 1961 to Luis Manuel Chac√≥n, a former leader in the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC for its Spanish initials). She lives in Goicoechea with her two daughters. She has been cited twice for violating employer delinquency laws by not paying employer contributions to the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, once in 2001 and once in 2004. Both cases were resolved after hearings. Chac√≥n trained as an international relations expert and has served in numerous public policy organizations. In 2011, she served on the United Nation's Global Commission on HIV and the Law Reviews Legal Barriers Obstructing Progress on AIDS in Asia-Pacific. From 2011 to 2013, she served on the Board of Directors for Fundaci√≥n PANIAMOR, a non- profit organization that supports the rights of children. Political career Chac√≥n served as Vice Minister of Public Safety during the Abel Pacheco administration (2002-2006). She then served as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica from 2006 to 2010 for PUSC. At the time, she worked with the block of deputies who were in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Chac√≥n expressed interest in favor of in vitro fertilization, the rights of children, and same-sex marriage. Some of these issues put her in direct ideological conflict with others members of her party. In 2010, Chac√≥n left PUSC to create a new party with other ex-PUSC members, the Christian Democratic and Social Party (CDS for its Spanish initials). PCDS never fielded any candidates, but remained active as an arm of PUSC. In 2014, Chac√≥n became Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s' second vice presidential candidate, alongside Helio Fallas. Her selection was a surprise to many PAC followers given her support of CAFTA during the Arias administration and her past association with PUSC. She explained the disagreement about CAFTA by saying that it had not been implemented correctly, citing problems of corruptions, ethics, and transparency. In 2018, Carlos Alvarado elected her as new Costa Rican Ambassador in Madrid, Spain. Political philosophy As a deputy, Chac√≥n often clashed with PUSC, her own party, supporting such initiatives as the right to in vitro fertilization, same sex marriage, and abortion in the case of fetal health. Chac√≥n also expressed interest in issues of adolescent pregnancy, domestic violence, and poverty. She believes that extreme poverty in Costa Rica can be eliminated within four years of good governance. She marched in support of LGBT rights during an annual parade in 2015. Upon joining PAC, Chac√≥n was open about her dislike of President Laura Chinchilla's policies with regard to women, saying that they were ignored by the former president. Of Chinchilla, Chac√≥n said that \\"she has not worn the clothes of a woman in order to govern like a woman, because she is just another politician.\\" Chac√≥n also expressed grievances about how CAFTA is implemented, but nevertheless stood by her support of it, claiming that it is too early to analyze the positive or negative impact of the free trade agreement.

While in the Boston area, he served at the well-known Park Street Church where Steve met Sharol Rhodes, whom he later married in June 1973.  Education  He began his education at Whitman College where he earned his B.A. in English Literature in 1970. In 1972, he continued his education at Harvard Divinity School where he received his M.T.S. in Semitic Studies and one year later earned a Th.M. from Gordon- Conwell Theological Seminary.

The bill would offer loan guarantees, offer various types of aid, and place sanctions on people who were \\"responsible for or engaged in actions that undermine democratic processes in Ukraine or that threaten its peace or territorial integrity, acts of significant corruption in Ukraine, or the commission of serious human rights abuses.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Other bills attempting to provide support for Ukraine included the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress) and the To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress). Background The 2014 Ukrainian revolution began with civil unrest in Kiev, Ukraine, as part of Ukraine's ongoing Euromaidan protest movement against the government. The conflict escalated rapidly, leading to the downfall of the government of President Viktor Yanukovych and the setting up of a new government to replace it within a few days. Yanukovych fled to Russia, and is wanted in Ukraine for the killing of protesters. The conflict continued with the 2014 Crimean crisis when Russian forces seized control of the Crimea region. The 2014 Crimean crisis began in late February 2014 in the aftermath of the Ukrainian Revolution, when‚Äîafter months of protests by Euromaidan and days of violent clashes between protesters and police in the Ukrainian capital Kiev‚Äîthe President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, fled the capital on February 21. The Verkhovna Rada (the parliament of Ukraine) subsequently voted unanimously to impeach Yanukovych.\\"Update: The Ukrainian Parliament declared that President Yanukovych has failed to perform his duties hence he is relieved from the post of president\\" Forbes What Does The Future Hold For UkraineParliament votes 328-0 to impeach Yanukovych on Feb. 22; sets May 25 for new election; Tymoshenko free (VIDEO) Feb. 23, 2014, 2:39 a.m. https://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine- feb-21-live-updates-337287.html This was followed by the interim appointment of the Yatsenyuk Government, as well as the appointment of a new Acting President of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said President Yanukovych was illegally impeached and that Russia continues to regard him as Ukraine's legitimate president.United Nations News Centre - UN Security Council action on Crimea referendum blocked Russia describes the Yatsenyk government as \\"self-proclaimed\\" and the events in Kiev as a \\"coup d'etat\\". Yanukovych supporters point out that not enough members of the parliament were present for the vote to reach the three-fourths majority required to impeach a President according to the Constitution of Ukraine.https://huffingtonpost.com/john-feffer/who-are-these-people- anyw_b_4964526.html Who Are These 'People,' Anyway? Beginning on February 26, pro-Russian forces gradually took control of the Crimean peninsula. Russia claimed that the uniformed men were local self-defense forces, but they are generally claimed in Western media to be Russian military personnel without insignia. On February 28, President Barack Obama's statement was released warning Russia not to intervene in Crimea. The statement said that President Obama is \\"deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine.\\" It added that \\"any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe\\" and that it would be \\"a clear violation of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international laws.\\" On March 1, Obama held a phone conversation with Putin and said that the Russian invasion was a \\"violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity ... [and a] breach of international law.\\" He warned of \\"greater political and economic isolation\\" and threatened to withdraw the United States from the 40th G8 summit chaired by Russia. Barack Obama talks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, March 1, 2014 Secretary of State John Kerry then labeled and condemned Russia's \\"invasion\\" of Ukraine on March 2 in an interview for Face the Nation. He called it an \\"incredible act of aggression,\\" and said that \\"you just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext.\\" On March 3, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden announced that the United States would not send a presidential delegation to the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi (which was to be led by Tammy Duckworth), \\"in addition to other measures we are taking in response to the situation in Ukraine.\\" As with the British boycott effort, it will not affect the country's participation in the Games themselves. On March 5, 2014, U.S. Representative Hal Rogers introduced the bill To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide loan guarantees to Ukraine of up to $1 billion, part of the American response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. On March 6, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 114 to pass the bill 385‚Äì23. On March 25, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid indicated that United States Senate would vote on this bill on March 27, 2014, but only after amending it to include provisions that would put sanctions \\"against anyone deemed by the president to have undermined Ukraine's security or independence, or to have engaged in corruption in Ukraine or Russia.\\" On March 6, Obama signed Executive Order 13660, Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine, authorizing sanctions against persons who, being determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State, have violated or assisted in the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. On March 11, the Supreme Council of Crimea and the City Council of Sevastopol adopted a joint resolution expressing their intention to unilaterally declare Crimea's independence from Ukraine as a single united nation with the possibility of joining the Russian Federation as a federal subject. In a referendum on March 16, officials said that nearly 96% of those who voted in Crimea supported joining Russia.Crimea Applies to Join Russia Election officials said the turnout was a record high,Crimea referendum: Voters 'back Russia union', BBC, March 16, 2014 although many Tatars and opponents of the referendum were reported to have boycotted the vote.Crimea election chief reports 95% vote to secede, half of ballots counted CBC Retrieved on March 16, 2014 On March 17, the Crimean parliament officially declared its independence from Ukraine and requested to join the Russian Federation.Crimean parliament formally applies to join Russia, BBC, March 17, 2014 On March 18, President Putin reclaimed Crimea as a part of Russia on both moral and material grounds, citing the principle of self-determination and Crimea's strategic importance for Russia.Uriel Abulof, Self-Determination, Redux?, Huffingtonpost, March 20, 2014 On March 12, 2014, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez introduced the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide funds to implement a U.S. quota increase at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rescind other funds previously appropriated for the IMF, and provide or authorize various forms of assistance to Ukraine and the surrounding region. It would require sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, corruption, human rights abuses, or undermining stability in Ukraine, and would authorize sanctions on certain individuals in Russia. On March 24, 2014, the Senate voted 78‚Äì17 to advance the bill to floor consideration. Consideration of the bill was withdrawn, however, the next day, after a decision by Majority Leader Harry Reid. Instead of continuing with this bill and its controversial International Monetary Fund provisions, the Senate was to take up a House-passed bill already offering Ukraine loan guarantees, amending it to add sanctions provisions. The Ukrainian parliament has stated that the referendum is unconstitutional. The United States and the European Union said they consider the vote to be illegal, and warned that there may be repercussions for the Crimean ballot.Obama: US, EU Prepared to Penalize Russia for Crimea Ballot, VOA, March 16, 2014 On 17 March, Obama signed Executive Order 13661, Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine, which expanded the scope of the previous sanctions imposed by EO 13660, to include the freezing of certain Russian government officials' assets in the US and blocking their entry into the US. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Ukraine Support Act would state U.S. policy supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a democratic Ukraine, and in condemning Russia's armed intervention into Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea. The bill would authorize and encourage the President of the United States to provide assistance to support democracy and civil society in Ukraine by: (1) improving democratic governance and anti-corruption efforts; (2) supporting Ukrainian efforts to foster greater unity among people and regions of the country, combat anti-Semitism, and promote respect for religious freedom; (3) supporting the people and government of Ukraine in conducting free and fair elections; (4) assisting Ukraine in diversifying its economy, trade, and energy supplies; and (5) expanding access to independent media and assisting with the protection of journalists and civil society activists. The bill would state that it shall be U.S. policy to work with other countries and international institutions to stabilize and reform Ukraine's economy. The bill would express the sense of Congress that U.S. loan guarantees for Ukraine should be used to promote anti-corruption efforts and government, banking, and energy sector reforms. The bill would direct Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Incorporated, and the Voice of America (VOA) service to Ukraine and neighboring regions to: (1) provide accurate and accessible news and information; (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to highlight misinformation provided by Russian or pro-Russian media outlets; (3) prioritize programming to target populations and areas where access to uncensored information is limited, especially populations serviced by Russian supported media outlets; (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea; (5) promote democratic processes, human rights, freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; (6) increase programming and content services to Russia; and (7) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates to increase distribution. The bill would authorize FY2014 appropriations for programming in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, and Tatar language services of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and VOA. The bill would express the sense of Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) should prioritize investments in Ukraine. The bill would state that it shall be U.S. policy to assist Ukraine foster a democratically reformed police force. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of State to seek to provide enhanced security cooperation with Central and Eastern European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states. The bill would express the sense of Congress that: (1) specified U.S. assistance to Ukraine under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act should continue, (2) the President is encouraged to draw down United States Department of Defense (DOD) stocks in order to provide non-lethal assistance to the government of Ukraine, and (3) the Administration should conclude its current review of security assistance for the government of Ukraine. The bill would express the sense of Congress that: (1) the Administration should provide assistance to the government of Ukraine to recover assets stolen from the government of Ukraine or linked to acts of corruption by former President Viktor Yanukovych, members of his family, and other former or current Ukrainian government officials; and (2) the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should increase investments in Ukraine and cease new investments in the Russian Federation. The bill would continue specified property-blocking sanctions against certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine. The bill would impose asset and visa/entry sanctions against a foreign person or an alien who on or after November 21, 2013: (1) is responsible for or engaged in actions that undermine democratic processes in Ukraine or that threaten its peace or territorial integrity, acts of significant corruption in Ukraine, or the commission of serious human rights abuses; (2) is a current or former senior official of the Russian Federation who has engaged in any such activity; (3) operates in the arms sector in the Russian Federation that has engaged in any such activity; (4) is a current or former leader of an entity that has engaged in any such activity, or of an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Act; (5) has materially assisted or provided financial, material, or technological support for any such activity, or of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Act; or (6) is owned or controlled by, or has acted for or on behalf of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Act. The bill would subject violators of such provisions to specified penalties. The bill would authorize the President to waive the imposition of such sanctions if in the U.S. national interest. The bill would terminate sanctions under this Act at the earlier of: (1) 90 days after the President certifies to Congress that Ukrainian sovereignty is not being violated by the Russian Federation or any other state, or (2) 30 days after any date subsequent to January 1, 2020, on which the President submits to Congress a determination that sanctions termination is in U.S. national security interests. The bill would direct the Secretary of State and the United States Secretary of the Treasury to jointly report to Congress every 180 days for a period not to exceed 2 years regarding foreign financial institutions that: (1) control government of Ukraine state-owned or controlled assets without such government's knowledge; (2) may be complicit in financial activities prohibited under U.S law that are organized under the laws of the Russian Federation, or owned or controlled by a foreign person subject to additional sanctions under this Act; and (3) are aiding the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, including, the Crimea. The bill would amend the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to require the President to fully implement the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, including sanctions against Russian companies. The bill would express the sense of Congress that the President should expand the list of 18 Russian officials and others who were engaged in certain actions regarding the death of Sergei Magnitsky, illegal activity by officials of the Russian Federation, or violations of human rights. Authorizations of appropriations The Ukraine Support Act would authorize appropriations of $68 million to spend on various projects in Ukraine. The House Republican Conference reports that the spending \\"is fully offset by a reduction in authorized assistance for Pakistan.\\" Section 101 authorizes the appropriation of $50 million for \\"support for democratic governance and civil society in Ukraine\\" such as support for fair elections. Section 103(d) authorizes the appropriation of $10 million for radio and broadcast programming in local languages. Finally, Section 105(b) authorizes the appropriations of $8 million for \\"enhanced assistance for law enforcement and the judicial system\\" in Ukraine. Section 110 offsets this potential spending by reducing the amounts authorized in the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. The amendment to the Pakistan bill reduces by $70,000,000 the amounts available in each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014, for a total reduction in Pakistan- related budget authority of $350,000,000. As prior year funds have probably been spent, the result will be a reduction of $70,000,000 in current-year (2014) Pakistan spending. Procedural history The Ukraine Support Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 21, 2014 by Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Debate and discussion This bill is one of several different attempts to provide aid to Ukraine and sanctions on those responsible for the violence there. One of the sticking points regarding previous bills was the desire of Senate Democrats to include provisions that would reform the International Monetary Fund, provisions that were opposed by House Republicans. In order to ensure that aid for Ukraine was finally passed, the Democrats agreed to drop their requirement for those provisions, which is one of the reasons why those provisions were not included in this bill. One of the bill versions with the unpopular IMF provisions was the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress).

His success brought him in contact with Al Capone, who arranged a deal with Diesbourg to supply him with regular shipments of alcohol by plane. Diesbourg took the name \\"King Canada\\" at this time as an alias to hide from legal authorities.Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 51. Early life Diesbourg was born in Rochester Township, a farming area near Belle River, the son of Paul and Mary Jane Diesbourg, he was the 10th of 12 children. Belle River was a small town east of Windsor, Ontario. The French-Canadian Diesbourg started his career as a small-time bootlegger, serving bar at his brother Charlie's hotel, the Wellington, on the main street of Belle River. His early bootlegging operations were only local, he never sent the liquor across the border into the United States. Diesbourg saw significant profits, since he would buy whiskey for about $1.25 a case and sell it for $3.00. At some point during 1925-26, he opened his own hotel, called the Omar Hotel, and expanded into the export business.Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg.38 Export business Due to the ease and proximity of smuggling across the Detroit River to the United States, it was an obvious choice for Diesbourg to expand his operations across the border. Farming or fishing wages of $35 a month could not compete with monthly rum running salaries of $400 a month for a captain. Seventy-five percent of all illegal liquor brought into the United States was transported across the Detroit River from Canada, mainly along the thirty-five mile stretch from Lake Erie to the St. Clair River. In fact, the city's two major industries during this time were the manufacturing of automobiles and the distribution of Canadian liquor.Philip P.

It is estimated that in the vicinity of Detroit, over a thousand cases of liquor a day were legally shipped from Canada upon vessels bound to international locations.B.H.Spence, \\"Prohibitory Legislation in Canada,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 109 (1923): 239. Diesbourg was very successful in smuggling the alcohol to the U.S., working with the Mexico Export Company, the largest outfit at the time. He would take the whiskey across the ice in the winter months. \\"It was like a highway out there,\\" Diesbourg recalled, \\"the cars going back and forth, and no one to stop you.\\" He said that it was very hard to catch smugglers in the winter. The export docks were all along the river, and people paid cash for the liquor, up to $10,000 at times. Diesbourg spent his money almost as fast as he made it.Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 53. In addition to boats and cars, King Canada smuggled liquor by plane. Being one of the few to utilize that strategy. He stockpiled his loads of whiskey and beer, which he called \\"plants\\", underground to hide them from the authorities, placing the liquor in cisterns right under the feet of authorities that would search the place, and never found. He would load the planes on fields he rented from farmers in exchange for a case of beer or whiskey.Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 56. Contact with Al Capone Smuggling via planes gave Diesbourg his greatest wealth; it was also in this time that he came in contact with Al Capone. The mafia boss came to see him at the Mexico Export Dock, and they discussed business in Diesbourg's brother Charlie's cellar. From the start, Diesbourg demonstrated he was not afraid of Capone, and the kingpin could not push him around. Diesbourg recalled their meeting, telling the gangster, \\"Listen, I am King Canada, and you know you can't fool around with me. I know every move in Chicago‚Äîevery move you make.\\" When asked how he knew this, he replied, \\"What do you think I am? Don't you think I know something through the government of what's going on in Chicago?\\"Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 58. Diesbourg recalled how, despite Capone's tough attitude, he was \\"a good guy,\\" never talking tough to King Canada. They would meet only once more after the meeting in the cellar, in Chicago, when Diesbourg flew down with his pilots. Working with Capone, Diesbourg used old bombers that could hold twenty-five cases of whiskey. They would meet at six in the morning and load up the planes, regardless of the weather. Legacy Since his death in 1989, Blaise Diesbourg has added new interest in tourism in his hometown of Belle River. A local councilor, Ray Lalonde, has attempted to showcase the town's rum-running history by using Diesbourg and Al Capone's names. Old prohibition buildings, including their secret passages to transport liquor, could be turned into museums for anyone interested in the history of prohibition.Gary Rennie, \\";Grand Bend' Visions for Belle River; Councillor sees tourism possibilities,\\" The Windsor Star, September 9, 2012, A5.

The concept is \\"The yakuza versus society\\", shifting from \\"The yakuza versus the police\\". The ordinances prohibit citizens from making or keeping up a relationship with the yakuza. The targeted acts and treatment for the violators differ between prefectures. Some prefectures only set an obligation of \\"endeavor\\" to citizens, or a penalty in which companies in violation of the law are publicly exposed. But others impose imprisonment or a fine on their citizens. Among the prefectures, Fukuoka leads the way in toughening the regulations. Fukuoka was the first prefecture where the comprehensive ordinance came into force: commencing April 10, 2010.http://www.police.pref.fukuoka.jp/boutai/sotai/012.html Once the ordinances of Okinawa and Tokyo went into effect on October 10, 2011, all of Japan's prefectures have had the ordinance.https://www.nhk.or.jp/kaisetsu- blog/100/97004.html The ordinances pursue cutting any implicit relationships between citizens and the yakuza. Some of the prohibitions contain punishment against citizens. But a few of the definitions and their range of application are blurry. Especially what acts should be regarded as ‚Äúa payoff that assists the yakuza‚Äôs activity or operation‚Äù and ‚Äúclose association with the yakuza‚Äù; these definitions remain somewhat arbitrary for the authorities.  Criticisms  There is criticism based on violation of freedom of expression and the yakuza's human rights.Joint Statement Seeking Abolition Of ‚ÄúOrganized Crime Exclusion Ordinances‚Äù And Protesting Against Revision To Anti-Boryokudan Law http://www.bouhai-hantai.com/joint-statement  The ordinance of Tokyo  = Prohibition of payoff (Article 24-1) = This clause prohibits business owners from giving property benefits to the yakuza and its associates as payback for illegal demanding acts or illegal acts which benefit the business owner him/herself. For example, such acts are variations of cases where a business owner asks for the yakuza to intimidate a rival company; or to obstruct a local residents' campaign. Anti-boryokudan law also covers a business owner's requests for illegal demanding acts. But the clause can also cover scenarios when the request is difficult to define, such as when a business owner pays money after the yakusa has acted without knowing in advance of the illegal acts conducted by the yakuza. ;Penalty: On the first offense, the company receives a warning from the public safety commission. On the next offense, the police will reveal the company's name to the public. If the company violates the clause once again within a year after revelation of its name, the public safety commission then issues an order to stop the acts. If the company still does not obey the order, then the authorities can impose the penalty of imprisonment for not more than a year, or a fine of not more than 500,000 yen. = Prohibition of payoff that assists the yakuza‚Äôs activities or operations (Article 24-3) = The clause prohibits business owners from giving property benefits to the yakuza which assists the yakuza's activity or operation, knowing they are the yakuza. The clause has a wider scope than the \\"Prohibition of Payoff\\" (Article 24-1). It does not limit the case in which benefits are given to the yakuza for business, but includes mere dealing, delivery, and contract. For example, many of the daily transactions ‚Äî lending a room for a convention, delivering pizzas, repairing an office ‚Äî could be considered a violation of this case if they are regarded as assisting the yakuza's activities or operations. Providing lifelines such as electricity, water, and gas is permitted by the \\"exceptions clause\\" granted in article 24-3. ;Penalty: There is no criminal code for violators. The only penalty is public revelation of a violating company. It is executed if the company doesn't follow warning again within a year after receiving the first warning from the public safety commission. = Close contact with the yakuza = There is no prohibition for close contact with the yakuza. However, when a person participates in a party which the yakuza sponsors, this act could be regarded as an ‚Äú...assist of the yakuza‚Äôs activity or operation...‚Äù which is prohibited on Article 24-3. And also, when a business owner repeatedly plays golf or eats with members of the yakuza, the owner could be excluded from public projects, which is defined in Article 9. = Exclusion from private-sector businesses (Article 18) = The clause declares the obligation of endeavor for citizens. When a company makes a contract with a customer, the company is encouraged to add a term to confirm that the customer (whether operating as a business or an individual) is not a yakuza member. Adding this clause to the contract gives a reason to break out of the contract after discovering that he is a yakuza. In addition, this clause makes it easier to file a claim for indemnity against the yakuza. = Other features =  Exclusion from public projects (Article 7)   Exclusion from real-estate deal (Article 19)  The clause aims to prevent the yakuza from opening a new office in the whole area of Tokyo.

The British deployed Joseph Gorham and his Rangers along with Captain Rudolf Faesch and regular troops of the 60th Regiment of Foot to defend Lunenburg.\\"Regular\\" refers to a professional British soldier, paid by the British Crown. The Campaign was so successful, by November 1758, the members of the House of Assembly for Lunenburg stated \\"they received no benefit from His Majesty's Troops or Rangers\\" and required more protection.  Historical Context  Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. To prevent the establishment of Protestant settlements in the region, Mi'kmaq raided the early British settlements of present-day Shelburne (1715) and Canso (1720). A generation later, Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008; Thomas Beamish Akins. History of Halifax, Brookhouse Press. 1895. (2002 edition). p 7 By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War.Wicken, p. 181; Griffith, p. 390; Also see Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. By the time Cornwallis had arrived in Halifax, there was a long history of the Wabanaki Confederacy (which included the Mi'kmaq) protecting their land by killing British civilians along the New England/ Acadia border in Maine (See the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747).Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 2008. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (Citadel Hill) (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754).John Grenier. The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. There were numerous Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids on these villages such as the Raid on Dartmouth (1751).Grenier pp. 154‚Äì155. For the Raids on Dartmouth see the Diary of John Salusbury (diarist): Expeditions of Honour: The Journal of John Salusbury in Halifax; also see A genuine narrative of the transactions in Nova Scotia since the settlement, June 1749, till August the 5th, 1751 [microform] : in which the nature, soil, and produce of the country are related, with the particular attempts of the Indians to disturb the colony / by John Wilson. Also see http://www.blupete.com/Hist/NovaScotiaBk1/Part5/Ch07.htm After the Raid on Lunenburg (1756), Governor Lawrence sought to protect the area by establishing blockhouses at the LaHave River, Mush-a-Mush (at present day Blockhouse, Nova Scotia) and at the Northwest Range (present day Northwest, Nova Scotia). Despite the protection of these blockhouses, Indians and Acadians continued raiding the area, executing eight such raids over the next three years. A total of 32 people from Lunenburg were killed in the raids with more being taken prisoner. The British reported that most of these raids were by the Mi'kmaq and Acadians at Cape Sable. (The Argyle, Nova Scotia region was formerly known as Cape Sable and encompassed a much larger area than it does today. It extended from Cape Negro (Baccaro) through Chebogue.) Following the raid of 1756, Mi'kmaq made eight more raids on the Lunenburg Peninsula over the next three years. In 1757, the Mi'kmaq raided Lunenburg and killed six people from the Brissang family. That same year, the Lunenburg settlers were compelled to do \\"much militia duty\\".Desbresaie, p. 49 During the winter, 300 soldiers under the command of former governor, now Major General, Hopson's were stationed at Lunenburg. In April 1757, a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq partisans raided a warehouse near-by Fort Edward, killing thirteen British soldiers and, after taking what provisions they could carry, setting fire to the building. A few days later, the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland.John Faragher. Great and Noble Scheme. Norton. 2005. p. 398. Because of the strength of the Acadian militia and Mi'kmaq militia, British officer John Knox wrote that \\"In the year 1757 we were said to be Masters of the province of Nova Scotia, or Acadia, which, however, was only an imaginary possession.\\" He continues to state that the situation in the province was so precarious for the British that the \\"troops and inhabitants\\" at Fort Edward, Fort Sackville and Lunenburg \\"could not be reputed in any other light than as prisoners.\\"Knox. Vol. 2, p. 443; By year end, Governor Charles Lawrence wrote, \\"More inhabitants were killed and taken prisoner, by which many were too much exposed, and others apprehensive of danger. The people much discouraged, and in great distress.\\"p. 54 (By June 1757, the settlers of another Halifax satellite settlement, Lawrencetown, had to be withdrawn completely again from the settlement because the number of Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses). Of the 151 settlers who arrived in Dartmouth in August 1750, after Mi'kmaq and Acadia raids half of the settlers left the community within two years later.Harry Chapman, p. 31 By the end of war (1763), Dartmouth was only left with 78 settlers.Harry Chapman, p. 32  Campaign  The following year, March 1758, the Mi'kmaq raided the Lunenburg Peninsula at the Northwest Range (present-day Blockhouse, Nova Scotia) and killed five people from the Ochs and Roder families. On 15 May 1758, Captain Faesch left Halifax for Lunenburg with troops of the 60th Regiment and an order was given for Sutherland to join the forces en route to Louisbourg.Sutherland did not return to Lunenburg until September 6 (see ) Acadian privateers attacked shipping off of Lunenburg.Bell, p. 513, note 50 By the end of May 1758, most of those on the Lunenburg Peninsula abandoned their farms and retreated to the protection of the fortifications around the town of Lunenburg, losing the season for sowing their grain. For those that did not leave their farms for the town, the number of raids intensified. D.C. Jessen led the militia - The Jessen Bell, St. John's Anglican Church (Lunenburg), Nova Scotia During the summer of 1758, in response to the British Siege of Louisbourg (1758), Mi'kmaq conducted four raids on the Lunenburg Peninsula. On July 13, 1758, a member of the Labrador family killed two boys on the LaHave River. The next raid happened at Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia on August 24, 1758, when eight Mi'kmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. While they killed three people in the raid, the Mi'kmaq were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French. Two days, later, two soldiers were killed in a raid on the blockhouse at LaHave, Nova Scotia. On August 27, Joseph Stye along with Conrad Halty and his wife were buried after being scalped.p. 84 On September 8, D.C. Jessen led 60 militia and forty troops from the 60th Regiment around the peninsula for a week to scout for Mi'kmaq, which they did not find. During that time, on September 11, Mi'kmaq captured a child in a raid on the Northwest Range. After the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), Gorham's Rangers were stationed at Lunenburg for the winter. (Joseph Gorham owned 300 acres of land at Lunenburg: land still named Gorham Point at the end of present-day Second Peninsula, two islands nearby, a peninsula leading from the community of Mahone Bay as well as the Seven Islands, near Sacrifice Island in Mahone Bay.George Bates. John Gorham 1709-1751. Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, p. 87) Despite the presence of Gorham's Rangers and the 60th Regiment, in December Lawrence wrote to the Lords of Trade, that the Mi'kmaq \\"had just destroyed a whole family remarkable for their industry, and that in so bloody and barbarous a manner as to terrify and drive three parts of the people from their county lots into the town for protection.\\"Desbraisey, p. 52  Afterward  The raids continued the following spring. One raid happened on March 27, 1759, in which three members of the Oxner family were killed.Archibald McMechan, Red Snow of Grand Pre. 1931. p. 192 The last raid happened on April 20, 1759. The Mi'kmaq killed four settlers at Lunenburg who were members of the Trippeau and Crighton families. In a letter to the Lords of Trade dated 20 September 1759, Lawrence continued to comment on the raids by Mi'kmaq and Acadians slowing the development of the community.p. 53 Again, Acadian privateers attacked shipping off of Lunenburg. Rev. Jean-Baptiste Moreau was the minister at Lunenburg who buried many of the dead. He reported that the Mi'kmaq killed 32 people in the Campaign. Chief Paul Laurent of the LaHave Tribe arrived in Halifax after surrendering to the British at Fort Cumberland on 29 February 1760 and signed a Halifax Treaty on 10 March 1760.See Beamish Murdoch, Vol. 2, p. 385Chief Francis Mius of La Heve signed a peace treaty on 9 Nov. 1761.

The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.0. At least an estimated 1,349 people were killed in towns around the Gulf of Izmit such as Yalova, Sapanca and Adapazarƒ±, and in the nearby city of Constantinople (now known in English under its Turkish name, Istanbul). The main shock caused a tsunami high. Background An 1894 xylograph showing damage to the Wall of Constantine. Printed originally in Science Illustr√©, 25 August 1894, p. 193. The Sea of Marmara is a pull-apart basin formed at a releasing bend in the North Anatolian Fault, a right-lateral strike-slip fault. This local zone of extension occurs where this transform boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Eurasian Plate steps northwards to the west of Izmit from the Izmit Fault to the Ganos Fault. The pattern of faults within the Sea of Marmara basin is complex but near Istanbul there is a single main fault segment with a sharp bend. To the west, the fault trends west-east and is pure strike-slip in type. To the east, the fault is NW‚ÄìSE trending and show evidence of both normal and strike-slip motion. Movement on the Gulf of Izmit section of the fault, which bounds the √áƒ±narcƒ±k Basin, is the most likely cause of the 1894 event. Other possible causes are movement on the Prince's Islands segment of the fault (to the west of the Gulf of Izmit), and movement on a normal fault in the √áinarcik basin, separate from the North Anatolian Fault. Damage The earthquake is estimated to have generated shaking with a modified Mercalli intensity of 9 at Sapanca, 8.5 at Yalova, and 8 at Adapazarƒ±, B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, Gebze, Kartal, K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece and on the Prince's Islands.

Key findings According to reviewer Duncan Green, the following were the main findings of the study: # Poor people put the poverty line at a level closer to the $2/day threshold for income at purchasing power parity than to the $1/day threshold used in most academic analyses of extreme poverty. # The Oscar Lewis view of a culture of poverty is falsified by the study, which shows poor people working hard, optimistic, eager for a better future, and aware of the dangers of bad habits such as drinking and drugs. # Poverty is a condition/experience, not a permanent characteristic. # Inner strength and confidence that one can move out of poverty is often a first step to a successful transition out of poverty. # Poor people face much fewer economic choices than rich people, and this is a major barrier to their getting out of poverty. # Microcredit alone does not help most people move out of poverty. However, it can help when combined with good local infrastructure. # More responsive local governments lead to better local health and sanitation. # Collective action can help poor people cope but does not get them out of poverty because, even pooled together, they do not have much wealth. Reception Deepa Narayan wrote an op-ed in the New York Times building on the findings in the study reported in the books. Duncan Green reviewed the book series on his blog for Oxfam, calling it an outstanding mega-study. Former United States President Bill Clinton called the series ‚Äúan important resource for everyone who‚Äôs working to alleviate poverty.‚Äù See also * Voices of the Poor, a 1990s study by the World Bank about the statics of poverty.

A native of Bra»ôov educated in France and Germany, he was active in Transylvania's cultural life and worked as a Romanian-language professor at Czernowitz in the Duchy of Bukovina. He began his scholarly career in 1906, when he was tasked with compiling a general dictionary of the Romanian language. Interested in a variety of disciplines, Pu»ôcariu published widely and brought new ideas into Romania, as well as overseeing two monumental projects related to the language: advancing his dictionary to the letter \\"L\\", and creating an atlas of the language. As a soldier for Austria-Hungary during World War I, Pu»ôcariu embraced the creation of Greater Romania at its conclusion, heading the department of foreign affairs in the provisional government representing Bukovina Romanians. He was also the founder of Glasul Bucovinei, a newspaper which helped channel Romanian nationalism in that region, and, with Ion Nistor, oversaw Bukovina's union with Romania in November 1918. Under Romanian rule, he led efforts to create a new university in Cluj, where he also set up a research institute in the same city dedicated to the study of his native language. He promoted interdisciplinary approaches, primarily by attaching a sociological focus to his studies on linguistics. Though committed to ethnic nationalism and cultural conservatism, Pu»ôcariu embraced Europeanism during his stint at the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. He radicalized himself during the 1920s and '30s, first by seeking to impose a Jewish quota at his university, and then by more openly supporting fascist politics. Throughout much of the interval, he chaired the Romanian Orthodox Fraternity, which identified with the mainstream church and sometimes clashed with Transylvanian Greek Catholics. With the onset of World War II, he moved to Berlin, where he led a propaganda institute meant to promote Romanian culture in the German Reich, as well as counter Hungary's justifications for absorbing Northern Transylvania. Pu»ôcariu raised suspicion from his government employers, who disliked his lavish spending and his continued involvement with the rebellious Iron Guard. He was ultimately pushed to resign in 1943. After his return home, his health deteriorated while the authorities of the new Communist regime initiated legal proceedings. He refused to escape Romania and died at Bran, before he could be sentenced. Pu»ôcariu's work was largely shunned for two decades, and his scholarly legacy was fully revived following the collapse of the regime. Biography =Origins= According to Pu»ôcariu's own research, the family originated in Maramure»ô, spending time in Moldavia before ending up in southern Transylvania. Named Iuga in Maramure»ô, their surname was then Pu»ôca»ôu, reportedly an occupational surname marking their huntig skills (from pu»ôca»ô, meaning \\"shooter\\"),Stoian, p. 418 before the final form was selected at the suggestion of Bishop Ioan Lemeni (served 1833-1850),Florea, p. 663 as pu»ôca»ô is directly adopted from the Hungarian pusk√°s,pu»ôca»ô at DEX online while Pu≈ücariu has a Latinised, more Romanian-sounding ending. In the latter part of the 18th century, one Iuga Pu»ôca»ôu left »öara FƒÉgƒÉra»ôului and arrived at Sohodol village near Bran; it was from two of his sons that the prominent family was descended.Florea, p. 663. See also Stoian, p. 418 Sextil's grandfather Ioan Pu»ôca»ôu, a priest from Sohodol, had five sons and five daughters, providing all of them a rigorous education. One son was Ioan Pu»ôcariu, who became a noted jurist and historian, while another, Ilarion, left his mark as a theologian.Faiciuc, pp. xix‚Äìxx Sextil's cousins included Emil, a surgeon, who married a sister of the literary historian Ovid Densu»ôianu.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 83, 309‚Äì10 Sextil's father Iosif (1835‚Äì1923) studied at the Transylvanian Saxon high school in Bra»ôov (known then as Brass√≥ and Kronstadt) before being sent to learn Theology in Sibiu. Metropolitan Andrei »òaguna observed that Iosif lacked a priestly vocation and gave him permission to leave the seminary in order to study Law. After graduating from the Saxon Law Academy, where he published a humor newsletter, the elder Pu»ôcariu served as a judge in ZƒÉrne»ôti from 1848 to 1867, running his courtroom in Romanian. Upon marrying Eufrosina Ciurcu, who came from a merchant family, he moved to Bra»ôov to work as a lawyer. Applying his literary talent, he founded Coco»ôul Ro»ôu, a humor magazine, editing it between 1874 and 1878 and in 1881.Damian, p. 121Faiciuc, p. xx =Early life and education= Pu»ôcariu's Bra»ôov house Born in Bra»ôov as Iosif and Eufosina's sixth son, Sextil Iosif Pu»ôcariu would later have two more brothers and a sister. He attended the Romanian high school in his native city, where he picked up Latin and history from teacher Vasile Goldi»ô,Cri»ôan, p. 196 before going to Germany and France for his undergraduate and doctoral degrees. Simona Suciu, \\"137 de ani de na≈üterea lui Sextil Pu»ôcariu, cel mai mare om de culturƒÉ al Bra»ôovului\\", AdevƒÉrul, 4 January 2014; accessed 26 March 2014 Trained in the spirit of Positivism, he was one of the first Romanian scholars to make a transition from philology to methodical linguistics.Constantinescu, pp. 299‚Äì301 At the University of Paris, between 1899 and 1901, he studied under Gaston Paris, while his doctoral adviser at Leipzig University was Gustav Weigand.Niculescu, p. 188 Weigand introduced him to a Dutch female student of Romanian, whom Pu»ôcariu would later describe as his first love.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 34‚Äì36 He also studied at the University of Vienna, Petru PoantƒÉ, \\"Universitatea Daciei Superioare\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 11/2011 teaching there in 1904. =Political journalism= As a political journalist, Pu»ôcariu joined the informal group, formed around Octavian Goga, Octavian Codru TƒÉslƒÉuanu, and Ghi»õƒÉ Pop, and known as tinerii o»õeli»õi (\\"inuered youth\\"). The main focus of their criticism was the more conservative Romanian National Party (PNR).Cri»ôan, p. 201 Through 1901, Pu»ôcariu's writings regularly appeared in Gazeta de Transilvania. He also made important contributions to LuceafƒÉrul, headed by TƒÉslƒÉuanu (whom he had befriended as a schoolmate in Bra»ôov), while it appeared both in Budapest and, after 1906, in Sibiu. Nicolae Mocanu, \\"Sextil Pu»ôcariu, corespondent al lui Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, Dumitru Caracostea (I)\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 6/2013 In 1902, he was elected a corresponding member of ASTRA's literary section. During the remainder of his life, he undertook activities related to the society, although at varying paces: active that decade in its philological efforts, he found himself largely overtaken by other activities in the 1910s, only to organize a series of conferences starting in the mid-1920s in Transylvania's towns, both large and small. Gabriel Vasiliu, \\"Sextil Pu»ôcariu »ôi Astra\\", Caiete Silvane, 14 February 2008 =Debut in academia and World War I experience= Pu»ôcariu made frequent crossings into the Kingdom of Romania (the \\"Old Kingdom\\", in later reference). He was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1906, becoming a titular member in 1914.Niculescu, p. 187 He also became one of several Transylvanian affiliates of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, the Romanian traditionalist and ethnic nationalist review in Bucharest,Ornea (1998), p. 126 finding his ideas on linguistics and history challenged by Densusianu and Ion Aurel Candrea. Pu»ôcariu's scholarly work was featured in the mainstream review Convorbiri Literare, signaling the latter's own transition toward SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist nationalism.Ornea (1998), pp. 62, 126 While at Leipzig, he came into contact with Wilhelm Meyer-L√ºbke, under whom he began his university career and who offered him a post at the University of Fribourg. Pu»ôcariu declined, citing a wish to be closer to the Romanian lands. In 1903 Pu»ôcariu began courting Leonora Maria Dima. In keeping up with the Pu»ôcariu family tradition, which favored consanguine marriage, she was his mother's grandniece.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 56, 84, 130 Leonora had studied music in Bra»ôov; her father, a mathematics teacher at Pu»ôcariu's high school, was the elder brother of composer Gheorghe Dima.Faiciuc, p. xxvi They were married on 5 September 1905, selecting academics Ion Bianu and Virgil Cioflec as their godfathers.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 111, 149 Leonora's dowry included a villa in Bran, which became Sextil's favorite residence.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 149, 242, 384 The Pu»ôcarius went on to have three children. At various later junctions, Sextil looked back on his conjugal life as having greatly improved his life, for being a \\"perfect union of souls\\".NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 72‚Äì73, 197‚Äì99, 291 In 1906, following earlier attempts by August Treboniu Laurian, I. C. Massim, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Alexandru Philippide, the Romanian Academy assigned Pu»ôcariu the task of writing a Dictionary of the Romanian Language, with the latter two personally giving him their notes. Pu»ôcariu took on the challenge at a difficult time: Romania's aging King, Carol I, had asked Philippide to remove all entries for neologisms, causing the latter to resign in protest.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 219‚Äì20 Pu»ôcariu taught Romanian language and literature at Czernowitz University in the Duchy of Bukovina from 1906. He replaced the retiring Ion G. Sbiera,H., \\"NoutƒÉ»õi. Dela universitatea din CernƒÉu»õi\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 1/1908, p. 3 and eventually rose to become dean of the Literature and Philosophy Faculty.Livezeanu (2000), pp. 225‚Äì26 This period saw him forming a close bond with philologist Alexe Procopovici and historian Ion Nistor.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 199 In September 1911, he visited the University of Ia»ôi, in Romania, alongside Mathias Friedwagner; he forged a friendship with A. C. Cuza, the jurist and anti-Semitic doctrinaire.Mocanu, p. 15 While in Czernowitz (Romanian name: CernƒÉu»õi), Pu»ôcariu refused the chance to teach at Vienna, as he would not have been able to lecture in Romanian, at the same time declaring his adherence to Pan-Germanism.NastasƒÉ (2011), p. 46 The outbreak of World War I caught Pu»ôcariu in Techirghiol, Romania. A reserve officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and overall an Austrian patriot, he rushed back to be mobilized in Bra»ôov,Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\".

Anii 1915‚Äì1916\\", in Collegium Mediense, vol. VII (ComunicƒÉri »òtiin»õifice XVI), 2017, p. 73 and was later ordered to CisnƒÉdie. In September 1914, after a liturgical music concert in the Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral, he met Onisifor Ghibu, whom he had known since 1905, and who records the deep concern the ongoing conflict was causing Pu»ôcariu.Faiciuc, p. xxxiOnisifor Ghibu, Oameni √Æntre oameni: amintiri, pp. 413, 416. Ed. Eminescu, 1990, Subsequently, Pu»ôcariu was stationed on the Italian Front. There, his sentiments of loyalty toward the Empire conflicted with the Italophilia he felt toward a country whose inhabitants he saw as the natural allies of the Romanians, a fellow Latin people.Damian, passim Czernowitz, the site of his residence, where he kept his manuscripts and materials, fell to the Imperial Russian Army in the first half of the war. From February to June 1916, he was intermittently hospitalized for eye problems, first at Trieste, where he met Iuliu Maniu, and later at Innsbruck, followed by Bra»ôov.Faiciuc, p. xxxii When the Romanian Kingdom entered the war in August, on the side of the Triple Entente, he was either at home on leave or at the front, but in either case continued his research. Nevertheless, the situation forced him to interrupt work on the Dictionary of the Romanian Language he had started in 1906.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 72 The following January, he began keeping a diary, writing fairly regular entries until his wife's death in 1944. While on the front in early 1918 dealing with military accounting and supplies, he worked on a glossary of the Istro-Romanian language. His older brother, engineer Anton Pu»ôcariu, escaped Austria-Hungary and joined the Romanian Army, dying of typhus at the garrison of BacƒÉu in 1917.Mocanu, p. 17 =Bukovina's unification= Dispute over the Duchy of Bukovina in 1918. In blue, territories claimed by the West Ukrainian People's Republic, and partly held by the Ukrainian Galician Army. Red line shows territories initially claimed by the Kingdom of Romania in 1916; arrows mark the route taken by Iacob Zadig's expeditionary force By October 1918, Pu»ôcariu had regained Bukovina, joining the Romanian nationalist caucus forming in that region. As reported by eyewitness Teodor BƒÉlan, his presence there was a \\"great fortune\\" for Romanian groups, since Pu»ôcariu indicated the \\"straight path ahead\\" for his conationals.BƒÉlan, p. 96 On 12 October, he founded the newspaper Glasul Bucovinei, which had as its limited initial goal the protection of rights for the province's Romanians, who formed an overall minority of the local population.Ion »öurcanu, Istoria rom√¢nilor: Cu o privire mai largƒÉ asupra culturii, pp. 519‚Äì20. Ed. Istros, BrƒÉila, 2007, However, Glasul also preserved a hidden agenda, namely: \\"to shatter the respect and fear inspired by the Austrian Empire and to militate for the ideal of pan-Romanian unification.\\"Mustea»õƒÉ, p. 363 Events quickly evolved, and Pu»ôcariu served as a vice president of the Romanian National Council (CNR) that worked for the union of Bukovina with Romania. This initiative pitted Pu»ôcariu against the loyalist Aurel Onciul, who vetoed all projects for Bukovina's merger with Romania.BƒÉlan, pp. 96‚Äì97; Duca, p. 143 Pu»ôcariu was also co-opted by the General Congress of Bukovina, a CNR body which claimed to be the provisional parliament of Bukovina, in opposition to the Ukrainian assembly; from 27 October 1918, he served on its foreign policy committee, alongside Alexandru Hurmuzachi and Gheorghe Grigorovici.Ungureanu, p. 5 On 9 November, he helped Ilie LazƒÉr organize armed resistance to the Ukrainian Galician Army, which had occupied Czernowitz. These irregulars held their ground until the arrival of Romanian regulars under Iacob Zadig on 11 November.Ungureanu, p. 7.

It was here that, on 22 November, he resumed contacts with Nistor, head of the Romanian Mission in Bukovina, with whom he reached an agreement on the recognition of the union.Mustea»õƒÉ, pp. 318‚Äì19 He networked with Romanian nationalists in both Transylvania and the Moldavian Democratic Republic (or Bessarabia). He advised the former \\"never to reach a compromise with the Hungarians\\", while announcing the latter that Bukovina had become a Romanian province.BƒÉlan, p. 100 Pu»ôcariu also met Romanian Premier Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, who advised him to push ahead with the union, noting that unification needed to be demanded and enacted without waiting on international arbitration.Duca, pp. 143‚Äì44; Mustea»õƒÉ, p. 364 Pu»ôcariu reports that all of BrƒÉtianu's decisions on this issue were pre-approved by a bedridden Alexandru C. Constantinescu.Sebastian-Drago»ô Bunghez, \\"BacƒÉu\\", in Bogdan Murgescu, Andrei Florin Sora (eds.), Rom√¢nia Mare voteazƒÉ. Alegerile parlamentare din 1919 \\"la firul ierbii\\", p. 219. Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2019. Pu»ôcariu and Nistor traveled back to Czernowitz, then known as CernƒÉu»õi, where Nistor joined the CNR and drafted the act of union.Mustea»õƒÉ, pp. 318‚Äì20, 364 This document was in fact co- written by Duca and Constantinescu and Ion G. Duca‚Äîas Duca himself testified in his memoirs.Duca, p. 144 During his absence, Glasul Bucovinei was reorganized into an official daily of the CNR, with Pu»ôcariu as manager.Ungureanu, p. 8 After this recognition, he worked very closely with Nistor, helping him organize the radically nationalistic Democratic Unionist group from a base of Glasul intellectuals. However, he was himself inactive politically, and later stated that he had grown disillusioned with politics.Michelson, pp. 118, 121‚Äì122, 133, 140 He remained more involved in literary matters. In January 1919, writing in Glasul, Pu»ôcariu penned a strongly positive review of Poemele luminii, the debut volume by Transylvania's Lucian Blaga, helping launch his career. Gavril Istrate, \\"Lucian Blaga, contemporanul nostru\\", p. 9, in Anuar de lingvisticƒÉ »ôi istorie literarƒÉ, vol. XXXIV, 1994‚Äì1995, pp. 9‚Äì18 Transylvania united with Romania on 1 December 1918, but Pu»ôcariu was unable to attend the festivities at Alba Iulia, being sick in bed with a case of influenza he had caught at Ia»ôi.Faiciuc, p. xxxiv Disease had also prevented him from welcoming in CernƒÉu»õi a Bessarabian unionist delegation on 28 November.Ungureanu, p. 10 =University administrator and anti-Semitic campaign= Following these events, which marked the culmination of Greater Romania's creation, Pu»ôcariu could return to Transylvania, being named as the first rector of the Superior Dacia University in Cluj. A Franz Joseph University already existed in the city, but its Hungarian faculty departed as a bloc and an entirely new professorial corps and administrative structure were required. The revamped university had two founders, the idealistic Ghibu and the more practical Pu»ôcariu. Chosen by the Directing Council, Transylvania's provisional government, the latter headed a twenty-man committee charged with the seemingly insurmountable task of setting up four faculties (Literature and Philosophy, Medicine, Science, Law) and recruiting professors within a few months. As a native Transylvanian, Pu»ôcariu was familiar with the Austro- Hungarian milieu; he also had relations with academics in Western Europe and was close to a number of figures in the Old Kingdom, especially Nicolae Iorga. Set up in July 1919, the committee included twelve professors from the Universities of Ia»ôi and Bucharest, and eight Transylvanians. At the time, Pu»ôcariu recommended that intellectuals in Bukovina and Transylvania steer away from any involvement in the Old Kingdom's party politics.Radu Florian Bruja, \\"The Image of the Romanian State in Bukovina between the Two World Wars\\", in the Journal of Romanian Literary Studies, No. 16, 2019, p. 442 Despite pressures from the PNR, he announced a strictly apolitical hiring process, only making an exception for Maniu's brother Cassiu, a law professor he found \\"slightly ridiculous, but friendly and discreet\\". The new professors were mainly young, but also included a contingent of established Old Kingdom academics and Romanians working abroad, as well as foreign scholars. Pu»ôcariu had insisted his formal appointment come from within the university rather than the government, which allowed him to deny Ia»ôi and Bucharest a greater say in the proceedings. He also advocated against extending to Cluj the same set of laws that governed the Old Kingdom institutions, as he found them unsatisfactory; the laws were not applied uniformly until 1925. Notably, Pu»ôcariu hired Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ over Eugen Lovinescu; the former was, in addition to being a Transylvanian and a scholar of some local renown, Iorga's brother-in-law. It was Pu»ôcariu's idea to bring in foreign academics, mainly from France, including geographer Emmanuel de Martonne, who drew Romania's expanded borders at the Paris Peace Conference; and Jules Guyart of Lyon University, who became the medical faculty's first head. Courses began in November 1919, with a grand opening held the following February. Cluj had suddenly become a visible European academic center. Pu»ôcariu left the rectorate in 1920.Vasile Pu»ôca»ô, \\"Idealul universitƒÉ»õii moderne: prelegeri inaugurale la Universitatea din Cluj √Æn perioada interbelicƒÉ (1919‚Äì1940)\\", p. 264. Bibliotheca Judaica, vol. 7, Funda»õia CulturalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1994, Although he had joined the Freemasonry,NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 230 Pu»ôcariu remained committed to his identity as a member of the Romanian Orthodox Church; he stood out among his generation for fusing the national and religious identity into a culturally conservative mold. In his Romanian literature history tract of 1921 (Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Epoca veche), he concluded that \\"our Orthodoxism was the most significant event when it came to our cultural development\\". This, he noted at the time, had both positive and negative effects: Romanians were absent from the Renaissance, but were also free to develop their own culture, one of \\"measure and harmony\\".Ornea (1995), p. 114 The work was critical of monasticism, especially as embodied in the Catholic Church, alleging that \\"monasteries have always fostered internationalism\\".Dumitru Neda, \\"Sf√¢ntul Pavel ca fiul neamului sƒÉu. G√¢nduri cre»ôtine asupra iubirii de lege »ôi neam\\", in Cultura Cre»ôtinƒÉ, vol. XIV, nr. 7‚Äì8, July‚ÄìAugust 1925, p. 228 Istoria literaturii..., \\"very popular with students and men of culture\\",Constantinescu, p. 297 and heavily influenced by Iorga, made a point of discovering or reclaiming early contributions to fine writing in the medieval principalities. According to literary historian Eugen Negrici, this effort was unconvincing: \\"The aesthetic gamble is a meek one, and [Pu»ôcariu's] critical insights and interpretative newness are both frail. [...] However, the imposing illustrations and the openness [...] toward other forms of ancient art (architecture, painting, embroidery, miniatures, etc.) are not without consequences. Such rich and motley environs become a resonance box for the hardly perceptible sound of an actual literature. We may now fool ourselves that this literature is one of force and consistency\\".Eugen Negrici, Iluziile literaturii rom√¢ne, p. 230. Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2008. An anti-Semitic campaign swept Romanian universities in the wake of World War I. In this context, at the time the 1920‚Äì1921 school year opened, Pu»ôcariu expressed his concern that Jews were disproportionately represented in the Medicine and Law faculties. He suggested they congregated toward those subjects because of surer and more profitable career prospects, given the lack of doctors, administrators and magistrates in Romania's newly acquired provinces. A Jewish quota was enacted in the Kingdom of Hungary in September 1920, leading to a surge in Hungarian Jewish enrollment at Cluj. Prompted by the medical faculty's leadership, the university senate discussed introduction of a similar policy.NastasƒÉ (2011), p. 90 In early 1921, students, later joined by cultural figures, began demanding that sociologist Eugen Ehrlich be fired from his professorship at CernƒÉu»õi. Ehrlich was a Jew who had converted to Catholicism, but the primary motivating factor in his firing appears to have been a campaign to fill teaching posts with ethnic Romanians. Ehrlich, who was rector in 1906‚Äì1907, had been instrumental in Pu»ôcariu's being hired at the university. However, no one intervened on his behalf; not even Pu»ôcariu tried to stop his benefactor's dismissal.NastasƒÉ (2011), pp. 44‚Äì46 By 1922‚Äì1923, as a nationalist, anti-democratic and anti-Semitic student movement centered around Corneliu Zelea Codreanu gained ascendancy, he was not at the forefront of its radical promoters, but rather figured among a group of moderate, respectable academic supporters who countenanced the agitators and lent them an air of general acceptance.Livezeanu (2000), pp. 272‚Äì73 In March 1923, he wrote an article applauding the 15,000 student movement participants; praising the cohesion they showed, rare for Romania, he claimed they represented \\"a healthy and spontaneous reaction of the national preservation instinct\\". Addressing students from Bukovina, he called the Jewish quota something all those who wished the country well would endorse, for \\"in our country [which we] gained with so many sacrifices, we no longer have air to breathe; the invasion of the foreign element stifles us, chokes us\\".Irina Livezeanu, \\"Fascists and Conservatives in Romania: Two Generations of Nationalists\\", in Martin Blinkhorn (ed.), Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, p. 215.

This allowed him to leave the country regularly, and also cemented his friendship with diplomat Nicolae Titulescu, whom Pu»ôcariu called \\"charming\\". Together, they defended the Romanian cause against property claims made in Transylvania by Hungarian citizens.Agrigoroaie, pp. 12‚Äì14, 17‚Äì18 In 1923, Pu»ôcariu also helped art historian George Oprescu take office art the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, of which he himself was a member.Agrigoroaie, p. 10 The following year, Pu»ôcariu put out Cultura magazine from Cluj. It enshrined his affiliation to Europeanism and support for the League of Nations.Angela MƒÉgheru»ôan Precup, \\"Ideea europeanƒÉ √Æn presa mure»ôeanƒÉ interbelicƒÉ\\", in The Proceedings of the European Integration - Between Tradition and Modernity Congress, vol. 4, 2011, p. 332 From around 1922, Pu»ôcariu approached various intellectuals and politicians with the goal of creating new institutions for the preservation of cultural identity. With VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu and Nistor, he set up the BrƒÉtianu Foundation, which financed a network of summer schools for adult education.Michelson, p. With Iorga's assistance, Pu»ôcariu established the Museum of the Romanian Language, a research institute he had conceived in early 1917, while on the front. The large group of collaborators and students who advanced the language as an academic discipline came to be known as the Cluj School of linguistics. Rather than confine himself to a narrow field, Pu»ôcariu incorporated linguistics, history, sociology and even literature into his studies, constantly referring to research in other disciplines.Faiciuc, p. xxxii; Niculescu, pp. 188‚Äì89 Ion Simu»õ, \\"Nicolae Iorga ‚Äì Coresponden»õƒÉ necunoscutƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22/2006 For instance, in 1927 he penned articles recording how the Romanian War of Independence impacted Transylvanian society, as well as an overview of Hungarian borrowings in Romanian, which saw print in P√°sztort≈±z.\\"Memento\\", in Cele Trei Cri»ôuri, vol. VIII, nr. 6, June 1927, p. 111 Pu»ôcariu introduced Romanian linguistics to the theories of Meyer-L√ºbke, particularly as they related to the form of Latin that underpins the language; to Matteo Bartoli's ideas about the isolated and peripheral position of the language; and to Jules Gilli√©ron's dialectological notions. In terms of Romanian scholars, he incorporated the archaeological findings of Vasile P√¢rvan, as well as the sociological and folkloric studies of Simion Mehedin»õi and Romulus Vuia. His respect for their opinions led him to draw upon the work of Densusianu, Candrea, Constantin C. Giurescu, Iorgu Iordan, Alexandru Rosetti, Alexandru Graur and others.Niculescu, pp. 189‚Äì90 He had over eight hundred articles and numerous books to his name. In 1930, he helped organize a Folklore Archive within the museum building; led by Ion Mu»ôlea, this was the country's first institution dedicated exclusively to the study of its folklore tradition.Nae Antonescu, Reviste rom√¢ne»ôti de culturƒÉ din Transilvania interbelicƒÉ, vol. 1, Presa UniversitarƒÉ ClujeanƒÉ, Cluj-Napoca, 1999, The museum, associated with Cluj University (soon renamed after King Ferdinand), had as its goals the spread of popular interest in studying and cultivating the Romanian language, the training of Romanian philologists and the publication of monographs, special dictionaries, glossaries and bibliographies. The museum ended up being the nerve center of the great dictionary project, resumed from the 1906 attempts; this project was headed by Constantin Lacea and Theodor Capidan, who in turn were assisted by numerous other linguists in different stages. Lexical and etymological notes were presented in weekly meetings and later published in the museum's Dacoromania magazine, and in this way, practically all active members of the museum contributed to the Dictionary. Pu»ôcariu and his team worked for 43 years, until 1948, completing some 60,000 definitions across over 3,000 pages covering up to the letter \\"L\\". Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian communities in Greece and Albania The museum's second great project was a Romanian Linguistic Atlas, conceived and led by Pu»ôcariu but principally executed by two of his associates, Sever Pop and Emil Petrovici. The pair prepared fieldwork in 398 localities, undertook the work between 1930 and 1938, thereafter drawing the maps. By 1943, there had appeared four volumes encompassing Pop's research and three from Petrovici, as well as a volume on dialect texts. Finally, Dacoromania appeared from 1921 to 1948, in eleven enormous volumes totaling some 9,000 pages. The magazine contained studies, articles, notes and reviews, mainly on linguistics (lexicology, dialectology, linguistic geography, language history, onomastics, general linguistics, grammar, phonetics and phonology) and philology, as well as research on history and literary criticism, cultural history and folklore. Each edition included a bibliography that systematically recorded writings on linguistics, philology, folklore, ethnography and literature, connected to Romanian language, culture and literature, both domestically and abroad. Three generations of scholars worked on the magazine, with most articles presented at weekly meetings. Pu»ôcariu, in an obituary for Nicolae DrƒÉganu, commented on these sessions' usefulness, noting how the members would benefit from constructive criticism, \\"sometimes pointed, mainly intelligent, but never bitter, for the critical spirit never originated from a pleasure to destroy, but from a desire to complete, while the joy in another's discovery was always greater than the temptation to persist in a mistake\\". Despite remaining \\"enthralled by Latin elements\\" in onomastics, Pu»ôcariu announced in Dacoromania his conclusion that no Romanian surname had been traced back to a Roman source, contradicting Philippide in this respect.Graur, pp. 51‚Äì2 More controversially, the journal segregated its contributors into income classes: while most received fees of 150 lei, Iorga's articles would fetch some 1,000 per page.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 387 The institution also provided stable employment to Pu»ôcariu family members, including daughter Lia, daughter-in-law Maria, and nephew Vasile Bologa.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 313‚Äì14 =FOR and Iron Guard= By 1931, Lia Pu»ôcariu had married Grigore Manoilescu, brother of the influential ideologue, Mihail Manoilescu. Encouraged by his Manoilescu in- laws, Pu»ôcariu was briefly a sympathizer of Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party, and spent some time as director of its regional mouthpiece, Drumul Nou.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 180, 199, 313‚Äì14, 345 He is also credited as the newspaper's founder, while schoolteacher Ioan Costea was its editor.Netea, p. 149 The circle he created around him was noted for enthusiastically supporting Romania's authoritarian King, Carol II. Pu»ôcariu also attempted to go into national politics as a university representative in the Senate of Romania. He presented himself in the June 1931 election, but lost to the more popular Nicolae BƒÉnescu; this conflict prolonged itself into a local scandal, with Pu»ôcariu accusing BƒÉnescu of opportunism.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 370 Pu»ôcariu had another row with historian Alexandru Lapedatu, whom he challenged to a duel with swords in October 1931. That outcome was eventually averted when they agreed to reconcile.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 212 In tandem, Pu»ôcariu was becoming critical of Iorga's behavior‚Äîalready in 1923, he complained that his former mentor was \\"dictatorial\\".NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 170 In keeping with his Orthodoxist agenda, Pu»ôcariu also helped Nicolae Ivan set up the Romanian Orthodox Fraternity (FOR), which, as noted by historian Lucian NastasƒÉ, was under the influence of far-right groups.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 199, 345 It existed as a counterpart and rival of AGRU, a lay organization for the Transylvanian Greek Catholic Church. Allegedly, in 1934 he gave orders to boycott public ceremonies marking AGRU's anniversary, though he allowed his colleagues to attend those events where Carol II was also present.Br√Ænzeu et al., pp. 77, 156 Pu»ôcariu served as FOR president from March 1933 to 1939, and hosting its celebratory Congress in October 1935.Mocanu, pp. 14, 17. See also Br√Ænzeu et al., p. 156 Around that date, the FOR intervened in trilateral negotiations between Romania, Hungary, and the Holy See, asking for the Concordat of 1932 to be annulled, and demanding that Hungary immediately hand over Emanoil Gojdu's estate.Ioan Opri»ô, \\"Despre unele reac»õii ale clerului ortodox rom√¢n la preten»õiile revizioniste\\", in Cvmidava, vol. XXX, 2007, pp. 116, 120 At another Congress, in 1937, he repeated the claim that \\"our Orthodoxy is our only criterion for differentiation, for we are the only Latin people of the Orthodox faith\\".Ornea (1995), p. 113 His anti-Catholic rhetoric was particularly strong, forcing government to apologize for tolerating the display.Br√Ænzeu et al., p. 289 Immersing himself in the cultural politics of Transylvania, Pu»ôcariu resumed his links with ASTRA, attending its most notorious congress, held in September 1934 at T√¢rgu Mure»ô. It was here that he presented his paper on \\"literary perspectives of the era\\".Netea, pp. 42‚Äì43, 51 While his work again took him away from ASTRA in the 1940s, it was to its Bra»ôov chapter's president that he sent the manuscript of his history of the city in 1947. In March 1933, Pu»ôcariu's work was being assessed by government officials in Fascist Italy. This followed suggestions made by historian Francesco Salata, who wanted Pu»ôcariu to receive an Italian state decoration, and who noted that Bartoli had been similarly honored in Romania. The proposal was dropped when it became clear that Pu»ôcariu was opposing Hungarian revisionism, while Italy condoned it.Veronica Turcu»ô, \\"Sextil Pu»ôcariu √Æntre »ôtiin»õƒÉ »ôi politicƒÉ. Un episod italian din anul 1933\\", in Dacoromania, vol. XXI, nr. 1, 2016, pp. 95‚Äì100 During the mid 1930s, Pu»ôcariu became a manifest supporter of Codreanu's semi-legal fascist movement, the Iron Guard (or \\"Legionary Movement\\"). Records tend to show that he did not formally register with the Guard itself,Boia (2012), pp. 104, 106; NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 199 although his name appears among the card-carrying members of the Guard's political front, the \\"Everything for the Country\\" party.Ornea (1995), p. 207 He also signed his name to a list of intellectuals who \\"believed in Legionary victory\\".Boia (2012), p. 104; Ornea (1995), pp. 113, 205 On the occasion, he noted that the Guard had been the surest way of countering a \\"Jewish movement\\" at university, but also professed his admiration for Codreanu's \\"sincere religiosity\\" and \\"virtue\\".Boia (2012), p. 104 Pu»ôcariu was additionally noted for his eulogy upon the deaths of Ion Mo»õa and Vasile Marin, Guardist volunteers among the Spanish Nationalists. He depicted himself as a pious and old supplicant at their grave, and expressed gratitude that a \\"new spirit sweeps over our country.\\"NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 199‚Äì200 A contributor to the Guardist magazine, Buna Vestire, he added his voice to the campaign against modernist literature and \\"Jewish influence\\" in Romanian letters.Ornea (1995), pp. 410, 440, 451‚Äì452 The Nazi German consul in Cluj noted that Pu»ôcariu's \\"decidedly right-wing orientation\\" may have prevented his obtaining the rectorate or even a post in the academic senate at the latest university elections.OlƒÉrescu, p. 176 Under the authoritarian regime established by Carol as the \\"National Renaissance Front\\", Romania felt the mounting pressure of Hungarian revisionism. During the FOR rally in November 1937, Pu»ôcariu praised the king for building a chain of forts in Bihor County, on Romania's border with Hungary. At the time, he argued that the Diocese of Oradea was similarly serving as bulwark against foreign infiltration.Ioan-Mircea Ghitea, \\"75 de ani de la √Æntronizarea episcoului martir dr. Nicolae Popoviciu reflectatƒÉ √Æn Legea Rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", in Revista Tabor, nr. 6, September 2012, p. 27 At the next congress, in November 1938, Pu»ôcariu ordered a toning-down of anti- Catholicism. In a resolution adopted by the group, reference was made to \\"racial cohesion\\" between the Greek Catholics and the Orthodox, while still calling on the former to embrace Orthodoxy.Br√Ænzeu et al., p. 328 =Berlin institute= A year into World War II, Hungarian territorial demands received backing from Germany, limiting Romania's choices. In August 1940, Pu»ôcariu attended a crisis meeting of Transylvanian notabilities. He took a conciliatory position, supporting a voluntary exchange of territories with Hungary.Netea, p. 103 Following the Nazi-mediated Second Vienna Award, a large area, defined as \\"Northern Transylvania\\", was re-annexed by Hungary. The political crisis originating from this event also had the unlikely consequence of bringing the Iron Guard to power, producing the \\"National Legionary State\\". Slightly earlier, in August 1940, Pu»ôcariu had proposed the founding of the Berlin-headquartered Romanian Institute in Germany, becoming its first president and serving until 1943.OlƒÉrescu, p. 175 The purpose of this body was to counter Hungarian propaganda, particularly as related to Northern Transylvania. Irina NastasƒÉ-Matei, \\"Emil Cioran √Æn peregrinatio academica, 1933‚Äì1945\\", in Anuarul Institutului de Istorie 'George Bari»õiu' ‚Äì Series Historica, Nr. LI (2012), p. 252 Pu»ôcariu, who made generous financial contributions to the Guard's coffers, based his hiring at the institute on whether applicants belonged to the movement, and according to one of his employees there, was a member of the Guard's senate. Grigore Manoilescu, who had returned to politics as an Iron Guard figure, became the institute's director;OlƒÉrescu, pp. 176‚Äì77 Maximilian Hacman, former rector at CernƒÉu»õi, was an old friend; among the younger hires was Constantin Noica. The order for establishing the institute came on 16 August‚Äîstill during the National Renaissance Front regime‚Äîfrom the Foreign Ministry, led by Mihail Manoilescu.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 313‚Äì14; Magdalena Vulpe, \\"Institutul rom√¢n din Germania\\", p. 45, in Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai ‚Äì Series Philologia, 1999, vol. 44, nr. 1-2, pp. 43‚Äì50 Meanwhile, Pu»ôcariu, as a symbol of continuity, was offered a renewed mandate as rector of the Cluj University, which had moved to Sibiu due to the Vienna Award; he accepted and took office in October.Boia (2012), p. 161; Zolt√°n P√°lfy, \\"The Cluj/Kolozsv√°r University Amidst Wartime Cultural Politics, 1940‚Äì1944. An Assessment of Student Recruitment Patterns\\", p. 44, in Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai, Nr. 1/2005 Upon relocating to Berlin, he delegated his powers to his ally Procopovici, and later to Iuliu Ha»õieganu.Boia (2012), pp. 161, 201 Pu»ôcariu's institute was headquartered in a 26-room building in western Berlin, endowed with furniture of the highest quality ordered by Pu»ôcariu and hosting large receptions attended by politicians and cultural figures. For instance, Education Minister Bernhard Rust paid a visit lasting over six hours in July 1942. Pu»ôcariu held forth on the topic of Romanians' continuous presence in the Danubian space, particularly in Transylvania, and according to an internal memorandum, the visit ended with \\"exceptionally cordial\\" remarks toward his country.OlƒÉrescu, p. 179 Pu»ôcariu, in writings and interviews, made flattering remarks about the Nazi regime, calling it \\"a new chapter in world history\\" and \\"a new world, a new era in the life of the German state\\". Nazi Party figures were invited to receptions, including one in 1941 to commemorate Mo»õa and Marin.OlƒÉrescu, p. 178 Meanwhile, Pu»ôcariu undertook to spread knowledge of Romania and its culture in Germany. The institute was subordinate to the Romanian Propaganda Ministry, and as early as 1931, Pu»ôcariu had written an article expressing his concern at the fact that Romania's external propaganda was much weaker than that of its neighbors. He sought to have Romanian works staged in Germany, succeeding, for instance, in having Sabin DrƒÉgoi's opera NƒÉpasta and George Ciprian's play The Man and His Mule presented in Elbing in late 1942.OlƒÉrescu, pp. 179‚Äì80 In 1940, it was known that Romania did not enjoy a very positive image in Germany, with the country's consul in Cologne noting that its inhabitants were seen as \\"gypsies or at best Balkan people, with very primitive habits\\". Pu»ôcariu attempted to change this through numerous articles appearing in speciality publications that he was able to have printed due to his connections in Germany.OlƒÉrescu, p. 180 The propaganda books and articles that came out under Pu»ôcariu's supervision intended to show Germans that Romanians were an Aryan people, that Romania deserved to win back its lost territories thanks to its alliance with Germany, that Russians were a communist people desiring to use Bessarabia as a beachhead to attack the rest of Europe, while Romanians had been anti-communist since the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War began in 1918 and viewed the disputed province as a line of defense. He made similar arguments in Basarabia, an ample 1941 article in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale journal that chronicled the province's history from antiquity until its return to Romania during Operation Barbarossa. Expounding on what he saw as Imperial Russian neglect and contempt for the Bessarabia Governorate, he contrasted this with \\"the land rendered arable by the hard-working arms\\" of Romanians. Pu»ôcariu also brought up the 271 AD withdrawal of the Roman army into Dacia Ripensis, which left the agricultural population of Roman Dacia vulnerable to barbarian attack, comparing it with the previous year's departure of the Romanian Army from Bessarabia and subsequent Soviet occupation. He suggested that the 3rd century barbarians were \\"surely not more inhuman than the Bolsheviks who overran Bessarabia in 1940\\".Eugenia Bojoga, \\"Referin»õe basarabene la Sextil Pu»ôcariu\\", pp. 276‚Äì77, in Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai ‚Äì Series Philologia, 1999, vol. 44, nr. 1-2, pp. 271‚Äì78 As an old adherent of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism, Pu»ôcariu strongly promoted the peasant as a symbol of Romanianism.OlƒÉrescu, p. 181 He disseminated photographs of ordinary people from Bukovina, made unrealized plans for books on Romanian art and investigated the possibility of founding or reactivating Romanian language programs at a number of leading German universities. For his activities, he was awarded the Order of the German Eagle.OlƒÉrescu, p. 182 By 1940, Pu»ôcariu's public offices and various job benefits afforded him a comfortable lifestyle; he collected some 62,000 lei in regular payments from his work in Romania, and an \\"undisclosed\\" salary for his activities abroad.NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 376‚Äì77 However, his work there soon became the focus of investigation, particularly after the Legionnaires' rebellion, which resulted in the Iron Guard's removal from power in early 1941. As early as October 1940, the Education and Culture Ministries had noted Pu»ôcariu's \\"dictatorial\\" powers in hiring personnel, but were overruled by General Ion Antonescu, the country's ConducƒÉtor, in December. The following February, financial issues appeared, with an investigation sought by Mihai Antonescu into the reportedly exorbitant sums being spent by the institute. Pu»ôcariu ended up losing his rector's position at Sibiu and was accused of carrying on a months' long campaign against Ion Antonescu following the Guard's ouster.OlƒÉrescu, pp. 182‚Äì83 He often expressed the view that Heinrich Himmler would install the Guard back in power, and that the latter would then depose Antonescu.OlƒÉrescu, p. 184 After an audit in 1941‚Äì1942, the institute received just over a third of the 15 million lei budgeted; a half for 1942‚Äì1943; but zero of the 10 million in 1943. These moves were due not only to Pu»ôcariu's Guard background, but also to his political maneuvers that raised the question of the institute being shut down. The budget cuts were a signal for him to resign and return to Romania. Although for a time he was able to finance the institute out of his salary at the University of Berlin, as well as‚Äîit appears‚Äîanother, unknown source, he did ultimately depart in mid-1943. Nevertheless, Pu»ôcariu gave formal approval to Antonescu's core policies, including Romania's war on the Eastern Front.Boia (2012), p. 211 =Final years= A member of the Permanent Committee of Linguists, Pu»ôcariu was admitted to the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1936 and in 1939 became the second Romanian, after Dimitrie Cantemir, to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In addition to his activity as a propagandist, he worked on his definitive tract of sociolinguistics, Limba rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"The Romanian Language\\"), put out by Editura Funda»õiilor Regale. According to philologist Pompiliu Constantinescu, the work exceeded \\"the narrow bounds of specialization\\", turning the historical development of language and into the ethnographic \\"mirror\\" of Romanian culture and civilization.Constantinescu, p. 298 Limba rom√¢nƒÉ, which saw print in 1940, investigated proto-Romanian (designated by Pu»ôcariu under the name of strƒÉrom√¢nƒÉ), and spoke of a large Sprachbund comprising all Balkan Romance languages; his theory identifying Istro-Romanian as a Western varitety of the language was since corrected by his pupil Petrovici.Petri»ôor, pp. 207, 210‚Äì14 His views on the topic were also being challenged from 1941 by Alexandru Rosetti, who noted that Aromanian was highly distinct from its point of origin.Petri»ôor, pp. 211‚Äì12 Other parts of the book broke ground in the professional study of the Romanian lexis, with a phonaesthetic retrospective on the national poet Mihai Eminescu and a sociological analysis of neologisms.Constantinescu, pp. 301‚Äì308 It also featured Pu»ôcariu's newer musings on onomastics, recording the influence of popular novels on baptismal names for Romanian girls.Graur, p. 23 Fleeing aerial bombardments, Pu»ôcariu spent 1944 with his daughter and in-laws in Bran. In August, he heard news of the King Michael Coup and the country's changeover to the Allies. As noted by Maria Pu»ôcariu, the entire family was silent and worried about the future, whereas people in the streets celebrated.Stoian, pp. 419‚Äì420 In September, the left-leaning Romanian Writers' Society expelled Sextil from its ranks,Boia (2012), pp. 263‚Äì264 thus signaling his marginalization. In October, a decree compelled Pu»ôcariu to retire, including from the Museum he had led for a quarter century. The same month, the Communist Party press began targeting Pu»ôcariu for his political affiliations: Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ published an article denouncing him as a traitor,Faiciuc, p. 257 while Contemporanul included him on a list of \\"war criminals not yet on trial\\", a category also including Ion Petrovici and Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu.Bogdan Cristian Iacob, \\"Avatars of the Romanian Academy and the Historical Front: 1948 versus 1955\\", in Vladimir TismƒÉneanu (ed.), Stalinism Revisited: The Establishment of Communist Regimes in East-Central Europe, p. 262. CEU Press, Budapest, 2009, This opened the way to further attacks in the Communist press, where terms such as \\"fascist\\" and \\"enemy of the people\\" were used to target the linguist.Lazarovici et al., p. 148 In September, Leonora died, reportedly of shock from witnessing the arrival of Soviet occupiers and the deportation of German civilians.Stoian, pp. 420‚Äì21 Deeply affected by this loss,Stoian, p. 420 Sextil remained isolated in Bran. In late December, he suffered a stroke that left him unable to use his right hand and forced him to learn to type with his left.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 413; Stoian, pp. 423‚Äì425 He still found protection from Princess Ileana, who befriended his son Radu. As Ileana recalls in her memoirs, she and surgeon Cornel CƒÉrpini»ôan managed to exaggerate Pu»ôcariu's medical condition, which prevented the authorities from arresting him; CƒÉrpini»ôan also obtained a reprieve from a personal friend, the Communist potentate Ion Gheorghe Maurer.Stoian, pp. 420‚Äì23 During his remaining three years, Pu»ôcariu continued to be active in writing his memoirs and working on the dictionary project.Stoian, pp. 423‚Äì424 In January 1948, as the Romanian royal family prepared to leave the country permanently following the establishment of a Communist regime, he was sent an invitation to leave his residence in Bran and join them in exile. However, he refused, stating he wished to remain in his native country. He had been placed on trial by the new regime but not yet sentenced when he died in Bran on 5 May 1948,NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 470; Stoian, p. 425 of heart failure. Two days later, he was buried in Bra»ôov's Groaveri Cemetery. No special honors were on show, though Lapedatu attended and spoke on behalf of the Academy.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 470; Stoian, p. 425. See also Faiciuc, p. lxxxvi Later that year, Lapdatu was allowed to praising Pu»ôcariu's memory at the Academy's general meeting.Faiciuc, p. lxxxvi The vacant seat was taken up by literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, in May 1948.Boia (2012), p. 264 However, in June, Pu»ôcariu was posthumously stripped of his Academy membership, as part of a larger purge of living anti-communists.Stoian, p. 425 In November, the self-exiled writer Mircea Eliade still eulogized the deceased, noting: \\"Almost all the work done in Romanian philology over the last twenty-five years is thanks to him. He organized the University of Cluj, with its admirable Museum of the Romanian Language; he founded Daco-Romania magazine and strove to establish the Folklore Archive. Sextil Pu»ôcariu believed, as did Lucian Blaga's generation, in a major destiny for Romanian spirituality\\".Faiciuc, p. 118 Legacy For the first two decades after his death, linguists largely avoided using Pu»ôcariu's work in their publications. Dumitru Macrea cited him as early as 1956, followed by Romulus Todoran and, later, Emil Petrovici. Challenging Communist censorship, Petrovici also attempted to obtain for the second volume of Limba rom√¢nƒÉ to be released for print, and earned endorsement from Alexandru Graur and Iorgu Iordan. At the time, the manuscript had been handed back to the Pu»ôcariu family.»òipot, p. 193 Other collaborators, many of them facing their own difficulties with the regime, did not bring up their former mentor; these included Capidan and Lacea, as well as George Giuglea and Silviu Dragomir. In 1959, the latter made oblique references to Pu»ôcariu's treatment of Balkan Romance as a single dialect, highlighting yet again that Aromanian was more distantly related to Romanian.»òipot, pp. 207‚Äì8 Work on the dictionary was moved to Bucharest, while the museum and Dacoromania were disbanded. There was a colloquium held about Pu»ôcariu's life at the Bra»ôov County Museum in 1977, to mark the centenary of his birth. His reputation did not fully revive until after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, with his rehabilitation embodied by an international conference held at Cluj-Napoca in 1998. For the community of Romanians living in exile from the communist regime, Pu»ôcariu served as a symbol of refusal to serve the new authorities, and in this spirit, Alphonse Juilland published a series of Cahiers Sextil Pu»ôcariu in Western Europe and in the United States. Sextil's son Radu (1906‚Äì1978) was a noted surgeon; his wife Maria lived to 1999.Stoian, p. 419 Lia Pu»ôcariu Manoilescu continued to work as a linguist until her death in 1965, as did her daughter by Manoilescu,NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 314; OlƒÉrescu, p. 176 Magdalena Vulpe (1936‚Äì2003).Avram, p. 192 Vulpe, drawing on manuscripts left in the family vault at Bran, published four volumes of his memoirs: CƒÉlare pe douƒÉ veacuri (1968), Bra»ôovul de altƒÉdatƒÉ (1977), Memorii (1978) and Sextil Pu»ôcariu.

Established in 1952, it primarily provided fire and emergency medical services in the central portion of the county surrounding Hillsboro, including the city of North Plains. The District had two fire stations when it was absorbed by Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue in 2017. History The district was established in 1952 as the Hillsboro Rural Fire Protection District. In 1964, the district sued the county to recover $1,281 for fighting a fire at the county's dump, but the district eventually lost at the Oregon Supreme Court. Volunteers built a temporary station in 1966 off Brookwood Avenue on the eastern edge of Hillsboro. In the 1970s the headquarters for the district were in Orenco. By 1973 the name was changed to Washington County Fire District 2. In 1981, the city approved plans for a new fire station off Brookwood, which became the Drake Lane Station that later became part of the Hillsboro Fire Department (HFD). Neighboring Fire District 1 (now Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue) gave WCFD2 a used tanker truck in 1984, and at that time WCFD2 was the largest in the county covering . WCFD2 signed a five-year contract with Hillsboro in July 1987 that moved eight paid fire fighters from the district to the HFD and consolidated operations to where both forces responded to emergencies in both territories. The agreement also called for HFD to relocate an engine company from the city's Parkwood Station to the district's Orenco Station, which it did in July 1988 after annexing Tanasbourne. At that time, the district had four fire stations: North Plains, Orenco, Brookwood, and Midway. The next year WCFD2 considered consolidation with the then new Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue, who maintained the district's equipment. The district sought consolidation, but not a merger, after continuing to lose territory to annexations. Plans started in 1991 to replace the Midway fire station that was built in the 1950s. WCFD2 built the new station directly south of the prior one, building it over four-years to spread the construction costs over several tax years. The district sent firefighters in August 1994 to help fight wildfires around Leavenworth, Washington, along with other firefighters in the county. WCFD2 had only three paid firefighters as of 1995, with 30 volunteers at each of the two stations. In 1997, WCFD2 contracted with the Hillsboro Fire Department for the latter to provide administrative support for the district, which allowed the district to have four paid fire fighters. Those duties include inspections, education, maintenance, and training. In 2002 District 2 hired Dennis England as fire chief, who remained until October 2012. Upon his retirement, the chief of the Hillsboro department again became the acting chief of WCFD2. In February 2015 the board of directors contracted for the services of an Interim Chief, Jim Stearns, who reports to the district's board. Fire station in North Plains opened in 1998 The district opened a new fire station in North Plains in February 1998 on Northwest Commercial Street paid for by a $750,000 bond passed in 1996. At the time the station had just two paid fire fighters along with 30 volunteers. The old station, built about 1951, had been damaged by the Spring Break Quake in 1993. The new station is and can house up to eight apparatus in the four equipment bays. The Midway station handled 497 calls in 2001. In 2002, the district used donations to purchase a thermal-imaging camera. The district was involved in possible merger discussions or coordination in training and purchasing in 2005 with all of the fire departments in the western part of the county. However, none of the departments merged. The district ended its two-year contract with Hillsboro for administrative services in February 2015. On September 1, 2015, a new contract with Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue (TVF&R;) started with that agency taking over administrative functions and talks of a possible annexation of the district into Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue. On November 8, 2016, voters in the district voted to merge into TVF&R;, with the merger completed as of July 1, 2017.  Apparatus and stations Fire station at Midway WCFD2 had two fire stations at the time it merged into TVFR. The main station was located in downtown North Plains, which was Station 17 and included administration for the district. Station 19 was located south of Hillsboro in the unincorporated community of Midway along Oregon Route 219. Organization The district was governed by a five-person board of directors and led by a fire chief. The district stretched from the Multnomah County line on the north all the way to the border with Yamhill County on the south, passing between Cornelius and Hillsboro. It wrapped around Hillsboro with some unincorporated areas on the east side of Hillsboro in the district. Communities in the district were North Plains, Helvetia, parts of Rock Creek and West Union, Laurel, Midway, Farmington, and Scholls.

On the one hand there were the Catholic \\"inner cantons\\" and the Imperial Abbey of Saint Gall, on the other the Protestant cantons of Bern and Z√ºrich as well as the abbatial subjects of Toggenburg. The conflict was simultaneously a religious war, a war for the hegemony within the Confederacy and an uprising of subjects. Im Hof: Ancien R√©gime. 1977, p. 694. The war ended in a Protestant victory and toppled the balance of political power within the Confederacy.  Background  The war was caused by a conflict between the prince-abbot of St Gall, Leodegar B√ºrgisser, and his Protestant subjects in the county of Toggenburg, that had belonged to the Imperial Abbey of St Gall ever since 1460, but was simultaneously connected to the Swiss cantons of Glarus and Schwyz through Landrecht since 1436. After the Reformation, about two thirds of the Toggenburg population had become Protestant, however the Protestants did not comprise the majority in every municipality. After the transaction of sovereignty to the Imperial Abbey, the Reformed inhabitants of Toggenburg were promised by their Swiss allies Z√ºrich and Bern, and also by the prince-abbot, that the principle of equal treatment in religious matters would be respected. Despite this, the abbots of St Gall undertook attempts to recatholicise Toggenburg in the frame of the Counter-Reformation. In all municipalities, including the almost completely Reformed ones, the position of Catholics was strengthened, and new Catholic churches were built in several towns, so that the common usage of parish churches was no longer required. In the 17th century the prince-abbots and their worldly magistrates, the Landeshofmeister, began to organise the abbatial sovereign territories more strictly and subject them to an at least tentatively modern governance in the frame of the absolutist practice of the day. This resulted in conflicts by the infringement of the Protestant clergy by the abbatial authorities. In 1663, for example, the abbatial governor of Toggenburg in Lichtensteig, Wolfgang Friedrich Schorno, tried to pass the death sentence to vicar Jeremias Braun there, because he allegedly committed blasphemy during a Reformed sermon. It was only because of the interference by the Protestant canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden that Braun could be saved ‚Äì but he had to accept his banishment nonetheless. After an intervention of their protector cantons four years later, the Toggenburgers succeeded in having Schorno removed from office by abbot Gallus Alt (r. 1654‚Äì1687). In 1695, in the frame of the Counter-Reformation, the seven Catholic cantons of the Confederacy and the prince-abbot of St Gall formed an alliance for the salvation of Catholicism against the \\"un-Catholic religion\\". To strengthen the connections between the Imperial Abbey and Catholic Central Switzerland, Schwyz proposed to prince-abbot Leodegar B√ºrgisser (r. 1696‚Äì1717) in 1699 to construct a new road over the Ricken Pass, strategically and economically important for the Catholic cantons, between Uznach and Wattwil. This would enable a rapid movement of Catholic troops to Toggenburg and the Princely Lands in case of war. After the settlement of the \\"Cross War\\" with the also Reformed Imperial City of St. Gallen in 1697, prince-abbot B√ºrgisser ordered the municipality of Wattwil to start construction of the road over the Ricken Pass on the Toggenburg side through socage. Out of the refusal of the Wattwilers to collaborate to building the road, which they regarded as a threat to their religious freedom as well as financial suppression, a serious conflict with the prince-abbot arose. The abbot eventually resolved to simply incarcerate the highest Toggenburg magistrate, the Landweibel Josef Germann, to break the opposition. Because Germann was a Catholic, the complaints of the Toggenburgers were heard by the protector cantons, which began acting on behalf of the Toggenburgers. In this situation, Landeshofmeister Fidel von Thurn moved the abbot to seek diplomatic ties within the Holy Roman Empire, concluding a protection treaty with Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg in 1702, and even receiving the investiture as Imperial Prince in 1706. These events threatened to raise the conflict to a European level. Moreover, this constituted a grave breach of the structure and sovereignty of the Confederacy: the Imperial Abbey of St Gall seemed to entirely escape the influence of the Confederacy (of which it was a member since 1451) and enter into the Austrian sphere of influence (while the Swiss had fought for centuries to uphold their independence from the Habsburgers). Especially both Appenzells, but also Z√ºrich, could not accept such a turn of affairs. Besides that, the Princely Lands housed the fourth greatest population within the Confederacy, and was also of essential economic importance to Eastern Switzerland.Im Hof: Ancien R√©gime. (1977) p. 695. The Toggenburgers sought and found allies, mainly in their protector cantons of Schwyz and Glarus, with whom they renewed their Landrecht in 1703 and 1704. Moreover, the Protestant outposts Z√ºrich and Bern were becoming more and more supportive of the Toggenburg cause. In 1707, they presented the prince-abbot with a mediation proposal, in which Toggenburg would be granted far-reaching autonomy, to which however the abbot did not respond. With that a series of events began that eventually amounted to an escalation to war.  Escalation  The bombardment of Wil on 21 May 1712 by Z√ºrcher and Bernese artillery. Samuel Frisching II, general of the Bernese troops at the Second Battle of Villmergen. The first step towards escalation was made by the Toggenburgers, with the approval of Bern and Z√ºrich, by adopting a design for a constitution on 23 March 1707 at a Landsgemeinde at Wattwil, which installed an autonomous governance for Toggenburg while maintaining the sovereignty of the Imperial Abbey of St Gall over it. With it, the Toggenburgers acted upon the example given by Appenzell as a Landsgemeinde democracy. All abbatial magistrates and the governor were extradited and freedom of religion was promulgated, which obviously turned against the interests of the Catholic cantons. Therefore, the Catholic protector canton of Schwyz defected to the camp of the prince-abbot, whereby the conflict now assumed a clearly religious character, and the Confederacy chose sides along its fault lines of faith for either the prince- abbot of St Gall or the Reformed Toggenburgers. Attempts at mediation by Imperial and French envoys to the Confederacy failed, and the Reformed cantons urged to settle the conflict before the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, to diminish the likelihood of a foreign intervention. The struggle reached such a peak that the Toggenburgers armed themselves with the support of Z√ºrich, and occupied the abbatial fortresses at L√ºtisburg, Iberg and Schwarzenbach in 1710. The interfaith strifes were now splitting the Toggenburgers themselves along religious boundaries in the moderate \\"Lime Tree\\" (Linde) and the radical \\"Pine\\" (Harte), so that in 1711, several Catholic municipalities once again subjected themselves to the abbot. The \\"Pines\\" then militarily occupied these municipalities, the abbatial goods and the monasteries of Magdenau and Neu St. Johann ‚Äì with the tacit approval of Bern and Z√ºrich. This incident definitively forced the prince-abbot to take military counteractions, and it also meant an escalation on Confederate level. On 13 April 1712, Bern and Z√ºrich published a manifesto against the prince- abbot of St Gall and thereby revealed their support for the Toggenburgers. On the opposite side, the five Catholic inner cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri, Zug and Unterwalden published a counter-manifesto, and armed themselves for war. Bern and Z√ºrich found support with the city of Geneva and the Principality of Neuch√¢tel as well as its allies in the Prince-Bishopric of Basel: Biel, Moutier and La Neuveville. The five cantons found support with ValaisDuring this period, Valais (known as the Republic of the Seven Tithings) was still a vassal of the Confederacy, not a Swiss canton; therefore one only speaks of \\"five cantons\\" on the Catholic side. It was not until 1815 when Valais became a full member of the new Swiss Confederacy. and in their Vogteien in Ticino as well as in the Freie √Ñmter. The remaining cantons stayed neutral, the Catholic cantons of Fribourg and Solothurn without regard to Bern and France, the Reformed city of St Gallen was surrounded by the abbatial territory, Glarus internally divided. Although the Three Leagues did mobilise in favour of the Protestant cause because of their alliance with Z√ºrich from 1707, they did not participate in any combat actions.  War course  Because Bern and Z√ºrich had been preparing the war for a long time, they seized the offensive. Bern opened the first war phase on 26 April, when its first troops crossed the river Aar at Stilli, to support Z√ºrich with the occupation of Thurgau and the assault on the abbatial lands. In mid-May, about 3000 Z√ºrichers, 2000 Bernese, 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands and first hit upon the abbatial city of Wil, that fell on 22 May after a short siege., \\"Bl√§tter aus der Schweizer Milit√§rgeschichte\\", Schriftenreihe der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft f√ºr Milit√§rhistorische Studienreisen (GMS) Volume 15 (Frauenfeld 1995) p. 158. Huber. . The allies then pushed forward to St. Gallen and occupied the Abbey of Saint Gall and the Vogtei Rheintal. The abbot fled to Neuravensburg, a lordship north of Lake Constance that the abbey had acquired in 1699. The five Catholic cantons did occupy Rapperswil, but initially left the abbot without any support. In concordance with contemporaneous laws of war, the abbey and its goods were put an under a military governance and the chattel and riches were abducted to Bern and Z√ºrich. Plan of the second battle of Villmergen Just like in the First War of Villmergen, the canton of Aargau became the most important stage of combat. The five cantons occupied the cities of Baden, Mellingen and Bremgarten with their strategic fords, thereby threatening to drive a wedge between Z√ºrich and Bern. The Bernese immediately launched a counteroffensive under command of general-major Jean de Sacconay, and already on 22 May, the forces clashed in the county of Baden near Mellingen. The battle went in favour of the Bernese, who subsequently took the city. On 26 May, they were also victorious at the Battle of Fischbach and occupied Bremgarten. United with the Z√ºrcher troops, the Bernese marched towards Baden, that was forced to surrender on 1 June. The fortress of the Catholic city, the Stein, that had been built after the First War of Villmergen despite protests from the Reformed cantons, was immediately destroyed to symbolise the Protestant victory. With that Bern and Z√ºrich had successfully prevented that the five cantons would split them in Aargau. The five cantons then moved towards peace negotiations on 3 June, and on 18 July 1712 Z√ºrich, Bern, Lucerne and Uri signed a treaty in Aarau. This decided that the five cantons would lose their share in the Gemeine Herrschaften of the county of Baden and (partially) the Freie √Ñmter. The second, much bloodier phase of the war was triggered by the Landsgemeinden of Schwyz, Zug and Unterwalden who, after being influenced by the papal nuncio Caraccioli, had rejected the treaty of Aarau. In Lucerne and Uri, too, the people demanded from the government to take up arms once more against the Protestant cantons. On 20 July, the first strike of the forces of the five cantons on the Bernese armed bands occurred at Sins, who then retreated to join the main guard of Bern at Muri (Battle of Sins). On 22 July, the Schwyzer and Zuger troops launched an attack against the Z√ºrcher redoubts at Richterswil and H√ºtten, without success. On 25 July, Villmergen once again became the site of the decisive battle. The 8000 men strong Bernese companies under the command of Samuel Frisching, Niklaus von Diesbach and Jean de Sacconay fought against 12,000 men from Central Switzerland under command of Franz Konrad von Sonnenberg and Ludwig Christian Pfyffer. The lengthy undecided battle was finally determined by the intervention of a fresh corps from Seengen en Lenzburg as well as the superior Bernese artillery. At the conclusion of the battle, the Catholics lost 2,000 killed. After their victory in the Second Battle of Villmergen, the Bernese and Z√ºrichers advanced into the Lucernese territory, the land of Zug, across the Br√ºnig Pass to Unterwalden, and via Rapperswil to the Linthebene, after which the resistance of the five cantons finally collapsed.\\"Villmergerkriege\\", in: Historisch-Biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz. Band 7: Tinguely ‚Äì Zyro. Administration des historisch-biographischen Lexikons der Schweiz (Neuch√¢tel 1934), p. 259f.  Peace of Aarau or \\"Fourth Landfrieden\\"  At the of 11 August 1712, the Fourth Landfrieden in the history of the Confederacy, Bern and Z√ºrich secured their rule over the Gemeine Herrschaften. With this, the since 1531 existing political hegemony of the Catholic cantons in the Gemeine Herrschaften came to an end.\\"Aarauer Friede.\\" In: Historisch-Biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz. Band 1: A ‚Äì Basel. (Neuch√¢tel 1921), p. 8. Administration des historisch-biographischen Lexikons der Schweiz. This simultaneously meant the restoration of a compromised religious peace within the Old Confederacy. The territorial conditions for peace were somewhat sharpened compared to the first peace treaty: * Z√ºrich and Bern together with Glarus maintained their ownership of the county of Baden and the lower Freie √Ñmter, limited by a line between Oberlunkhofen and Fahrwangen. This secured the military connection between Z√ºrich and the Bernese land of Aargau, as well as blocking the Catholic cantons' access to the North. * The lordship of Rapperswil was acquired by Z√ºrich, Bern and Glarus. * The Schwyzer Hurden (in Freienbach) became a Gemeine Herrschaft of Z√ºrich and Bern. * From now on, Bern had co- rule in all Gemeine Herrschaften in which it previously did not have a share: Thurgau, the Vogtei Rheintal, the county of Sargans and the upper Freie √Ñmter. * Inside the Gemeine Herrschaften and Toggenburg, subjects kept their right to exercise both the Catholic and the Protestant religion. Further stretching Z√ºrcher claims to the county of Uznach, H√∂fe (lost in the Old Z√ºrich War) and the Vogtei Gaster were not supported by Bern and the other cantons. Juridically, the Fourth Landfrieden made the Second Landfrieden of Kappel of 1531, confirmed at the Third Landfrieden in 1656, cease to function. Because of this, the Protestant religion was formally treated equally before the law in the Tagsatzung as well as in the governance of the Vogteien, and in all conflicts in which both religions were concerned there was parity from now on. In the Landvogteien Thurgau, Baden, Sargans and Rheintal, the Reformed municipalities now kept the guarantee of their religious exercise under Z√ºrcher sovereignty, while the rights of the Catholics were secured. Instead of mere tolerance, the Protestants now received equal treatment before the law to the traditionally favoured Catholic religion. A \\"Landfriedliche Kommission\\", composed of representatives from Z√ºrich, Bern, Lucerne en Uri, would now keep oversight in matters of religion.Im Hof: Ancien R√©gime. (1977) p. 699. The prince-abbot of Saint Gall, Leodegar B√ºrgisser, went into exile with his convent on 29 May to Neuravensburg Castle, the residence of a new lordship of St Gall north of Lindau. Z√ºrich and Bern occupied the Princely Lands and governed it together. A large part of the monastic movable goods that were left behind in St. Gallen, including parts of the archive of and the library, were taken away by them. Because of the in his eyes outrageous damaging of the rights of the Imperial Abbey and the danger posed to the Catholic religion in Toggenburg, abbot B√ºrgisser obtained the Peace of Rohrschach, that was finally approved on 28 March 1714 after a series of negotiations with Z√ºrich and Bern. After the death of prince-abbot B√ºrgisser, a new treaty, the Peace of Baden, was concluded with his successor Joseph von Rudolphi (r. 1717‚Äì1740) on 16 June 1718. The Imperial Abbey of St Gall was restored, including its rule over Toggenburg, while its autonomy and freedom of religion were confirmed. Z√ºrich and Bern ratified the Peace on 11 August 1718. The fact that pope Clement XI would denounce the peace in a letter shortly after, no longer had any effect on the settlement of the conflict. Abbot von Rudolphi returned to the monastery of St Gall on 7 September 1718 after a six-year exile. On 23 March 1719, he was able to retrieve a large part of the library that was abducted to Z√ºrich at the start of the war. Further objects from the Bernese spoils of war were returned to St. Gallen in 1721. Despite this, several valuable pieces of the monastic library of St Gall remained in Z√ºrich, including manuscripts, paintings, astronomy tools and the Globe of St Gall. The cultural goods conflict (Kulturg√ºterstreit) between Z√ºrich and St. Gallen, that resurged in the 1990s, was finally settled amicably in 2006. The animosity between the Imperial Abbey and Toggenburg increased further until the abolishment of the monastic state in 1798, after two abbatial magistrates were murdered in 1735 and a 1739 conference in Frauenfeld between the parties also did not yield any results.

It is today part of the Tower City Center mixed-use complex. History =Site= A place of lodging has occupied the site since 1815, when Phinney Mowrey opened Mowrey's Tavern. Donald MacIntosh purchased the tavern in 1820 and operated it as the Cleveland House and later the City Hotel until it was destroyed by fire in 1845. In 1848, it was rebuilt as the Dunham House, which was enlarged in 1852 and renamed the Forest City House. That structure was demolished in 1916 to make way for the current hotel. =Hotel Cleveland= Renaissance Cleveland Hotel, right, connected to Terminal Tower The 1000-room Hotel Cleveland was built at a cost of $4.5 million and opened on December 16, 1918. Charles Lindbergh spoke in a ballroom at the hotel in 1927, three months after completing his solo Trans-Atlantic flight. The Van Sweringen brothers purchased the hotel in the 1920s and built the Cleveland Union Terminal complex, completed in 1930, around it. Eliot Ness and his wife Evaline frequently danced in the hotel's famous Bronze Room during his time in Cleveland. Ness also questioned Francis Sweeney, a suspect in the Torso murders, in one of the hotel's rooms for over a week in 1938. The following year, in 1939, he held a meeting of local factory owners in the hotel's Empire Room, attempting to start a network of informants among their employees, to catch potential saboteurs. The local CIO head feared it was a union-busting ploy and asked J. Edgar Hoover to intervene. Hoover sided with the CIO and remained at odds with Ness through the remainder of his career. President Harry S. Truman and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt were both guests at the hotel in the 1940s. =Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel= Sheraton Hotels acquired the Hotel Cleveland in 1958 and rechristened it the Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a series of speeches at the Sheraton on November 4, 1960, before giving a major speech in the adjacent Public Square. In 1961, Sheraton converted the Bronze Room to the Kon Tiki Restaurant. The restaurant has since been closed and the space has been converted to offices. In 1962, Sheraton spent $5.2 million renovating the hotel and adding an enormous adjacent convention wing structure containing a three-story, 500-space parking garage, topped by a 12,000 sq ft exhibition hall and a new grand ballroom accommodating 4000 people. A historic meeting between leaders of Cleveland's white and black communities occurred at the Sheraton on April 19, 1964, following the death of Civil Rights protester Rev. Bruce W. Klunder twelve days earlier. The Beatles stayed at the Sheraton on September 14, 1964, before performing at the Public Auditorium the next day. Police established a cordon around the Sheraton to protect the group from mobs of fans, who surrounded the hotel. On March 23, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. attended a Nobel Peace Prize dinner in his honor at the Sheraton, briefly leaving the Selma to Montgomery marches to be at the event. The Beatles returned in 1966, when they performed at Cleveland Stadium on August 14 and gave a press conference in the Sheraton's Empire Room that day. Duke Ellington gave a concert in the Sheraton Ballroom of the hotel on September 28, 1972. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 as part of the Terminal complex. President Gerald Ford visited the hotel on June 6, 1976 and gave a series of speeches and attended multiple receptions. =Restoration and today= In 1977, Sheraton sold the hotel, which now had only 800 rooms, to Save-the-Square, Inc. for $18 million. The group of investors, headed by Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell and also including Cleveland Indians owner Steve O'Neill, rescued the hotel from receivership and paid its debts. The group hired Biltmore Construction to fully renovate the aging hotel, enclosing the rear courtyard as a glass-roofed atrium, with a pool that had to be lowered into place by a huge crane. It reopened in 1978, managed by Stouffer Hotels, as Stouffer's Inn on the Square. Ronald Reagan visited the hotel on October 29, 1980, prior to participating in a presidential debate against Jimmy Carter at Public Auditorium. Boxer Larry Holmes fought a series of exhibition bouts in the hotel's Grand Ballroom on April 9, 1982. Cast and crew of the classic 1983 film A Christmas Story stayed at the hotel while filming in the adjacent Higbee's department store. In 1985, Stouffer began a $37 million, five-year renovation, throughout which the hotel remained open. The renovation reduced the number of rooms to 500 and modernized the fire safety systems with sprinklers, smoke detectors and alarms. In December 1986, the hotel was renamed Stouffer Tower City Plaza to match the renovated train station and its shopping mall. Renaissance Hotels purchased Stouffer Hotels in 1993, and the hotel became the Stouffer Renaissance Cleveland Hotel. Finally, in 1996, it gained its current name, Renaissance Cleveland Hotel.

It is Kayo Dot's longest album and its first double album, and contains aspects of black metal, post-rock, jazz fusion, and chamber music.Hubardo Band Camp It was picked as the 4th best album of 2013 on indie music website SputnikMusic.SputnikMusic Staff's Top 50 Albums of 2013 Hubardo was co- produced by Driver and longtime producer Randall Dunn.

After leaving Hydra Head Records and releasing Gamma Knife independently, Driver crowdfunded the album entirely through pre-orders on independent music website Bandcamp. Shortly after the release of the album, Driver announced that he was in the process of producing a triple LP \\"super limited black vinyl\\" that was limited to 200 pressings which contained a 40-page book detailing the concept behind the album entitled \\"The Sword of Satan\\" written by Jason Byron.Hubardo Band Camp Writing and recording After leaving Hydra Head, Driver felt that \\"labels were not interested in what I was doing\\". He said that the return to the more metal-based sound of early Kayo Dot albums was sparked prior to the making of Gamma Knife because he felt frustrated with \\"bland, unthoughtful, weak metal coming out and receiving acclaim.\\"Lurker Kayo Dot Hubardo Interview The budgets for Stained Glass and Gamma Knife were minuscule, thus limiting the scope in which those projects could be conceived; however, with Hubardo, the group had a set budget that was considerably larger, allowing the band to create an album on a grander scale. Additionally, Driver was able to dedicate his time to writing the album due to a lack of day job. Due to increased repetition and an aspect of catchiness, guitarist Ron Varod characterized the album as \\"pop\\".GearGods Interview With Ron Varod The album was recorded at Randall Dunn's studio in Seattle, Washington after receiving a sizeable amount of funding from their crowdfunding attempt via the group's Bandcamp page. This reportedly allowed the group much more flexibility to undertake such a large project. Unlike past albums, the entire live band performed on the record, including guitarist Ron Varod played lead guitar on the album. Driver plays the bass guitar on the album, as well as synthesizers, piano, and organ. Shortly after the release of the album, longtime collaborator Mia Matsumiya and Terran Olson moved and are no longer a part of the band's live incarnation. No word has been given if they will return to future Kayo Dot releases.GearGods Interview With Ron Varod Music and lyrics Driver continued to collaborate on the lyrics with Jason Byron on the album, the lyrics and concept a collaboration between the two. The lyrics reportedly came first, and the composition of the album was much more in line with how maudlin of the Well songs were composed. He decided to make the album without worrying whether the music would be perceived as \\"avant-garde\\". The album, marking the tenth anniversary of the band's formation, draws inspiration from aspects of all of Kayo Dot's various sounds over the past decade, as well as from predecessor group maudlin of the Well.Hubardo Band Camp \\"Hubardo\\" means \\"lantern\\" or \\"lamp\\" in the mystical language of Enochian.Hubardo Band Camp The album, more metallic in style while still maintaining the wide orchestration Kayo Dot is known for, grew out of a dislike of critically respected metal, according to Toby Driver. The album features a very wide list of collaborators, unlike recent albums which were mostly written and performed by Driver and a few people. Release and reception =Release= Despite attempting to use Kickstarter, the group was left with low finances after leaving Hydra Head, and Driver considered ending the project. In early 2013, however, Kayo Dot offered preorders on a new album to finance the album's recording and publishing; the effort was successful, giving the band the ability to go into the studio with a set budget. Those who pre-ordered received the album digitally on August 31, 2013. Shortly after the initial digital release, the group announced that they would be releasing a limited 3-LP set with artwork by Rachel Wolf and the book \\"The Sword of Satan\\" by Jason Byron.

Background David Carroll (D.C.) Churchill (1873 ‚Äì 1969) and Eleanor Franzen Churchill (1888 ‚Äì 1981) started Churchill Weavers in part to bring employment opportunity to Appalachian women and men. They previously were not entrepreneurs, but they had a thorough understanding of weaving from both an engineer's and a weaver's viewpoint. They brought to their work the combined skills of mechanical engineering, design, marketing and business management.Photograph of David Carroll Churchill and his wife, Eleanor Franzen Churchill, 1953 Work in India D.C., a native of Oberlin, Ohio, studied engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated at the top of his class before going to India as a missionary. There, he worked as an industrial engineer with the Marathi Mission, which was affiliated with the Congregational Church. Eleanor, the daughter of a Lutheran minister, was a native of Connecticut and a Wellesley College graduate. She was teaching in India at the Clarke-Abbott School and Home for Indian Boys when she and D.C. met. In 1914, two years after D.C.'s first wife died, she and D.C. married. In the early part of the 20th century, handweaving was the second-largest industry in India but individual weavers found it difficult to compete with mechanized textile companies. D.C. studied the home weaving industry and developed a new type of fly-shuttle loom that allowed weavers to produce twice as much cloth as they could produce using their old looms. By 1911, his subsequent modifications allowed 36 people to do the work that it previously had taken 200 to accomplish and allowed them to compete in the mechanized marketplace. The British government in India twice gave D.C. a grant to study hand-weaving methods worldwide while en route to and from the United States. The first time was when he returned home for a one-year furlough in 1910; the second time was in 1917 when he and Eleanor decided that it was impractical to stay in India because of World War I. While the British government expected D.C. to return and use what he had learned in India, circumstances prevented that and the family remained in the United States. Start of Churchill Weavers When they returned to the United States in 1917, the Churchills settled in Oberlin, Ohio. D.C. worked at Garford Manufacturing Co. and aided the war effort by developing the first practical retractable airplane landing gear for the U.S. Army ‚Äî one of several inventions he had that were not associated with weaving. The family moved to Berea, Kentucky, in 1920 when D.C.'s longtime friend William J. Hutchins, president of Berea College, invited him to teach physics there. At the same time, D.C. planned to develop his own business designing and selling looms for handweavers. The arrangement with Berea College lasted only two years. In 1922, D.C. left the college ‚Äî in part because it would not fund an engineering department ‚Äî and also because policy changes would not allow him to work part-time on his own business. The Churchills decided to stay in Berea and start their own company to produce handwoven goods. D.C. brought to the company his engineering and business skills. He evaluated the production process for efficiency, made fly-shuttle looms and worked to perfect new devices to minimize the physical strain on workers while maximizing output throughout the business. Eleanor brought firsthand weaving experience, a designer's eye, marketing and business management skills. =Innovation= Christine Akers weaving at a handloom at Churchill Weavers, 1977From the beginning, \\"most aspects of Churchill Weavers ‚Ä¶ set them apart from the rest of the mountain weaving ventures‚Ä¶.\\" Unlike other mountain weaving enterprises Churchill Weavers employed both women and men and by the late 1940s provided jobs to as many as 150 people. Women tended to dominate other handweaving operations. D.C.'s efficiency analysis led Churchill Weavers to organize its process so that workers came into a central location with departmentalized tasks; in other mountain areas, one weaver carried out all aspects of making the item and worked alone in her home. Churchill Weavers made an array of items, from baby blankets and couch throws ‚Äî its signature pieces ‚Äî to clothing. Other mountain weavers generally produced only placemats and finger towels. Under Eleanor's marketing direction, Churchill Weavers made for itself a national and urban market in such places as New York, Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles before there was a market in those areas for hand-woven goods. Eleanor used such techniques as in-store demonstrations and professional models in the company catalogs. =Products= Besides clothing, throws and baby blankets, Churchill Weavers also created special-use fabric on commission. Among those commissions: B.F. Goodrich commissioned Churchill Weavers to produce fabric for space flight in 1960. The company made 50 yards of anti-thermal fabric to be considered for use in coveralls for Mercury Mission astronauts to wear over a pressurized high altitude suit. For nearly a decade in the 1970s and 1980s, internationally known fiber artist Gerhardt Knodel commissioned Churchill Weavers to produce fabric for several textile installations, including \\"Free Fall\\" at Detroit's Renaissance Center; \\"Sky Ribbon: An Oklahoma Tribute\\" (1978) at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Oklahoma City (destroyed in 1995 by a bomb blast) and \\"Grand Exchange\\" (1981) at Cincinnati Bell. Advertisement showing a red Churchill Weavers throw draped over a chair and ottoman, ca. 1995Churchill Weavers operated under the Churchill family for more than half a century. In 1973, Eleanor, then a widow of four years, asked Lila and Richard Bellando to take over its operation. Richard was the sole employee for the Kentucky Guild of Artists and Craftsmen and organized its fair. Lila was an educator who had studied art at Berea College. The Bellandos operated Churchill Weavers as a family business until 1996 when they sold the company to Crown Craft in Georgia. Their reasons for selling were \\"to bring additional resources for production, corporate expertise in business matters, and better benefits for employees.\\" Lila continued to manage the business for another 11 years. Churchill Weavers continues to produce its distinctive handwoven items and has done so since its sale to an Indiana entity in 2007. It never ceased production. Historic recognition In 2007, the Kentucky Historical Society acquired the Churchill Weavers' archive with funding from the KHS Foundation and donor Joan Cralle Day, a Kentucky philanthropist and activist. The collection is a nearly complete representation of every Churchill Weavers product and weave pattern, with a fabric archive that contains more than 30,000 textiles. The collection also contains warping cards, design books and construction notes dating to the 1920s; sales brochures and catalogs; business records and correspondence; original photographs; vintage advertising signs; two antique looms that D.C. designed and built; scrapbooks containing the company's history; and other items. In January 2014, the Churchill Weavers building in Berea was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its significant place in the local Arts and Crafts movement and because of its connection to David Carroll Churchill.National Park Service.

Within his brief career, which spanned from 1847 to his death in 1851, Ames created a series of at least nineteen unique, three-dimensional portraits of family members, neighbors, friends and on at least one occasion, national political figures. Ames's work received acclaim during his own lifetime, culminating in the presentation of a silver medal for his work at the New York State Fair in 1848. His carvings - which primarily depict children and young adults - are held in the collections of a number of prominent American art institutions, including the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, American Folk Art Museum, Boulder History Museum, Huntington Museum of Art, New York State Historical Association and Wadsworth Atheneum.  Life  Asa Ames was born on December 28, 1823, in Evans, Erie County, New York, some twenty miles south of Buffalo. His parents, John Ames (1791 ‚Äì 1830) and Susan Gates Ames (1790 - 1865), had recently moved there from Worcester County, Massachusetts, probably in anticipation of the greater economic opportunity to come with the opening of the Erie Canal, which followed in 1825. After the death of John Ames in 1830, when Asa was seven, his mother remarried in 1842, to Elias Babcock, but was to be widowed a second time two years later. Asa was the fourth of five children, with his siblings and their families playing an important part in his career; at least four of Ames's known oeuvre of nineteen (previously fourteen, see the new additions below under list of known works) works portray family members. Others portray neighbors in Evans, some of whom Ames lived with for a time. His work as a sculptor is therefore deeply rooted in his kinship network and local community, which was in tension with other aspects of his career which point to the rising tide of modernity, notably his interest in phrenology. Ames died on August 4, 1851, possibly of tuberculosis, with his tombstone giving his final age as \\"27 years, 7 months, and 7 days.\\" His name would not be recovered by art historians until 1977, when Jack T. Ericson discovered it in the 1850 federal census for Evans, New York; publication followed five years later in 1982, establishing the basis for subsequent scholarship. Since then Asa Ames has assumed an eminent place in the history of American art as a leading folk sculptor of the 19th century. Ames's short life is sparely documented. The dates of his birth and death are known by his tombstone, other details (including his occupation, described as \\"sculpturing\\") in the federal census of 1850, with the gaps in the record skillfully reconstructed by art historians on the basis of nineteen works (signed and unsigned, the latter attributions grounded on style and provenance) and the web of connections they have revealed. Additionally, descendants of Asa Ames have proved helpful to historians by making accessible family records, which show that Ames was married to a woman named Emma Hurd (1830 ‚Äì 1893) of the Marvin household, where Ames was a resident at the time of the 1850 census shortly before his death. Even more significantly, the Ames family has helped identify subjects of the sculptors' portraits.  \\"Sculpturing\\"  Despite the fact that little is known about the Ames's artistic formation, his skill \\"suggests that he served an apprenticeship\\" during his youth, \\"although it is not clear in what profession.\\"Stacy C. Hollander, \\"Asa Ames: Occupation Sculpturing.\\" New York: American Folk Art Museum, 2008, 2 Ames's medium of wood distinguished him from his contemporaries. In the nineteenth century, painting was understood as the common medium for portraiture. In contrast, woodcarving was employed in the more humble production of advertising figures and ship carving. Ames's distinctiveness lies in his ability to construct such emotionally commanding portraiture out of this vernacular medium. Scholars have debated whether Ames‚Äô work should be understood as a direct descendant of the ship carving genre, or rather, as part of the classical tradition of sculpture. Typical ship carving of figureheads have a forward thrust, which is absent from Ames‚Äô work. Additionally, with the exception of one piece, Ames's works have ‚Äúno flowing neoclassical draperies‚Äù ‚Äì another characteristic of the ship carving tradition.Stacy C. Hollander, ‚ÄúAsa Ames: New Discoveries,‚Äù The Magazine Antiques, vol. 174, no. 2 (August 2008) To some extent, Ames's self-described occupation of ‚Äúsculpturing‚Äù in the United States census of 1850 offers a glimpse into the artist's self-perception. Despite the fact that ‚Äúsculpturing‚Äù was usually reserved to describe works of stone or metal, Ames employed it freely in the census. He professed his work to be one of artistic merit.  Portraits  Ames dedicated most of his career to carving likenesses of his relatives and friends. His portraits reveal an attentive eye to the particular ‚Äì to the individual characteristics of each of his subjects, which he portrayed in a straightforward fashion. Characteristic of Ames‚Äô portraits are ‚Äúbroad foreheads and uncompromising eyes,‚Äù which Ames ‚Äúcarved deeply under heavy brows, the eyelashes painted as a series of dots.‚ÄùStacy C. Hollander, ‚ÄúAsa Ames and the Art of Phrenology,‚Äù The Clarion, vol. 15, no. 3 (summer 1989), 32 In 1847 Ames carved frontal busts of his sister's three children: Millard F., Maria, and Adelaide. Afterwards, while living with Dr. Thomas Armstrong later that year, he set out to carve a likeness of Dr. Thomas Armstrong‚Äô daughter ‚Äì Amanda Clayanna. What resulted is a standing figure of the young girl, ‚Äúleaning against a draped tablet in slight contrapposto.‚Äù From 1847 to 1851, Ames carved three portraits of adults ‚Äì two men and one woman. Scholars have recently suggested that this series of portraits may represent portraits of Ames‚Äô two brothers and sister. In 1849 Ames crafted two carvings of children ‚Äì a full-figured statue of a young girl and a Naked Child. The young girl has been identified as Susan Ames, the daughter of Ames's brother, Henry. Naked Child probably represents a likeness of the son of Dr. Harvey B. Marvin ‚Äì LaRay Marvin. At the time this sculpture was carved, Ames was living with the family; young LaRay was seven months old. The work Seated Female Figure with Lamb and Cup was the last carving to be dated by Ames in April 1850 - a little more than a year before his death. Widely understood as a memorial to two young sisters, Sarah Reliance and Ann Augusta Ayer, Ames inscribed in wood their death from cholera in 1849, at the ages of three and one, respectively.  Phrenological Head  Ames's 1850 phreonological bust, currently in the American Folk Art Museum's collection, is perhaps the artist's most unusual work. Since its introduction at the Brooklyn Museum's 1948 exhibition ‚ÄúPopular Art in America,‚Äù the bust has testified both to the profound impact of phrenology on the 19th-century American psyche and to Ames's increasingly sophisticated craft. At the height of its influence, phrenology had become a visible practice of both urban and rural landscapes. Individual operators, inspired by the commercial success of the Fowler brothers, offered \\"phrenological observations\\" to the public. This increase in interest brought about the distribution of phrenological tools; plaster casts, measuring devices, charts, and to some extent, modeled phrenological heads, became increasingly common. While it is not known why exactly Ames's carved this phrenological study, some have suggested that Dr. Marvin, the physician that Ames was living with at the time, fostered his interest in \\"alternative\\" medicine. Marvin, who explored remedies such as hydrotherapy and magnet therapy, perhaps inspired Ames's study of phrenology. Additionally, given the fact that Ames soon fell ill to tuberculosis, he might have been seeking treatment from Dr. Marvin.Stacy C. Hollander, \\"Asa Ames,\\" Folk Art, vol. 30, no. 2 (Summer 2005), 55  Modern Exhibitions  Ames's sculptures made their debut at the Newark Museum's 1931 exhibition \\"American Folk Sculptures: The Work of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Craftsmen.\\" However, the exhibit incorrectly identified their creator to be Alexander Ames, not Asa Ames.Jack T. Ericson,‚ÄúAsa Ames, sculptor.\\" The Magazine Antiques, vol. 122, no. 3 (September 1982): 522 Asa Ames finally earned his own solo exhibition in 2008. From April to September, The American Folk Art Museum launched the show \\"Asa Ames: Occupational Sculpturing.\\" The exhibition featured eight of his works, as well as a newly discovered daguerreotype of the artist.Roberta Smith, \\"Filling in the Contours of a Surprising Golden Age,\\" The New York Times, April 25, 2008  Daguerreotype  The daguerreotype found in the collection of the Ames family is singularly exceptional in that it shows the sculptor surrounded by several of his creations while working on another.Stacy C. Hollander, \\"Asa Ames: Occupation Sculpturing,\\" 14 Asa Ames is seated at the left, working on a new bust located between his legs (now believed, based on studies of its profile and of Ames's own image, to be his self portrait held in the collection of the Huntington Museum of Art) while behind him at center is the top of a viola and four additional sculptural works on display. They include his sculpture of a naked child (here draped and holding an object in its right hand), his study of a hand holding a book and two portrait busts, one depicting a young boy and the other a young girl. In the lower right foreground is the mysterious image of another young man, perhaps a member of the Ames family. The purpose of staging such an elaborate image is open to interpretation.http://www.luminous-lint.com/app/image/51155607047195107279/ However, it seems likely that it was created at some point not long after Ames received his silver medal in 1848 as a promotional image or device. Due to its small size, Fleming believes it may have been prominently displayed to potential clients when Ames traveled to their homes to propose creating a sculpture for them as a way to show the quality and types of work he was capable of creating.Geoffrey K. Fleming Research, notes in author's files, Huntington, West Virginia This may be especially true as unlike many of his contemporaries, Ames was not known to have maintained a fixed studio space and is often reported as residing with his clients during the creation of their commissions.That Ames resided with several of his clients while working on their sculptures is mentioned several times; for more on this see the notes on individual sculptures in the 'List of Known Works' section.  List of Known Works  Currently, there are nineteen works (eighteen portrait figures, one doll) known to have been made by Asa Ames during his very short career. While most examples are held in public and private collections, the location of several works remain unknown at present. Of these, nearly all were exhibited at some point either during the artist's lifetime or during the early part of the 20th century. Only one work is known to have been destroyed since its creation. *Bust Portrait of Millard F. Dewey - January 1847 - currently held in a private collection, 2008. Millard F. Dewey (b. 1845) was the artist's nephew. Inscription: \\"Jan. 1847/ A. Ames.\\" Discovered in 1978 in the garage attic of a descendant of Millard Dewey. Illustrated in Jack T. Ericson's \\"Asa Ames: Sculptor\\" in the magazine Antiques (September 1982). *Full-Length Portrait of General Zachary Taylor - spring/summer 1847 - present location unknown. Geoffrey K. Fleming, Executive Director of the Huntington Museum of Art, where Ames's probable self portrait is held, recently (2020) discovered an nineteenth work documented in an article in the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser (Sept 1, 1847) which announced the exhibition of a full length carved figure of General Taylor (1784 - 1850) which was placed on display in the autumn of 1847 at the Buffalo, New York Merchant's Exchange. The Exchange was completed in 1844 by Russell H. Heywood and was located near the docks at the Buffalo waterfront. The paper noted that it was by Asa Ames of \\"Evans, in this county\\" and further noted Ames had only been carving for six months (slightly off based on the month and date of the Millard Dewey bust). The paper further remarked that \\"Under such circumstances this is a very creditable specimen.‚Äù The display of the bust in that location, in such proximity to the docks, lends credence to the idea that Ames may have initially studied with a ship or figurehead carver. It was for the creation of the sculpture of Taylor, and one of a little girl (possibly for one of his figures depicting Maria or Adelaide Dewey or Amanda Armstrong), that Ames was awarded a silver medal at the New York State Fair in September 1848, as reported again in the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser (Sept 11, 1848): To ‚ÄúA. Ames, Evans, Erie co., for a full length likeness of Gen. Taylor, and the figure of a little girl, as specimens of wood carving executed by a lad with a knife, that showed extraordinary and early talent and perseverance. sil. med.\\"Geoffrey K.

This is almost certainly a self-portrait by Ames (based upon comparisons between the profiles of it, the bust carving depicted in the recently discovered daguerreotype and the image of Ames himself) or far less likely, a portrait of John Trowbridge Ames (1819 - 1902), the artist's brother. The daguerreotype was commented upon in 2015 at luminous-lint.com, a website devoted to 'Photography: History, Evolution and Analysis,' where the site noted: \\"Ames is shown sitting at the far left with a block of wood held between his knees. He is sculpting with a mallet and chisel, and a face is just beginning to emerge from the surrounding wood, a face eerily like his own: the artist carving a self-portrait.\\"http://www.luminous-lint.com The addition of the doubly elaborate drapery and two tied bows surrounding its base along with its delicately carved and painted features, indicates this particular bust, more than others, was meant to be a showpiece, conveying the artist's technical abilities. Like the daguerreotype, the bust's rather diminutive size (just over 14 inches tall), meant that it, too, could have been brought to the homes of prospective clients to see in person.Geoffrey K. Fleming Research The unique circular, hollowed out space at the front of the sculpture, which may have been designed to hold the silver medal awarded to Ames at the New York State Fair in 1848, would have further impressed the artist's stature upon his potential clientele. The Huntington Museum acquired the carving in 1977 from Gene Harris Antiques Auction Center, located in Marshalltown, Iowa, not far from the town of Traer, Iowa, where John T. Ames, his family and Asa's widow, Emma, resided and were eventually buried (Buckingham Cemetery).Geoffrey K. Fleming Research; Huntington Museum of Art Research Files, Huntington, West Virginia.

It is native to the Caribbean Sea and the Central Indo-Pacific. Description The medusa of Tripedalia cystophora is about in diameter. Its boxy dome-shaped bell has a flattened top and is slightly wider than it is high. From a single point on each of the four corners of the bell arise three tentacles, each on a pedalium or stalk. The outer surface of the bell is granulated with small wart-like structures armed with nematocysts. About a quarter way up the bell are four rhopalia, cylindrical structures containing light-sensitive cells. About half way up the bell, the four flattened gonads can be seen on the inside of the bell. The underside of the bell is partially constricted by a velarium, a horizontal ring of tissue, and in the centre is a manubrium, a tube-like structure which hangs down with the mouth at its tip. This box jellyfish is a translucent yellowish-brown colour. Distribution and habitat The World Register of Marine Species lists the Caribbean Sea and the Central Indo-Pacific as habitats, but marks them as unreviewed. Colonies of Tripedalia cystophora are found off the north coast of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. One colony in Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean Sea, was found inhabiting the margins of mangrove lagoons. Biology Box jellyfish swim by expanding and contracting their bells vigorously. During the day Tripedalia cystophora is mostly to be found within of the surface, in sunlit positions among the prop roots of mangroves. These warm sunlit areas are where its main food item, the copepod Dioithona oculata, are to be found during the day. Dense swarms of these copepods form in the illuminated patches of water where shafts of sunlight shine through the mangrove canopy. Tripedalia cystophora forages by allowing itself to sink slowly towards the bottom with its tentacles spread out around it to snare its prey. Box jellyfish have complex visual systems. Each of the four rhopalia on the bell of Tripedalia cystophora consists of a group of six eyes of four morphological types. The uppermost and the lowest eye each contains a lens, and there are also a pair of slit eyes and a pair of pit eyes. It has been found that Tripedalia cystophora displays complex behaviours such as the avoidance of obstacles and fast swimming in a particular direction and is able to maintain its position in the shaft of sunlit water presumably by using visual cues. The presence or absence of the copepod prey or the quantity present does not seem to affect its turning behaviour or swimming speed but by remaining in the sunlit water it maximises the number of copepods on which it can feed. It can detect a cylindrical object such as a root when it gets close enough to it and can then swerve sharply to one side to avoid it. At night Tripedalia cystophora moves away from the mangroves a few metres further into the shallow lagoon and sinks to the bottom. It is not clear whether it settles on the bed of the lagoon or whether it swims slowly about among the seagrasses and green algae. This is because when an investigator shines a light to observe it, it reacts by rising towards the surface. Each individual medusa of Tripedalia cystophora is gonochoristic (either male or female) and produces gametes. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a planula larva which is brooded by the female inside the bell. It is later expelled and settles to the bottom where it undergoes metamorphosis into a polyp about long with four, knob- tipped tentacles surrounding a mouth. This may produce further polyps by budding and these creep across the substrate before attaching themselves.

Here the grape is usually blended with Avan√†, Neretta Cuneese and other local red Piemontese varieties.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 69-70 Allen Lane 2012 History The Val Chisone region where Avarengo has a had a long history of production. Ampelographers believe that the name Avarengo is derived from the Latin avaro, which means \\"stingy\\" and is likely a reference to the vine's propensity to produce very low yields, even among young vines. The grape has had a long history growing in the Val Chisone region of the Cottian Alps and around the commune of Pomaretto in the Valle Germanasca with ampelographers believing that Avarengo likely originated somewhere between these areas. Evidence for a Piemontese origin of Avarengo was further bolstered in the early 21st century when DNA analysis revealed a parent-offspring relationship with the old Piedmont wine and table grape, Grisa nera. Additional DNA research in 2011 suggest that Avarengo may also be closely related to the northern Piedmont grape variety Ner d'Ala. Viticulture Avarengo is a mid-ripening grapevine that is noted for producing very low harvest yields. Wine regions Today, Avarengo is still grown in the Pinerolese region (pictured) of Piedmont. Over the past century, plantings of Avarengo have steadily decreased as the grape's reputation of being a low yielding variety has encouraged growers to move on to other varieties. In 2000, there were of the vine in production, most of it in the Pinerolese region between the commune of Pomaretto and the villages along the Chisone river valley in the province of Turin. In the red wine only DOC of Pinerolese located in the provinces of Cuneo and Turin, Avarengo grapes destined for DOC wine production must be limited to a harvest yield of 10 tonnes/hectare with the finished wines needing to attain minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5%. Wines labeled as just Pinerolese must contain a minimum of 50% of Barbera, Bonarda Piemontese, Nebbiolo and Neretta Cuneese with Avarengo and other local red Piemontese varieties permitted to fill in the remainder of the blend. For Pinerolese Ramie, Avarengo must make up a minimum of 15% of the blend with Avan√† and Neretta Cuneese required to make up an additional minimum of 30% and 20% of the blend, respectively, with other red wine grapes permitted to account up to a maximum of 35%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 191 & 212 Firefly Books 2004 Styles Within the Pinerolese DOC, Avarengo can be blended with Nebbiolo (pictured). According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, as a varietal, Avarengo tends to produce pale-colored, light red wines that are highly aromatic with easy drinking, fresh fruit flavors. Synonyms Over the years, Avarengo has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Amarene, Avarena, Avarenc, Avarene, Avarengo Comune, Avarengo Comune nero, Avarengo di Piemonte, Avarengo Fino, Avarengo Grosso, Avarengo Mezzano, Avarengo Piccolo, Avarengo Rama-Bessa, Avarengo Ramabessa, Avarengo Ramafessa, Boffera, Croassera, Mostera Ivrea, Mostera nera, Mosterce, Mostero, Mostero rosso, Mosto, Mostona, Mostosa, Mostoson, Must√®r (in the Canavese region), Muster, Riondasca, Riondosca, Riundasca (in the province of Biella) and Rondasca.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Avarengo Accessed: March 26th, 2014 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Avarengo"},{"id":"42318433","text":"Paul-J√ºrgen Weber (born 1942) is a Cologne, Germany-based visual artist and photographer. Life and intention Born in Cologne, Germany, Weber started in 1968 his artwork initially with paintings and assemblage sculptures. Since the 1980s he attended primarily to photographic artwork, which bases upon the world's visible reality as it is. His particular feature is to discover, select and process the intrinsic essence from the huge diversity and variety of existing forms and substances to be converted into creative artwork. Only a different view on even well known items is able yet to provoke this specific quality. Wilfried Wiegand calls that the 'detected' beauty, which has been already existing but has to be reminded again. Weber feels particular photographic reference to Ansel Adams, Harald Mante plus Bernd and Hilla Becher.

Early life and career  Born in the Canary Islands in 1754, Sim√≥n de Herrera started his military career at the early age of nine, joining the Guimar Militia as sub-lieutenant on September 12, 1763. On August 2, 1769, at the age of 15, he had already reached the rank of captain of militia. In 1776, he served in South American ventures capturing Portuguese (now Brazilian) towns and ports.Harris Gaylord Warren and Jack D. L.

In 1782, he fought under the command of Bernardo de G√°lvez at Gu√°rico, Venezuela, and became acquainted with George Washington. He performed military services from 1788 to 1794 in Colotl√°n and Guadalajara, in Nueva Galicia, and afterwards took on a military leadership role in Nuevo Le√≥n.

He occupied Bayou Pierre in resistance to foreseen American aggression by General James Wilkinson. In November 1806, Herrera and Wilkinson settled on the Neutral Ground agreement (which was honored until the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819).Edmonson, p. 31. After 1806 Herrera devoted his time in improving the defenses of Texas. During the rebellion led by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Herrera was imprisoned in 1811, during the Casas Revolt in San Antonio.Almar√°z, p. 118. Herrera and Governor Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo were removed for detention to Ignacio Elizondo's hacienda in Coahuila. These two royalist prisoners persuaded Elizondo to change allegiance.Almar√°z, p. 119. Their new convert Elizondo soon captured Hidalgo and his followers on their pilgrimage to establish San Antonio as the center of the revolt in New Spain.Edmonson, p. 35. In July 1811, Herrera returned to San Antonio as ad interim governor. He filled this position for six months, until Salcedo resumed the office in December. Salcedo and Herrera were confronted by the Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition, a filibuster that captured Nacogdoches and La Bah√≠a in November 1812.

This is a minigene in its most basic sense. More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and intron(s). Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating splicing patterns both in vivo and in vitro biochemically assessed experiments. Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter vectors (also called exon-trapping vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both cis-regulatory elements (RNA effects) and trans-regulatory elements (associated proteins/splicing factors) affect gene expression. pre-mRNA splice patterns showing constitutive exons and introns and the inserted fragment. Orange lines show alternative splicing outcomes as dictated by the exonic sequences and intronic sequences (yellow and green bands) that influence splicing. These sequences may be splicing enhancers or silencers, polypyrimidine tract binding protein sites or other elements. History Minigenes were first described as the somatic assembly of DNA segments and consisted of DNA regions known to encode the protein and the flanking regions required to express the protein. The term was first used in a paper in 1977 to describe the cloning of two minigenes that were designed to express a peptide. RNA splicing was discovered in the late 1970s through the study of adenoviruses that invade mammals and replicate inside them. Researchers identified RNA molecules that contained sequences from noncontiguous parts of the virus‚Äôs genome. This discovery led to the conclusion that regulatory mechanisms existed which affected mature RNA and the genes it expresses. Using minigenes as a splice reporting vector to explore the effects of RNA splicing regulation naturally followed and remains the major use of minigenes to date. Types In order to provide a good minigene model, the gene fragment should have all of the necessary elements to ensure it exhibits the same alternative splicing (AS) patterns as the wild type gene, i.e., the length of the fragment must include all upstream and downstream sequences which can affect its splicing. Therefore, most minigene designs begin with a thorough in silico analysis of the requirements of the experiment before any \\"wet\\" lab work is conducted. With the advent of Bioinformatics and widespread use of computers, several good programs now exist for the identification of cis-acting control regions that affect the splicing outcomes of a gene and advanced programs can even consider splicing outcomes in various tissue types. Differences in minigenes are usually reflected in the final size of the fragment, which is in turn a reflection of the complexity of the minigene itself. The number of foreign DNA elements (exon and introns) inserted into the constitutive exons and introns of a given fragment varies with the type of experiment and the information being sought. A typical experiment might involve wild type minigenes which are expected to express genes normally in a comparison run against genetically engineered allelic variations which replace the wild-type gene and have been cloned into the same flanking sequences as the original fragment. These types of experiments help to determine the effect of various mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. Construction Once a suitable genomic fragment is chosen (Step 1), the exons and introns of the fragment can be inserted and amplified, along with the flanking constitutive exons and introns of the original gene, by PCR. The primers for PCR can be chosen so that they leave \\"sticky ends\\" at 3' sense and anti-sense strands (Step 2). These \\"sticky-ends\\" can be easily incorporated into a TOPO Vector by ligation into a commercially available source which has ligase already attached to it at the sight of incorporation (Step 3). The subsequent TOPO Vectors can be transfected into E.coli cells (Step 4). After incubation, total RNA can be extracted from the bacterial colonies and analyzed using RT-PCR to quantify ratios of exon inclusion/exclusion (step 5). The minigene can be transfected into different cell types with various splicing factors to test trans-acting elements (Step 6). The expressed genes or the proteins they encode can be analyzed to evaluate splicing components and their effects via a variety of methods including hybridization or size-exclusion chromatography. A typical cycle for constructing a minigene. Uses RNA splicing errors have been estimated to occur in a third of genetic diseases. To understand pathogenesis and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention in these diseases, explicating the splicing elements involved is essential. Determining the complete set of components involved in splicing presents many challenges due to the abundance of alternative splicing, which occurs in most human genes, and the specificity in which splicing is carried out in vivo. Splicing is distinctly conducted from cell type to cell type and across different stages of cellular development. Therefore, it is critical that any in vitro or bioinformatic assumptions about splicing regulation are confirmed in vivo. Minigenes are used to elucidate cis-regulatory elements, trans-regulatory elements and other regulators of pre-mature RNA splicing in vivo. Minigenes have been applied to the study of a diverse array of genetic diseases due to the aforementioned abundance of alternatively spliced genes and the specificity and variation observed in splicing regulation. The following are examples of minigene use in various diseases. While it is not an exhaustive list, it does provide a better understanding of how minigenes are utilized. =Endocrine diseases= RNA splicing errors can have drastic effects on how proteins function, including the hormones secreted by the endocrine system. These effects on hormones have been identified as the cause of many endocrine disorders including thyroid- related pathological conditions, rickets, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. One specific example of a splicing error causing an endocrine disease that has been studied using minigenes is a type of growth hormone deficiency called isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), a disease that results in growth failure. IGHD type II is an autosomal dominant form caused by a mutation in the intervening sequence (IVS) adjacent to exon 3 of the gene encoding growth hormone 1, the GH-1 gene. This mutated form of IVS3 causes exon 3 to be skipped in the mRNA product. The mRNA (-E3) encodes a truncated form of hGH that then inhibits normal hGH secretion. Minigenes were used to determine that a point mutation within an intron splice enhancer (ISE) embedded in IVS3 was to blame for the skipping of E3. Moreover, it was determined that the function of the ISE is influenced by a nearby transposable AC element, revealing that this particular splicing error is caused by a trans-acting factor. =Neurodegenerative diseases= Accumulation of tau protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as other tauopathies. Tau protein isoforms are created by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10. The regulation of tau splicing is specific to stage of development, physiology and location. Errors in tau splicing can occur in both exons and introns and, depending on the error, result in changes to protein structure or loss of function. Aggregation of these abnormal tau proteins correlates directly with pathogenesis and disease progression. Minigenes have been used by several researchers to help understand the regulatory components responsible for mRNA splicing of the TAU gene. =Cancer= Cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease that can be hereditary or the result of environmental stimuli. Minigenes are used to help oncologists understand the roles pre-mRNA splicing plays in different cancer types. Of particular interest are cancer specific genetic mutations that disrupt normal splicing events, including those affecting spliceosome components and RNA-binding proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticules (hnRNP), serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and small ribonucleoproteins (snRNP). Proteins encoded by aberrantly spliced pre-mRNAs are functionally different and contribute to the characteristic anomalies exhibited by cancer cells, including their ability to proliferate, invade and undergo angiogenesis, and metastasis. Minigenes help researchers identify genetic mutations in cancer that result in splicing errors and determine the downstream effects those splicing errors have on gene expression. Using knowledge obtained from studies employing minigenes, oncologists have proposed tests designed to detect products of abnormal gene expression for diagnostic purposes. Additionally, the prospect of using minigenes as a cancer immunotherapy is being explored.

She was a long-time companion of , one of the first female doctors in Germany.Historical Dictionary of Switzerland  Life  Blumenstilleben by Ottilie Roederstein Roederstein was born in Switzerland. She was the second daughter of a businessman who came from Germany to work as a representative for a Swiss textile company. She was first attracted to painting when the now-forgotten Swiss painter Eduard Pfyffer (1836‚Äì1899) came to their home to do family portraits. This interest grew with visits to local museums. For a woman, training as a painter would have gone against contemporary social conventions. Her mother was especially opposed to her wishes, but persistence eventually won over her father and, in 1876, she was allowed to study with Pfyffer, so she would be close to home. Her talent for portrait painting soon became obvious and she quickly outgrew Pfyffer's studio. Her opportunity came when her sister Johanna married a businessman from Berlin. Johanna and her husband agreed to let her live with them there, and she found a place as a student in a special women's class given by Karl Gussow. In 1882, she had her first exhibition with an art dealer in Z√ºrich and it was well received. That same year, she followed a friend to Paris, where she found a position in the studios of Carolus-Duran and Jean- Jacques Henner. By 1887, she was able to support herself with sales and commissions and no longer had to depend on her parents. She was a participant in the Salon and won a Silver Medal at the Exposition Universelle (1889). She exhibited her work at the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. After 1890, she moved to Frankfurt to be with her friend, Elisabeth Winterhalter; although she travelled widely (including a trip to Africa in 1913). She never lost track of her Swiss roots, however, and became an Honorary Citizen of Z√ºrich in 1902. Five years later, she and Eisabeth settled in Hofheim am Taunus (a suburb of Frankfurt). Amongst her models was Gwen John who was intrigued that Roederstein wore a shirt, jacket and a fob watch. Roederstein's painting of her as \\"The Letter\\" was exhibited at the salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1908. That same year Roederstein and her partner helped to create the Schillerschule, Frankfurt's first school for girls. After the war she did a number of portraits of women widowed by the war. She continued to exhibit regularly until 1931. References  Further reading  * Clara Tobler: Ottilie W. Roederstein. Rascher & Cie, Z√ºrich 1929. * Hermann Haindl: Ottilie W.

A member of the prominent Winslow family of Plymouth, he served as a civil and military official in early 18th-century Massachusetts, a period marked by political transition.  Early Life and family  Isaac Winslow was the grandson of Mayflower passenger Edward Winslow (October 18, 1595 ‚Äì 1655), a governor of Plymouth Colony and one of that colony's near-mythical \\"Pilgrims\\". Isaac's father, Josiah, also served as governor of Plymouth Colony, and as commander-in-chief of the colonial English forces during King Philip's War. Winslow was born ca. 1671 on the family estate in the village of Marshfield. His parents were Josiah Winslow and Penelope (Pelham) Winslow. Of this generation of the family, Isaac and his sister Elizabeth (born April 8, 1664) were the only children to survive to adulthood, a sister and brother having each died within a year of their birth.Kellogg. p. 8. Somewhere around the turn of the 17th century, Isaac built a house at the current intersection of Careswell Street and Webster Street in Marshfield, which still exists as the Historic 1699 Winslow House. On July 11, 1700, he married Sarah Wensley of Boston, in a ceremony presided over by the Reverend Cotton Mather. The marriage produced six children; Josiah (born 1701), John (born 1703), Penelope (born 1704), Elizabeth (born 1707), Anna (born 1709 or 1710), and Edward (born 1714).Kellogg. p. 11  Career  Active in local affairs, Winslow was appointed to the Plymouth County Inferior Court of Common Pleas in 1712, and served until 1738, for the last nine years as its chief justice. In 1715, he was commissioned a colonel in the Massachusetts militia and given charge of a regiment drawn from Plymouth County, and was a judge of the Court of Probate for Plymouth from 1718 to 1738.Krusell. p. 24. A decade after Plymouth's incorporation into Massachusetts, Winslow became prominent at a wider colonial level. In 1703, he was appointed for the first time to the Council for the Province of Massachusetts Bay. As a representative in the legislature's upper house, he and his fellow councilors were to serve as advisors to the Royal Governor in Boston, as well as passing laws and approving government expenditures. Winslow's term in council was marked by a period of war and turbulent politics; Massachusetts was almost constantly fighting New England natives and French colonists in Canada, and several successive governors would clash with the lower House of Representatives on issues of finance and legislative appointments. With the exception of 1715, Winslow served as a member of the council until 1736, for a time as its president.  Death and burial  He died in Marshfield on December 14, 1738, having named as his heirs his wife Sarah, his sons John and Edward, and his daughters Penelope and Elizabeth. He is buried in the Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts, not far from the house that he built in 1699.  Legacy  His house, the 1699 Isaac Winslow House, still stands today in Marshfield. It has been converted into a historic house museum providing a glimpse into the lives of New England landed gentry prior to the Revolutionary War.

He started two games as quarterback for the Texas Longhorns in 1977. When the 1977 season started he was the 4th string quarterback, but injuries to all three of the quarterbacks ahead of him led to him starting the two games at the end of the regular season. At the time Texas was undefeated, ranked #1 and playing for the national championship. They won both games. College career Sam \\"Sammy\\" Ansley, had been a unanimous all-district quarterback in high school and had made the All-Greater Houston team in 1976. He was a freshman in 1977 when injuries to three other Texas quarterbacks led to him starting two games for the #1 Texas Longhorns to keep their national championship hopes alive. = Injury = Injuries to Ted Constanzo in the summer, followed by injuries to Mark McBath and Jon Aune in the Oklahoma game and to Randy McEachern in practice led to Ansley taking over as starter against TCU and the following week against Baylor. Up to that point he had only gotten into 3 games, throwing one pass and running the ball four times. The other freshman quarterback, Sanford Coggins, had been moved to flanker in the summer meaning that in the TCU game his backups were sophomore defensive back Ricky Churchman, who had played quarterback in high school, and Constanzo who was only partly recovered from his surgery and still being held out for a medical redshirt. Against TCU, Ansley and the Longhorns relied on eventual Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell to lead them to a 44-14 win. But Ansley ran for 1 touchdown and threw for two others, putting in an admirable debut. The following week, against Baylor, he led Texas to an early lead, scoring one touchdown, and then alternated series with a recovering McEachern and, in the fourth quarter, Costanzo, who used a whole year of eligibility to fill in as punter. = Recovery = McEachern recovered and reclaimed the starting position, and Ansley took a few snaps the next week against Texas A&M;, but that would be the end of his playing career. After Ansley's 1978 redshirt season, he returned in the spring running second team behind Donnie Little. Ansley separated his shoulder in a spring scrimmage and ultimately had rotator cuff surgery after the 1979 season. The following spring, a knee injury to McEachern had Ansley leading the Longhorn offense in practice. But McEachern recovered and Ansley was redshirted the next season. He never made the roster again. He finished with a 2-0 record as a starter.  Professional career  After graduating from Texas, he went into the oil and gas industry working for Clayton Williams Jr.; Sanchez O'Brien Oil and Gas; Coba Investments, Corp and Energy Marketing Services; and Lonestar Midstream, L.P.

Export-oriented employment refers to employment in multinational corporations' international industrial factories, usually located in developing countries. Such factories produce goods and services for sale in other countries. While these multinational producers have globally expanded women‚Äôs access to employment, evidence suggests they do so by reinforcing traditional gender roles or creating new gender inequalities. Pdf version - via the World Bank. Such gender inequities allow multinational firms to greater exploit profits per worker than they would otherwise due to the decreased labor cost. This decrease in the cost of labor comes as a result of the relegation of women to certain occupations. Studies show that in the quest for lower unit labor costs, export-oriented facilities create poor working conditions. History Work in international factories has become an option for women in developing countries.Elson, D. & Pearson, R. (1981). \\"The Subordination of Women and Internationalization of Factory Production\\" in K. Young et al. Of Marriage and the Market, CSE 214-216; 219-221 This opportunity, which has increased since the latter part of the 1960s, represents the production of goods to be sold explicitly to more developed countries. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, developing countries emerged as the sites to relocate labor-intensive manufacturing industries, as they were moved away from developed countries.Kabeer, N. (2004). \\"Globalization, Labor Standards, and Women‚Äôs Rights: Dilemmas of Collective (In)action in an Interdependent World.\\" Feminist Economics. 10(1): 3-35. This expansionism has forced developing countries to create and sell assembled products and other goods to more developed countries. Upon greater enhancement, developing countries were able to bolster their industrialized processes by swapping imported goods in favor of goods produced domestically. However, within the last 40 years this process eroded due in part to technological development, changes in regulation, and higher employment costs in more developed countries. Additionally, international trade has expanded in a distinct manner that is linked to manufacturing processes. From the 1970s forward, the global marketplace and the makeup of the labor force has had transformations by way of technological innovation, work structure, and new forms of controlling labor.Standing, G. (1999). \\"Global Feminization through Flexible Labor: A Theme Revisited.\\" World Development 27 (3): 583-586. Because of changes in the wider labor market, women have joined the labor force in greater numbers and tended to remain a part of the force. Moreover, many male employees have often been moved to less desirable jobs, if not placed outside of the labor market entirely. Additionally, those characteristics commonly related to female employment such as temporary arrangements, low wages, and job instability have risen. Moreover, these patterns have increased vis-a-vis characteristics identified with male labor, such as unionization and job security. Consequently, the expansion of export-oriented employment is a major contributor to what some have called, \\"the global feminization of labor\\" in the post-1980 period. Currently one of the most significant examples of export-oriented employment is the Bangladesh textile industry. By 2013, about 4 million people, mostly women, worked in Bangladesh's $19 billion-a-year industry, export-oriented ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Sixty percent of the export contracts of western brands are with European buyers and about forty percent with American buyers. Women as the preferred labor force Gender roles vary by society, but are often based in social ideas that women have different natural abilities and a more suitable temperament for certain work as compared to men. Typically, women have been the preferred labor force in export-oriented factories because they allow for lower unit labor costs. Additionally, women are often deemed more physically dexterous and are regarded as more tempered in reference to their personality. As a result of which, some have argued that women are stereotyped as being better able to complete tasks that are mundane. There is evidence to support the argument that women receive such perceived traits or skills in a non-formal and independent setting. However, as a result of which, women's skills employed in a factory setting are likely to be viewed as less valuable compared to other skill sets. Thus, women can be described as being relegated to an inferior status because their abilities are not equally valued. Finally, while women in factory settings are often unfairly demoted and forced into submissive roles, they are aware of their perceived lower status and do not accept it. Dominguez et al. (2010) note that in processing centers located in Mexico, employers favored hiring married females.Dom√≠nguez, E., Icaza, R., Quintero, C., L√≥pez, S., & Stenman, √Ö. (2010). Women Workers in the Maquiladoras and the Debate on Global Labor Standards. Feminist Economics, 16(4), 185-209\\\\. doi:10.1080/13545701.2010.530603 In this context, Dominguez et al. note that married women were seen as more dependable and as a result of which, better employees. The same authors also note that employers put forth that such a system allowed the families of those hired to be better supported. However, Dominguez et al. claim such a stance by employers is a decision that relegates women to a specific role based on gender and allows for greater control of the given workers. In a 2003 analysis of a Chinese electronics producer, Pun Ngai found that surveyed workers sought employment by migrating from a variety of areas across the country and generally were employed for a period that was less than 36 months. The workers surveyed by Ngai were largely in their early 20s and nearly three-quarters were female. Working conditions =Wage levels= In an examination of Chinese factories producing electronic goods for the west, including Apple and Microsoft, reporting indicates that workers are often paid less than 2 USD per hour. In the latter part of 2011, weekly payments for minimum wage workers in Cambodia's garment industry totaled 8117 Riel.International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic, Stanford Law School & Workers Rights Consortium. (2013, February) \\"Monitoring in the dark.\\" Retrieved from http://humanrightsclinic.law.stanford.edu/wp- content/uploads/2013/03/Monitoring-in-the-Dark-Stanford-WRC.pdf Despite the fact that workers have others who rely upon their wages, manufacturing entities are well aware that they do not provide sustainable wages. Moreover, for Cambodian garment manufacturers to remain competitive, factory owners must keep wages low. Creating higher wages poses risks for factory owners that other countries accepting export orders will usurp their place. However, despite the allure that factory jobs provide for rural workers, rapidly falling wages risk alienating this mass of people. Beginning in the at the start of the millennium and ending in 2010, workers in Cambodia's garment sector have seen their inflation adjusted wages decrease by nearly 17%. These wages are expected to continue to fall almost twofold through the year of 2014. =Hours= In 2012, evidence that workers in Cambodia's garment sector were burdened by unreasonable overtime hours was found to be common place in factories monitored by \\"Better Factories Cambodia,\\" a group originally designated to oversee and improve factory conditions. As product orders often ebb and flow, managers require extended hours from their employees. Additionally, managers can eliminate additional costs by imposing excessive overtime on fewer workers, versus giving a greater share of benefits to a larger population with less overtime. In discussions with Cambodia's garment sector workers, many have noted that burdensome overtime was particularly strenuous, but also necessary because of falling wages. Moreover, workers in the industry have called for the option to choose when to engage in overtime hours, versus required overtime work delegated to them. =Control= Pun Ngai has analyzed labor systems in Chinese dormitories that are intertwined with production sites and labor.Pun, N. (2007) \\"Gendering the Dormitory Labor System: Production, Reproduction and Migrant Labor in south China.\\" Feminist Economics. 13 (3-4): 239-258. In this analysis, evidence is put forth that details how migrant laborers in export-processing areas have been forced into such residences that allow for complete worker control. This control comes from the dormitory grounds being secured by security guards that prevent worker exits. This structure is often rationalized as a benefit to the workers, whom the factory owners view as being in need of security and extra discipline. Additionally, dormitories of this kind can house hundreds of workers, where as many as twenty workers may share a room. While such conditions can be detrimental to workers, it can also be a shared source of discomfort through which workers may more easily unite for common causes. =Safety concerns= In 2012, a fire erupted in a garment factory in Karachi, Pakistan that killed approximately 300 people.Hasan, S. S. (2012, September 12). Deadly karachi blaze was \\"waiting to happen\\". BBC News Asia .

In 2013, 2013 a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing at least 1000 people and injuring approximately 2500 others.Brennan , C. (2013, May 10).

Of the factories assessed, the majority had a lack of restroom sanitizing products, excessively high temperature levels, and no access to safe water for drinking. Kalpona Akter, a former Bangladeshi child garment worker and industry activist, has described conditions where garment factory managers lock exit doors while workers are engaging in tasks.Labour Activist sheds light on working conditions in Bangladeshi sweatshops . Public Service Alliance of Canada. (2013, December 16). Retrieved from http://psacunion.ca/labour-activist-sheds-light-working-conditions- bangladeshi-sweatshops Akter notes that factory managers value the goods that are being produced instead of worker well-being. Activism In 2005, students at a variety of universities in the United States engaged in protests against colleges that purchase goods created in the industrial apparel sector in order to sell with their personal namesakes.Appelbaum, R., & Dreier, P. (2005). Students Confront Sweatshops. Nation, 281(18), 28. In their quest for better outcomes, some of the students in protest have urged universities to create special independent contracts with international apparel factories that require stringent oversight, as well as a promise to refrain from producing goods other than those created for the noted educational institution. Protesters also argue that because these industrial workers receive payments that are less than or equal to two percent of an item's selling price, the earnings for industrial workers should allotted based on prices in the area of which they work. While activists note that there is an increased cost for consumers, they set forth that in one example that this price change can be under one U.S. dollar in retail price. Rachel Silvey has noted that efforts by college activists force local college administrators to make changes that have international effects.Silvey, R. (2004).

In 2014, workers employed in Cambodia's garment industry, who are predominantly female, protested against the government's current minimum wage level.Narin, S., & Wong, C. H. (2014 January 2). Cambodian Garment Workers return to streets. The Wall Street Journal Some participants in Cambodia's Garment Manufacturing Association responded to protests by noting that products manufactured in Cambodia would move elsewhere. =Unions and workers' rights= In Cambodian export factories, workers often face hardship in regards to participating in unionization efforts that differ from that of management philosophy. Workers have noted deliberate efforts by managers to dismantle union activities, that have often included threats or the initiation of violence. Among other Asian countries, Bangladesh has extremely poor rights regarding unionization.Berik, G., & Van Der Meulen Rodgers, Y. (2008). Options for Enforcing Labour Standards: Lessons from Bangladesh and Cambodia. Journal of International Development, (22), 56‚Äì85. doi: 10.1002/jid There is evidence that this problem may be connected to, and exacerbated by, Bangladesh's reliance on exporting apparel goods in the past three decades. Highlighting the lack of collectivity, a mere 2 percent of employees were active in unions. Policies In light of deteriorating labor market standards abroad, widespread attention and criticism has been leveled at overseas manufacturers in hopes of creating a minimum standard for labor practices that would afford workers rights related to unionization and freedom from workplace discrimination. Intertwined in this attention, critics have looked to connect such minimum standards to broader global trading treaties. This pairing, known as a \\"social clause\\", aims to force international trade bodies such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) to integrate seven core International Labour Organization (ILO) labour rights conventions into trade agreements and attach penalties to those that do not. Advocacy on behalf of labour rights can often come via governments and private groups from the global north. In this regard, many entities may support such a theme because of personal economic interest or indignation toward unfair labor practices. Comparatively, lesser developed countries and private groups in those countries are often skeptical of such trade agreements as they view the implementation of labor rights policies as being designed to further enrich the global north. Despite the precariousness found in export-oriented factories, research has indicated that women in developing countries are satisfied by the opportunity to have a formal factory job, compared to the limited informal ways of making money. This contentment on the part of women is created via the ability to garner greater independence as well as having increasing oversight within their homes. In 1999, Cambodia and the United States entered into a trade agreement known as the U.S./Cambodia Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement.Trade, Monitoring, and the ILO: Working to Improve Conditions in Cambodia's Garment Factories, Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal Vol. 7, 2004, pp. 79-107 (7 Yale Hum. Rts. & Dev. L. J. 79) (2004).

Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus do not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara have already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds. SEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 93% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of Rs. 23500 crores and only around Rs. 2260.69 crores are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than Rs. 12,000 crore which has with interest swelled to Rs. 16000 Crore. By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability. Furthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded Rs. 64 crore to the investors while it has received Rs. 16000 crore from Sahara. On October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies. Reports also suggested that between the time that SEBI first initiated the inquiry four years ago and Roy's eventual detention and it is to note that till today there is not a single charge against him, there has not been a single instance of an investor in either of the two Sahara firms under watch actually filing a police complaint or going to court.While Sahara has been asked to refund the money to a special Sebi account under a Supreme Court-monitored repayment process, the group has been saying it has already refunded more than 98 per cent of the amount directly to investors and the proof for the same have been given to Sebi. The case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over Rs 24,000 crore from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to Sebi office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information. It is also been reported that Sahara has paid Rs 725.97 crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009-10 and 2012‚Äì13. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.http://www.firstpost.com/business/saharas-subrata-roy-is-planning-a- comeback-and-high-on-his-priority-is-online-education-4161227.html On 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of Rs 20,000 crore of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar. Despite the double payment for single liability, Sahara India has been continuously depositing money of around Rs 20,000 crore (including interest earned) in Sahara-Sebi account. Timeline of events The unravelling of this case started in 2010 and it is still in process in the Supreme Court of India as of 2016. *November 2010 - Securities and Exchange Board of India barred Sahara India Pariwar chief Subrata Roy and two of its companies ‚Äì Sahara India Real Estate Corp (SIREC) and Sahara Housing Investment Corp (SHIC) - from raising money from the public as they had raised several thousand crores through optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCDs) that SEBI deemed illegal. *December 2010 - Sahara appealed in the Allahabad High Court, which ordered SEBI not to take any action until a court order is passed. *January 2011 - Delhi High Court issued a warrant against Sahara India Pariwar chairman Subrata Roy and four other officials of the group on a complaint that it deceived investors in a proposed housing project of Rs. 25,000 crore. *February 2011 - Delhi High Court stays proceedings against Sahara India Pariwar chairman Subrata Roy and four other officials of the group on a complaint that it deceived investors in a proposed housing project. *May 2011 - Supreme Court of India asked Sahara India Real Estate (SIREC) to furnish the format of the application for its optionally fully convertible debenture (OFCD) scheme and a list of accredited agents that raised money on the company's behalf. *June 2011 - SEBI ordered Sahara firms to immediately refund the money collected through its sale of OFCDs. *October 2011 - Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), set up by the Supreme Court, ordered two unlisted Sahara group companies to refund within six weeks about Rs. 17,656.53 crore with 15% interest, which it had raised through OFCDs. *November 2011 - Sahara India Pariwar moved the Supreme Court against SAT's order and the Supreme Court stayed the SAT order, and asked the two companies to refund Rs. 17,400 crores to their investors and asked the details and liabilities of the companies. *January 2012 - Supreme Court gives three weeks time to Sahara India Pariwar to choose between options to return investments made by public in its OFCD scheme.

Prior to its restoration in the 1990s, the building had become dilapidated, with a downstairs room (once used as a Suffolk Wildlife Trust office) being in a reasonable condition, but the upstairs room, that had been used to store theatrical props, needing a lot of work. Funds for the refurbishment of the building, which cost ¬£23,000, were largely raised by Jack Rose, through the sales of his local history books and by his popular slide shows.

The museum works as an umbrella organization for a total of five departments and six exhibitions in Vendsyssel. It was initiated in 1889 and attained recognition by the State of Denmark in 1959. Exhibits The VHM has extensive collections on the natural history of the region and also conducts and archives archaeological excavations. Some of the excavated items originated as early as 10,000 BC. The museum exhibits in Hj√∏rring, two places in Hirtshals, in Mosbjerg and at Rubjerg Knude: * Hj√∏rring: This is the site of the headquarters of VHM, taking residence in several buildings both old and new, all encompassing a small enclosed park with herb gardens, a playground and facilities for picnics. The exhibits holds artifacts and tells stories from the earliest Nordic Stone Age to modern times, rooted in finds from the region of Vendsyssel. The museum and its collections was initiated by the first dentist in Hj√∏rring J. J. L√∏nborg Friis and his old preserved clinic can also be studied here. There is a museum shop and a caf√© at the complex. * Hirtshals Museum: Situated in an old fisherman's house from 1880, this museum exhibits and tells the story of Hirtshals and its strong relations to the North Sea through the ages. The interior of the house is reconstructed to show how ordinary fishermen's families lived anno 1915 in this region. The museum also tells the story of the 'Bjesk', the old traditional bitter of Vendsyssel and gives information and assistance on how to use the many local herbs found in the dunes along the west coast, for producing one's own 'Bjesk'. Bitters are an old and widespread tradition in Scandinavia, and is generally referred to as snaps in Denmark. * Bunker Museum Hirtshals: The shorelines around the city of Hirtshals was part of the German Atlantic Wall defence during World War II. The museum presents the only excavated complete WWII bunker system in Denmark and holds 54 bunkers and many artillery nests between radar and lighting facilities spread out over a 3.5 km long strip of shoreline.Bunkermuseum Hirtshals Bunkermuseum Hirtshals 10th Battery Official homepage of the museum * Mosbjerg: The department in Mosbjerg 20‚Äì30 km east of Hj√∏rring, is a landscape- and agricultural museum (see ecomuseum) placed in a hilly and geologically interesting landscape. The museum is a working museum, imitating the agricultural practises in the early part of the 1900s and is based in two separate farm buildings. There are three designed hiking paths in the area associated with the museum; \\"Oldtidsstien\\", \\"Markstien\\" and \\"Skovstien\\", which translates as The Prehistoric Path, The Field Path and The Forest Path. The trails are focusing on prehistoric tumuli, various agricultural landuses and a characteristic forest meadow habitat respectively. The long-distance hiking trail of H√¶rvejen passes through the area in the east.H√∏jen-Bj√∏rnager-Omr√•det A map of the area and the three trails. * Rubjerg Knude: The old coastal farm of Strandfogedg√•rden (\\"The Wreck Master's Farm\\") a few kilometres south of the decommissioned lighthouse of Rubjerg, has been administered by the VHM since 2000. As the name implies, it was formerly the home of the wreck master at Rubjerg Knude, going back to 1860s. The relentless winds, drifting sands and migrating dunes, hints at the rather harsh living conditions here in former ages. VHM has a permanent, but ever evolving exhibit at the farm, telling the stories of the four coastal parishes covered by L√∏nstrup Cliff (including Rubjeg Knude) and the unique conditions of life and nature found here. The Wreck Master's Farm is also known as Jens Thomsen's farm, in remembrance of a former owner - and the first wreck master of Rubjeg Knude - who overtook the place from his father in 1838. The place has been on the hands of the Thomsen family since 1814, when Jens' father Thomas, acquired the farm and it is now owned by the great-great grandson of Jens.

It is registered as a Provincial Heritage Building and is currently served by the Society of Jesus.History, StPatricks.halifax.ns.ca; retrieved March, 26, 2014. History =Foundation= In 1843, the parish of St. Patrick was founded. The first Masses were held in a local stable on the corner of Gerrish and G√∂ttingen streets. Two years later, in 1845, the parish moved to a former chapel that was previously an Anglican Garrison Chapel. In 1851, this was extended when a spire with a bell was added. In 1857, a school was opened in the basement of the church. In 1867 the school was moved to a separate building. =Construction= With the congregation growing in number, plans were drawn up to rebuild the church so that it would have a larger capacity. A local architect, Henry Peters, was chosen to design the church. He also designed St Matthew's Church in the city. Peters, who is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery was a well known local builder. He built the South Street Poor House, an Irish Catholic Institution in the Victoria Era. The last Mass in the old church was said on 2 April 1883. On 8 August 1883, the Archbishop of Halifax, Cornelius O'Brien laid the cornerstone of the new church. The first Mass in the new church was said in the basement on 22 December 1883. On 27 December 1885, the church was opened to the congregation and the first Mass was said on the main altar. =Extensions= From 1898 to 1903, stained windows were installed in the church. In 1922, those windows were replaced with ones from Franz Mayer & Co., after all but 5 of the original windows had been blown out in the December 6, 1917 Halifax explosion. That year, St Patrick's Boys School was opened opposite the church. On the same street was St Patrick's Girl School. In 1954 the schools were merged when a new school was built on Quinpool Road. In 1946, work was carried out to repaint and maintain the church. In the 1960s and 1970s, following the Second Vatican Council, the altar rail was removed, some statues taken away and a small table altar placed before the old high altar. In 2005, the Jesuits moved into the area and started to serve as parish priests later that decade. Parish There is one Sunday Mass in the church, at 10:00am on Sunday morning.

Life Born about 1519 at Yeate in Gloucestershire, Neale became in 1531 a scholar of Winchester College with the support of his maternal uncle, Alexander Belsire, a Fellow of New College, Oxford. On 19 June 1538 he was chosen probationer of New College, and in 1540 admitted perpetual fellow. He graduated B.A. 16 May 1542, M.A. 11 July 1546, and was admitted B.D. 23 July 1556. Before he took orders, Neal had acquired a reputation as a Greek and Hebrew scholar and theologian, and was given a pension by Sir Thomas Whyte. He travelled in France, probably during the time of the Edwardian reformation; and appears to have been there in 1556. Soon after the beginning of Mary I's reign he had been made chaplain to Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, and appointed rector of Thenford in Northamptonshire. On the accession of Elizabeth I, Neal went to Oxford, and in 1559 was made Regius Professor of Hebrew. He entered himself as a commoner of Hart Hall, and built lodgings for himself at the west end of New College, and opposite to Hart Hall. He took a prominent part in the entertainment of Elizabeth at Oxford in 1566, and wrote an account of it, published in Anthony Wood's History and Antiquities of Oxford, and used as the source for Richard Stephens's Brief Rehearsal. In 1569, concerned because of his Catholicism, Neal resigned his professorship and retired to Cassington near Oxford. The Nag's Head Story Neal has been taken as the ultimate authority for the Nag's Head Story, told against Matthew Parker by Catholic opponents of the Church of England, as related by William Arthur Shaw in the Dictionary of National Biography. The statements that Bonner sent him to Bishop Anthony Kitchin to dissuade him from assisting in the consecration of Parker, and that he was present at the pretended ceremony at the Nag's Head, rest on assertions of John Pits. Works Neal's works were: * Dialogus in adventum serenissim√¶ Regin√¶ Elizabeth√¶ gratulatorius inter eandem Reginam et D. Rob. Dudleium comitem Leicestri√¶ et Acad. Ox. cancellarium, together with Collegiorum scholarumque publicarum Ac. Ox. Topographica delineatio. These Latin verses were written to accompany drawings of the colleges and public schools of Oxford by John Bearblock. Neal's work was first printed, inaccurately, by Miles Windsor in Academiarum Catalogus, London, 1590. It was then reprinted by Thomas Hearne, Oxford, 1713, at the end of his edition of Dodwell de Parma Equestri; also by John Nichols in his Progresses of Elizabeth, i. 225; by the Oxford Historical Society (vol. viii.), and reproduced in facsimile, Oxford, 1882. * Commentarii Rabbi Davidis Kimhi in Hagg√¶um, Zachariam, et Malachiam prophetes ex Hebraico idiomate in Latinum sermonem traducti, Paris, 1557, dedicated to Cardinal Reginald Pole. Thomas Tanner also assigned to Neal: * A translation \\"of all the Prophets\\" out of the Hebrew. * A translation of Commentarii Rabbi Davidis Kimhi super Hoseam, Joelem, Amos, Abdeam, Micheam, Nahum, Habacuc, et Sophoniam (dedicated to Queen Elizabeth). * Rabbinic√¶ qu√¶dam observationes ex pr√¶dictis commentariis possibly identical with Breves qu√¶dam observationes in eosdem prophetes partim ex Hieronymo partim ex aliis probat√¶ fidei authoribus decerpt√¶, appended to the Commentarii.

The boatyard built experimental craft, lifeboats and yachts during the first part of the twentieth century. The Bell yard was notable for its dual focus on both experimental and traditional boats and for its employment of large numbers of female boatbuilders.Rick McGraw, \\"Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) the Boat Builder\\", Classic Boat Spring 2012, Issue 113, p. 24  Creation  The laboratories and boatyard were located on the large estate that Dr. Bell acquired in 1885. Dr. Bell bought a large portion of a peninsula that jets out into the Baddeck Bay and named the estate Beinn Bhreagh. The 600 acre estate was originally built as a summer residence, but was later used year round by the Bell family.Eber, Dorothy Harley.Genius at Work: Images of Alexander Graham Bell. Halifax, NS, CAN: Nimbus Publishing,1991. Print From the beginning the estate including laboratory facilities and a boathouse which grew in size to match Bell's interests and later wartime needs. The laboratories located on Beinn Bhreagh were used for various experiments Dr. Bell created. These included his tetrahedral kites, sheep farming, manned aerial flights and development of hydrofoils. The laboratories employed carpenter, plumbers, engineers, boatbuilders and unskilled labourers. At its peak it employed 40 people working on air and water craft, both experimental and traditional.Rick McGraw, \\"Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) the Boat Builder\\", Classic Boat Spring 2012, Issue 113, p. 23  1909‚Äì1914  During the years after the flight of the Silver Dart and up to the start of the First World War, Bell used his laboratories to develop hydrofoils. Dr. Bell and, long-time collaborator, Casey Baldwin started their first major designs of hydrofoils in 1911 after viewing Enrico Forlanini's hydrofoil while on a world tour in Italy in 1910.Pasachoff, Naomi E. Alexander Graham Bell : Making Connections. In Oxford Portraits in Science.New York : Oxford University Press. 1996.EBSCOhost.Web 25 March 2014 In order to build the experiments labelled HD 1, HD 2, HD 3, and HD 4, (HD standing for Hydrodrome) Dr. Bell and Casey used the laboratories and staff to construct the various pieces needed. As work progressed on the hydrofoils the main focus was for them to become submarine chasers. Before a full working prototype could be completed World War One broke out. As a citizen of the neutral United States, Dr. Bell did not want to risk breaking his country's neutrality law. So he switched the boatyard's focus from developing the military applicable HD vessels to building life boats for the Canadian Navy.  World War I  Women workers building lifeboats at Dr. Alexander Graham Bell's laboratory at Beinn Bhreagh. The Bells often employed local women from Baddeck and other places. The main focus throughout the war was a program ran from the estate by Mabel Bell's former secretary Gretchen Schmitt. The Bells converted one of the houses on their estate into a residence for the women from out of town.Eber, Dorothy Harley.Genius at Work: Images of Alexander Graham Bell. Halifax, NS, CAN: Nimbus Publishing,1991. Print During the war the Bell Boatyard consisted of a large open shed that was used as the primary shed to build the lifeboats. During this time the boatyard was managed by a Sydney native by the name of Walter Pinaud. The boat yard also produced the 55' yawl Elsie designed by naval architect George Owen and built by Walter Pinaud. Elsie was built as a gift for the Bells daughter Elsie Bell Grosvenor and her husband Gilbert Grosvenor.Morrow, Jim.\\"Two local yachts & the CCA.\\" The Victoria Standard. 9 July 2012: p1+.  1919‚Äì1922  After the war, Dr. Bell and Casey Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to sell the HD4 to the United States Navy and the British Navy.Eber, Dorothy Harley.Genius at Work: Images of Alexander Graham Bell. Halifax, NS, CAN: Nimbus Publishing,1991. Print Although both navies declined to buy or build the HD4, they were successful in achieving the water speed record of 70.86 mph which stood for a decade.Rick McGraw, \\"Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) the Boat Builder\\", Classic Boat Spring 2012, Issue 113, p. 24 After the HD4 and the life boat program the boatyard focused more on yachts but continued experimentation with high-speed vessels.  1922‚Äì1928  After the death of Dr. Bell in 1922, Casey Baldwin inherited many of the laboratory facilities and boatyard. He built a number of custom boats. These included a 30 foot high-speed boat using the hydrodrome design ordered by the British racer Marion Carstairs, intended to achieve 115 mph. Carstairs planned to compete for the Harmsworth Cup but withdrew and the boat was completed with a more economical engine delivering 57 mph. One of the last boats made at the yard was Tolka, a 36 foot motor vessel ordered by Baldwin's brother-in-law John Lash for the Muskokas in Ontario. Completed in 1928, it included a dual- control system that was unique for the era.Rick McGraw, \\"Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) the Boat Builder\\", Classic Boat Spring 2012, Issue 113, p. 24 After production at the boatyard ceased, a large building on the site was used to store boats of the Fairchild family descendants of Mable and Dr. Bell's. That same building was eventually sold and moved on the ice during the winter to its new home. It is still (2013) in use as a barn on a farm in Middle River, on the Cabot Trail.

The Megaphonic Thrift is also renowned for their energetic live shows. Pitchfork reviewed one of them: \\"... they set up a perfectly tuneful song, then carefully unravel it strand by melodic strand-- all in about four minutes. The result is a surge of scribbly, dissonant guitars, propelled by a percussive bass line and drumbeat that punishes the hi-hat and cymbals.\\" The band has several European and North-American tours behind them, and has amongst other things performed at SXSW, CMJ, The Great Escape, PopKomm and Roskilde, as well as several support shows for Dinosaur Jr, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, Band of Horses and A Place to Bury Strangers.

Karales (July 15, 1930, Canton, Ohio ‚Äì April 1, 2002, Croton-on- Hudson, N.Y.) was an American photographer and photo-essayist best known for his work with Look magazine from 1960 to 1971. At Look he covered the Civil Rights Movement throughout its duration, taking many of the movements memorable photographs, including those of the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his family. Karales's single best known image is the iconic photograph of the Selma to Montgomery march showing people proudly marching along the highway under a cloudy turbulent sky. Career Karales was born in Ohio to a family of Greek immigrants. Although he initially enrolled in Ohio University with the intention of majoring in electrical engineering, Karales switched his major to photography after watching his roommate in the darkroom. He graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1955, departing Ohio for New York City. He eventually found work as a darkroom assistant for photo-essay photographer W. Eugene Smith at the Magnum photo agency, initially on a two-week assignment making prints for Smith's Pittsburgh essay. He would go on to work for Smith for two years, making more than 7,000 prints and developing expertise both in the darkroom and as a photo-essayist. After leaving Magnum, Karales produced his own photo essays, including works showing what life was like for the working citizens of Rendville, Ohio, a former stop on the Underground Railroad and one of the few integrated working communities in the United States. His Rendville photo-essay would draw the attention of Edward Steichen and led to a solo exhibition at Helen Gee's Greenwich Village gallery, Limelight. Karales also drew attention from Look for the Rendville essay, and Look would go on to hire him in 1960 to cover and photograph both the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam. Karales worked for Look until the magazine closed in 1972; afterwards, he worked as a freelance photographer. Before he met Smith, he also created a photo-essay on the Greek-American community in his hometown of Canton, Ohio.

One of the former members of the Jewish Sonderkommando who escaped from the Treblinka extermination camp during the prisoner uprising of August 1943, Taigman later testified at the 1961 Eichmann Trial held in Jerusalem. After his escape and emigration from Poland, Taigman did not return to the country for more than 60 years. He returned to Treblinka for the first time in 2010 (two years before his death), asked by film director Tzipi Beider to take part in a documentary, along with another Treblinka revolt survivor and friend of his, Samuel Willenberg. Taigman's second wife of 26 years, Lea Lipshitz, who went along with them, said that Taigman was happy to be in Poland once more and much to her surprise spoke Polish again with ease. Biography Kalman Teigman (Taigman) studied at a technical school in Warsaw, where he was taught by Adam Czerniak√≥w among others. In 1935, his father emigrated to Mandate Palestine intending to arrange for the family to join him, but the war broke out and he was unable to achieve that. After the Nazis invaded Poland and began to set up ghettos in major cities, the young Kalman and his mother were trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto. It was the largest Jewish ghetto in all of Nazi Germany-occupied Europe, eventually holding 500,000 inmates. They worked for the ghetto branch of Germany's Chemnitzer Astrawerke AG factory.Christoph Schult (28 May 2005), Holocaust Survivors: Former Nazi Ghetto Workers Get Cheated ‚Äì Again, Der Spiegel 22/2005.

The extermination camp near Treblinka was built as part of the Nazis' Operation Reinhard (the most deadly phase of the \\"Final Solution\\"). It operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 officially.Treblinka Death Camp Day-by-Day Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team, H.E.A.R.T. Retrieved August 11, 2013. During this time, more than 800,000 Jews ‚Äì men, women, and children ‚Äì were murdered there, gassed upon arrival. Kalman's mother was sent directly from the Holocaust train to the gas chambers, which were disguised as showers. Kalman was put to work with the Sonderkommando in the Auffanglager sorting barracks. Of his experience at Treblinka, Taigman said on film: \\"It was hell, absolutely hell. A normal man cannot imagine how a living person could have lived through it ‚Äì killers, natural-born killers, who without a trace of remorse just murdered every little thing.\\"Death Camp Treblinka: Survivors Stories (2012), BBC Four broadcast. He described how the Germans had designed the camp to conceal its true purpose: From Taigman's deposition: burning Treblinka II perimeter during the prisoner uprising of 2 August 1943. Barracks were set ablaze, including a tank of petrol which exploded and spread flames to all other structures. A clandestine photograph taken by eyewitness Franciszek ZƒÖbecki. The Sonderkommando had planned the revolt for a long time, accumulating weapons and following the schedules of the SS officers. They planned to kill the SS officers first and then lead the prisoners out the gates, but plans went awry after a few officers were killed, and chaos ensued. Taigman escaped during the uprising of 2 August 1943 by climbing over the barbed-wire fence under machine-gun fire by the guards. He reached Warsaw after weeks. Soon after the war ended, he married in Warsaw. A year later Taigman joined his father in Mandate Palestine. In trying to reach the territory, he was first arrested by the British and transferred to a Jewish refugee camp set up in Cyprus. Taigman became a businessman in Israel, where he developed a successful import business. For a number of years in Israel, Taigman used to meet with other Holocaust survivors on the anniversary of the Treblinka uprising. Among the guests at the home of his friends Samuel (Szmuel) Willenberg and his wife Ada were Pinhas (Pinchas) Epstein and Eliahu Rosenberg. Together with Taigman, they testified at the 1961 trial of Holocaust perpetrator Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Later both Rosenberg and Epstein were star witnesses for the Israeli prosecution at the 1986‚Äì88 trial in Israel of John Demjanjuk, who had been living in the United States since 1952. He was identified as a Trawnkiki camp guard, who drawn from Soviet POWs held by the Germans, who had been nicknamed \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" by Treblinka prisoners. A guard at the gas chamber, \\"Ivan\\" was accused of committing murder and acts of extraordinary cruelty and violence at Treblinka against the Jewish prisoners in . But when asked, Taigman refused to testify against him. He said that Demjanjuk had not worked as a guard at Treblinka. He was convicted but appealed the verdict, saying he had never worked at Treblinka. While the case was under appeal, the Soviet Union fell and it opened many of its archives to researchers. Investigators discovered in those Soviet-held archives that Demjanjuk appeared to have served at Sobibor SS death camp, according to an ID with his photo. Rosenberg and Epstein had identified Demjanjuk as \\"Ivan\\" from photographs that were decades old. To make matters worse, Rosenberg's testimony in his case from 1981 was shown to have been coached by the interrogators and wholly illegitimate. Kalman Taigman died in 2012 of a brain tumor, survived by his second wife Lea, a son, and two grandchildren. Legacy and honors *Taigman was featured in two documentary films: Despite Treblinka (2002), a Uruguayan documentary in which he was featured along with Treblinka revolt survivor Chil Rajchman of Montevideo. *He and his friend Samuel Willenberg were featured in BBC Four's Death Camp Treblinka: Survivors Stories (2012), aired also in the US that year as Treblinka's Last Witness.

The current line-up of the band consists of Nik Taylor-Stoakes (Lead Vocals), Matt Pearce (Guitar), Tony Newton (Bass), Joe Lazarus (Drums) and Tommy Gentry (Guitar).  History The band was conceived by bassist Tony Newton and guitarist Richie Faulkner following a brief stopover by Newton in Los Angeles for production work. Upon his return to England, he and Faulkner began recruiting members for the band, before starting on the club circuit. In 2005, supplemented by drummer Dave \\"Grav\\" Cavill, vocalist Henry Rundell, and second guitarist Matt Pearce, they opened for Iron Maiden at the Hammersmith Apollo. Their first album, \\"Feed My Soul\\" was released the following year. This was later re-mixed & re-issued as \\"First Hit For Free\\" in 2008, which also featured a new song, \\"Faith\\". By this time, Faulkner had left the band, his place being taken by Chris Jones. Faulkner later joined Judas Priest. By the time of the band's next release, the 2010 EP \\"A Little Something For You\\", Luke Purdie had taken over on vocals. Purdie is notable for being the grandson of late entertainer Bruce Forsyth. The \\"Fluke?\\" album followed shortly after, although Cavill left after the subsequent tour, with Joe Lazarus subsequently taking over on drums. This line-up recorded the \\"Falling Knives\\" EP in 2011, which was followed by the 2013 album \\"Songs To Invade Countries To\\". The band supported Iron Maiden on the European leg of their Maiden England World Tour and subsequently headlined their own tour throughout Europe in 2014. Purdie left the band after this tour, his place eventually being taken by Nik-Taylor Stoakes. By the time of recording their 2017 album \\"Make Way for the King\\", Chris Jones had also departed, leaving Matt Pearce to record all the guitar parts on the record.

John and Shane and I all sing and write songs, and I think the album is a very good mix of our individuality and togetherness as a cohesive piece'. They began rehearsing the material at The Puritan Garage in Charlestown, Boston.

Moving the hips, legs and hands give off different gestures to the audience to tell a tale, typically related to the natural landscape such as the ocean and birds and flowers, but also feelings of love and sadness. The ura dance has three distinct components; the ura pa'u (drum dances), korero (legends) and kaparima (action songs). To perform the ura, women typically wear a pareu and a kikau (grass) skirt, with flowers and shell headbands and necklaces known as ei. Men during the dance are said to \\"vigorously flap their knees in a semi-crouched position while holding their upper bodies steady\\", and they typically wear kikau skirts and headbands. The drumming group, an integral part of the Ura, typically consists of a lead drummer (pate taki), support lead (pate takirua), a double player (tokere or pate akaoro) playing wooden gongs, and two other players playing skin drums (pa'u and mango). The finest performances of the Ura are put on in Rarotonga. A sexually charged variant of the ura dance is known at the ura piani in which both men and women are involved in telling the story. Other variations include the ura rore (stilt dance), ura tairiri (fan dance), ura korare (spear dance), and ura rama (torch dance).

Construction history  = Planning = On 17 October 2012, NCL announced it was ordering its first Breakaway Plus- class ship from Meyer Werft, with an option for a second ship slated for delivery in spring 2017. Breakaway Plus-class ships would be designed larger than the fleet's Breakaway-class ships, with an increase of to 163,000 GT, making room for a higher guest capacity and more features. On 16 July 2013, NCL announced that it was confirming the order for the second ship, reportedly at an estimated cost of approximately ‚Ç¨700 million. Together with the first Breakaway Plus-class ship ordered nine months prior, the two-ship order would amount to a total cost of approximately ‚Ç¨1.4 billion. On 8 October 2013, NCL announced the name of its second Breakaway Plus-class ship as Norwegian Bliss, which was chosen from an online contest it held for fans in September to name its two new ships on order. But on 12 October 2015, NCL announced the ship would be deployed to China and would no longer be named Norwegian Bliss, with a separate announcement on 29 February 2016 announcing she would be named Norwegian Joy and have a conjoining Chinese name, ËØ∫ÂîØÁúüÂñúÊÇ¶Âè∑ (Nu√≤ W√©i Zhƒìn X«ê Yu√® H√†o). = Construction = The ship began construction with the steel-cutting at the Meyer Werft shipyard on 16 September 2015. Her keel-laying and coin ceremonies were performed on 5 April 2016, in which a ceremonial coin was placed under the first of 80 total blocks to be laid. The first section was later launched on 4 June 2016. During her construction, two separate fires broke out. The first occurred on 28 September 2016 and was later attributed to welding work, costing the shipyard approximately ‚Ç¨50,000. The second occurred on 8 October 2016, damaging several cabins after it broke out on a balcony, and was also later attributed to welding work. Four weeks after the second fire, on 3 November 2016, Meyer Werft announced that construction was no longer behind schedule from the fires. On 4 March 2017, Norwegian Joy was floated out from the shipyard. She began her 14-hour conveyance along the Ems from Papenburg to Eemshaven on 26 March 2017 and performed her sea trials in the North Sea through the rest of the month. = Delivery and christening = On 21 November 2016, Norwegian announced that Norwegian Joy would be christened by a godfather, Chinese singer, Wang Leehom. On 27 April 2017, Meyer Werft delivered Norwegian Joy in Bremerhaven. On 27 June 2017, Wang christened the vessel in Shanghai.  Operational career  = Deployment in Asia = On 30 March 2016, following news that the ship would debut in China, Norwegian announced that Norwegian Joy would be homeported in Shanghai and Tianjin once she arrived in China. Following her delivery in April 2017, she left for Shanghai from Bremerhaven, making maiden calls in Singapore, Qingdao, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong for inaugural one-day events, before arriving in Shanghai on 10 June 2017 to sail exclusive cruises prior to her christening. She began her inaugural season of voyages from Shanghai on 28 June 2017, with sailings from Tianjin between 26 August and 15 September. During her time homeported in China, Norwegian Joy primarily sailed four-to-five-day voyages from Shanghai to various ports in Japan, and moved to Tianjin for a brief period in the summer, performing the same length of voyages that also visited various ports in Japan. = Deployment in North America = On 19 July 2018, Norwegian announced Norwegian Joy would be redeployed from China to the United States to begin sailing to Alaska from Seattle in 2019 and replace , joining sister ship, Norwegian Bliss. Before moving to Seattle, Norwegian Joy underwent a $50 million refurbishment to redesign her public spaces with features more popular for a Western audience and make her more similar to Norwegian Bliss. Work began on the ship's transformation on 11 March 2019 as the ship sailed from China to Singapore for a 21-day dry dock, continued through the transpacific crossing, and ended in late-April 2019 after a final five-day wet dock upon arriving in Seattle. She sailed two preview voyages between 26 April and 30 April before debuting on her first Alaskan sailing from Seattle on 4 May. Following her first Alaskan season, Norwegian Joy sailed Mexican Riviera cruises from Los Angeles and Panama Canal transits between Los Angeles and Miami. In the summer of 2020, she was scheduled to return to Seattle to operate Alaska cruises, though the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the season. In fall 2020, she is scheduled to cruise five-to-seven-day voyages from Miami to the Caribbean, before debuting in New York City in April 2021 to sail to Bermuda and the Maritimes. Design and specifications On 12 October 2015, NCL announced that the ship would be deployed to China, with new accommodations, dining options, and onboard features specifically designed to cater to the Chinese market. In March 2016, NCL unveiled details about the changes in design and features of Norwegian Joy that would distinguish her from Norwegian Escape. Of them, they include a lower guest capacity of 250 fewer passengers and less staterooms overall, more connecting cabins and family-oriented suites, an expanded casino, an expanded boutiques space, more restaurants amounting to a total of 29, and a two-level electric go-kart race track. On 27 July 2016, Norwegian announced it had commissioned Chinese artist, Tan Ping, to design the ship's hull art, which is inspired by the phoenix. Norwegian Joy has five main engines with total output power of 102,900 hp. The vessel has two MAN B&W; 14V48/60CR, each with power of 22,520 hp and three MAN B&W; 12V48/60CR, each with power of 19,300 hp. The propulsion system is two ABB Azipod XO units with total power of 40 MW, which allows service speed of 22.5 kts, while the maximum speed during trials exceeds 25.0 kts. The ship also has an air lubrication system installed, the Silverstream¬Æ System, which creates a carpet of tiny air bubbles along the hull to reduce drag.http://shipandbunker.com/news/emea/709523-first- commercial-silverstream-air-lubrication-system-installed-on-norwegian-cruise- ship References External links * Category:Ships built in Papenburg Category:Ships of Norwegian Cruise Line Category:Cruise ships Category:2017 ships ","title":"Norwegian Joy"},{"id":"42319567","text":"Warfield Richards Red Bow (June 26, 1948 ‚Äì March 28, 1993) was a South Dakota Lakotan known for his music.

It broke both world and national records. Design and development The Mg-9 was a glider designed as a high performance and training aircraft with aerobatic capabilities. Like most gliders of its day, it was wood framed with a mixture of plywood and fabric covering. It had a high gull wing built around a single spar, with ply covering ahead of it around the leading edge forming a torsion resistant D-box. The centre section was rectangular in plan, with ply covering extending rearwards to a diagonal drag strut. This inner section had modest dihedral, about 3¬∞. Behind main and drag struts the wing was fabric covered. Outboard the straight leading edge had slight sweep on it, and the trailing edge curved in to elliptical tips. One of the changes made between the prototype Mg 9 and the production Mg 9a was a reduction of aileron chord, though on both versions these extended over the whole of the tapered our panels. The wing was supported over the fuselage by a ply covered pylon which contained the rear cockpit. The prototype had a single, faired lift strut between the spar and the lower fuselage but production aircraft replaced this with an unusual inverted V pair of thin struts on each side, partly to ease the introduction of a monowheel between its fuselage connections. The fuselage of the Mg 9 was entirely ply covered and, pylon apart, had an ovoid cross-section. The forward cockpit, ahead of the wing, was enclosed by a complicated, multi-framed, flat panelled canopy. On the Mg 9a the forward fuselage was deepened, allowing the cockpit roof line, the seats and the pylon to be lowered; the glazing was also simplified. The view from the rear seat was greatly limited by the overhead wing though windows, less deep on the Mg 9a, provided sideways vision and the seat was raised to improve the forward view. Behind the trailing edge the pylon fell rapidly away to a slightly tapering fuselage. The horizontal tail, almost entirely fabric covered, was mounted on top of the fuselage; its straight, slightly swept tailplane carried full, semi-elliptical elevators. Their hinge line was close to the root of the ply covered fin, placing the full, D-shaped, fabric covered balanced rudder largely behind them. There was a small, ply covered tail bumper protecting the base of the rudder; on the prototype the main undercarriage was a skid that extended from the nose to behind the rear cockpit but on production models this ended further forward, under the wing spar, with the monowheel immediately aft. The first prototype flew in either 1935 or 1936, with ten Mg 9a produced in a run followed by a few later examples. Operational history Toni Kahlbacher, with different co-pilots, twice increased the world two seat glider endurance record in 1938 in a Mg 9a; the second flight, flown from 8 to 10 September with Josef F√ºhringer, lasted for 40 hours and 51 minutes. He also set several new Austrian gliding records with it. Kahlbacher and Tauschegg, the other pilot on the first record duration flight, flew a Mg 9a at the Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) Contest of 1938. They gained third place in the two seater class. Variants ;Mg 9:Prototype, one only. ;Mg 9a: Deepened forward fuselage, lowered pylon. Revised canopy, wing struts and ailerons. Landing wheel.

Sensors collect process as well as communicate information gathered from their environment. Thus BANs are inherently cyber- physical systems. The BAN interacts with its physical world (human body) by collecting, processing, and communicating health data (vital signals, temperature, pressure) from the person. This information from the environment that is already being collected can be used to provide security to the BAN. Physiological Value based Security (PVS) uses the vital signals of the human body that is collected during health monitoring operation to provide usable security to BAN. Figure 1. Physiological Value Based Key Agreement Protocol  Properties of PVS  For PVS to succeed the scheme developed should have the following properties: # The keys provided by PVS for security are long and random (a basic requirement in any security protocol). # Knowing the physiological signals at any time will not provide significant advantage in knowing the keys agreed upon in future executions of the scheme, i.e. time variance (required to prevent attacker from guessing future feature values from present ones). # The physiological stimuli used for PVS is universally (ensures that sensors at different location can measure the same signal). # Knowing the physiological value of one individual will not provide significant advantage in guessing the keys being agreed by sensors on another individual, i.e. distinctiveness.  Implementation of PVS using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals  Plethysmogram based Key Agreement protocol (PKA) uses PPG signals to provide PVS infrastructure to the BAN.

Early years Jean Lacave-Laplagne was born in Montesquiou, Gers, on 12 August 1795. His parents were was Barth√©lemy Lacave-Laplagne (1743‚Äì1814) and Jeanne-Marie Barris (c. 1755‚Äì1801), both from notable bourgeois families. He studied at the Ecole polytechnique, graduating in 1813 as an Artillery Lieutenant. He participated in Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e in the last campaigns on the Empire. After the Bourbon Restoration he resigned from the army. Lacave-Laplagne took up the study of law, and was admitted to the bar in Toulouse. In 1819 he entered the judiciary as a crown prosecutor. On 27 March 1819 he married his first cousin, Marie-Charlotte Tarrible (c. 1795‚Äì1871). They were to have four children. In 1821 he was made an auditor at the Court of Accounts. July Monarchy Lacave-Laplagne supported the July Revolution of 1830 and the monarchy of Louis Philippe I. On 13 March 1831 at the recommendation of Baron Louis he was appointed Master Councillor. As the official candidate he ran successfully for election as deputy for the 5th college of Gers (Mirande) on 27 December 1834. He sat in the center, supported the government, and became noticed as a skilled speaker on a variety of topics. On 15 April 1837 Lacave-Laplagne was asked to take the Finance portfolio in the second ministry of Louis-Mathieu Mol√©. He was reelected on 20 May 1837, and again on 4 November 1837 and 2 March 1939. As minister he had to defend all the draft financial laws of the government, including laws on pension conversion, slavery, forest clearance, railways, the budget and taxes. On 22 January 1839 the cabinet ministers resigned due to lack of support in the chamber. On 2 February 1839 the chamber of deputies was dissolved. Elections were held on 2 March 1839, but the new chamber would not support the government. The ministry was finally dismissed on 8 March 1839. Lacave- Laplagne returned to his seat in the Chamber with the conservative majority, and continued to participate in all discussions about public works and finance. Lacave-Laplagne was again given the Finance portfolio when Georges Humann died on 25 April 1842, and retained it until 8 May 1847. He was involved in questions that included reducing the size of the army, police, patents, recruitment, conversion of pensions, postal reform, taxes on newspapers and periodicals, railway concessions, customs and salt taxes. Lacave-Laplagne was reelected on 9 July 1842 and 1 August 1846. Last years After the February Revolution of 1848 Lacave-Laplagne returned to private life. He does not seem to have stood for election to the Constituent Assembly. When Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pag√®s, Finance Minister in the Provisional Government (24 February 1848 to 9 May 1848), criticized the financial administration of the July Monarchy, Lacave-Laplagne issued a rebuttal. On 13 May 1849 he was elected deputy for Gers in the Legislative Assembly. He died in Paris the next day, on 14 May 1849, from an attack of gout.

It was created in 1894 as a result of the 1894 Local Government of England and Wales Act and the 1894 election saw the election of the first members of the authority, initially known as the Ystradyfodwg Urban District Council. The Council existed until 1973 and replaced the Ystradyfodwg Local Board of Health which had functioned since the 1870s. . Initially, the Council had fifteen members but this was increased to twenty in 1906, as a result of the increase in population. There were five wards. The first councillors were elected at the 1894 election. From the outset there was a strong representation on the Council of middle-class nonconformist liberals, who were typical of the new elite who rose to prominence in Wales in the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods. Following the inaugural elections there were comparatively few contests during the next few years. In the years leading up to the First World War, representatives of the Labour Party began to gain ground. In 1974 the authority was abolished, and replaced by the Rhondda Borough Council which, in turn, was subsumed into the unitary authority of Rhondda Cynon Taf in 1996. Notable members of the Council  1896 Rhondda Urban District Council election  This was the second election to the authority, originally known as the Ystradyfodwg Urban District Council. The initial election was held in 1894 and this election was followed by the 1897 election. All the wards were uncontested. In four wards, members returned at the previous election were unopposed, while in Ward No.3, the Labour member, Ebenezer davies, checkweigher at the Clydach Vale Colliery did not seek re-election.

Reception is possible on medium wave 1170 kHz in Slovenia, Croatia and North Italy. It is also available on the Satellite through Hot bird. Radio-Television Slovenia is the owner of the Radio.  History  Radio Koper was first heard on 24 May 1949, called Radio jugoslovanske cone Trsta - Radio Trieste zona Jugoslava (Radio Triest, Yugoslav Zone), and it started to broadcast a day later. It was owned by D. D. Radiofonia SA, set up by the then Yugoslav military administration Zone B of the former Free Territory of Trieste. After the abolition of the Free Territory in 1954, it teamed up with Radio Ljubljana and was later known as Radio Koper - Capodistria. Until 1954, it broadcast programs in Slovenian, Italian and Croatian. From 1954 to 1979, the program was mainly in Italian, while two short blocks were reserved to Slovenian in the morning and evening time. In 1979, the two linguistic versions of the radio separated, each with its own transmitter network. Studio Nova Gorica] became operational in 1980, and in 1992 Radio Koper expanded into the Slovenian holding as an all-day radio broadcast. Radio Koper - Capodistria as a border and minority radio station played a very important role in the history of this area in bringing together neighbouring nations, especially during the Cold War. For many years Radio Capodistria was one of the three most listened radio stations in Italy, its signal is stretched even to the shores of Africa, carrying Socialist and Titoist cross-border propaganda particularly appreciated by the members and sympathisers of the Italian Communist Party, particularly its youth. After the independence of Slovenia, Radio Koper became an organisational unit of RTV Slovenia, which has eliminated the transmission system in Italy, while the cross-border program shifted to minority and regional.  Programming and rating  Radio Koper is the most listened radio station in the Slovenian Littoral and on both sides of the Slovenian-Italian border. Many listeners also come from Croatian Istria. In 2011 it was among the ten most listened radio stations in Slovenia (official data radiometry carried out by the agency Mediapool). Radio Koper created a program that combines the informational, cultural, educational, children's, music, entertainment and sports programs. Its own program begins at 5:00 and ends at 24:00. During this time, the radio plays three regional news programs, five reports and a lot of voice and music broadcasts. During the night it broadcasts the night program of Radio Slovenija 1, which it also prepares every Friday from the studios of Koper and Nova Gorica. In addition to regular programs, which are being prepared for all three programs, the contributions daily presence in news programming. Radio Koper is distinguished by its rich musical productions and is also establishing itself as a promoter of cultural and social events throughout the coastal region, including that in Italy, where Slovenians live.  Infrastructures  The Hendrix Studio of Radio Koper is designed for the recording and production of classical, choral and pop music. It is used for the most demanding technical music radio shows, roundtables and confrontation. It is a technologically modern music production studio, which for many years has been famous for its excellent acoustic characteristics such as the recording control box. Radio Koper's Fonoteka keeps the archives of music and recordings from the beginning of broadcasting of the Slovenian and Italian program on different media. On the shelves is also has over 25,000 strips, 44,000 LPs, CDs 22100, 2000 CD-house production - recorded in the studio Hendrix and beyond 1100 DAT tapes. At present, the entire archive is in the process of digitisation.
