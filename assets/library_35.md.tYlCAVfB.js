Puffballs are in the division Basidiomycota and encompass several genera, including Calvatia, Calbovista and Lycoperdon. True puffballs do not have a visible stalk or stem. The puffballs were previously treated as a taxonomic group called the Gasteromycetes or Gasteromycetidae, but they are now known to be a polyphyletic assemblage. The distinguishing feature of all puffballs is that they do not have an open cap with spore-bearing gills. Instead, spores are produced internally, in a spheroidal fruitbody called a gasterothecium (gasteroid ('stomach-like') basidiocarp). As the spores mature, they form a mass called a gleba in the centre of the fruitbody that is often of a distinctive color and texture. The basidiocarp remains closed until after the spores have been released from the basidia. Eventually, it develops an aperture, or dries, becomes brittle, and splits, and the spores escape. The spores of puffballs are statismospores rather than ballistospores, meaning they are not forcibly extruded from the basidium. Puffballs and similar forms are thought to have evolved convergently (that is, in numerous independent events) from Hymenomycetes by gasteromycetation, through secotioid stages. Thus, 'Gasteromycetes' and 'Gasteromycetidae' are now considered to be descriptive, morphological terms (more properly gasteroid or gasteromycetes, to avoid taxonomic implications) but not valid cladistic terms. Stalked puffballs do have a stalk that supports the gleba. None of the stalked puffballs are edible as they are tough and woody mushrooms. The Hymenogastrales and Enteridium lycoperdon, a slime mold, are the false puffballs. A gleba which is powdery on maturity is a feature of true puffballs, stalked puffballs and earthstars. False puffballs are hard like rock or brittle. All false puffballs are inedible, as they are tough and bitter to taste. The genus Scleroderma, which has a young purple gleba, should also be avoided. Puffballs were traditionally used in Tibet for making ink by burning them, grinding the ash, then putting them in water and adding glue liquid and \\"a nye shing ma decoction\\", which, when pressed for a long time, made a black dark substance that was used as ink.Cuppers, Christoph (1989). \\"On the Manufacture of Ink.\\" Ancient Nepal - Journal of the Department of Archaeology, Number 113, August‚ÄìSeptember 1989, p. 5. Edibility and identification Spores coming out of puffball fungus While most puffballs are not poisonous, some often look similar to young agarics, and especially the deadly Amanitas, such as the death cap or destroying angel mushrooms. It is for this reason that all puffballs gathered in mushroom hunting are cut in half lengthwise. Young puffballs in the edible stage, before maturation of the gleba, have undifferentiated white flesh within; whereas the gills of immature Amanita mushrooms can be seen if they are closely examined. Puffball mushrooms on sale at a market in England The giant puffball, Calvatia gigantea (earlier classified as Lycoperdon giganteum), reaches a foot (30 cm) or more in diameter, and is difficult to mistake for any other fungus. It has been estimated that a large specimen of this fungus when mature will produce around 7 √ó 10¬π¬≤ spores. If collected before spores have formed, while the flesh is still white, it may be cooked as slices fried in butter, with a strong earthy, mushroom flavor. Not all true puffball mushrooms are without stalks. Some may also be stalked like the Podaxis pistillaris which is also called the \\"false shaggy mane\\".

It is a necessary element of many crimes. The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, i.e. \\"the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty\\".Lanius, D., Strategic Indeterminacy in the Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019), p. 113. In jurisdictions with due process, there must be both actus reus (\\"guilty act\\") and mens rea for a defendant to be guilty of a crime (see concurrence). As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in criminal law. Exceptions are known as strict liability crimes. Moreover, when a person intends a harm, but because of bad aim or other cause, the intent is transferred from an intended victim to an unintended victim, the case is considered to be a matter of transferred intent.Hall, D. E., Criminal Law and Procedure (Boston: Cengage Learning, 2015), pp. 63‚Äì64. In civil law, it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort, for example. But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability and the damages payable to the plaintiff. In some jurisdictions, the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology.Child, J., & Ormerod, D., Smith, Hogan, and Ormerod's Essentials of Criminal Law, 2nd ed., (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 95.Ibid., 3rd ed., 2019, p. 84.  Levels of mens rea  Under the traditional common law, the guilt or innocence of a person relied upon whether he had committed the crime (actus reus), and whether he intended to commit the crime (mens rea). However, many modern penal codes have created levels of mens rea called modes of culpability, which depend on the surrounding elements of the crime: the conduct, the circumstances, and the result, or what the Model Penal Code calls CAR (conduct, attendant circumstances, result). The definition of a crime is thus constructed using only these elements rather than the colorful language of mens rea: The traditional common law definitions and the modern definitions approach the crime from different angles. In the common law approach, the definition includes: #actus reus: unlawful killing of a human being; #mens rea: malice aforethought. Modern law approaches the analysis somewhat differently. Homicide is a \\"results\\" crime in that it forbids any \\"intentional\\" or \\"knowing\\" conduct that results in the death of another human being. \\"Intentional\\" in this sense means the actor possessed a \\"purpose\\" or \\"desire\\" that his or her objective (i.e. death of another human being) be achieved. \\"Knowing\\" means that the actor was aware or practically certain that the death would result. Thus, the actus reus and mens rea of homicide in a modern criminal statute can be considered as follows: #actus reus: any conduct resulting in the death of another individual; #mens rea: intent or knowledge that the conduct would result in the death. In the modern approach, the attendant circumstances tend to replace the traditional mens rea, indicating the level of culpability as well as other circumstances. For example, the crime of theft of government property would include as an attendant circumstance that the property belong to the government.  Modes of culpability  The levels of mens rea and the distinction between them vary among jurisdictions. Although common law originated from England, the common law of each jurisdiction with regard to culpability varies as precedents and statutes vary. = England and Wales = *Direct intention: the actor has a clear foresight of the consequences of his actions, and desires those consequences to occur. It's his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence (death). *Oblique intention: the result is a virtually certain consequence or a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case. *Knowingly: the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur. *Recklessness: the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not. *Criminal negligence: the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences. = Scotland = *Intention: the accused willingly committed a criminal act entirely aware of his actions and their consequences. Necessary for murder and for assault. *Recklessness: the accused was aware the criminal act could be potentially dangerous but did not give a second thought to its consequences, for example, involuntary culpable homicide. = United States =  State criminal law  The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the several states in accordance with the laws of the state in question. Historically, the states (with the partial exception of civil-law Louisiana) applied common law rules of mens rea similar to those extant in England, but over time American understandings of common law mens rea terms diverged from those of English law and from each other. By the late 1950s to early 1960s, the common law of mens rea was widely acknowledged to be a slippery, vague, and confused mess. This was one of several factors that led to the development of the Model Penal Code. = Model Penal Code = Since its publication in 1957, the formulation of mens rea set forth in the Model Penal Code has been highly influential throughout the US in clarifying the discussion of the different modes of culpability. The following levels of mens rea are found in the MPC:Blond, N. C., Criminal Law (Alphen aan den Rijn: Wolters Kluwer, 2007), pp. 60‚Äì62. *Strict liability: the actor engaged in conduct and his mental state is irrelevant. Under Model Penal Code Section 2.05, this mens rea may only be applied where the forbidden conduct is a mere violation, i.e. a civil infraction. *Negligently: a \\"reasonable person\\" would be aware of a \\"substantial and unjustifiable risk\\" that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, will lead to a prohibited result, and/or is under prohibited attendant circumstances, and the actor was not so aware but should have been. *Recklessly: the actor consciously disregards a \\"substantial and unjustifiable risk\\" that his conduct will lead to a prohibited result and/or is of a prohibited nature. *Knowingly: the actor is practically certain that his conduct will lead to the result, or is aware to a high probability that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, or is aware to a high probability that the attendant circumstances exist. *Purposefully: the actor has the \\"conscious object\\" of engaging in conduct and believes or hopes that the attendant circumstances exist. Except for strict liability, these classes of mens rea are defined in Section 2.02(2) of the MPC.  Federal criminal law  Since the federal government of the United States does not have a generalized police power like that of the states, the scope of its criminal statutes is necessarily circumscribed. Ordinary prosecutions are the province of the states, and only crimes of special federal import are pursued by the federal government. Consequently, Title 18 of the United States Code does not use the aforementioned culpability scheme but relies instead on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law. For example, malice aforethought is used as a requirement for committing capital murder. = Canada = The Supreme Court of Canada has found that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees a minimum requirement for the mental state of various crimes. For example, the crime of murder must include a mental requirement of at least subjective foresight of death. For crimes where imprisonment is a sanction, there is a requirement of at least a defence of due diligence. = Australia = Mens rea needs to be proved by prosecution from offence to offence. If it is a common law offence, mens rea is found out by relevant precedent (DPP v Morgan [1976] AC 182). Where the offence is in legislation, the requisite mens rea is found by interpreting the intention of the legislation. They must intend to commit the full offence. = India = Mens Rea in the Indian Penal Code 1860 sets out the definition of offences, the general conditions of liability, the conditions of exemptions from liability and punishments for the respective offences. Legislatures had not used the common law doctrine of mens rea in defining these crimes. However, they preferred to import it by using different terms indicating the required evil intent or mens rea as an essence of a particular offence. Guilt in respect to almost all offences created under the IPC is fastened either on the ground of intention, knowledge or reason to believe. Almost all the offences under the IPC are qualified by one or other words such as 'wrongful gain or loss', 'dishonesty', 'fraudulently', 'reason to believe', 'criminal knowledge or intention', 'intentional cooperation', 'voluntarily', 'malignantly', 'wantonly', 'maliciously'. All these words indicate the blameworthy mental condition required at the time of commission of the offence, nowhere found in the IPC, its essence is reflected in almost all the provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Every offence created under the IPC virtually imports the idea of criminal intent or mens rea in some form or other. = Islamic law =  Ignorance of law contrasted with mens rea  The general rule under common law and statutory law is that \\"ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution.\\" However, in some cases, courts have held that if knowledge of a law, or if intent to break a law, is a material element of an offense, then a defendant may use good faith ignorance as a defense: Crimes like tax evasion are specific intent crimes and require intent to violate the law as an element of the offense. In R. v. Klundert, for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found as follows: :\\"[55] Section 239(1)(d) is part of an Act which is necessarily and notoriously complex. It is subject to ongoing revision. No lay person is expected to know all the complexities of the tax laws. It is accepted that people will act on the advice of professionals and that the advice will often turn on the meanings to be given to provisions in the Act that are open to various interpretations. Furthermore, it is accepted that one may legitimately structure one's affairs so as to minimize tax liability. Considered in this legislative context, I have no difficulty in holding that a mistake or ignorance as to one's liability to pay tax under the Act may negate the fault requirement in the provision, regardless of whether it is a factual mistake, a legal mistake, or a combination of both.\\" A good-faith belief that a law is unjust or unconstitutional is no excuse, but \\"reasonable compliance upon an official statement of law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous\\" does not constitute a criminal act. However, a law must be reasonably clear; it must be worded so that a reasonable layman can comprehend the specific prohibited acts. Otherwise, the law may be unconstitutional pursuant to the Vagueness doctrine.  Subjective and objective tests  The test for the existence of mens rea may be: :(a) subjective, where the court must be satisfied that the accused actually had the requisite mental element present in his or her mind at the relevant time (for purposely, knowingly, recklessly etc) (see concurrence); :(b) objective, where the requisite mens rea element is imputed to the accused, on the basis that a reasonable person would have had the mental element in the same circumstances (for negligence); or :(c) hybrid, where the test is both subjective and objective. The court will have little difficulty in establishing mens rea if there is actual evidencefor instance, if the accused made an admissible admission. This would satisfy a subjective test. But a significant proportion of those accused of crimes makes no such admission. Hence, some degree of objectivity must be brought to bear as the basis upon which to impute the necessary component(s). It is always reasonable to assume that people of ordinary intelligence are aware of their physical surroundings and of the ordinary laws of cause and effect (see causation). Thus, when a person plans what to do and what not to do, he will understand the range of likely outcomes from given behaviour on a sliding scale from \\"inevitable\\" to \\"probable\\" to \\"possible\\" to \\"improbable\\". The more an outcome shades towards the \\"inevitable\\" end of the scale, the more likely it is that the accused both foresaw and desired it, and, therefore, the safer it is to impute intention. If there is clear subjective evidence that the accused did not have foresight, but a reasonable person would have, the hybrid test may find criminal negligence. In terms of the burden of proof, the requirement is that a jury must have a high degree of certainty before convicting, defined as \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" in the United States and \\"sure\\" in the United Kingdom. It is this reasoning that justifies the defenses of infancy, and of lack of mental capacity under the M'Naghten Rules, an alternate common law rule (e.g., Durham rule), and one of various statutes defining mental illness as an excuse. Moreover, if there is an irrebuttable presumption of doli incapax ‚Äì that is, that the accused did not have sufficient understanding of the nature and quality of his actionsthen the requisite mens rea is absent no matter what degree of probability might otherwise have been present. For these purposes, therefore, where the relevant statutes are silent and it is for the common law to form the basis of potential liability, the reasonable person must be endowed with the same intellectual and physical qualities as the accused, and the test must be whether an accused with these specific attributes would have had the requisite foresight and desire. In English law, s8 Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides a statutory framework within which mens rea is assessed. It states: :A court or jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offense, ::(a) shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reasons only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions; but ::(b) shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances. Under s8(b) therefore, the jury is allowed a wide latitude in applying a hybrid test to impute intention or foresight (for the purposes of recklessness) on the basis of all the evidence.  Relevance of motive  One of the mental components often raised in issue is that of motive. If the accused admits to having a motive consistent with the elements of foresight and desire, this will add to the level of probability that the actual outcome was intended (it makes the prosecution case more credible). But if there is clear evidence that the accused had a different motive, this may decrease the probability that he or she desired the actual outcome. In such a situation, the motive may become subjective evidence that the accused did not intend, but was reckless or willfully blind. Motive cannot be a defense. If, for example, a person breaks into a laboratory used for the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals, the question of guilt is determined by the presence of an actus reus, i.e. entry without consent and damage to property, and a mens rea, i.e. intention to enter and cause the damage. That the person might have had a clearly articulated political motive to protest such testing does not affect liability. If motive has any relevance, this may be addressed in the sentencing part of the trial, when the court considers what punishment, if any, is appropriate.  Intention   Recklessness (United States: \\"willful blindness\\")  In such cases, there is clear subjective evidence that the accused foresaw but did not desire the particular outcome. When the accused failed to stop the given behavior, he took the risk of causing the given loss or damage. There is always some degree of intention subsumed within recklessness.Duff, R. A., & Green, S., eds., Philosophical Foundations of Criminal Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 257.Allen, M. J., & Edwards, I., Criminal Law, 15th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019), p. 81. During the course of the conduct, the accused foresees that he may be putting another at risk of injury: A choice must be made at that point in time. By deciding to proceed, the accused actually intends the other to be exposed to the risk of that injury. The greater the probability of that risk maturing into the foreseen injury, the greater the degree of recklessness and, subsequently, sentence rendered. In common law, for example, an unlawful homicide committed recklessly would ordinarily constitute the crime of voluntary manslaughter. One committed with \\"extreme\\" or \\"gross\\" recklessness as to human life would constitute murder, sometimes defined as \\"depraved heart\\" or \\"abandoned and malignant heart\\" or \\"depraved indifference\\" murder.Carlan, P., Nored, L. S., & Downey, R. A., An Introduction to Criminal Law (Burlington, MA: Jones and Bartlett, 2011), p. 82.  Criminal negligence  Here, the test is both subjective and objective. There is credible subjective evidence that the particular accused neither foresaw nor desired the particular outcome, thus potentially excluding both intention and recklessness. But a reasonable person with the same abilities and skills as the accused would have foreseen and taken precautions to prevent the loss and damage being sustained. Only a small percentage of offences are defined with this mens rea requirement. Most legislatures prefer to base liability on either intention or recklessness and, faced with the need to establish recklessness as the default mens rea for guilt, those practising in most legal systems rely heavily on objective tests to establish the minimum requirement of foresight for recklessness.

The city covers more than and is the second-largest city in Cameron County, as well as the fourth-largest in the Rio Grande Valley. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 64,849, for a growth rate of 12.5% since the 2000 census. Harlingen is a principal city of the Brownsville‚ÄìHarlingen metropolitan area, which is part of the larger Brownsville-Harlingen- Raymondville combined statistical area, included in the Matamoros‚ÄìBrownsville metropolitan area. History A drawing of Lon Hill in 1912 Harlingen's Jackson Street in the late 1950s Harlingen's strategic location at the intersection of U.S. Route 77 and U.S. Route 83, co-designated as Interstate 69 East and Interstate 2, respectively, in northwestern Cameron County, fostered its development as a distribution, shipping, and industrial center. In 1904, Lon C. Hill (a man of Choctaw ancestry) envisioned the Rio Grande as a commercial waterway. He named the town he founded on the north bank after the Frisian city of Harlingen, in the Netherlands. The town's post office was established that year. The first school opened with 15 pupils in 1905 near the Hill home, the first residence built in Harlingen. Harlingen incorporated on April 15, 1910, when the population totaled 1,126. In 1920, the census listed 1,748. The local economy at first was almost entirely agricultural, with the chief crops vegetables and cotton. World War II military installations in Harlingen caused a jump in population from 23,000 in 1950 to 41,000 by 1960. Harlingen Army Air Field preceded Harlingen Air Force Base, which closed in 1962. The city's population fell to 33,603 by 1972, then climbed to 40,824 by 1980. Local enterprise, focused on the purchase and use of the abandoned base and related housing, laid the groundwork for continuing progress through a diversified economy. The estimated population in July 1985 was 49,000, of which about 80% was Hispanic. In the late 1980s, income from tourism ranked second only to citrus fruit production, with grain and cotton next in order. The addition of wholesale and retail trade, light and medium manufacturing, and an array of service industries has broadened the economic base. Large- scale construction for multifaceted retirement communities is a new phase of industrial development. The City of Harlingen operates a busy industrial airpark where bombers used to land. At Valley International Airport, the Confederate Air Force (now Commemorative Air Force) occupied hangar and apron space until 1991. The first hospital in Harlingen opened in 1923, and consisted of little more than two barracks as wings. The Valley Baptist Hospital was built nearby a few years later, and eventually the older hospital closed. The Valley Baptist Hospital has grown into the Valley Baptist Medical Center. The city's outstanding network of health-care specialists and facilities parallels the growth of the still-expanding center. Also serving regional health needs are the South Texas State Chest Hospital, the State Hospital for Children, and the Rio Grande State Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center. Besides public and church-affiliated schools, Harlingen students attend the University Preparatory School, the Marine Military Academy, Texas State Technical College, or Rio Grande Vocational and Rehabilitation classes. Civic and cultural development in Harlingen has kept pace with the growth of the community. Fraternal orders and civic organizations operating in the community include Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, Optimist, 20‚Äì30, VFW, American Legion, and the Lower Valley Cotillion Club; a woman's building is maintained as a center for the activities of the many woman's clubs active in the city. Development and appreciation of the fine arts are encouraged by organizations such as the Rio Grande Valley Art League, the Art Forum, and the Rio Grande Valley Civic Association, which stages its winter concert series at the 2,300-seat Harlingen Municipal Auditorium. Each March, Harlingen is the site of the Rio Grande Valley International Music Festival. The city has two newspapers‚Äîthe Harlingen Press, a weekly paper established in 1951, and the Valley Morning Star, a daily established in 1911. In 1990, the population was 48,735.

It is named after Cesare Burali-Forti, who, in 1897, published a paper proving a theorem which, unknown to him, contradicted a previously proved result by Cantor. Bertrand Russell subsequently noticed the contradiction, and when he published it in his 1903 book Principles of Mathematics, he stated that it had been suggested to him by Burali-Forti's paper, with the result that it came to be known by Burali-Forti's name. Stated in terms of von Neumann ordinals We will prove this by reductio ad absurdum. # Let \\\\Omega be a set that contains all ordinal numbers. # \\\\Omega is transitive because for every element x of \\\\Omega (which is an ordinal number and can be any ordinal number) and every element y of x (i.e. under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, for every ordinal number y < x), we have that y is an element of \\\\Omega because any ordinal number contains only ordinal numbers, by the definition of this ordinal construction. # \\\\Omega is well ordered by the membership relation because all its elements are also well ordered by this relation. # So, by steps 2 and 3, we have that \\\\Omega is an ordinal class and also, by step 1, an ordinal number, because all ordinal classes that are sets are also ordinal numbers. # This implies that \\\\Omega is an element of \\\\Omega. # Under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, \\\\Omega < \\\\Omega is the same as \\\\Omega being an element of \\\\Omega. This latter statement is proven by step 5. # But we have that no ordinal class is less than itself, including \\\\Omega because of step 4 (\\\\Omega is an ordinal class), i.e. \\\\Omega less \\\\Omega. We've deduced two contradictory propositions (\\\\Omega < \\\\Omega and \\\\Omega less \\\\Omega) from the sethood of \\\\Omega and, therefore, disproved that \\\\Omega is a set. Stated more generally The version of the paradox above is anachronistic, because it presupposes the definition of the ordinals due to John von Neumann, under which each ordinal is the set of all preceding ordinals, which was not known at the time the paradox was framed by Burali-Forti. Here is an account with fewer presuppositions: suppose that we associate with each well-ordering an object called its order type in an unspecified way (the order types are the ordinal numbers). The order types (ordinal numbers) themselves are well- ordered in a natural way, and this well-ordering must have an order type \\\\Omega. It is easily shown in na√Øve set theory (and remains true in ZFC but not in New Foundations) that the order type of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed \\\\alpha is \\\\alpha itself. So the order type of all ordinal numbers less than \\\\Omega is \\\\Omega itself. But this means that \\\\Omega, being the order type of a proper initial segment of the ordinals, is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals, but the latter is \\\\Omega itself by definition. This is a contradiction. If we use the von Neumann definition, under which each ordinal is identified as the set of all preceding ordinals, the paradox is unavoidable: the offending proposition that the order type of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed \\\\alpha is \\\\alpha itself must be true. The collection of von Neumann ordinals, like the collection in the Russell paradox, cannot be a set in any set theory with classical logic. But the collection of order types in New Foundations (defined as equivalence classes of well-orderings under similarity) is actually a set, and the paradox is avoided because the order type of the ordinals less than \\\\Omega turns out not to be \\\\Omega. Resolutions of the paradox Modern axioms for formal set theory such as ZF and ZFC circumvent this antinomy by not allowing the construction of sets using terms like \\"all sets with the property P\\", as is possible in naive set theory and as is possible with Gottlob Frege's axiomsspecifically Basic Law Vin the \\"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.\\" Quine's system New Foundations (NF) uses a different solution. showed that in the original version of Quine's system \\"Mathematical Logic\\" (ML), an extension of New Foundations, it is possible to derive the Burali-Forti paradox, showing that this system was contradictory. Quine's revision of ML following Rosser's discovery does not suffer from this defect, and indeed was subsequently proved equiconsistent with NF by Hao Wang.

It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way upstream in a series of waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out. Bores are present on about 130 days in the year, concentrated on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on such things as the time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.  Formation  The Severn Estuary, which empties into the Bristol Channel, has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world ‚Äì about . It is exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy, and possibly Ungava Bay, both in Canada. The tidal wave starts far out in mid- ocean. It moves towards the continent of Europe at about 700miles wide/(1126 Km ). When it reaches the continental shelf, its width decreases to about 200 miles wide/320 km, and its amplitude increases. Approaching the Bristol Channel, a segment of the wave has to accommodate to the ever-decreasing width by raising its height. When it reaches the Severn proper, its width has decreased from a or so to less than , and its height is nearly . As the bed of the estuary starts to rise and the sides continue to converge, the bore forms and begins to surge up the river in a tidal stream. The front edge of the wave is steep and the trailing edge flatter. The bore consists of three or four sizeable waves followed by a few of diminishing size. As with other waves, the wave tends to break in shallow places and near the bank, and flow smoothly in deep water. The wave travels upstream against the river current at a speed of . In the lower, broader part of the estuary near Avonmouth, the tidal surge advances as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to the eastern side of the river. Above Longney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so. Timing This bore, near the Severn Bore Inn, was smaller than predicted. The largest bores occur around the times of the equinoxes but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores are associated with the phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima. Timetables for the bore and predictions of bore heights are published each year, however, the heights and timings are subject to minor variations. The bore height is increased by a strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, about of fresh water below Gloucester and well-scoured channels in the estuary. The height is decreased by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure and little fresh water below Gloucester or excessive fresh water. The bore is made earlier by strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, between two and five feet of fresh water, and shorter and well-scoured channels in the estuary. Conversely, it is delayed by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure, little fresh water and more meandering, poorly scoured channels. The wind direction out at sea is of more significance than the local air-flow. Being the onset of the flood tide, the bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn bore is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or soliton but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above the bore (see tidal bore for more details). The passing of the bore causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by the bore. The largest recorded bore was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of at Stonebench.  Viewpoints  The Severn bore near Over Bridge There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths. Crowds often assemble at popular viewing points and car parking may prove difficult. Related to the time of the high tide at Sharpness, the bore passes Newnham on Severn one hour before this, Framilode and Arlingham, twenty-five minutes before, Epney twenty minutes before, Minsterworth at the high tide, Stonebench, on the east bank, fifteen minutes after the high tide and Over Bridge thirty-five minutes afterwards. One of the main viewpoints is at Minsterworth at the Severn Bore Inn on the A48. Another good place to see the spectacle is Over Bridge, but the view here is rather restricted by the adjacent railway bridge.  Transport and surfing  The River Severn is considered a navigable river and Gloucester used to be an important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester. Surfers riding the Severn bore River surfing enthusiasts attempt to surf along on the wave, which can be high. The river was first surfed in 1955 by World War II veteran Jack Churchill, a Military Cross recipient renowned both for carrying a Scottish broadsword, and for being the only Allied soldier to kill an enemy with a longbow during the war. He became a surfing enthusiast in his later life and rode the bore on a board he designed himself. In September 2005, several hundred surfers gathered in Newnham on Severn to celebrate 50 years since the first recorded attempt at surfing the Severn bore and to view the premi√®re of Longwave by Donny Wright, a historical film documenting the evolution of the sport since its inception in 1955. In March 2006, Steve King, a railway engineer from Gloucestershire, set a world record for the longest surfing ride on a river bore while riding the Severn bore; King surfed up the river for a distance of , a Guinness World Record. On days when a large bore is expected, hundreds of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, waiting for the waves to arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for this part of the river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the bore. Historical accounts An eighteenth century account of the bore that has been attributed to Charles Blagden (died 1820), secretary of the Royal Society, is in the collection of the Gloucestershire Archives under reference Glos. R.O., D 1914. In the account, the author described it rising to eight feet and how he rode on horseback between bends in the river in order to \\"overtake\\" the bore as observers still attempt to do. The phenomenon is referred to as a \\"head of tide\\" with the author noting at the end that elsewhere such things are known as a \\"boar\\" or \\"bore\\".\\"The Severn Bore\\" , Irvine Gray, Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, Vol. 97, pp. 123-126.

Since the beginning of the 19th century, it had been the practice of the Royal Navy to add lemon juice to the sailors' daily ration of grog (watered-down rum). The vitamin C (specifically acid) in citrus fruits prevented scurvy and helped to make these sailors some of the healthiest of the time. At that time, \\"lemon\\" and \\"lime\\" were used interchangeably to refer to citrus fruits.Maciej Ceg≈Çowski, 2010-03-06, \\"Scott and Scurvy\\". Retrieved 2016-05-31. Initially, lemon juice (from lemons imported from Europe) was used as the additive to grog on the Royal Navy ships but was later switched to limes (grown in British colonies), not realizing that limes contained only a quarter of the vitamin C the lemons had, and that the way the juice was stored and processed destroyed much of that, leaving the lime juice unable to prevent scurvy. In time, the term lost its naval connotation and was used to refer to British people in general, and in the 1880s, British immigrants in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Although the term may have been used earlier in the U.S. Navy as slang for a British sailor or a British warship, such usage was not documented until 1918. By 1925, the usage of limey in American English had been extended to mean any British person, and the term was so commonly known that it was featured in American newspaper headlines.

The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.

Swift, a figure in the early Christian Identity movement. Swift combined British Israelism, extreme antisemitism, and political militancy. He founded his own church in California in the mid-1940s. He hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, the name of his church was changed to the Church of Jesus Christ‚ÄìChristian, which continues to be used by Aryan Nations churches. From the late 1970s until 2001, Aryan Nations headquarters was located in a 20-acre (8.1 ha) compound 1.8 miles (3 km) north of Hayden, Idaho. Aryan Nations had a number of state chapters, but it was highly decentralized and the chapter ties to the organization's headquarters were extremely loose. The group hosted an annual World Congress of Aryan Nations at Hayden Lake for Aryan Nations members and members of similar groups. Until 1998, the leadership of Aryan Nations remained firmly in the hands of Richard Girnt Butler. By that time, he was over 80 years old and was in poor health. At the annual Aryan Nations World Congress in 2001, Neuman Britton was appointed as Butler's successor. But in August 2001, after Britton died, Butler appointed Harold Ray Redfeairn from Ohio as his successor; he had been agitating for control of the organization since the mid-1990s. Redfeairn had brought in Dave Hall, an FBI informant who exposed the group's illegal activities.Hall, Dave; Tym Burkey, Katherine Ramsland (2008). Into the Devil's Den (1st ed.). New York: Ballantine Books. . After this was discovered, Redfeairn was distrusted by some in the group. Redfeairn and August Kreis III, the propaganda minister for Aryan Nations, formed a splinter group, and Butler expelled them from Aryan Nations. A few months later, Redfeairn returned to form an alliance with Butler. Butler's 2002 World Congress drew fewer than 100 people, and when he ran for mayor, he lost, garnering only 50 votes against more than 2,100 votes. Redfeairn died in October 2003, and Butler died of heart failure in September 2004. At the time of Butler's death, Aryan Nations about 200 actively participating members. =Shooting and lawsuit= In September 2000, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) won a $6.3 million judgment against Aryan Nations from an Idaho jury, who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to plaintiffs Victoria Keenan and her son Jason. The two Native Americans had been beaten with rifles by Aryan Nations security guards in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in July 1998. The woman and her son were driving near the Aryan Nations compound when their car backfired, which the guards claimed to misinterpret as gunfire. The guards fired at the car, striking it several times. The car crashed and one of the Nations guards held the Keenans at gunpoint, beating them. The SPLC filed suit on behalf of the Keenans. A jury found that Butler and Aryan Nations were grossly negligent in selecting and supervising the guards, and awarded the Keenans $6.3 million. A local attorney from the Keenan's legal team said that the large verdict was partly to compensate the Keenans, but largely to punish Butler and his followers, and serve to deter similar conduct in the future. The $6.3 million verdict caused Butler to file for bankruptcy one month later. As part of the bankruptcy process, the group's property was put up for auction. SPLC loaned the Keenans $95,000 to bid on the 20-acre property. In February 2001, the group's Hayden Lake compound and intellectual property, including the names \\"Aryan Nations\\" and \\"Church of Jesus Christ Christian\\", were transferred to the Keenans. Idaho native and millionaire philanthropist Greg Carr purchased the property from the Keenans, donating it to the North Idaho College Foundation. It has been converted to a park dedicated to peace. Local fire departments demolished some of the church's former buildings by burning them during training exercises. Edgar Steele, the attorney who had represented Butler, was later convicted of hiring a handyman to kill his own wife. In 2014, Steele died while serving a 50-year prison sentence. =Split and decline= There are three main Aryan Nations factions. One was led by Charles John Juba, followed by August Kreis III. In 2012, Kreis stepped down as leader and designated Drew Bostwick as his successor. In 2002, Juba's group was based on a compound in the rural town of Ulysses in Potter County, north central Pennsylvania; it hosted the 2002 Aryan Nations World Congress. Juba resigned in March 2005, announcing that Kreis was the group's new leader. Kreis established a new headquarters in Lexington, South Carolina and eventually moved it to near Union City, Tennessee. In 2005, Kreis received media attention by seeking an Aryan Nations‚Äìal Qaeda alliance. In 2005, the Holy Order of the Phineas Priesthood, formerly in association with the faction operated by Kreis, seceded and formed Aryan Nations Revival, based in New York City. The Holy Order was created in opposition to Kreis's acceptance of adherents of Wicca, Islam, and Odinism. It considered such groups to be a deviation from the core Christian Identity belief of Aryan Nations. This Revival rapidly became the largest faction. Aryan Nations Revival leaders were listed in the Congressional Record as domestic terrorists. The government concluded that the Holy Order of the Brotherhood of the Phinehas Priesthood was the enforcement/terrorist wing of Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations Revival hosted a weekly radio broadcast titled The Aryan Nations Broadcast. Airing from 1979 to 2009, the radio program was authorized by Richard Butler. The program ended when host Hal Turner was arrested for threatening the lives of federal judges in Chicago. While incarcerated, Turner announced, through his attorney, that he was a federal informant, and that Aryan Nations was among those organizations which had been informed upon. In 2009, Aryan Nations Revival, which was then based in Texas, merged with Pastor Jerald O'Brien's Aryan Nations, which was based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Both parties were ardent Christian Identity adherents. Associates In 1983, Robert Jay Mathews, who had visited the Aryan Nations compound many times, formed The Order, along with Aryan Nations members Dan Bauer, Randy Duey, Denver Parmenter, and Bruce Pierce. The Order's mission was to overthrow the Zionist Occupational Government and establish the Northwest Territorial Imperative through an orchestrated plan of domestic terrorism, to include murder, arson, armed robbery, theft, counterfeiting, and extortion between 1983 and 1984. Dennis McGiffen, who also had ties to Aryan Nations, formed a group called \\"The New Order\\", inspired by Mathews' group. The members were arrested before they could follow through with their violent plans. Buford O. Furrow, Jr., who was convicted of both the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting and the murder of Filipino American postal worker Joseph Ileto, had earlier worked as a security guard for some time at the Aryan Nations compound.

For example, the statement \\"all cell phones in the room are turned off\\" will be true even if there are no cell phones in the room. In this case, the statement \\"all cell phones in the room are turned on\\" would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: \\"all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off\\". For that reason, it is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true only because it does not really say anything. More formally, a relatively well-defined usage refers to a conditional statement (or a universal conditional statement) with a false antecedent. One example of such a statement is \\"if London is in France, then the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia\\". Such statements are considered vacuous truths, because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the consequent. In essence, they are true because a material conditional is defined to be true when the antecedent is false (regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false). In pure mathematics, vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by mathematical induction.. This notion has relevance in pure mathematics, as well as in any other field that uses classical logic. Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about qualified objects which do not actually exist. For example, a child might tell their parent \\"I ate every vegetable on my plate\\", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with. In addition, vacuous truth is often used colloquially with absurd statements about the speaker, either to confidently assert something (e.g. \\"the dog was red, or I'm a monkey's uncle\\"), or to express doubt, sarcasm, disbelief, incredulity or indignation (e.g. \\"yes, and I'm the Queen of England\\").  Scope of the concept  A statement S is \\"vacuously true\\", if it resembles the statement P \\\\Rightarrow Q, where P is known to be false. Statements that can be reduced (with suitable transformations) to this basic form include the following universally quantified statements: * \\\\forall x: P(x) \\\\Rightarrow Q(x), where it is the case that \\\\forall x: eg P(x). * \\\\forall x \\\\in A: Q(x), where the set A is empty. * \\\\forall \\\\xi: Q(\\\\xi), where the symbol \\\\xi is restricted to a type that has no representatives. Vacuous truth most commonly appears in classical logic with two truth values. However, vacuous truth can also appear in, for example, intuitionistic logic, in the same situations as given above. Indeed, if P is false, then P \\\\Rightarrow Q will yield vacuous truth in any logic that uses the material conditional; if P is a necessary falsehood, then it will also yield vacuous truth under the strict conditional. Other non- classical logics, such as relevance logic, may attempt to avoid vacuous truths, by using alternative conditionals (such as the case of the counterfactual conditional).  Examples  These examples, one from mathematics and one from natural language, illustrate the concept: * \\"For any integer x, if x > 5 then x > 3.\\" ‚Äì This statement is true non-vacuously (since some integers are indeed greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that \\"if 2 > 5 then 2 > 3\\". * \\"All my children are cats\\" is a vacuous truth, when spoken by someone without children. Similarly, \\"None of my children are cats\\" would also be a vacuous truth, when spoken by the same person.

The group has a presence in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, Palawan, Basilan, and other neighbouring islands. Philippines CIA World Factbook, 2006 The armed wing of the group was the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) although the name of the parent organization MILF, was often used to refer to BIAF. History A Bangsamoro fighter trains with an M60 machine gun. The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) is a Moro and Lumad group formed in 1969 following the Jabidah massacre which happened in 1968 to achieve greater Bangsamoro autonomy in the southern Philippines. The MNLF took part in terrorist attacks and assassinations to achieve their goals. The government in Manila sent troops into the southern Philippines to control the insurgency. In 1976, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi brokered a negotiation between the Philippine government and MNLF Leader Nur Misuari which led to the signing of the MNLF-GRPH Tripoli Agreement of 1976 wherein the MNLF accepted the Philippine government's offer of semi-autonomy of the regions in dispute. The signing of this agreement brought about a serious rift in MNLF leadership, leading to the formation of a breakaway group in 1977 by Hashim Salamat and 57 MNLF officers. The group was initially known as \\"The New Leadership\\". Misuari expelled Salamat in December 1977, after which Salamat moved his new organization first to Cairo, Egypt and then, in 1980, to Lahore, Pakistan, where it engaged in diplomatic activities. This organization was formally established in 1984 as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Muammar Gaddafi became a longstanding supporter of the MILF after its emergence.Qaddafi, terrorism, and the origins of the U.S. attack on Libya (1990). Brian Lee Davis In January 1987, the MNLF accepted the Philippine government's offer of semi- autonomy of the regions in dispute, subsequently leading to the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao on November 6, 1990. The MILF, however, refused to accept this offer and continued their insurgency operations. A general cessation of hostilities between the government in Manila and the MILF was signed in July 1997 but this agreement was abolished in 2000 by the Philippine Army under the administration of Philippine President Joseph Estrada. In response, the MILF declared a jihad against the government, its citizens and supporters. Under President Gloria Arroyo, the government entered into a cease-fire agreement with the MILF and resumed peace talks. Despite peace negotiations and the cease-fire agreement, the MILF attacked government troops in Maguindanao resulting in at least twenty-three deaths in January 2005. The combined armies of the MILF and Abu Sayyaf were involved in days of fighting which necessitated government troops using heavy artillery to engage rebel forces. The bombing incident in Davao Airport in 2003 which the Philippine government blamed on MILF members,President: MILF has until June 1 to cut terror links, Guinto, J. Philippine ‚Äì Daily Inquirer, 13 May (2003) raised speculation that the peace negotiations might be ineffectual in bringing peace to Mindanao if the MILF is unable to control its operatives. The MILF denies ties with terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, although Jemaah Islamiyah is considered to have provided them with training facilities in areas they control. The MILF also continues to deny connections with Al-Qaeda, though it has admitted to sending around 600 volunteers to Al- Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and that Osama Bin Laden sent money to the Philippines, though the group denies directly receiving any payment.Tentacles of terror: Al Qaeda‚Äôs Southeast Asian network, Abuza, Z. Contemporary Southeast Asia 24(3),(2002) From June 28 to July 6, 2006, conflict between the MILF and armed civilian volunteers under Maguindanao Province governor Andal Ampatuan who were supported by the Philippine Army had been reported. The fighting began after governor Ampatuan blamed the MILF for a June 23 bomb attack on his motorcade, which killed five in his entourage. The MILF denied responsibility, but Ampatuan sent police and civilian volunteers to arrest MILF members connected to the attack. Four thousand families were reported displaced by the fighting that followed, which was ended by a cease-fire agreement signed on July 10 and 11.Buffer zones set up to prevent CVO-MILF clashes in Maguindanao , Carolyn Arguillas, Mindanews.com, July 10, 2006 Talks between the MILF and the government collapsed in 2008 after a Supreme Court decision in Sema vs. COMELEC which rejected a preliminary accord that would have expanded the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. In 2011, the MILF withdrew their demands for independence, instead saying that they would pursue substate status, likened to a U.S. state instead of independence from the Philippines. Struggles =Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain= On August 4, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Government and the MILF from officially signing the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain, which would conclude all dispute and begin formal talks that would lead to the drafting and eventual signing of a Final Comprehensive Compact between the two groups. The Court accepted motions by the southern provincial governments that object to the extended boundaries for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao envisioned in the peace deal. The MOA-AD would have allowed the Moro people gained control of the region under the concept of human rights with the right to establish a police force and to control natural resources. The MOA-AD was initialed by former governor and peace panel chair Rodolfo Garc√≠a and Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Hermogenes Esperon and MILF peace panel chair Mohagher Iqbal on July 27 in Malaysia. It was scheduled for formal signing on August 5, but the Supreme Court issued no negotiation preventing the executive department from signing the agreement. The MOA-AD is the last of several agenda items under the 2001 agreement of the GRP-MILF. after security and relief and rehabilitation, prior to the discussion on the political settlement.Arguillas, C. (2008), SC affirms Oct. 14 ruling on \\"unconstitutional\\" MOA-AD, Mindanews The Young Moro Professionals Network (YMPN) appealed to the public not to be afraid of the MOA-AD and to \\"open your hearts to the Moro grievance\\".

This was responded by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which immediately deployed ten battalions composed of a total of 6,000 soldiers into Mindanao under the command of Lt. Gen. Cardozo Luna.Mindanaws (2009), Military starts operations against Bravo, Mindanews The violence displaced over 600,000 people and left about 300 dead.Gallardo, F.

The document of Conchita Carpio-Morales ruled: \\"In sum, the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process committed grave abuse of discretion when he failed to carry out the pertinent consultation process. The furtive process by which the MOA-AD was designed and crafted runs contrary to and in excess of the legal authority and amounts to a whimsical, capricious, oppressive, arbitrary and despotic exercise thereof. It illustrates a gross evasion of positive duty and a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined.\\" Civil society organizations such as Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society had submitted a Motion for Reconsideration. However, the Supreme Court affirmed its October 14 ruling that declared unconstitutional the initialed MOA-AD between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front on November 21, 2008. MILF soldiers offered to help free the Irish priest father Michael Sinott, who was kidnapped in the Philippines on October 14, 2009 and sought permission to deploy about 100 of its soldiers in the area where Sinnott is believed to be held. However it was turned down by the Philippine government. =Modification of demands= On September 23, 2010, Mohagher Iqbal said that the MILF will pursue a substate, likened to a U.S. state, instead of independence from the Philippines. The Muslim substate would not exercise power over national defense, foreign affairs, currency and coinage, and postal services, which the central government exercises. Igbal further added that the substate would not have its own armed forces but instead would have troops for internal security.Philippine Muslim rebels drop independence demand, ABC News International. =Peace talks= On October 7, 2012, President Benigno Aquino announced a peace deal with the MILF and that \\"This framework agreement paves the way for a final and enduring peace in Mindanao\\". MILF Vice Chairman Ghazali Jaafar is quoted as saying \\"We are very happy. We thank the president for this.\\" The deal was signed on October 15, 2012. Its aim is to pave the way to enduring peace between the two parties by officially envisaging an autonomous region in Mindanao. According to the framework, this semi-independent Muslim area would have a more just share of revenues from the extraction of its own plentiful resources, budgetary autonomy, its own police, and sharia law only for Muslims. In exchange for this, the MILF will stop armed movements against the government for autonomy and will allow the national government to retain its control of national security and foreign policy. The autonomy agreement to be gradually implemented will also rename the region Bangsamoro after the Moro people. Chief peace negotiator Miriam Coronel-Ferrer said that the government was cautiously optimistic for a final agreement soon following six days of talks on July 13, 2013. He said: \\"This signing indicates that both sides are really committed to finish the peace negotiations. Nobody wants this not to reach its fruition.\\" The agreement would see government allowances for the MILF to have a 75 percent share of earnings from natural resources and metallic minerals in a proposed autonomous region. For other energy resources, earnings would be split equally in accordance with Malaysia-brokered talks. =Peace agreement= On January 24, 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferrer and MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed a peace agreement in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called \\"Bangsamoro\\" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. The government aimed to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established, and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area. President Rodrigo Duterte signed the law, a key step to ending a Muslim rebellion in the south of the mainly Catholic Philippines. In early January 2020, the OPAPP announced progress exceeding its target for the decommissioning of MILF fighters, noting that ‚Äú8,879 out of the 12,000 MILF combatants were decommissioned from the last quarter of 2019.‚Äù Some former rebel fighters have joined the police and military to protect certain areas of the Bangsamoro region until an elected government is established in 2022.

Writing career  Danziger's debut novel was The Cat Ate My Gymsuit, whose characters were largely based on her experiences from childhood. She continued writing books for teens through the 1980s, expanding to books for younger readers with the Amber Brown series, whose protagonist is based on Danziger's niece Carrie. She frequently gave lectures and speeches, wearing elaborate costumes and calling herself a children's Dame Edna Everage. She is quoted as saying that her alternative career choice would have been as a stand-up comedian. She collaborated with Ann M. Martin twice, with P.S. Longer Letter Later (1998) and Snail Mail No More (2000). The two would send correspondence to each other as if they were the main characters. Paula Danziger and author Bruce Coville read their work to each other over the phone beginning in 1992, continuing for over a decade as a two-person writers' group and later including author Elizabeth Levy. Following Danziger's passing, Coville and Levy continued her Amber Brown series, beginning with Amber Brown is Tickled Pink (2012), which told the story of the title character's mother's re-marriage. Awards Paula Danziger's works were nominated for and won many American state children's book awards, including the Massachusetts Children's Book Award for The Cat Ate My Gymsuit in 1979 and the California Young Reader Medal for There's a Bat in Bunk Five in 1984.

They spoke a Hurro-Urartian language called Hurrian and lived in Anatolia, Syria and Northern Mesopotamia. The largest and most influential Hurrian nation was the kingdom of Mitanni, its ruling class perhaps being Indo-Iranian speakers. The population of the Indo-European-speaking Hittite Empire in Anatolia included a large population of Hurrians, and there is significant Hurrian influence in Hittite mythology. By the Early Iron Age, the Hurrians had been assimilated with other peoples. Their remnants were subdued by a related people that formed the state of Urartu. The present-day Armenians are an amalgam of the Indo-European groups with the Hurrians and Urartians. Language Incense burner. Hurrian period, 1300-1000 BC. From Tell Basmosian (also Tell Bazmusian), modern-day Lake Dukan, Iraq. Currently displayed in Erbil Civilization Museum Louvre lion and accompanying stone tablet bearing the earliest known text in Hurrian The Hurrian language is closely related to the Urartian language, the language of the ancient kingdom of Urartu. Together they form the Hurro-Urartian language family. The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a genetic relationship to other language families (e.g. the Northeast Caucasian languages), but none of these are generally accepted. From the 21st century BCE to the late 18th century BCE, Assyria controlled colonies in Anatolia, and the Hurrians, like the Hattians or Lullubis, adopted the Assyrian Akkadian cuneiform script for their own language about 2000 BCE. Texts in the Hurrian language in cuneiform have been found at Hattusa, Ugarit (Ras Shamra), as well as in one of the longest of the Amarna letters, written by King Tushratta of Mitanni to Pharaoh Amenhotep III. It was the only long Hurrian text known until a multi-tablet collection of literature in Hurrian with a Hittite translation was discovered at Hattusa in 1983. History =Middle Bronze Age= Hurrian names occur sporadically in northwestern Mesopotamia and the area of Kirkuk in modern Iraq by the Middle Bronze Age. Their presence was attested at Nuzi, Urkesh and other sites. They eventually infiltrated and occupied a broad arc of fertile farmland stretching from the Khabur River valley in the west to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the east. I. J. Gelb and E. A. Speiser believed East Semitic speaking Assyrians/Subarians had been the linguistic and ethnic substratum of northern Mesopotamia since earliest times, while Hurrians were merely late arrivals.Gelb, Ignace J.(1963), The History of Writing (University of Chicago Press) However, Subarians are now believed to have been a Hurrian, or at least a Hurro-Urartian, people.\\"History of Mesopotamia.\\" Encyclopaedia Britannica. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Subarian Urkesh Foundation tablet.

Let Shamash and Ishtar destroy the seeds of whoever removes this tablet. Shaum-shen is the craftsman.\\" The Khabur River valley became the heart of the Hurrian lands for a millennium. The first known Hurrian kingdom emerged around the city of Urkesh (modern Tell Mozan) during the third millennium BCE. There is evidence that they were initially allied with the east Semitic Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, indicating they had a firm hold on the area by the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254‚Äì2218 BCE). This region hosted other rich cultures (see Tell Halaf and Tell Brak). The city-state of Urkesh had some powerful neighbors. At some point in the early second millennium BCE, the Northwest Semitic speaking Amorite kingdom of Mari to the south subdued Urkesh and made it a vassal state. In the continuous power struggles over Mesopotamia, another Amorite dynasty had usurped the throne of the Old Assyrian Empire, which had controlled colonies in Hurrian, Hattian and Hittite regions of eastern Anatolia since the 21st century BCE. The Assyrians then made themselves masters over Mari and much of north east Amurru (Syria) in the late 19th and early 18th centuries BCE. Shubat-Enlil (modern Tell Leilan), was made the capital of this Old Assyrian empire by Shamshi Adad I at the expense of the earlier capital of Assur. Yamhad The Hurrians also migrated further west in this period. By 1725 BCE they are found also in parts of northern Syria, such as Alalakh. The mixed Amorite‚ÄìHurrian kingdom of Yamhad is recorded as struggling for this area with the early Hittite king Hattusilis I around 1600 BCE. Hurrians also settled in the coastal region of Adaniya in the country of Kizzuwatna, southern Anatolia. Yamhad eventually weakened vis-a-vis the powerful Hittites, but this also opened Anatolia for Hurrian cultural influences. The Hittites were influenced by both the Hurrian and Hattian cultures over the course of several centuries. =Late Bronze Age= Mitanni The Indo-European Hittites continued expanding south after the defeat of Yamhad. The army of the Hittite king Mursili I made its way to Babylon (by then a weak and minor state) and sacked the city. The destruction of the Babylonian kingdom, the presence of unambitious or isolationist kings in Assyria, as well as the destruction of the kingdom of Yamhad, helped the rise of another Hurrian dynasty. The first ruler was a legendary king called Kirta who founded the kingdom of Mitanni (known also as Hanigalbat/·∏™anigalbat by the Assyrians, and to the Egyptians as nhrn) around 1500 BCE. Mitanni gradually grew from the region around the Khabur valley and was perhaps the most powerful kingdom of the Near East in c. 1475‚Äì1365 BCE, after which it was eclipsed and eventually destroyed by the Middle Assyrian Empire. Some theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit an Indo- Aryan superstrate, suggesting that an Indo-Aryan elite imposed itself over the Hurrian population in the course of the Indo-Aryan expansion.Manfred Mayrhofer, \\"Welches Material aus dem Indo-arischen von Mitanni verbleibt f√ºr eine selektive Darstellung?\\" In: E. Neu (ed.), Investigationes philologicae et comparativae: Gedenkschrift f√ºr Heinz Kronasser (Wiesbaden, O. Harrassowitz 1982), 72‚Äì90.Paul Thieme, The 'Aryan Gods' of the Mitanni Treaties, Journal of the American Oriental Society 80, 301‚Äì317 (1960). (See Mitanni-Aryan.) Arrapha Another Hurrian kingdom also benefited from the demise of Babylonian power in the sixteenth century BCE. Hurrians had inhabited the region northeast of the river Tigris, around the modern Kirkuk. This was the kingdom of Arrapha. Excavations at Yorgan Tepe, ancient Nuzi, proved this to be one of the most important sites for our knowledge about the Hurrians. Hurrian kings such as Ithi-Teshup and Ithiya ruled over Arrapha, yet by the mid-fifteenth century BCE they had become vassals of the Great King of Mitanni. The kingdom of Arrapha itself was destroyed by the Assyrians in the mid 14th century BCE and thereafter became an Assyrian city. =Bronze Age collapse= By the 13th century BCE all of the Hurrian states had been vanquished by other peoples, with the Mitanni kingdom destroyed by Assyria. The heartlands of the Hurrians, the Khabur river valley and south eastern Anatolia, became provinces of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1366‚Äì1020 BCE) which came to rule much of the Near East and Asia Minor. It is not clear what happened to these early Hurrian people at the end of the Bronze Age. Some scholars have suggested that Hurrians lived on in the country of Nairi north of Assyria during the early Iron Age, before this too was conquered by Assyria. The Hurrian population of northern Syria in the following centuries seems to have given up their language in favor of the Assyrian dialect of Akkadian, and later, Aramaic. =Urartu= However, a power vacuum was to allow a new and powerful state whose rulers spoke Urartian, similar to old Hurrian, to arise. The Middle Assyrian Empire, after destroying the Hurro- Mitanni Empire, the Hittite Empire, defeating the Phrygians and Elamites, conquering Babylon, the Arameans of Syria, northern Ancient Iran and Canaan and forcing the Egyptians out of much of the near east, itself went into a century of relative decline from the latter part of the 11th century BCE. The Urartians were thus able to impose themselves around Lake Van and Mount Ararat, forming the powerful Kingdom of Urartu. During the 11th and 10th centuries BCE, the kingdom eventually encompassed a region stretching from the Caucasus Mountains in the north, to the borders of northern Assyria and northern Ancient Iran in the south, and controlled much of eastern Anatolia. Assyria began to once more expand from circa. 935 BCE, and Urartu and Assyria became fierce rivals. Urartu successfully repelled Assyrian expansionism for a time, however from the 9th to 7th century BCE it progressively lost territory to Assyria. It was to survive until the 7th century BCE, by which time it was conquered fully into the Neo Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì605 BCE). The Assyrian Empire collapsed from 620 to 605 BCE, after a series of brutal internal civil wars weakened it to such an extent that a coalition of its former vassals; the Medes, Persians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Scythians and Cimmerians were able to attack and gradually destroy it. Urartu was ravaged by marauding Indo-European speaking Scythian and Cimmerian raiders during this time, with its vassal king (together with the king of neighbouring Lydia) vainly pleading with the beleaguered Assyrian king for help. After the fall of Assyria, Urartu came under the control of the Median Empire and then its successor Persian Empire during the 6th century BCE. During the 2nd millennium BC a new wave of Indo- European speakers migrated over the Caucasus into Urartian lands, these being the Armenians. An alternate theory suggests that Armenians were tribes indigenous to the northern shores of Lake Van or Urartu's northern periphery (possibly as the Hayasans, Etuini, and/or Diauehi, all of whom are known only from references left by neighboring peoples such Hittites, Urartians, and Assyrians). This theory is supported by genetic and archaeological evidence, which is suggestive of an Indo-European presence in Armenia and eastern Turkey by the end of the 3rd millennium BCE.John A. C. Greppin and I. M. Diakonoff, Some Effects of the Hurro-Urartian People and Their Languages upon the Earliest Armenians Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 111, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1991), pp. 721 Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, Jean M. Evans, Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C. Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) (2008) pp. 92 pp. 254Peter I. Bogucki and Pam J.

Volume 94 of Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World. John Wiley & Sons, 2012 p.681 It is argued that proto- Armenian came into contact with Urartian at an early date (3rd or 2nd millennium BC), before the formation of the Urartian kingdom. While the Urartian language was used by the royal elite, the population they ruled may have been multi-lingual, and some of these peoples would have spoken Armenian.Zimansky, Paul \\"Xenophon and the Urartian legacy.\\" Dans les pas des Dix-Mille (1995): 264-265 In the 6th century BCE the region became part of the Armenian Orontid Dynasty. The Hurro-Urartians seem to have disappeared from history around this time, almost certainly being absorbed into the Indo- European Armenian population. Culture and society Knowledge of Hurrian culture relies on archaeological excavations at sites such as Nuzi and Alalakh as well as on cuneiform tablets, primarily from Hattusa (Boghazk√∂y), the capital of the Hittites, whose civilization was greatly influenced by the Hurrians. Tablets from Nuzi, Alalakh, and other cities with Hurrian populations (as shown by personal names) reveal Hurrian cultural features even though they were written in Akkadian. Hurrian cylinder seals were carefully carved and often portrayed mythological motifs. They are a key to the understanding of Hurrian culture and history. =Ceramic ware= The Hurrians were masterful ceramists. Their pottery is commonly found in Mesopotamia and in the lands west of the Euphrates; it was highly valued in distant Egypt, by the time of the New Kingdom. Archaeologists use the terms Khabur ware and Nuzi ware for two types of wheel-made pottery used by the Hurrians. Khabur ware is characterized by reddish painted lines with a geometric triangular pattern and dots, while Nuzi ware has very distinctive forms, and are painted in brown or black. =Metallurgy= The Hurrians had a reputation in metallurgy. It is proposed that the Sumerian term for \\"coppersmith\\" tabira/tibira was borrowed from Hurrian, which would imply an early presence of the Hurrians way before their first historical mention in Akkadian sources. Pp. 8‚Äì9. Copper was traded south to Mesopotamia from the highlands of Anatolia. The Khabur Valley had a central position in the metal trade, and copper, silver and even tin were accessible from the Hurrian-dominated countries Kizzuwatna and Ishuwa situated in the Anatolian highland. Gold was in short supply, and the Amarna letters inform us that it was acquired from Egypt. Not many examples of Hurrian metal work have survived, except from the later Urartu. Some small fine bronze lion figurines were discovered at Urkesh. =Horse culture= The Mitanni were closely associated with horses. The name of the country of Ishuwa, which might have had a substantial Hurrian population, meant \\"horse-land\\" (it is also suggested the name may have Anatolian or proto-Armenian roots).Armen Petrosyan \\"The Indo European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources in the Armenian Epic.\\" (2002) P. 23.https://www.academia.edu/3656244/The_Indo- European_and_Ancient_Near_Eastern_Sources_of_the_Armenian_Epic._Washington_D.C._2002 A text discovered at Hattusa deals with the training of horses. The man who was responsible for the horse-training was a Hurrian called Kikkuli. The terminology used in connection with horses contains many Indo-Aryan loan-words (Mayrhofer, 1974). =Music= Among the Hurrian texts from Ugarit are the oldest known instances of written music, dating from c. 1400 BCE.A reconstruction by Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin of the only substantially complete hymn may be heard at the Urkesh webpage, though this is only one of at least five \\"rival decipherments of the notation, each yielding entirely different results\\". West 1994, 161. In addition to West and Duchesne-Guillemin (1975, 1977, 1980, and 1984), competitors include Anne Draffkorn Kilmer (1965, 1971, 1974, 1976, & 1984), David Wulstan (1968), and Raoul Vitale (1982). Among these fragments are found the names of four Hurrian composers, Tap≈°i·∫ñuni, Pu·∫ñiya(na), Ur·∫ñiya, and Ammiya.West 1994, 171. =Religion= The Hurrian culture made a great impact on the religion of the Hittites. From the Hurrian cult centre at Kummanni in Kizzuwatna Hurrian religion spread to the Hittite people. Syncretism merged the Old Hittite and Hurrian religions. Hurrian religion spread to Syria, where Baal became the counterpart of Teshub. The later kingdom of Urartu also venerated gods of Hurrian origin. The Hurrian religion, in different forms, influenced the entire ancient Near East, except ancient Egypt and southern Mesopotamia. Hurrian incense container The Hittite gods Teshub and Hebat, chamber A, Yazilikaya, Hittite rock sanctuary, Turkey The main gods in the Hurrian pantheon were: * Teshub, Teshup; the mighty weather god. * Hebat, Hepa; his wife, the mother goddess, regarded as the Sun goddess among the Hittites, drawn from the deified Sumerian queen Kubaba. * Sharruma, or Sarruma, ≈†arruma; their son. * Kumarbi; the ancient father of Teshub; his home as described in mythology is the city of Urkesh. * Shaushka, or Shawushka, ≈†auska; was the Hurrian counterpart of Assyrian Ishtar, and a goddess of fertility, war and healing. * Shimegi, ≈†imegi; the sun god. * Kushuh, Ku≈°uh; the moon god. Symbols of the sun and the crescent moon appear joined together in the Hurrian iconography. * Nergal; a Babylonian deity of the netherworld, whose Hurrian name is unknown. * Ea; was also Babylonian in origin, and may have influenced Canaanite El, and also ◊ô◊ù Yam, God of the Sea and River. Hurrian cylinder seals often depict mythological creatures such as winged humans or animals, dragons and other monsters. The interpretation of these depictions of gods and demons is uncertain. They may have been both protective and evil spirits. Some is reminiscent of the Assyrian shedu. The Hurrian gods do not appear to have had particular \\"home temples\\", like in the Mesopotamian religion or Ancient Egyptian religion. Some important cult centres were Kummanni in Kizzuwatna, and Hittite Yazilikaya. Harran was at least later a religious centre for the moon god, and Shauskha had an important temple in Nineve, when the city was under Hurrian rule. A temple of Nergal was built in Urkesh in the late third millennium BCE. The town of Kahat was a religious centre in the kingdom of Mitanni. The Hurrian myth \\"The Songs of Ullikummi\\", preserved among the Hittites, is a parallel to Hesiod's Theogony; the castration of Uranus by Cronus may be derived from the castration of Anu by Kumarbi, while Zeus's overthrow of Cronus and Cronus's regurgitation of the swallowed gods is like the Hurrian myth of Teshub and Kumarbi.G√ºterbock, Hans Gustav: \\"Hittite Religion\\"; in Forgotten Religions: Including Some Living Primitive Religions (ed. Vergilius Ferm) (NY, Philosophical Library, 1950), pp. 88‚Äì89, 103‚Äì104 It has been argued that the worship of Attis drew on Hurrian myth.Suggested by Jane Lightfoot in the Times Literary Supplement 22 July 2005 p 27, in her account of Philippe Borgeaud, Mother of the Gods: from Cybele to the Virgin Mary, Johns Hopkins 2005 . The Phrygian goddess Cybele would then be the counterpart of the Hurrian goddess Hebat. =Urbanism= The Hurrian urban culture was not represented by a large number of cities. Urkesh was the only Hurrian city in the third millennium BCE. In the second millennium BCE we know a number of Hurrian cities, such as Arrapha, Harran, Kahat, Nuzi, Taidu and Washukanni ‚Äì the capital of Mitanni. Although the site of Washukanni, alleged to be at Tell Fakhariya, is not known for certain, no tell (city mound) in the Khabur Valley much exceeds the size of 1 square kilometer (250 acres), and the majority of sites are much smaller. The Hurrian urban culture appears to have been quite different from the centralized state administrations of Assyria and ancient Egypt. An explanation could be that the feudal organization of the Hurrian kingdoms did not allow large palace or temple estates to develop. Archaeology Hurrian settlements are distributed over three modern countries, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The heart of the Hurrian world is bisected by the modern border between Syria and Turkey. Several sites are situated within the border zone, making access for excavations problematic. A threat to the ancient sites are the many dam projects in the Euphrates, Tigris and Khabur valleys. Several rescue operations have already been undertaken when the construction of dams put entire river valleys under water. The first major excavations of Hurrian sites in Iraq and Syria began in the 1920s and 1930s. They were led by the American archaeologist Edward Chiera at Yorghan Tepe (Nuzi), and the British archaeologist Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak. Recent excavations and surveys in progress are conducted by American, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, French, German and Italian teams of archaeologists, with international participants, in cooperation with the Syrian Department of Antiquities. The tells, or city mounds, often reveal a long occupation beginning in the Neolithic and ending in the Roman period or later. The characteristic Hurrian pottery, the Khabur ware, is helpful in determining the different strata of occupation within the mounds. The Hurrian settlements are usually identified from the Middle Bronze Age to the end of the Late Bronze Age, with Tell Mozan (Urkesh) being the main exception. =Important sites= The list includes some important ancient sites from the area dominated by the Hurrians. Excavation reports and images are found at the websites linked. As noted above, important discoveries of Hurrian culture and history were also made at Alalakh, Amarna, Hattusa and Ugarit. * Tell Mozan (ancient Urkesh)Urkesh an overview * Yorghan Tepe (ancient Nuzi)The Semitic Museum: Nuzi and the Hurrians * Tell Brak (ancient Nagar)Tell Brak Learning Sites * Tell Leilan (ancient Shehna and Shubat-Enlil)Yale Tell Leilan Project * Tell Barri (ancient Kahat)Missione Italiana archaeologica a Tell Barri * Tell Beydar (ancient Nabada)ESE Tell Beydar * Kenan Tepe * Tell TuneinirTell Tuneinir St. Louis Archaeological Expeditions * Umm el-Marra (ancient Tuba?)The Johns Hopkins/University of Amsterdam Joint Expedition to Tell Umm el-Marra * Tell ChueraGrabung Tell Chuera * Hammam al Turkman (ancient Zalpa?)Excavation Hammam al Turkman, Leiden University * Tell Sabi AbyadDutch Excavation at Tell Sabi Abyad * HamoukarThe Hamoukar Expedition University of Chicago * Chagar Bazar * Tell el Fakhariya / Ras el Ayn (ancient Washukanni?) * Tell Hamidiya (ancient Taidu?)For the results of the Swiss excavations at Tell al-Hamidiya see See also * Horites * Kassites * Mitanni * Nairi References Bibliography * Asimov, Isaac.

He won three Pulitzer Prizes‚Äîfor the novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey, and for the plays Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth ‚Äî and a U.S. National Book Award for the novel The Eighth Day. Early years and family Amos at the family cottage in Maple Bluff, Wisconsin (1900) Wilder was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor and later, a U.S. diplomat, and Isabella Thornton Niven. He had five siblings. Thornton, himself, had a twin who was stillborn.Man of Letters: The case of Thornton Wilder By Robert Gottlieb, December 31, 2012 Published in print in the column A Critic at Large in the January 7, 2013 Issue of The New Yorker. Accessed online May 4, 2020 All of the surviving Wilder children spent part of their childhood in China when his father was stationed in Hong Kong and Shanghai as US Consul General. His older brother, Amos Niven Wilder, became Hollis Professor of Divinity at the Harvard Divinity School. Amos Wilder was a noted poet and was instrumental in developing the field of theopoetics. Thornton's sister, Isabel Wilder, was an accomplished writer. He had two more sisters, Charlotte Wilder, a poet, and Janet Wilder Dakin, a zoologist. Education Wilder in his Yale College graduation photo (1920) Wilder began writing plays while at The Thacher School in Ojai, California, where he did not fit in and was teased by classmates as overly intellectual. According to a classmate, \\"We left him alone, just left him alone. And he would retire at the library, his hideaway, learning to distance himself from humiliation and indifference.\\" His family lived for a time in China, where his sister Janet was born in 1910. He attended the English China Inland Mission Chefoo School at Yantai but returned with his mother and siblings to California in 1912 because of the unstable political conditions in China at the time. Thornton graduated from Berkeley High School in 1915. After having served a three-month enlistment in the Army's Coast Artillery Corps at Fort Adams, Rhode Island, in World War I (rising to the rank of corporal), he attended Oberlin College before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1920 at Yale University, where he refined his writing skills as a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, a literary society. He earned his Master of Arts degree in French literature from Princeton University in 1926. Career After graduating, Wilder went to Italy and studied archaeology and Italian (1920‚Äì21) as part of an eight-month residency at The American Academy in Rome, and then taught French at the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey beginning in 1921. His first novel, The Cabala, was published in 1926. In 1927, The Bridge of San Luis Rey brought him commercial success, and his first Pulitzer Prize (1928). He resigned from the Lawrenceville School in 1928. From 1930 to 1937 he taught at the University of Chicago, during which time he published his translation of Andr√© Obey's own adaptation of the tale, \\"Le Viol de Lucrece\\" (1931) under the title \\"Lucrece\\" (Longmans Green, 1933). In Chicago, he became famous as a lecturer and he was chronicled on the celebrity pages. In 1938 he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play Our Town, and he won the prize again in 1943 for his play The Skin of Our Teeth. World War II saw him rise to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Air Force Intelligence, first in Africa, then in Italy until 1945. He received several awards for his military service.The American Legion of Merit and Bronze Star, Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur from France, and an honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) from Britain. He went on to be a visiting professor at Harvard University, where he served for a year as the Charles Eliot Norton professor. Though he considered himself a teacher first and a writer second, he continued to write all his life, receiving the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1957 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. In 1968 he won the National Book Award for his novel The Eighth Day. The Wilder Family Website Being proficient in four languages, Wilder translated plays by Andr√© Obey and Jean-Paul Sartre, and wrote the libretti to two operas, The Long Christmas Dinner, composed by Paul Hindemith, and ''The Alcestiad'', composed by Louise Talma and based on his own play. Also, Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admired, asked him to write the screenplay to his thriller, Shadow of a Doubt. He completed the first draft of the screenplay for Hitchcock. The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in Peru when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the question of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem \\"innocent\\" or \\"undeserving\\". It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century. The book was quoted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the memorial service for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Since then its popularity has grown enormously. The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster. Frank Craven, Martha Scott and John Craven in the original Broadway production of Our Town (1938), winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama Wilder wrote Our Town, a popular play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was inspired in part by Dante's Purgatorio,Breyer, Jackson R. editor. Rojcewicz, Stephen. \\"Our Tears: Lacrimae Rerum and Thorton Wilder\\". Thornton Wilder in Collaboration: Collected Essays on His Drama and Fiction. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Dec 17, 2018. p. 166 .Erhard, Elise. \\"Searching for Our Town\\". Crisis Magazine. February 7, 2013. and in part by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of Americans.Konkle, Lincoln. Thornton Wilder and the Puritan Narrative Tradition. University of Missouri Press (2006). pp. 7-10. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set to underscore the human experience. Wilder played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize. Wilder as Mr. Antrobus in The Skin of Our Teeth, 1948 In 1938, Max Reinhardt directed a Broadway production of The Merchant of Yonkers, which Wilder had adapted from Austrian playwright Johann Nestroy's Einen Jux will er sich machen (1842). It was a failure, closing after 39 performances. His play The Skin of Our Teeth opened in New York on November 18, 1942, featuring Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar ‚Äì the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, that much of the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce's last work.Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson published a pair of reviews-cum-denunciations entitled \\"The Skin of Whose Teeth?\\" in the Saturday Review immediately after the play's debut; these created a huge uproar at the time. Campbell's reprints the reviews and discusses the controversy. In his novel, The Ides of March (1948), Wilder reconstructs the characters and events leading to, and culminating in, the assassination of Julius Caesar. He had met Jean-Paul Sartre on a U.S. lecture tour after the war, and was under the influence of existentialism, although rejecting its atheist implications. In 1954, Tyrone Guthrie encouraged Wilder to rework The Merchant of Yonkers into The Matchmaker. This time the play opened in 1955 and enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with Ruth Gordon in the title role, winning a Tony Award for Guthrie, its director. It became the basis for the hit 1964 musical Hello, Dolly!, with a book by Michael Stewart and score by Jerry Herman. In 1962 and 1963, Wilder lived twenty months in the small town of Douglas, Arizona, apart from family and friends. There he started his longest novel, The Eighth Day, which went on to win the National Book Award. According to Harold Augenbraum in 2009, it \\"attack[ed] the big questions head on, ... [embedded] in the story of small- town America\\". His last novel, Theophilus North, was published in 1973, and made into the film Mr. North in 1988. The Library of America republished all of Wilder's plays in 2007, together with some of his writings on the theater and the screenplay of Shadow of a Doubt. In 2009, a second volume was released, containing his first five novels, six early stories, and four essays on fiction. Finally, the third and final volume in the Library of America series on Wilder was released in 2011, containing his last two novels The Eighth Day and Theophilus North, as well as four autobiographical sketches. Personal life Although Wilder never discussed being homosexual publicly or in his writings, the pornographer Samuel Steward wrote in his autobiography, six years after Wilder's death that he had sexual relations with him.The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward: Recollections of an Extraordinary Twentieth- Century Gay Life, edited by Jeremy Mulderig, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2018, pages 118‚Äì124 Wilder was introduced to Steward by Gertrude Stein, who at the time regularly corresponded with both of them. The third act of Our Town was allegedly drafted after a long walk, during a brief affair with Steward in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. In Penelope Niven's biography Thornton Wilder: A Life, she provides considerable epistolary evidence that the third act of Our Town was not written in response to any walk, conversation or affair with Samuel Steward but was begun before Wilder met Steward and was not finished until several months afterward. Niven also raises doubts about Steward's uncorroborated and unsubstantiated claims of having been Wilder's lover. Wilder had a wide circle of friends, including writers Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather and Gertrude Stein, pianist and harpsichordist Gavin Williamson, actors Ruth Gordon, Montgomery Clift, Mia Farrow, industrialist Russel Wright and decorator and socialite Sibyl, Lady Colefax. Death From the earnings of The Bridge of San Luis Rey, in 1930 Wilder built a house for his family in Hamden, Connecticut. His sister Isabel lived there for the rest of her life. This became his home base, although he traveled extensively and lived away for significant periods. He died in this house on December 7, 1975 of heart failure. He was interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery, Hamden, Connecticut. (Kindle Location 50886).

Early life  Lloyd first became interested in music as a small child. He saw The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show and experienced the phenomenon of Beatlemania, later going on to follow the British Invasion back to its roots in Blues and Jazz. Lloyd attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. In his early teens, he studied drums with William Kessler, who was the ghostwriter for Cozy Cole, one of the famous big-band drummers. A few years later, he turned to the guitar.  Teenage years  When Lloyd was in his middle teens, he met a fellow guitarist from Brooklyn named Velvert Turner. Turner claimed he knew Jimi Hendrix. Per Turner, Hendrix considered Turner his \\"little brother\\", and took him on as his prot√©g√©, inviting him to various clubs and teaching him guitar from Hendrix's apartment on W 12th St. As Turner and Lloyd were best friends, Turner asked for permission to teach Lloyd what he was learning, and so Lloyd and Turner began practicing together under the teaching auspice of Hendrix. Lloyd frequently attended Hendrix's shows, as well as those of other well-known acts such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead. At Stuyvesant High School, during the 11th grade, Lloyd decided that he was going to become a well-known guitarist, and so he stopped bringing his textbooks or homework to school, instead bringing an electric guitar in a hardshell case. When his teachers would ask him where his schoolbooks were, he would point to the case. Being asked to open the case, the teachers would proclaim \\"I don't see any books in there ‚Äì only an electric guitar\\", and Lloyd's retort was \\"That's the book I'm studying.\\" He still managed to pass all of his tests but quit in May 1969, before graduation, because he did not believe in diplomas, and he considered that having a high school diploma would not do him any good in his pursuit of the music business. That summer his parents moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and gave him an ultimatum: he could either get a job or repeat the 12th grade in a new high school. He chose the latter, which led to his deep friendship with another guitarist named Al Anderson, who went on to be one of a couple of Americans to play in Bob Marley's touring band, The Wailers, along with Donald Kinsey.  Early music career  After quitting a second high school before graduation, he moved to Boston, where he lived for two years. It was during this time that he enjoyed his first public performance, sitting in with John Lee Hooker at the Jazz workshop on Boylston Street. By this time Lloyd had already met and knew Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and members of Led Zeppelin, and could be frequently found backstage conversing with his heroes. John Lee Hooker asked him what he did and Lloyd replied that he was a guitarist, whereupon John Lee Hooker called him over and whispered into his ear \\"the secret of the electric guitar\\" and invited him to sit in with the band. After living in Boston for a period of time, Lloyd moved back to New York, but desired to visit other centers of musical culture. He first decided to hitchhike across Route 66, but after considering how long it might take, he flew directly to Los Angeles instead. He spent the next two years in Los Angeles from 1971, practicing the electric guitar without an amplifier and going to record company parties, which at that time were very ostentatious. He lived as a roommate with Richard Cromelin, the music critic for the Los Angeles Times, so again, he had access to the highest level and echelon of rock 'n roll. In 1973, he heard about the New York Dolls and the beginning of a brand-new New York scene, so he arranged with a friend who owned a Lotus Europa to take him as a passenger across the country. As they made their way through the country, with stops in famous towns like Memphis and New Orleans, he reached New York and heard the unpleasant news that the Mercer Arts Center, known for hosting the first concerts of bands like the Dolls, the Modern Lovers and Suicide, had collapsed. He began frequenting shows at the Diplomat Hotel and other spots, and seeing the possibility of a new scene, began contemplating putting a band together. He met a fellow named Terry Ork at Max's Kansas City, who had a huge loft in Chinatown and needed a roommate, so Lloyd moved into Ork's Chinatown loft, living in the front room, a small room facing East Broadway. Ork worked for Andy Warhol making silkscreen prints at night and working at a theatrical poster shop called Cinemabilia during the daytime. Ork very much wanted to manage or create a band such as Warhol had done with The Velvet Underground. During discussions with Lloyd, Ork mentioned that he knew of another guitarist without a band who was auditioning a couple of songs at Reno Sweeney's audition night. Reno Sweeney's was an off-Broadway‚Äìstyle club on W. 13th St that mostly hosted singers like Peter Allen and Bette Midler.  Television  Ork and Lloyd went to Reno Sweeney's one night during the summer of 1973, where Richard saw Tom Miller play three songs. Lloyd leaned over to Ork during the second song and told him that this fellow had something, but was missing something, and what he was missing, Lloyd had. He advised Ork that if Terry could convince Tom, the combination of Lloyd and Miller would have the makings of the band Terry Ork was looking for. This was the beginning of the formation of the band Television. Miller would eventually change his last name to Verlaine and Richard Meyers became Richard Hell and promised to learn the bass as they went along. With the addition of Billy Ficca on drums, the quartet was complete. Television rehearsed seven days a week for five or six hours a day during the fall and winter of 1973, and made their first public performance on March 2, 1974, at the Town House Theatre on W. 44th St. Television were looking for a club where they could develop an audience and play more often as the house band, when Verlaine spotted a guy putting up the awning on a bar on the Bowery which stood under a flophouse for homeless alcoholics. Verlaine and Lloyd went back up and discussed the possibility of playing in this new club, which was to be called CBGB. After Television's manager Ork promised CBGB a large take at the bar, Television was given a gig at the end of March 1974. CBGB was run by Hilly Kristal, who had planned to feature country, bluegrass and blues (CBGB) at the club, but when several original rock bands like Blondie, the Ramones and Talking Heads started to show up after finding out that there was a place to play, Ork became the official booking agent for the club. CBGB started to get noticed after bands like Television and Talking Heads started to fill the place up, and when a young poet named Patti Smith began playing double bills with Television, the club started becoming famous. CBGB closed its doors in New York in 2007. After recording demos for various record companies, Richard Hell left the band and was replaced by Blondie's bass player at the time, Fred Smith. Fred Smith's solid bass playing allowed for a more transcendent and profound music from the two guitarists and drummer, resulting in their being signed to Elektra Records in 1977. Television recorded two albums for Elektra: Marquee Moon and Adventure. As a debut release in 1977, Marquee Moon remains on lists of greatest albums in rock and roll history, and never has been out of print. After recording Adventure in 1978, and finding success elusive in the United States, Television disbanded after a successful series of dates at New York's The Bottom Line. The various members went their separate ways, although all of them continued in the music industry, occasionally to reunite.  Solo career  After Television first disbanded in 1978, Lloyd released one album for Elektra Records titled Alchemy. During his solo career, as a guitarist and session musician he has worked with various artists in the music industry, including Matthew Sweet, John Doe (of the band X), and Stephan Eicher. In 1990 Lloyd recorded a cover version of the Roky Erikson/13th Floor Elevators song \\"Fire Engine\\", which was included on the various artists' tribute album Where The Pyramid Meets The Eye. In 1994, he was cast by Cynthia Plaster Caster, one of the Plaster Casters of Chicago. He is also known to teach other aspiring guitarists in his studio in New York City, where he frequently produces other acts. He acted as producer and recording engineer as well as a member of the band Rocket from the Tombs, titled Rocket Redux, which was released on Smog Veil Records. He has also produced a number of records for other local bands, including The Blondes, Inc., Chris Purdy, Miss Mother USA and Kevin Otto. as well as Skinny Girls Are Trouble (2010), the third album from country-punk songwriter Jim Neversink. He still owns the famous pinstriped Stratocaster he played with Television. His other current projects include a reformation of Rocket from the Tombs. As of 2016, Lloyd had released seven solo albums, starting with Alchemy in 1979, Field of Fire in 1986 (re-released in 2007 with an additional disc of music), his live disc Real Time in 1987 (recorded at CBGB) and The Cover Doesn't Matter in 2001. The Radiant Monkey was released on Parasol Records in late 2007. The CD features Lloyd playing everything but the drums (manned by session drummer Chris Purdy and, on one track, Television's Billy Ficca). 2009 saw his most ambitious album yet: The Jamie Neverts Story, a tribute to his hero Jimi Hendrix and dedicated to the memory of his friend Velvert Turner. It was released on Parasol Records. \\"Jamie Neverts\\" was the secret name that Velvert and Lloyd came up with to prevent all the kids in the neighborhood from trying to come along when they went to see Hendrix. In 2015, Lloyd married Sheila O'Keefe. In 2016, he released Rosedale. While Lloyd plays all the instruments on most of Rosedale, he has Billy Ficca and Chris Frantz on a few tracks, and a couple of tracks feature musicians from his new hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had \\"falolloped (fallen) over\\" and \\"grazed her kneeclabbers\\". Early life Unwin's parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin and his wife Jessie Elizabeth ( Brand) emigrated from England to South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in Pretoria in 1911. Following his father's death in 1914, Unwin's mother arranged for the family to return to England. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the National Children's Home in Congleton, Cheshire. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at Regent Street Polytechnic in London. In 1937, he married his wife Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the BBC, and was assigned to the Borough Hill transmitting station in Daventry. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life. Comedy career Unwin's early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC's War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media. While based in Birmingham from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he handed the microphone to broadcaster F.R. \\"Buck\\" Buckley, who ad-libbed a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called \\"Fasche\\". Buckley then encouraged Unwin to join in and introduced him as \\"Codlington Corthusite\\", handing back the microphonewhereupon Unwin continued in Unwinese. The recording was played back to two BBC producers, who added sound effects; it was eventually broadcast on Pat Dixon's Mirror of the Month programme and, after receiving a positive response, culminated in another sketch in which Unwin, playing a man from Atlantis, was interviewed about life in the sunken city. The broadcast produced Unwin's first fan mail, from Joyce Grenfell, who had been impressed by his performance. Since Grenfell was Unwin's heroine, the encouragement gave Unwin a boost and he was inspired to break into show business. After the war, while in Egypt and recording a series of shows by Frankie Howerd, Unwin was pushed onto the stage and told to \\"do a turn\\" after the actor suddenly fell ill. Unwin's next major breakthrough came when producer Roy Speer introduced him to the comedian Ted Ray. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: \\"I want him in the series\\"namely, The Spice of Life, co-starring June Whitfield and Kenneth Connor. During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the Cardew Robinson film Fun at St Fanny's (1956). In 1968 Unwin was invited to narrate \\"Happiness Stan\\", a six song fairy tale about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the Small Faces' album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake, which reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. In 1969, Unwin appeared in Gerry Anderson's \\"Supermarionation\\" TV series The Secret Service, both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When Lew Grade, Anderson's financial backer and head of distributor ITC, was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that he believed viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional. Though professionally retired in his later decades, Unwin still continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on The Max Bygraves Show on ITV, sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them. In 1985, Unwin recorded with Suns of Arqa on their album Ark of the Arqans, providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks. In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track \\"Erasmus Meets The Earthling\\", featured on their album Seven, and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s. He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of Inside Victor Lewis-Smith. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British dance music act Wubble-U on their single \\"Petal\\"; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the Aardman Animations series Rex the Runt, as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese. =Unwinese= Unwinese, also known as \\"Basic Engly Twenty Fido\\", was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were deliberately corrupted in a playful and humorous manner, but which was still largely comprehensible to the listener. Unwin's performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, although the meaning and context were always conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. Unwinese may well have been inspired in part by Lewis Carroll's well- known 1871 poem Jabberwocky.Carroll's influence on Unwin =Selected works= *Fun at St Fanny's (1955, film) as The Guide *Beyond Our Ken (1958, radio, cameo) *Rotatey Diskers with Unwin (1960, LP of Unwinese) *The Miscillian Manuscript (1961, travel journal in Unwinese, illustrated by Roy Dewar) *Inn for Trouble (1960, film) as Farmer *Carry On Regardless (1961, film) as Landlord *House & Garbidge (1962, book spoofing home and lifestyle magazines, with Dewar) *Rock-a-Bye Babel and Two Fairly Tales (1966, book of spoof nursery rhymes and fairy tales, with Dewar) *Press for Time (1966, film) as Mr. Nottage (Town Clerk) *Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (Small Faces album, 1968, as Narrator of Side 2) *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968, film) as Chancellor of Vulgaria *The Secret Service (1969, TV series) as Father Stanley Unwin *Pirelli Tyres TV advertisement (1980, featuring slogan \\"Outstandifold in the wetty grippers\\")Stanley Unwin: Master of Nonsense (BBC, 14 January 2002) *The Laughing Prisoner (The Tube TV Special) (1987, TV, The Prisoner parody) *Just a Minute (1987, 1989; radio) *Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015, archive footage) Death and legacy Unwin's grave in Long Buckby Unwin died at Danetre Hospital in Daventry on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at Long Buckby, with Frances, who predeceased him in 1993. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, \\"Reunitey in the heavenly-bodeDeep Joy!\\". A thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence's Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" by John Percival and friends. The valediction had been prepared by Unwin's family in his own style: \\"Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle- oteedeeOh Yes!\\" Suns of Arqa released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled \\"Tributey\\") following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews. Unwin's work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by John Lennon: In His Own Write (1964) and A Spaniard in the Works (1965).

The dialogue format originated in 1964 when Dudley Moore invited Peter Cook to appear in a television performance. Cook scripted a conversation between two men from Dagenham wearing flat caps. This proved to be very popular with television audiences and the partnership was continued during the series Not Only... But Also. Pete is a know-it-all and would-be intellectual, very much in the spirit of E. L. Wisty, and Dud is a put-upon Herbert in a subservient role, who tries to impress Pete with his knowledge. Neither of them has any real sense. The \\"Dagenham Dialogues\\" between the two ranged from paintings (Pete finds the Mona Lisa snooty, and the bottoms of Rubens's nudes seem to follow them around the room), reasons why geckos do not live long and being annoyed by film stars (including \\"bloody Greta Garbo\\" and \\"bloody Anna Magnani\\") pestering them for romance. During the 1970s, Cook and Moore used a similar formula for the more adult Derek and Clive recordings. The comic and personal relationship between Cook and Moore is the subject of the play Pete and Dud: Come Again, by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. In 2010, a group of comedians, Hugh Dennis, Angus Deayton and Alistair McGowan among them, recreated some of the Pete and Dud comic routines on BBC Two in Pete and Dud: the Lost Sketches.

Depositions are commonly used in litigation in the United States and Canada. They are almost always conducted outside court by the lawyers themselves, with no judge present to supervise the examination. Depositions developed in Canada and the United States in the nineteenth century. Depositions are a part of the discovery process in which litigants gather information in preparation for trial. In nations that do not provide for depositions, testimony is usually preserved for future use by way of live testimony in the courtroom, or by way of written affidavit. Some jurisdictions recognize an affidavit as a form of deposition, sometimes called a \\"deposition upon written questions.\\" While in common law jurisdictions such as England and Wales, Australia, and New Zealand recording the oral evidence of supporting witnesses ('obtaining a statement') is routine during pre- litigation investigations, having the right to pose oral questions to the opposing party's witnesses before trial is not. United States  Deposition is the preferred term in U.S. federal courts and in the majority of U.S. states. Some states also refer to a deposition as an examination before trial (EBT). However, in unusual situations depositions are sometimes taken during or even after trial. =Civil procedure= In almost all cases pending in United States federal courts, depositions are carried out under Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. About 35 states use versions of the FRCP in their state courts. Other states have discovery rules that are set out either in court rules or statutes, and which vary somewhat from one state to another. According to FRCP Rule 30, the number of depositions is limited to ten depositions per side (i.e. plaintiffs and defendants), with deposition of each deponent limited to a single day of no more than seven hours (unless specified otherwise in local rules of the district). Expert witness deposition in a mock trial simulation. The court reporter, who is an officer of the court, administers the oath to the deponent. The person to be deposed (questioned) at a deposition, known as the deponent, is usually notified to appear at the appropriate time and place by means of a subpoena. Frequently the most desired witness (the deponent) is an opposite party to the action. In that instance, legal notice may be given to that person's attorney, and a subpoena is not required. But, if the witness is not a party to the lawsuit (a third party) or is reluctant to testify, then a subpoena must be served on that party. To ensure an accurate record of statements made during a deposition, a court reporter is present and typically transcribes the deposition by digital recording or stenographic means. Depending upon the amount in controversy and the ability of the witness to appear at trial, audio or video recordings of the deposition are sometimes taken as well. Conduct of depositions Depositions usually take place at the office of the court reporter or in the office of one of the law firms involved in a case. However, depositions are also sometimes taken at a witness's workplace or home, or in a nearby hotel's conference room. Generally, the deposition is attended by the person who is to be deposed, their attorney, court reporter, and other parties in the case who can appear personally or be represented by their counsels. Any party to the action and their attorneys have the right to be present and to ask questions. Prior to taking a deposition, the court reporter administers the same oath or affirmation that the deponent would take if the testimony were being given in court in front of a judge and jury. Thereafter, the court reporter makes a verbatim digital or stenographic record of all that is said during the deposition, in the same manner that witness testimony is recorded in court. Some jurisdictions allow stenomask technology in lieu of traditional stenographic equipment, although many jurisdictions still prohibit stenomask because of its disconcerting effect on some lawyers and witnesses. Attorneys for the deposing litigant are often present, although this is not required in all jurisdictions. The attorney who has ordered the deposition begins questioning of the deponent (this is referred to as \\"direct examination\\" or \\"direct\\" for short). Since nods and gestures cannot be recorded, the witness is instructed to answer all questions aloud. After the direct examination, other attorneys in attendance have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The first attorney may ask more questions at the end, in re-direct, which may be followed by re-cross. During the course of the deposition, one attorney or another may object to questions asked. In most jurisdictions, only two types of objections are allowed: The first is to assert a privilege and the second is to object to the form of the question asked. Objections to form are frequently used to signal the witness to be careful in answering the question. Since the judge is not present, all other objections, in particular those involving the rules of evidence, are generally preserved until trial. They still can be made sometime at the deposition to indicate the serious problem to judge and witness, but the witness must answer the question despite these objections. If the form objection is made, the opposite party still has the right to re-phrase the same question and ask it again. Indeed, in Texas, lawyers were so aggressively using objections to indirectly coach their witnesses on the record that all objections outside four narrow categories are now prohibited and making such prohibited objections waives all objections to the question or answer at issue. California is the major \\"outlier\\" on deposition objections; under the California Civil Discovery Act as enacted in 1957 and heavily revised in 1986, most objections must be given on the record at the deposition (and must be specific as to the objectionable nature of the question or response) or they are permanently waived. As with oral examination at trial, depositions can become heated at times, with some attorneys asking harassing questions to provoke witnesses into losing their tempers, some witnesses giving evasive answers, and occasional use of profane language. In extreme situations, one side or the other may ask the reporter to mark the record, then may suspend the deposition, demand a rush transcript, and file an emergency motion to compel a response, for a protective order, or for sanctions. Some courts have magistrates or discovery commissioners who are on call for such contingencies, and the parties are supposed to use them to referee such disputes over the phone before resorting to filing motions. In extreme circumstances where the relationship between the lawyers, parties, or witnesses has totally broken down, the court may require the use of a discovery referee who will have authority to sit in on depositions and rule immediately on objections as they are presented, or may order that all further depositions take place in court in the presence of a judge. Parties can bring documents to the deposition and ask document identification questions to build a foundation for making the documents admissible as evidence at trial, as long as the deponent admits their authenticity. The court reporter and all parties in the case are usually provided a copy of the documents during the deposition for review. In recent years, developments in litigation technology has allowed the use of paper documents to be replaced by electronic documents and exhibits in the deposition. In such cases, the examining attorney marks and distributes the official exhibits electronically using a laptop or tablet device. The deponent, court reporter, and all parties receive digital official exhibits or courtesy copies. Combined with live transcript feed technology and legal videography, digital exhibit technology has made participation in remote depositions more functional and popular. Under FRCP 30(d)(1) and its state counterparts, a deposition normally must take place for no longer than seven hours on one day per each deponent, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or ordered by the court. This means that the deposing party who knows that a deposition will go longer than one day must either ask the deponent to stipulate to more time, or, if the deponent is uncooperative, go before the court and file a motion for a longer deposition. California was the major exception, in that it had no default time limit; depositions can theoretically proceed indefinitely, or at least until the deposition becomes so obviously excessive and burdensome that the deponent is able to move for a protective order. However, in January 2013, the California legislature amended the previous rule to fall in line with the federal rule, now requiring that depositions will typically be limited to seven hours of total testimony. It is worth noting that this new California rule does not apply to \\"any case brought by an employee or applicant for employment against an employer for acts or omissions arising out of or relating to the employment relationship.\\" Example page from stenographers copy of an expert's deposition from Anderson v. Cryovac After the deposition, the transcript is then published in the form of a hardcopy booklet, which is provided to the deponent as well as to any party to the suit who wishes to purchase a copy. The booklet will have the case caption (the name of the court, case number, and names of the parties) on the front. Inside, the pages have line numbers along the left margin, so that the parties can precisely cite testimony by page and line in later court documents. Timestamps are inserted into the margin if a video recording is being made; in the event the witness is unavailable for trial, the parties or the court will use the timestamps to identify admissible segments which a video editor will stitch together to present to the jury. Finally, a concordance is automatically generated by the stenographic system's software and included in the back of the booklet. Most court reporters can also provide a digital copy of the transcript in ASCII, RealLegal, and PDF formats. The court reporter keeps a copy of the documents provided to the deponent during the deposition for document identification questions, unless digital document and exhibit technology is employed, in which case the deponent and all parties receive the official exhibits in real time. Deponent has right to read and sign the deposition transcript before it is filed with the court. Deponent cannot change his statements on the deposition transcript, but under rule 30(e) they can correct on additional \\"errata sheet\\" any mistakes in the deposition transcript shortly after the testimony has been typed and bound. The errata sheet allows the deponent to make any modifications that make \\"changes in form or substance,\\" giving the deponent the option to alter their record from the original transcript. Issues may arise where a party attempts to make substantive changes to testimony through errata sheets. Use of depositions The chief values of obtaining a deposition, as with any discovery proceeding, is to give all litigant parties in a contested case a fair preview of the evidence, and to provide support documents for further trials and dispositive motions. The process provides a \\"level playing field\\" of information among the litigants and avoids surprises at trial (traditionally regarded as an unfair tactic). Another benefit of taking depositions is to preserve a witness's recollection while it is still fresh, since the trial may still be months or years away. When a witness's testimony in open court is inconsistent with that given at deposition, a party can introduce the deposition to impeach (or contradict) the witness. In the event a witness is unavailable for trial (usually because they are deceased, seriously ill, or live hundreds of miles away), their deposition may be read or played before the jury and made part of the record in the case, with the same legal force as live testimony. In some states, stenographic, audio, or video records of depositions can be offered into evidence even if the witness is available. Deposition of the opposite party is often used to produce self- incriminating statements from the deponent, also document identification questions can make exhibits admissible for hearings and summary judgment motions. Sometimes, after a number of witnesses have been deposed, the parties will have enough information that they can reasonably predict the outcome of a prospective trial, and may decide to arrive at a compromise settlement, thus avoiding trial and preventing additional costs of litigation. Accordingly, while most depositions are not videotaped, opposing counsel may use the opportunity to get an impression of the witness's affect and appearance, because these are telling factors as to how that person will present in front of a jury. Furthermore, deposition transcripts are frequently submitted in support of motions for summary judgment as evidence that there is no triable issue of fact. The moving party may use transcripts to argue that even if all the testimony given at deposition was given again at trial, no reasonable factfinder could find in the opponent's favor on a material issue of fact. The rationale is that generally, a witness must give consistent testimony on all material issues of fact both at deposition and at trial (unless there is a very good reason for changing one's answers), or else the inconsistencies can and will be used to impeach his credibility. =Criminal procedure= In some United States jurisdictions, depositions may be taken in criminal cases, for reasons that vary between jurisdictions. In federal criminal cases, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 15 governs the taking of depositions. Each state has its own laws which govern the taking of depositions. Most jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken to perpetuate the testimony of a witness, that is, preserve their testimony for trial. If the person requested to testify (deponent) is a party to the lawsuit or someone who works for an involved party, notice of time and place of the examination before trial can be given to the other side's attorney, but if the witness is an independent third party, a subpoena must be served on him/her if he/she is recalcitrant. This occurs when a witness may not be able to testify at trial. The deposition of the witness is taken and, if the witness is unable to appear at trial, the deposition may be used to establish the witness' testimony in lieu of the witness actually testifying. Regarding depositions to preserve testimony, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes a constitutional right of the defendant to be present during the deposition and to cross-examine the witness. The defendant may waive this right. Some jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken for purposes of discovery. In these jurisdictions, the defendant does not have a constitutional right to be present, although such a right may be established by statute. Some jurisdictions require that because of the sensitive nature of taking a deposition of a minor, it must be videotaped. A defendant in a criminal case may not be deposed without his consent because of the Fifth Amendment right to not give testimony against oneself. Canada In Canada, the process is nearly identical to that followed in the United States, but the proceeding is called an examination for discovery. Typically, the questions for the witness will be a mixture of direct questions and cross-examinations on prior statements. While most of the same objections to form are applicable as in the United States, the witness's lawyer may additionally take certain questions \\"under advisement\\" as a means of delaying answering the question, without making a formal objection. The process is considered in Canada to be time-consuming and expensive when conducted without limits. As a result, Rule 31.05.1 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure has, since January 1, 2010, limited examinations for discovery to seven hours per party except with consent of the other parties or the leave of the court. British Columbia implemented similar reforms on July 1, 2010, although the new Rule 7-2(2) can be read in two ways, it appears to be that each party can examine each other party for a maximum of seven hours unless the court orders otherwise. The alternative reading is that each party is only to be examined for a maximum of seven hours. Australia, England and Wales In Australia, and in England and Wales, there is no right of oral examination of opposing parties in civil litigation, save that in England and Wales the pre-litigation discovery process allows for each party to make written questions and the answers to those questions will be relied upon during if there is any discrepancy in the oral evidence given in court. Oral examination is typically completed after pleadings and requests for particulars by the exchange of affidavits of documents and sometimes written questions and answers (interrogatories). Often affidavits are exchanged before trial, but the first opportunity to orally question the opposing party's evidence is usually at trial.

It is useful in describing the algebra on infinities and the various limiting behaviors in calculus and mathematical analysis, especially in the theory of measure and integration. The affinely extended real number system is denoted \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} or [-\\\\infty, +\\\\infty] or \\\\mathbb R\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{-\\\\infty,+\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}. When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol +\\\\infty is often written simply as \\\\infty. Motivation =Limits= It is often useful to describe the behavior of a function f(x), as either the argument x or the function value f(x) gets \\"infinitely large\\" in some sense. For example, consider the function :f(x) = x^{-2}. The graph of this function has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0\\\\. Geometrically, when moving increasingly farther to the right along the x-axis, the value of \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{x^2} approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the limit of a function at a real number, except that there is no real number to which x approaches. By adjoining the elements +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty to \\\\mathbb{R}, it enables a formulation of a \\"limit at infinity\\", with topological properties similar to those for \\\\mathbb{R}. To make things completely formal, the Cauchy sequences definition of \\\\mathbb{R} allows defining +\\\\infty as the set of all sequences \\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\\\\\} of rational numbers, such that every M\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} is associated with a corresponding N\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} for which a_n>M for all n>N. The definition of -\\\\infty can be constructed similarly. =Measure and integration= In measure theory, it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite. Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a measure to \\\\mathbb{R} that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering improper integrals, such as :\\\\int_1^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{dx}{x} the value \\"infinity\\" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as :f_n(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 2n(1-nx), & \\\\mbox{if } 0 \\\\le x \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\frac{1}{n} < x \\\\le 1\\\\end{cases} Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the monotone convergence theorem and the dominated convergence theorem would not make sense. Order and topological properties The affinely extended real number system can be turned into a totally ordered set, by defining -\\\\infty\\\\leq a \\\\leq +\\\\infty for all a. With this order topology, \\\\overline\\\\mathbb R has the desirable property of compactness: every subset of \\\\overline\\\\mathbb R has a supremum and an infimum (the infimum of the empty set is +\\\\infty, and its supremum is -\\\\infty). Moreover, with this topology, \\\\overline\\\\mathbb R is homeomorphic to the unit interval [0, 1]. Thus the topology is metrizable, corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric that is an extension of the ordinary metric on \\\\mathbb{R}. In this topology, a set U is a neighborhood of +\\\\infty, if and only if it contains a set \\\\\\\\{x : x > a\\\\\\\\} for some real number a. The notion of the neighborhood of -\\\\infty can be defined similarly. Using this characterization of extended-real neighborhoods, the specially defined limits for x tending to +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty, and the specially defined concepts of limits equal to +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty, reduce to the general topological definition of limits. Arithmetic operations The arithmetic operations of \\\\mathbb{R} can be partially extended to \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{R} as follows: : \\\\begin{align} a + \\\\infty = +\\\\infty + a & = +\\\\infty, & a & eq -\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ a - \\\\infty = -\\\\infty + a & = -\\\\infty, & a & eq +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\cdot (\\\\pm\\\\infty) = \\\\pm\\\\infty \\\\cdot a & = \\\\pm\\\\infty, & a & \\\\in (0, +\\\\infty] \\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\cdot (\\\\pm\\\\infty) = \\\\pm\\\\infty \\\\cdot a & = \\\\mp\\\\infty, & a & \\\\in [-\\\\infty, 0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{a}{\\\\pm\\\\infty} & = 0, & a & \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\pm\\\\infty}{a} & = \\\\pm\\\\infty, & a & \\\\in (0, +\\\\infty) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\pm\\\\infty}{a} & = \\\\mp\\\\infty, & a & \\\\in (-\\\\infty, 0) \\\\end{align} For exponentiation, see Exponentiation#Limits of powers. Here, \\"a + \\\\infty\\" means both \\"a + (+\\\\infty)\\" and \\"a - (-\\\\infty)\\", while \\"a - \\\\infty\\" means both \\"a - (+\\\\infty)\\" and The expressions \\\\infty - \\\\infty, 0 \\\\times (\\\\pm\\\\infty) and \\\\pm\\\\infty/\\\\pm\\\\infty (called indeterminate forms) are usually left undefined. These rules are modeled on the laws for infinite limits. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, 0 \\\\times \\\\pm\\\\infty is often defined as 0. When dealing with both positive and negative extended real numbers, the expression 1/0 is usually left undefined, because, although it is true that for every real nonzero sequence f that converges to 0, the reciprocal sequence 1/f is eventually contained in every neighborhood of \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty,-\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, it is not true that the sequence 1/f must itself converge to either -\\\\infty or \\\\infty. Said another way, if a continuous function f achieves a zero at a certain value x_0, then it need not be the case that 1/f tends to either -\\\\infty or \\\\infty in the limit as x tends to x_0. This is the case for the limits of the identity function f(x)=x when x tends to 0, and of f(x) = x^2\\\\sin (1/x) (for the latter function, neither -\\\\infty nor \\\\infty is a limit of 1/f(x), even if only positive values of are considered). However, in contexts where only non-negative values are considered, it is often convenient to define 1/0 = +\\\\infty. For example, when working with power series, the radius of convergence of a power series with coefficients a_n is often defined as the reciprocal of the limit-supremum of the sequence \\\\\\\\{a_n^{1/n}\\\\\\\\}. Thus, if one allows 1/0 to take the value +\\\\infty, then one can use this formula regardless of whether the limit- supremum is 0 or not. Algebraic properties With these definitions, \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{R} is not even a semigroup, let alone a group, a ring or a field as in the case of \\\\mathbb{R}. However, it has several convenient properties: * a + (b + c) and (a + b) + c are either equal or both undefined. * a + b and b + a are either equal or both undefined. * a \\\\cdot (b \\\\cdot c) and (a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c are either equal or both undefined. * a \\\\cdot b and b \\\\cdot a are either equal or both undefined * a \\\\cdot (b + c) and (a \\\\cdot b) + (a \\\\cdot c) are equal if both are defined. * If a \\\\leq b and if both a + c and b + c are defined, then a + c \\\\leq b + c. * If a \\\\leq b and c > 0 and if both a \\\\cdot c and b \\\\cdot c are defined, then a \\\\cdot c \\\\leq b \\\\cdot c. In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{R}‚Äîas long as all occurring expressions are defined. Miscellaneous Several functions can be continuously extended to \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{R} by taking limits. For instance, one may define the extremal points of the following functions as follow:\\\\exp(-\\\\infty) = 0, \\\\ \\\\ln(0) = -\\\\infty, \\\\ \\\\tanh(\\\\pm\\\\infty) = \\\\pm 1, \\\\ \\\\arctan(\\\\pm\\\\infty) = \\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} Some singularities may additionally be removed. For example, the function 1/x^2 can be continuously extended to \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{R} (under some definitions of continuity), by setting the value to +\\\\infty for x = 0, and 0 for x = +\\\\infty and x = -\\\\infty. On the other hand, the function 1/x can not be continuously extended, because the function approaches -\\\\infty as x approaches 0 from below, and +\\\\infty as x approaches 0 from above. A similar but different real-line system, the projectively extended real line, does not distinguish between +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty (i.e., infinity is unsigned). As a result, a function may have limit \\\\infty on the projectively extended real line, while in the affinely extended real number system, only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function 1/x at x = 0. On the other hand :\\\\lim_{x \\\\to -\\\\infty}{f(x)} and \\\\lim_{x \\\\to +\\\\infty}{f(x)} correspond on the projectively extended real line to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus, the functions e^x and \\\\arctan(x) cannot be made continuous at x = \\\\infty on the projectively extended real line.

By fetching and dispatching two instructions at a time, a maximum of two instructions per cycle can be completed. (IF = Instruction Fetch, ID = Instruction Decode, EX = Execute, MEM = Memory access, WB = Register write back, i = Instruction number, t = Clock cycle [i.e. time]) CRAY T3e supercomputer with four superscalar Alpha 21164 processors A superscalar processor is a CPU that implements a form of parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. In contrast to a scalar processor that can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor. It therefore allows for more throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. Each execution unit is not a separate processor (or a core if the processor is a multi-core processor), but an execution resource within a single CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit. In Flynn's taxonomy, a single-core superscalar processor is classified as an SISD processor (Single Instruction stream, Single Data stream), though a single- core superscalar processor that supports short vector operations could be classified as SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data streams). A multi-core superscalar processor is classified as an MIMD processor (Multiple Instruction streams, Multiple Data streams). While a superscalar CPU is typically also pipelined, superscalar and pipelining execution are considered different performance enhancement techniques. The former executes multiple instructions in parallel by using multiple execution units, whereas the latter executes multiple instructions in the same execution unit in parallel by dividing the execution unit into different phases. The superscalar technique is traditionally associated with several identifying characteristics (within a given CPU): * Instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream * The CPU dynamically checks for data dependencies between instructions at run time (versus software checking at compile time) * The CPU can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle History Seymour Cray's CDC 6600 from 1966 is often mentioned as the first superscalar design. The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91 was another superscalar mainframe. The Motorola MC88100 (1988), the Intel i960CA (1989) and the AMD 29000-series 29050 (1990) microprocessors were the first commercial single-chip superscalar microprocessors. RISC microprocessors like these were the first to have superscalar execution, because RISC architectures free transistors and die area which can be used to include multiple execution units (this was why RISC designs were faster than CISC designs through the 1980s and into the 1990s). Except for CPUs used in low- power applications, embedded systems, and battery-powered devices, essentially all general-purpose CPUs developed since about 1998 are superscalar. The P5 Pentium was the first superscalar x86 processor; the Nx586, P6 Pentium Pro and AMD K5 were among the first designs which decode x86-instructions asynchronously into dynamic microcode-like micro-op sequences prior to actual execution on a superscalar microarchitecture; this opened up for dynamic scheduling of buffered partial instructions and enabled more parallelism to be extracted compared to the more rigid methods used in the simpler P5 Pentium; it also simplified speculative execution and allowed higher clock frequencies compared to designs such as the advanced Cyrix 6x86. Scalar to superscalar The simplest processors are scalar processors. Each instruction executed by a scalar processor typically manipulates one or two data items at a time. By contrast, each instruction executed by a vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items. An analogy is the difference between scalar and vector arithmetic. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two. Each instruction processes one data item, but there are multiple execution units within each CPU thus multiple instructions can be processing separate data items concurrently. Superscalar CPU design emphasizes improving the instruction dispatcher accuracy, and allowing it to keep the multiple execution units in use at all times. This has become increasingly important as the number of units has increased. While early superscalar CPUs would have two ALUs and a single FPU, a later design such as the PowerPC 970 includes four ALUs, two FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher is ineffective at keeping all of these units fed with instructions, the performance of the system will be no better than that of a simpler, cheaper design. A superscalar processor usually sustains an execution rate in excess of one instruction per machine cycle. But merely processing multiple instructions concurrently does not make an architecture superscalar, since pipelined, multiprocessor or multi-core architectures also achieve that, but with different methods. In a superscalar CPU the dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching each to one of the several execution units contained inside a single CPU. Therefore, a superscalar processor can be envisioned having multiple parallel pipelines, each of which is processing instructions simultaneously from a single instruction thread. Limitations Available performance improvement from superscalar techniques is limited by three key areas: * The degree of intrinsic parallelism in the instruction stream (instructions requiring the same computational resources from the CPU) * The complexity and time cost of dependency checking logic and register renaming circuitry * The branch instruction processing Existing binary executable programs have varying degrees of intrinsic parallelism. In some cases instructions are not dependent on each other and can be executed simultaneously. In other cases they are inter-dependent: one instruction impacts either resources or results of the other. The instructions \`a = b + c; d = e + f\` can be run in parallel because none of the results depend on other calculations. However, the instructions \`a = b + c; b = e + f\` might not be runnable in parallel, depending on the order in which the instructions complete while they move through the units. Although the instruction stream may contain no inter-instruction dependencies, a superscalar CPU must nonetheless check for that possibility, since there is no assurance otherwise and failure to detect a dependency would produce incorrect results. No matter how advanced the semiconductor process or how fast the switching speed, this places a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While process advances will allow ever greater numbers of execution units (e.g. ALUs), the burden of checking instruction dependencies grows rapidly, as does the complexity of register renaming circuitry to mitigate some dependencies. Collectively the power consumption, complexity and gate delay costs limit the achievable superscalar speedup to roughly eight simultaneously dispatched instructions. However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic on an otherwise conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms a second limitation. Alternatives Collectively, these limits drive investigation into alternative architectural changes such as very long instruction word (VLIW), explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC), simultaneous multithreading (SMT), and multi-core computing. With VLIW, the burdensome task of dependency checking by hardware logic at run time is removed and delegated to the compiler. Explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) is like VLIW with extra cache prefetching instructions. Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar processors. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern processor architectures. Superscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire processors. A single processor is composed of finer-grained execution units such as the ALU, integer multiplier, integer shifter, FPU, etc. There may be multiple versions of each execution unit to enable execution of many instructions in parallel. This differs from a multi-core processor that concurrently processes instructions from multiple threads, one thread per processing unit (called \\"core\\"). It also differs from a pipelined processor, where the multiple instructions can concurrently be in various stages of execution, assembly-line fashion. The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive‚Äîthey can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor. Thus a multicore CPU is possible where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel pipelines, each pipeline being superscalar. Some processors also include vector capability.

Whereas conventional central processing units (CPU, processor) mostly allow programs to specify instructions to execute in sequence only, a VLIW processor allows programs to explicitly specify instructions to execute in parallel. This design is intended to allow higher performance without the complexity inherent in some other designs.  Overview  The traditional means to improve performance in processors include dividing instructions into substeps so the instructions can be executed partly at the same time (termed pipelining), dispatching individual instructions to be executed independently, in different parts of the processor (superscalar architectures), and even executing instructions in an order different from the program (out-of-order execution). These methods all complicate hardware (larger circuits, higher cost and energy use) because the processor must make all of the decisions internally for these methods to work. In contrast, the VLIW method depends on the programs providing all the decisions regarding which instructions to execute simultaneously and how to resolve conflicts. As a practical matter, this means that the compiler (software used to create the final programs) becomes far more complex, but the hardware is simpler than in many other means of parallelism. Motivation A processor that executes every instruction one after the other (i.e., a non- pipelined scalar architecture) may use processor resources inefficiently, yielding potential poor performance. The performance can be improved by executing different substeps of sequential instructions simultaneously (termed pipelining), or even executing multiple instructions entirely simultaneously as in superscalar architectures. Further improvement can be achieved by executing instructions in an order different from that in which they occur in a program, termed out-of-order execution. These three methods all raise hardware complexity. Before executing any operations in parallel, the processor must verify that the instructions have no interdependencies. For example, if a first instruction's result is used as a second instruction's input, then they cannot execute at the same time and the second instruction cannot execute before the first. Modern out-of-order processors have increased the hardware resources which schedule instructions and determine interdependencies. In contrast, VLIW executes operations in parallel, based on a fixed schedule, determined when programs are compiled. Since determining the order of execution of operations (including which operations can execute simultaneously) is handled by the compiler, the processor does not need the scheduling hardware that the three methods described above require. Thus, VLIW CPUs offer more computing with less hardware complexity (but greater compiler complexity) than do most superscalar CPUs. Design In superscalar designs, the number of execution units is invisible to the instruction set. Each instruction encodes one operation only. For most superscalar designs, the instruction width is 32 bits or fewer. In contrast, one VLIW instruction encodes multiple operations, at least one operation for each execution unit of a device. For example, if a VLIW device has five execution units, then a VLIW instruction for the device has five operation fields, each field specifying what operation should be done on that corresponding execution unit. To accommodate these operation fields, VLIW instructions are usually at least 64 bits wide, and far wider on some architectures. For example, the following is an instruction for the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC). In one cycle, it does a floating-point multiply, a floating-point add, and two autoincrement loads. All of this fits in one 48-bit instruction: \`f12 = f0 * f4, f8 = f8 + f12, f0 = dm(i0, m3), f4 = pm(i8, m9);\` Since the earliest days of computer architecture, some CPUs have added several arithmetic logic units (ALUs) to run in parallel. Superscalar CPUs use hardware to decide which operations can run in parallel at runtime, while VLIW CPUs use software (the compiler) to decide which operations can run in parallel in advance. Because the complexity of instruction scheduling is moved into the compiler, complexity of hardware can be reduced substantially. A similar problem occurs when the result of a parallelizable instruction is used as input for a branch. Most modern CPUs guess which branch will be taken even before the calculation is complete, so that they can load the instructions for the branch, or (in some architectures) even start to compute them speculatively. If the CPU guesses wrong, all of these instructions and their context need to be flushed and the correct ones loaded, which takes time. This has led to increasingly complex instruction-dispatch logic that attempts to guess correctly, and the simplicity of the original reduced instruction set computing (RISC) designs has been eroded. VLIW lacks this logic, and thus lacks its energy use, possible design defects, and other negative aspects. In a VLIW, the compiler uses heuristics or profile information to guess the direction of a branch. This allows it to move and preschedule operations speculatively before the branch is taken, favoring the most likely path it expects through the branch. If the branch takes an unexpected way, the compiler has already generated compensating code to discard speculative results to preserve program semantics. Vector processor (single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)) cores can be combined with the VLIW architecture such as in the Fujitsu FR-V microprocessor, further increasing throughput and speed. History The concept of VLIW architecture, and the term VLIW, were invented by Josh Fisher in his research group at Yale University in the early 1980s. His original development of trace scheduling as a compiling method for VLIW was developed when he was a graduate student at New York University. Before VLIW, the notion of prescheduling execution units and instruction-level parallelism in software was well established in the practice of developing horizontal microcode. Fisher's innovations involved developing a compiler that could target horizontal microcode from programs written in an ordinary programming language. He realized that to get good performance and target a wide-issue machine, it would be necessary to find parallelism beyond that generally within a basic block. He also developed region scheduling methods to identify parallelism beyond basic blocks. Trace scheduling is such a method, and involves scheduling the most likely path of basic blocks first, inserting compensating code to deal with speculative motions, scheduling the second most likely trace, and so on, until the schedule is complete. Fisher's second innovation was the notion that the target CPU architecture should be designed to be a reasonable target for a compiler; that the compiler and the architecture for a VLIW processor must be codesigned. This was inspired partly by the difficulty Fisher observed at Yale of compiling for architectures like Floating Point Systems' FPS164, which had a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture that separated instruction initiation from the instructions that saved the result, needing very complex scheduling algorithms. Fisher developed a set of principles characterizing a proper VLIW design, such as self-draining pipelines, wide multi-port register files, and memory architectures. These principles made it easier for compilers to emit fast code. The first VLIW compiler was described in a Ph.D. thesis by John Ellis, supervised by Fisher. The compiler was named Bulldog, after Yale's mascot. Fisher left Yale in 1984 to found a startup company, Multiflow, along with cofounders John O'Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Multiflow produced the TRACE series of VLIW minisupercomputers, shipping their first machines in 1987. Multiflow's VLIW could issue 28 operations in parallel per instruction. The TRACE system was implemented in a mix of medium-scale integration (MSI), large-scale integration (LSI), and very large-scale integration (VLSI), packaged in cabinets, a technology obsoleted as it grew more cost-effective to integrate all of the components of a processor (excluding memory) on one chip. Multiflow was too early to catch the following wave, when chip architectures began to allow multiple-issue CPUs. The major semiconductor companies recognized the value of Multiflow technology in this context, so the compiler and architecture were subsequently licensed to most of these firms. Implementations Cydrome was a company producing VLIW numeric processors using emitter-coupled logic (ECL) integrated circuits in the same timeframe (late 1980s). This company, like Multiflow, failed after a few years. One of the licensees of the Multiflow technology is Hewlett-Packard, which Josh Fisher joined after Multiflow's demise. Bob Rau, founder of Cydrome, also joined HP after Cydrome failed. These two would lead computer architecture research at Hewlett-Packard during the 1990s. Along with the above systems, during the same time (1989‚Äì1990), Intel implemented VLIW in the Intel i860, their first 64-bit microprocessor, and the first processor to implement VLIW on one chip. This processor could operate in both simple RISC mode and VLIW mode: > In the early 1990s, Intel introduced the i860 RISC microprocessor. This > simple chip had two modes of operation: a scalar mode and a VLIW mode. In > the VLIW mode, the processor always fetched two instructions and assumed > that one was an integer instruction and the other floating-point. The i860's VLIW mode was used extensively in embedded digital signal processor (DSP) applications since the application execution and datasets were simple, well ordered and predictable, allowing designers to fully exploit the parallel execution advantages enabled by VLIW. In VLIW mode, the i860 could maintain floating-point performance in the range of 20-40 double-precision MFLOPS; a very high value for its time and for a processor running at 25-50Mhz. In the 1990s, Hewlett-Packard researched this problem as a side effect of ongoing work on their PA-RISC processor family. They found that the CPU could be greatly simplified by removing the complex dispatch logic from the CPU and placing it in the compiler. Compilers of the day were far more complex than those of the 1980s, so the added complexity in the compiler was considered to be a small cost. VLIW CPUs are usually made of multiple RISC-like execution units that operate independently. Contemporary VLIWs usually have four to eight main execution units. Compilers generate initial instruction sequences for the VLIW CPU in roughly the same manner as for traditional CPUs, generating a sequence of RISC-like instructions. The compiler analyzes this code for dependence relationships and resource requirements. It then schedules the instructions according to those constraints. In this process, independent instructions can be scheduled in parallel. Because VLIWs typically represent instructions scheduled in parallel with a longer instruction word that incorporates the individual instructions, this results in a much longer opcode (termed very long) to specify what executes on a given cycle. Examples of contemporary VLIW CPUs include the TriMedia media processors by NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors), the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC) DSP by Analog Devices, the C6000 digital signal processor (DSP) family by Texas Instruments, the ST200 family by STMicroelectronics based on the Lx architecture (designed in Josh Fisher's HP lab by Paolo Faraboschi), and the MPPA Manycore family by Kalray. These contemporary VLIW CPUs are mainly successful as embedded media processors for consumer electronic devices. VLIW features have also been added to configurable processor cores for system-on-a- chip (SoC) designs. For example, Tensilica's Xtensa LX2 processor incorporates a technology named Flexible Length Instruction eXtensions (FLIX) that allows multi-operation instructions. The Xtensa C/C++ compiler can freely intermix 32- or 64-bit FLIX instructions with the Xtensa processor's one-operation RISC instructions, which are 16 or 24 bits wide. By packing multiple operations into a wide 32- or 64-bit instruction word and allowing these multi-operation instructions to intermix with shorter RISC instructions, FLIX allows SoC designers to realize VLIW's performance advantages while eliminating the code bloat of early VLIW architectures. The Infineon Carmel DSP is another VLIW processor core intended for SoC. It uses a similar code density improvement method called configurable long instruction word (CLIW). Outside embedded processing markets, Intel's Itanium IA-64 explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) and Elbrus 2000 appear as the only examples of a widely used VLIW CPU architectures. However, EPIC architecture is sometimes distinguished from a pure VLIW architecture, since EPIC advocates full instruction predication, rotating register files, and a very long instruction word that can encode non-parallel instruction groups. VLIWs also gained significant consumer penetration in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, though both Nvidia and AMD have since moved to RISC architectures to improve performance on non-graphics workloads. ATI Technologies' (ATI) and Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) TeraScale microarchitecture for graphics processing units (GPUs) is a VLIW microarchitecture. In December 2015, the first shipment of PCs based on VLIW CPU Elbrus-4s was made in Russia. Backward compatibility When silicon technology allowed for wider implementations (with more execution units) to be built, the compiled programs for the earlier generation would not run on the wider implementations, as the encoding of binary instructions depended on the number of execution units of the machine. Transmeta addressed this issue by including a binary-to-binary software compiler layer (termed code morphing) in their Crusoe implementation of the x86 architecture. This mechanism was advertised to basically recompile, optimize, and translate x86 opcodes at runtime into the CPU's internal machine code. Thus, the Transmeta chip is internally a VLIW processor, effectively decoupled from the x86 CISC instruction set that it executes. Intel's Itanium architecture (among others) solved the backward-compatibility problem with a more general mechanism. Within each of the multiple-opcode instructions, a bit field is allocated to denote dependency on the prior VLIW instruction within the program instruction stream. These bits are set at compile time, thus relieving the hardware from calculating this dependency information. Having this dependency information encoded in the instruction stream allows wider implementations to issue multiple non-dependent VLIW instructions in parallel per cycle, while narrower implementations would issue a smaller number of VLIW instructions per cycle. Another perceived deficiency of VLIW designs is the code bloat that occurs when one or more execution unit(s) have no useful work to do and thus must execute No Operation NOP instructions. This occurs when there are dependencies in the code and the instruction pipelines must be allowed to drain before later operations can proceed. Since the number of transistors on a chip has grown, the perceived disadvantages of the VLIW have diminished in importance. VLIW architectures are growing in popularity, especially in the embedded system market, where it is possible to customize a processor for an application in a system-on-a-chip. Embedded VLIW products are available from several vendors, including the FR-V from Fujitsu, the BSP15/16 from Pixelworks, the ST231 from STMicroelectronics, the TriMediaTriMedia from NXP Semiconductors, the CEVA-X DSP from CEVA, the Jazz DSP from Improv Systems, and Silicon Hive. The Texas Instruments TMS320 DSP line has evolved, in its C6xxx family, to look more like a VLIW, in contrast to the earlier C5xxx family.

This group also includes a number of russuloid hypogeous fungi, polypores such as Bondarzewia, some tooth fungi (e.g. Auriscalpium vulgare), and club fungi e.g. Artomyces. Basidiospores in this group are typically ornamented with amyloid warts or reticulation but a few exceptions are known, e.g. Heterobasidion annosum. The genus Clavicorona was often treated in the Russulales, but its type species, C. taxophila is in the Agaricales. The remaining species are retained in the Russulales in the genus Artomyces. Genera Incertae sedis There are several genera classified in the Russulales that are i) poorly known, ii) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or iii) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., Incertae sedis with respect to familial placement).

In calculus, Taylor's theorem gives an approximation of a k-times differentiable function around a given point by a polynomial of degree k, called the kth-order Taylor polynomial. For a smooth function, the Taylor polynomial is the truncation at the order k of the Taylor series of the function. The first-order Taylor polynomial is the linear approximation of the function, and the second-order Taylor polynomial is often referred to as the quadratic approximation. (2013). and quadratic approximation\\" Retrieved December 6, 2018 There are several versions of Taylor's theorem, some giving explicit estimates of the approximation error of the function by its Taylor polynomial. Taylor's theorem is named after the mathematician Brook Taylor, who stated a version of it in 1715, Translated into English in although an earlier version of the result was already mentioned in 1671 by James Gregory.. Taylor's theorem is taught in introductory-level calculus courses and is one of the central elementary tools in mathematical analysis. It gives simple arithmetic formulas to accurately compute values of many transcendental functions such as the exponential function and trigonometric functions. It is the starting point of the study of analytic functions, and is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, as well as in numerical analysis and mathematical physics. Taylor's theorem also generalizes to multivariate and vector valued functions.  Motivation  Graph of (blue) with its linear approximation (red) at a = 0\\\\. If a real- valued function f(x) is differentiable at the point x = a, then it has a linear approximation near this point. This means that there exists a function h1(x) such that : f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + h_1(x)(x - a), \\\\quad \\\\lim_{x \\\\to a} h_1(x) = 0. Here :P_1(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) is the linear approximation of f(x) for x near the point a, whose graph is the tangent line to the graph y = f(x) at . The error in the approximation is: :R_1(x) = f(x) - P_1(x) = h_1(x)(x - a). As x tends to a, this error goes to zero much faster than f'(a)(x{-}a), making f(x)\\\\approx P_1(x) a useful approximation. Graph of (blue) with its quadratic approximation (red) at a = 0\\\\. Note the improvement in the approximation. For a better approximation to f(x), we can fit a quadratic polynomial instead of a linear function: :P_2(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \\\\frac{f(a)}{2}(x - a)^2. Instead of just matching one derivative of f(x) at x = a, this polynomial has the same first and second derivatives, as is evident upon differentiation. Taylor's theorem ensures that the quadratic approximation is, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of x = a, more accurate than the linear approximation. Specifically, :f(x) = P_2(x) + h_2(x)(x - a)^2, \\\\quad \\\\lim_{x \\\\to a} h_2(x) = 0. Here the error in the approximation is :R_2(x) = f(x) - P_2(x) = h_2(x)(x - a)^2, which, given the limiting behavior of h_2, goes to zero faster than (x - a)^2 as x tends to a. Approximation of f(x) = 1/(1 + x2) (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk of order k = 1, ..., 16 centered at x = 0 (red) and x = 1 (green). The approximations do not improve at all outside (‚àí1, 1) and (1 ‚àí ‚àö2, 1 + ‚àö2) respectively. Similarly, we might get still better approximations to f if we use polynomials of higher degree, since then we can match even more derivatives with f at the selected base point. In general, the error in approximating a function by a polynomial of degree k will go to zero much faster than (x{-}a)^k as x tends to a. However, there are functions, even infinitely differentiable ones, for which increasing the degree of the approximating polynomial does not increase the accuracy of approximation: we say such a function fails to be analytic at x = a: it is not (locally) determined by its derivatives at this point. Taylor's theorem is of asymptotic nature: it only tells us that the error Rk in an approximation by a k-th order Taylor polynomial Pk tends to zero faster than any nonzero k-th degree polynomial as x ‚Üí a. It does not tell us how large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulae for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on f. These enhanced versions of Taylor's theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function f is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.) There are several ways we might use the remainder term: # Estimate the error for a polynomial Pk(x) of degree k estimating f(x) on a given interval (a ‚Äì r, a + r). (Given the interval and degree, we find the error.) # Find the smallest degree k for which the polynomial Pk(x) approximates f(x) to within a given error tolerance on a given interval (a ‚àí r, a + r) . (Given the interval and error tolerance, we find the degree.) # Find the largest interval (a ‚àí r, a + r) on which Pk(x) approximates f(x) to within a given error tolerance. (Given the degree and error tolerance, we find the interval.) #  Taylor's theorem in one real variable  = Statement of the theorem = The precise statement of the most basic version of Taylor's theorem is as follows: The polynomial appearing in Taylor's theorem is the k-th order Taylor polynomial :P_k(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\\\frac{f(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k of the function f at the point a. The Taylor polynomial is the unique \\"asymptotic best fit\\" polynomial in the sense that if there exists a function and a k-th order polynomial p such that : f(x) = p(x) + h_k(x)(x-a)^k, \\\\quad \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a}h_k(x)=0, then p = Pk. Taylor's theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the remainder term : \\\\ R_k(x) = f(x) - P_k(x), which is the approximation error when approximating f with its Taylor polynomial. Using the little-o notation, the statement in Taylor's theorem reads as :R_k(x) = o(x-a^{k}), \\\\quad x\\\\to a. = Explicit formulas for the remainder = Under stronger regularity assumptions on f there are several precise formulae for the remainder term Rk of the Taylor polynomial, the most common ones being the following. These refinements of Taylor's theorem are usually proved using the mean value theorem, whence the name. Also other similar expressions can be found. For example, if G(t) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, then : R_k(x) = \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)}(\\\\xi)}{k!}(x-\\\\xi)^k \\\\frac{G(x)-G(a)}{G'(\\\\xi)} for some number Œæ between a and x. This version covers the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder as special cases, and is proved below using Cauchy's mean value theorem. The statement for the integral form of the remainder is more advanced than the previous ones, and requires understanding of Lebesgue integration theory for the full generality. However, it holds also in the sense of Riemann integral provided the (k + 1)th derivative of f is continuous on the closed interval [a,x]. Due to absolute continuity of f(k) on the closed interval between a and x, its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, and the result can be proven by a formal calculation using fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. = Estimates for the remainder = It is often useful in practice to be able to estimate the remainder term appearing in the Taylor approximation, rather than having an exact formula for it. Suppose that f is -times continuously differentiable in an interval I containing a. Suppose that there are real constants q and Q such that :q\\\\le f^{(k+1)}(x)\\\\le Q throughout I. Then the remainder term satisfies the inequality :q\\\\frac{(x-a)^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}\\\\le R_k(x)\\\\le Q\\\\frac{(x-a)^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}, if , and a similar estimate if . This is a simple consequence of the Lagrange form of the remainder. In particular, if :f^{(k+1)}(x)\\\\le M on an interval with some r>0 , then :R_k(x)\\\\le M\\\\frac{x-a^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}\\\\le M\\\\frac{r^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} for all The second inequality is called a uniform estimate, because it holds uniformly for all x on the interval = Example = Approximation of ex (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk of order k = 1,...,7 centered at x = 0 (red). Suppose that we wish to find the approximate value of the function on the interval while ensuring that the error in the approximation is no more than 10‚àí5. In this example we pretend that we only know the following properties of the exponential function: :(*) \\\\qquad e^0=1, \\\\qquad \\\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x, \\\\qquad e^x>0, \\\\qquad x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. From these properties it follows that for all k, and in particular, . Hence the k-th order Taylor polynomial of f at 0 and its remainder term in the Lagrange form are given by : P_k(x) = 1+x+\\\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{x^k}{k!}, \\\\qquad R_k(x)=\\\\frac{e^\\\\xi}{(k+1)!}x^{k+1}, where Œæ is some number between 0 and x. Since ex is increasing by (*), we can simply use ex ‚â§ 1 for x ‚àà [‚àí1, 0] to estimate the remainder on the subinterval [‚àí1, 0]. To obtain an upper bound for the remainder on [0,1], we use the property for 0<Œæ e^x = 1 + x + \\\\frac{e^\\\\xi}{2}x^2 < 1 + x + \\\\frac{e^x}{2}x^2, \\\\qquad 0 < x\\\\leq 1 using the second order Taylor expansion. Then we solve for ex to deduce that : e^x \\\\leq \\\\frac{1+x}{1-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}} = 2\\\\frac{1+x}{2-x^2} \\\\leq 4, \\\\qquad 0 \\\\leq x\\\\leq 1 simply by maximizing the numerator and minimizing the denominator. Combining these estimates for ex we see that : R_k(x)\\\\leq \\\\frac{4x^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} \\\\leq \\\\frac{4}{(k+1)!}, \\\\qquad -1\\\\leq x \\\\leq 1, so the required precision is certainly reached, when : \\\\frac{4}{(k+1)!} < 10^{-5} \\\\quad \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad 4\\\\cdot 10^5 < (k+1)! \\\\quad \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad k \\\\geq 9. (See factorial or compute by hand the values 9!=362 880 and 10!=3 628 800.) As a conclusion, Taylor's theorem leads to the approximation : e^x = 1+x+\\\\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{x^9}{9!} + R_9(x), \\\\qquad R_9(x)< 10^{-5}, \\\\qquad -1\\\\leq x \\\\leq 1. For instance, this approximation provides a decimal expression e ‚âà 2.71828, correct up to five decimal places.  Relationship to analyticity  = Taylor expansions of real analytic functions = Let I ‚äÇ R be an open interval. By definition, a function f : I ‚Üí R is real analytic if it is locally defined by a convergent power series. This means that for every a ‚àà I there exists some r > 0 and a sequence of coefficients ck ‚àà R such that and : f(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty c_k(x-a)^k = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \\\\cdots, \\\\qquad x-aIn general, the radius of convergence of a power series can be computed from the Cauchy‚ÄìHadamard formula : \\\\frac{1}{R} = \\\\limsup_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}c_k^\\\\frac{1}{k}. This result is based on comparison with a geometric series, and the same method shows that if the power series based on a converges for some b ‚àà R, it must converge uniformly on the closed interval , where rb = b ‚àí a. Here only the convergence of the power series is considered, and it might well be that extends beyond the domain I of f. The Taylor polynomials of the real analytic function f at a are simply the finite truncations : P_k(x) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k c_j(x-a)^j, \\\\qquad c_j = \\\\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{j!} of its locally defining power series, and the corresponding remainder terms are locally given by the analytic functions : R_k(x) = \\\\sum_{j=k+1}^\\\\infty c_j(x-a)^j = (x-a)^k h_k(x), \\\\qquad x-aHere the functions :\\\\begin{cases} h_k:(a-r,a+r)\\\\to \\\\mathbf R \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_k(x) = (x-a)\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty c_{k+1+j}(x-a)^j\\\\end{cases} are also analytic, since their defining power series have the same radius of convergence as the original series. Assuming that ‚äÇ I and r < R, all these series converge uniformly on . Naturally, in the case of analytic functions one can estimate the remainder term Rk(x) by the tail of the sequence of the derivatives f‚Ä≤(a) at the center of the expansion, but using complex analysis also another possibility arises, which is described below. = Taylor's theorem and convergence of Taylor series = The Taylor series of f will converge in some interval in which all its derivatives are bounded and do not grow too fast as k goes to infinity. (However, even if the Taylor series converges, it might not converge to f, as explained below; f is then said to be non-analytic.) One might think of the Taylor series : f(x) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty c_k(x-a)^k = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \\\\cdots of an infinitely many times differentiable function f : R ‚Üí R as its \\"infinite order Taylor polynomial\\" at a. Now the estimates for the remainder imply that if, for any r, the derivatives of f are known to be bounded over (a ‚àí r, a + r), then for any order k and for any r > 0 there exists a constant such that :(*) \\\\quad R_k(x)\\\\leqslant M_{k,r}\\\\frac{x-a^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} for every x ‚àà (a ‚àí r,a + r). Sometimes the constants can be chosen in such way that is bounded above, for fixed r and all k. Then the Taylor series of f converges uniformly to some analytic function :\\\\begin{cases} T_f:(a-r,a+r)\\\\to\\\\mathbf R \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_f(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k\\\\end{cases} (One also gets convergence even if is not bounded above as long as it grows slowly enough.) The limit function is by definition always analytic, but it is not necessarily equal to the original function f, even if f is inifintely differentiable. In this case, we say f is a non-analytic smooth function, for example a flat function: :\\\\begin{cases} f:\\\\mathbf R \\\\to \\\\mathbf R \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} e^{-\\\\frac{1}{x^2}} & x>0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x\\\\leqslant 0\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{cases}. Using the chain rule repeatedly by mathematical induction, one shows that for any order k, : f^{(k)}(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{p_k(x)}{x^{3k}}\\\\cdot e^{-\\\\frac{1}{x^2}} & x>0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x\\\\leqslant 0\\\\end{cases} for some polynomial pk of degree 2(k ‚àí 1). The function e^{-\\\\frac{1}{x^2}} tends to zero faster than any polynomial as , so f is infinitely many times differentiable and for every positive integer k. The above results all hold in this case: * The Taylor series of f converges uniformly to the zero function Tf(x) = 0, which is analytic with all coefficients equal to zero. * The function f is unequal to this Taylor series, and hence non-analytic. * For any order k ‚àà N and radius r > 0 there exists Mk,r > 0 satisfying the remainder bound (*) above. However, as k increases for fixed r, the value of Mk,r grows more quickly that rk, and the error does not go to zero. = Taylor's theorem in complex analysis = Taylor's theorem generalizes to functions f : C ‚Üí C which are complex differentiable in an open subset U ‚äÇ C of the complex plane. However, its usefulness is dwarfed by other general theorems in complex analysis. Namely, stronger versions of related results can be deduced for complex differentiable functions f : U ‚Üí C using Cauchy's integral formula as follows. Let r > 0 such that the closed disk B(z, r) ‚à™ S(z, r) is contained in U. Then Cauchy's integral formula with a positive parametrization of the circle S(z, r) with gives :f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\\\\,dw, \\\\quad f'(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{(w-z)^2} \\\\, dw, \\\\quad \\\\ldots, \\\\quad f^{(k)}(z) = \\\\frac{k!}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{(w-z)^{k+1}} \\\\, dw. Here all the integrands are continuous on the circle S(z, r), which justifies differentiation under the integral sign. In particular, if f is once complex differentiable on the open set U, then it is actually infinitely many times complex differentiable on U. One also obtains the Cauchy's estimates : f^{(k)}(z)\\\\leqslant \\\\frac{k!}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{M_r}{w-z^{k+1}} \\\\, dw = \\\\frac{k!M_r}{r^k}, \\\\quad M_r = \\\\max_{w-c=r}f(w)for any z ‚àà U and r > 0 such that B(z, r) ‚à™ S(c, r) ‚äÇ U. These estimates imply that the complex Taylor series : T_f(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}(z-c)^k of f converges uniformly on any open disk B(c, r) ‚äÇ U with S(c, r) ‚äÇ U into some function Tf. Furthermore, using the contour integral formulae for the derivatives f(k)(c), :\\\\begin{align} T_f(z) &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(z-c)^k}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{(w-c)^{k+1}} \\\\, dw \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{w-c} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-c}{w-c}\\\\right)^k \\\\, dw \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{w-c}\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{z-c}{w-c}} \\\\right) \\\\, dw \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{w-z} \\\\, dw = f(z), \\\\end{align} so any complex differentiable function f in an open set U ‚äÇ C is in fact complex analytic. All that is said for real analytic functions here holds also for complex analytic functions with the open interval I replaced by an open subset U ‚àà C and a-centered intervals (a ‚àí r, a + r) replaced by c-centered disks B(c, r). In particular, the Taylor expansion holds in the form : f(z) = P_k(z) + R_k(z), \\\\quad P_k(z) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k \\\\frac{f^{(j)}(c)}{j!}(z-c)^j, where the remainder term Rk is complex analytic. Methods of complex analysis provide some powerful results regarding Taylor expansions. For example, using Cauchy's integral formula for any positively oriented Jordan curve Œ≥ which parametrizes the boundary ‚àÇW ‚äÇ U of a region W ‚äÇ U, one obtains expressions for the derivatives as above, and modifying slightly the computation for , one arrives at the exact formula : R_k(z) = \\\\sum_{j=k+1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(z-c)^j}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w)}{(w-c)^{j+1}} \\\\, dw = \\\\frac{(z-c)^{k+1}}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(w) \\\\, dw}{(w-c)^{k+1}(w-z)} , \\\\qquad z\\\\in W. The important feature here is that the quality of the approximation by a Taylor polynomial on the region W ‚äÇ U is dominated by the values of the function f itself on the boundary ‚àÇW ‚äÇ U. Similarly, applying Cauchy's estimates to the series expression for the remainder, one obtains the uniform estimates : R_k(z)\\\\leqslant \\\\sum_{j=k+1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{M_r z-c^j}{r^j} = \\\\frac{M_r}{r^{k+1}} \\\\frac{z-c^{k+1}}{1-\\\\frac{z-c}{r}} \\\\leqslant \\\\frac{M_r \\\\beta^{k+1}}{1-\\\\beta}, \\\\qquad \\\\frac{z-c}{r}\\\\leqslant \\\\beta < 1\\\\. = Example = Complex plot of f(z) = 1/(1 + z2). Modulus is shown by elevation and argument by coloring: cyan=0, blue = /3, violet = 2/3, red = , yellow=4/3, green=5/3. The function :\\\\begin{cases} f : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\\\end{cases} is real analytic, that is, locally determined by its Taylor series. This function was plotted above to illustrate the fact that some elementary functions cannot be approximated by Taylor polynomials in neighborhoods of the center of expansion which are too large. This kind of behavior is easily understood in the framework of complex analysis. Namely, the function f extends into a meromorphic function :\\\\begin{cases} f:\\\\mathbf C\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\mathbf C\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1+z^2} \\\\end{cases} on the compactified complex plane. It has simple poles at z = i and z = ‚àíi, and it is analytic elsewhere. Now its Taylor series centered at z0 converges on any disc B(z0, r) with r < z ‚àí z0, where the same Taylor series converges at z ‚àà C. Therefore, Taylor series of f centered at 0 converges on B(0, 1) and it does not converge for any z ‚àà C with z> 1 due to the poles at i and ‚àíi. For the same reason the Taylor series of f centered at 1 converges on B(1, ‚àö2) and does not converge for any z ‚àà C with z ‚àí 1> ‚àö2.  Generalizations of Taylor's theorem  = Higher-order differentiability = A function f: Rn ‚Üí R is differentiable at a ‚àà Rn if and only if there exists a linear functional L : Rn ‚Üí R and a function h : Rn ‚Üí R such that :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\\\\boldsymbol{a}) + L(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a}) + h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a}, \\\\qquad \\\\lim_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\to\\\\boldsymbol{a}}h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=0. If this is the case, then L = df(a) is the (uniquely defined) differential of f at the point a. Furthermore, then the partial derivatives of f exist at a and the differential of f at a is given by : df( \\\\boldsymbol{a} )( \\\\boldsymbol{v} ) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_1}(\\\\boldsymbol{a})v_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_n}(\\\\boldsymbol{a})v_n. Introduce the multi-index notation : \\\\alpha= \\\\alpha_1+\\\\cdots+\\\\alpha_n, \\\\quad \\\\alpha!=\\\\alpha_1!\\\\cdots\\\\alpha_n!, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{x}^\\\\alpha=x_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\cdots x_n^{\\\\alpha_n} for Œ± ‚àà Nn and x ‚àà Rn. If all the k-th order partial derivatives of are continuous at , then by Clairaut's theorem, one can change the order of mixed derivatives at a, so the notation : D^\\\\alpha f = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}f}{\\\\partial x_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\cdots \\\\partial x_n^{\\\\alpha_n}}, \\\\qquad \\\\alpha\\\\leq k for the higher order partial derivatives is justified in this situation. The same is true if all the (k ‚àí 1)-th order partial derivatives of f exist in some neighborhood of a and are differentiable at a.This follows from iterated application of the theorem that if the partial derivatives of a function f exist in a neighborhood of a and are continuous at a, then the function is differentiable at a. See, for instance, . Then we say that f is k times differentiable at the point a . = Taylor's theorem for multivariate functions = h_\\\\alpha(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=0.\\\\end{align}}} If the function is k + 1 times continuously differentiable in a closed ball B = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\R^n : \\\\mathbf{a}-\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\leq r\\\\\\\\} for some r>0, then one can derive an exact formula for the remainder in terms of order partial derivatives of f in this neighborhood.

It is sufficient to show that :\\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} h_k(x) =0. The proof here is based on repeated application of L'H√¥pital's rule. Note that, for each , f^{(j)}(a)=P^{(j)}(a). Hence each of the first k‚àí1 derivatives of the numerator in h_k(x) vanishes at x=a, and the same is true of the denominator. Also, since the condition that the function f be k times differentiable at a point requires differentiability up to order k‚àí1 in a neighborhood of said point (this is true, because differentiability requires a function to be defined in a whole neighborhood of a point), the numerator and its k ‚àí 2 derivatives are differentiable in a neighborhood of a. Clearly, the denominator also satisfies said condition, and additionally, doesn't vanish unless x=a, therefore all conditions necessary for L'Hopital's rule are fulfilled, and its use is justified. So :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} \\\\frac{f(x) - P(x)}{(x-a)^k} &= \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} \\\\frac{\\\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) - P(x))}{\\\\frac{d}{dx}(x-a)^k} = \\\\cdots = \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} \\\\frac{\\\\frac{d^{k-1}}{dx^{k-1}}(f(x) - P(x))}{\\\\frac{d^{k-1}}{dx^{k-1}}(x-a)^k}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} \\\\frac{f^{(k-1)}(x) - P^{(k-1)}(x)}{x-a}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{k!}(f^{(k)}(a) - f^{(k)}(a)) = 0 \\\\end{align} where the second to last equality follows by the definition of the derivative at x = a. = Derivation for the mean value forms of the remainder = Let G be any real-valued function, continuous on the closed interval between a and x and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, and define : F(t) = f(t) + f'(t)(x-t) + \\\\frac{f(t)}{2!}(x-t)^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(t)}{k!}(x-t)^k. For t \\\\in [a,x] . Then, by Cauchy's mean value theorem, : (*) \\\\quad \\\\frac{F'(\\\\xi)}{G'(\\\\xi)} = \\\\frac{F(x) - F(a)}{G(x) - G(a)} for some Œæ on the open interval between a and x. Note that here the numerator is exactly the remainder of the Taylor polynomial for f(x). Compute :\\\\begin{align} F'(t) = {} & f'(t) + \\\\big(f(t)(x-t) - f'(t)\\\\big) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{f^{(3)}(t)}{2!}(x-t)^2 - \\\\frac{f^{(2)}(t)}{1!}(x-t)\\\\right) + \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\cdots + \\\\left( \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)}(t)}{k!}(x-t)^k - \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(t)}{(k-1)!}(x-t)^{k-1}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)}(t)}{k!}(x-t)^k, \\\\end{align} plug it into (*) and rearrange terms to find that : R_k(x) = \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)}(\\\\xi)}{k!}(x-\\\\xi)^k \\\\frac{G(x)-G(a)}{G'(\\\\xi)}. This is the form of the remainder term mentioned after the actual statement of Taylor's theorem with remainder in the mean value form. The Lagrange form of the remainder is found by choosing \\\\ G(t)=(x-t)^{k+1} and the Cauchy form by choosing \\\\ G(t) = t-a. Remark. Using this method one can also recover the integral form of the remainder by choosing : G(t) = \\\\int_a^t \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)}(s)}{k!} (x-s)^k \\\\, ds, but the requirements for f needed for the use of mean value theorem are too strong, if one aims to prove the claim in the case that f(k) is only absolutely continuous. However, if one uses Riemann integral instead of Lebesgue integral, the assumptions cannot be weakened. = Derivation for the integral form of the remainder = Due to absolute continuity of f(k) on the closed interval between a and x its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, and we can use fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that f(k) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval between a and x, and this leads to the same result than using the mean value theorem. The fundamental theorem of calculus states that :f(x)=f(a)+ \\\\int_a^x \\\\, f'(t) \\\\, dt. Now we can integrate by parts and use the fundamental theorem of calculus again to see that : \\\\begin{align} f(x) &= f(a)+\\\\Big(xf'(x)-af'(a)\\\\Big)-\\\\int_a^x tf(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f(a) + x\\\\left(f'(a) + \\\\int_a^x f(t) \\\\,dt \\\\right) -af'(a)-\\\\int_a^x tf(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f(a)+(x-a)f'(a)+\\\\int_a^x \\\\, (x-t)f(t) \\\\, dt, \\\\end{align} which is exactly Taylor's theorem with remainder in the integral form in the case k=1. The general statement is proved using induction. Suppose that : (*) \\\\quad f(x) = f(a) + \\\\frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x - a) + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + \\\\int_a^x \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)} (t)}{k!} (x - t)^k \\\\, dt. Integrating the remainder term by parts we arrive at :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^x \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)} (t)}{k!} (x - t)^k \\\\, dt = &  \\\\left[ \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)} (t)}{(k+1)k!} (x - t)^{k+1} \\\\right]_a^x + \\\\int_a^x \\\\frac{f^{(k+2)} (t)}{(k+1)k!} (x - t)^{k+1} \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ = & \\\\ \\\\frac{f^{(k+1)} (a)}{(k+1)!} (x - a)^{k+1} + \\\\int_a^x \\\\frac{f^{(k+2)} (t)}{(k+1)!} (x - t)^{k+1} \\\\, dt. \\\\end{align} Substituting this into the formula shows that if it holds for the value k, it must also hold for the value k + 1\\\\. Therefore, since it holds for k = 1, it must hold for every positive integer k. = Derivation for the remainder of multivariate Taylor polynomials = We prove the special case, where f : Rn ‚Üí R has continuous partial derivatives up to the order k+1 in some closed ball B with center a. The strategy of the proof is to apply the one-variable case of Taylor's theorem to the restriction of f to the line segment adjoining x and a. Parametrize the line segment between a and x by u(t) = We apply the one- variable version of Taylor's theorem to the function : :f(\\\\mathbf{x})=g(1)=g(0)+\\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\frac{1}{j!}g^{(j)}(0)\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{(1-t)^k }{k!} g^{(k+1)}(t)\\\\, dt. Applying the chain rule for several variables gives :\\\\begin{align} g^{(j)}(t)&=\\\\frac{d^j}{dt^j}f(u(t)) = \\\\frac{d^j}{dt^j} f(\\\\mathbf{a}+t(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=j} \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) (D^\\\\alpha f) (\\\\mathbf{a}+t(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{a})) (\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{a})^\\\\alpha \\\\end{align} where \\\\tbinom j \\\\alpha is the multinomial coefficient. Since \\\\tfrac{1}{j!}\\\\tbinom j \\\\alpha=\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\alpha!}, we get: :f(\\\\mathbf x)= f(\\\\mathbf a) + \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq \\\\alpha\\\\leq k}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha!} (D^\\\\alpha f) (\\\\mathbf a)(\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf a)^\\\\alpha+\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=k+1}\\\\frac{k+1}{\\\\alpha!} (\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf a)^\\\\alpha \\\\int_0^1 (1-t)^k (D^\\\\alpha f)(\\\\mathbf a+t(\\\\mathbf x-\\\\mathbf a))\\\\,dt.

The program was intended to provide a more user-friendly interface for the Windows 3.1x, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, supplanting the Windows Program Manager. Microsoft Bob presented screens showing a \\"house\\", with \\"rooms\\" that the user could go to containing familiar objects corresponding to computer applications‚Äîfor instance, a desk with pen and paper, a checkbook, and other items. In this case, clicking on the pen and paper would open the word processor. A cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using speech balloons. Rover and a few others later returned in Windows XP as \\"Search Companions\\". Upon release, Microsoft Bob was criticized in the media and did not gain wide acceptance with users, which resulted in its discontinuation. History Microsoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released), although it had been widely publicized prior to that date under the codename \\"Utopia\\". The project leader for Bob was Karen Fries, a Microsoft researcher. The design was based on research by Professors Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves of Stanford University. Melinda Gates, wife of Bill Gates, was marketing manager for the product. Microsoft originally purchased the domain name bob.com from Boston-area techie Bob Antia, but later traded it to Bob Kerstein for the windows2000.com domain name. Applications A screenshot of the \\"family room\\" area of the Microsoft Bob software, including the \\"Assistant\\" character Rover.Bob included various office suite programs such as a finance application and a word processor. The user interface was designed to simplify the navigational experience for novice computer users. Similar to early graphical shells like Jane, the main interface is portrayed as the inside of a house, with different rooms corresponding to common real-world room styles such as a kitchen or family room. Each room contains decorations and furniture, as well as icons that represent applications. Bob offers the user the option of fully customizing the entire house. The user has full control over decorating each room, and can add, remove, or reposition all objects. The user can also add or remove rooms from the house and change the destinations of each door. There is also a feature in which Bob offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as contemporary and postmodern. The applications built into Bob are represented by matching decorations ‚Äì for example, clicking on a clock opens the calendar, while a pen and paper represent the word processor. The user can also add shortcuts to applications on their computer. These shortcuts display the icon inside various styles of decorations such as boxes and picture frames. Released right as the Internet was beginning to become popular, Bob offered an email client with which a user could subscribe to MCI Mail, a dial-up email account. The price was $5.00 per month to send up to 15 emails per month. Each email was limited to 5000 characters, and each additional email after the limit was reached was an additional 45 cents. A toll-free phone number had to be called to set up the account. Bob features \\"Assistants\\", cartoon characters intended to help the user navigate the virtual house or perform tasks in the main interface or within the built-in applications. Gateway 2000 Edition An edition of Microsoft Bob was bundled with the Gateway 2000 computer around 1995. The Gateway Edition contained Gateway branding on the Login screen along with additional rooms and backgrounds not seen in the retail version. One additional room was the attic, which contained the box to a Gateway 2000 computer. Along with the additional rooms, there were more icons that appeared by default in the new rooms. Reception and legacy Microsoft Bob was one of Microsoft's more visible product failures. Despite being discontinued before Windows 95 was released, Microsoft Bob continued to be severely criticized in reviews and popular media. In 2017, Melinda Gates acknowledged that the software \\"needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then\\". Bob received the 7th place in PC World magazine's list of the 25 worst tech products of all time, number one worst product of the decade by CNET.com, and a spot in a list of the 50 worst inventions published by Time magazine, who called Bob \\"overly cutesy\\" and an \\"operating system designed around Clippy\\". Microsoft's Steve Ballmer mentioned Bob as an example of a situation in which \\"we decided that we have not succeeded and let's stop [now]\\". Microsoft employee Raymond Chen wrote in an article that an encrypted copy of Bob was included on Windows XP install CDs to take up space and slow down the downloading of illegal copies. Tech journalist Harry McCracken called the story \\"a delightfully urban legend-y tale\\" and noted its similarities to an April Fools' Day joke claiming Bob was hidden in Windows Vista. Rover, the software's dog mascot, reappeared in Windows XP's File Search function. The typeface Comic Sans was created for (but not used in) Microsoft Bob.

Intuitively, a Lipschitz continuous function is limited in how fast it can change: there exists a real number such that, for every pair of points on the graph of this function, the absolute value of the slope of the line connecting them is not greater than this real number; the smallest such bound is called the Lipschitz constant of the function (or modulus of uniform continuity). For instance, every function that has bounded first derivatives is Lipschitz continuous. In the theory of differential equations, Lipschitz continuity is the central condition of the Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution to an initial value problem. A special type of Lipschitz continuity, called contraction, is used in the Banach fixed-point theorem. We have the following chain of strict inclusions for functions over a closed and bounded non-trivial interval of the real line : Continuously differentiable ‚äÇ Lipschitz continuous ‚äÇ Œ±-H√∂lder continuous ‚äÇ uniformly continuous ‚äÇ continuous where 0 < Œ± ‚â§ 1. We also have : Lipschitz continuous ‚äÇ absolutely continuous ‚äÇ bounded variation ‚äÇ differentiable almost everywhere  Definitions  Given two metric spaces (X, dX) and (Y, dY), where dX denotes the metric on the set X and dY is the metric on set Y, a function f : X ‚Üí Y is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a real constant K ‚â• 0 such that, for all x1 and x2 in X, : d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \\\\le K d_X(x_1, x_2). Any such K is referred to as a Lipschitz constant for the function f. The smallest constant is sometimes called the (best) Lipschitz constant; however, in most cases, the latter notion is less relevant. If K = 1 the function is called a short map, and if 0 ‚â§ K < 1 and f maps a metric space to itself, the function is called a contraction. In particular, a real-valued function f : R ‚Üí R is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a positive real constant K such that, for all real x1 and x2, : f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\\\le K x_1 - x_2. In this case, Y is the set of real numbers R with the standard metric dY(y1, y2) = y1 ‚àí y2, and X is a subset of R. In general, the inequality is (trivially) satisfied if x1 = x2. Otherwise, one can equivalently define a function to be Lipschitz continuous if and only if there exists a constant K ‚â• 0 such that, for all x1 ‚â† x2, :\\\\frac{d_Y(f(x_1),f(x_2))}{d_X(x_1,x_2)}\\\\le K. For real-valued functions of several real variables, this holds if and only if the absolute value of the slopes of all secant lines are bounded by K. The set of lines of slope K passing through a point on the graph of the function forms a circular cone, and a function is Lipschitz if and only if the graph of the function everywhere lies completely outside of this cone (see figure). A function is called locally Lipschitz continuous if for every x in X there exists a neighborhood U of x such that f restricted to U is Lipschitz continuous. Equivalently, if X is a locally compact metric space, then f is locally Lipschitz if and only if it is Lipschitz continuous on every compact subset of X. In spaces that are not locally compact, this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. More generally, a function f defined on X is said to be H√∂lder continuous or to satisfy a H√∂lder condition of order Œ± > 0 on X if there exists a constant M ‚â• 0 such that :d_Y(f(x), f(y)) \\\\leq M d_X(x, y)^{\\\\alpha} for all x and y in X. Sometimes a H√∂lder condition of order Œ± is also called a uniform Lipschitz condition of order Œ± > 0. If there exists a K ‚â• 1 with :\\\\frac{1}{K}d_X(x_1,x_2) \\\\le d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \\\\le K d_X(x_1, x_2) then f is called bilipschitz (also written bi-Lipschitz). A bilipschitz mapping is injective, and is in fact a homeomorphism onto its image. A bilipschitz function is the same thing as an injective Lipschitz function whose inverse function is also Lipschitz. Examples ;Lipschitz continuous functions: ;Lipschitz continuous functions that are not everywhere differentiable: ;Lipschitz continuous functions that are everywhere differentiable but not continuously differentiable: ;Continuous functions that are not (globally) Lipschitz continuous: ;Differentiable functions that are not (locally) Lipschitz continuous: ;Analytic functions that are not (globally) Lipschitz continuous: Properties *An everywhere differentiable function g : R ‚Üí R is Lipschitz continuous (with K = sup g‚Ä≤(x)) if and only if it has bounded first derivative; one direction follows from the mean value theorem. In particular, any continuously differentiable function is locally Lipschitz, as continuous functions are locally bounded so its gradient is locally bounded as well. *A Lipschitz function g : R ‚Üí R is absolutely continuous and therefore is differentiable almost everywhere, that is, differentiable at every point outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. Its derivative is essentially bounded in magnitude by the Lipschitz constant, and for a < b, the difference g(b) ‚àí g(a) is equal to the integral of the derivative g‚Ä≤ on the interval [a, b]. Conversely, if f : I ‚Üí R is absolutely continuous and thus differentiable almost everywhere, and satisfies f‚Ä≤(x)‚â§ K for almost all x in I, then f is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant at most K. More generally, Rademacher's theorem extends the differentiability result to Lipschitz mappings between Euclidean spaces: a Lipschitz map f : U ‚Üí Rm, where U is an open set in Rn, is almost everywhere differentiable. Moreover, if K is the best Lipschitz constant of f, then \\\\Df(x)\\\\\\\\le K whenever the total derivative Df exists. *For a differentiable Lipschitz map f : U ‚Üí Rm the inequality \\\\Df\\\\_{\\\\infty,U}\\\\le K holds for the best Lipschitz constant of f, and it turns out to be an equality if the domain U is convex. *Suppose that {fn} is a sequence of Lipschitz continuous mappings between two metric spaces, and that all fn have Lipschitz constant bounded by some K. If fn converges to a mapping f uniformly, then f is also Lipschitz, with Lipschitz constant bounded by the same K. In particular, this implies that the set of real-valued functions on a compact metric space with a particular bound for the Lipschitz constant is a closed and convex subset of the Banach space of continuous functions. This result does not hold for sequences in which the functions may have unbounded Lipschitz constants, however. In fact, the space of all Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space is a subalgebra of the Banach space of continuous functions, and thus dense in it, an elementary consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (or as a consequence of Weierstrass approximation theorem, because every polynomial is locally Lipschitz continuous). *Every Lipschitz continuous map is uniformly continuous, and hence a fortiori continuous. More generally, a set of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant forms an equicontinuous set. The Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem implies that if {fn} is a uniformly bounded sequence of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant, then it has a convergent subsequence. By the result of the previous paragraph, the limit function is also Lipschitz, with the same bound for the Lipschitz constant. In particular the set of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space X having Lipschitz constant ‚â§ K is a locally compact convex subset of the Banach space C(X). *For a family of Lipschitz continuous functions fŒ± with common constant, the function \\\\sup_\\\\alpha f_\\\\alpha (and \\\\inf_\\\\alpha f_\\\\alpha) is Lipschitz continuous as well, with the same Lipschitz constant, provided it assumes a finite value at least at a point. *If U is a subset of the metric space M and f : U ‚Üí R is a Lipschitz continuous function, there always exist Lipschitz continuous maps M ‚Üí R which extend f and have the same Lipschitz constant as f (see also Kirszbraun theorem). An extension is provided by ::\\\\tilde f(x):=\\\\inf_{u\\\\in U}\\\\\\\\{ f(u)+k\\\\, d(x,u)\\\\\\\\}, :where k is a Lipschitz constant for f on U. Lipschitz manifolds Let U and V be two open sets in Rn. A function T : U ‚Üí V is called bi-Lipschitz if it is a Lipschitz homeomorphism onto its image, and its inverse is also Lipschitz. Using bi- Lipschitz mappings, it is possible to define a Lipschitz structure on a topological manifold, since there is a pseudogroup structure on bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This structure is intermediate between that of a piecewise- linear manifold and a smooth manifold. In fact a PL structure gives rise to a unique Lipschitz structure;SpringerLink: Topology of manifolds it can in that sense 'nearly' be smoothed. One-sided Lipschitz Let F(x) be an upper semi- continuous function of x, and that F(x) is a closed, convex set for all x. Then F is one-sided Lipschitz if :(x_1-x_2)^T(F(x_1)-F(x_2))\\\\leq C\\\\Vert x_1-x_2\\\\Vert^2 for some C and for all x1 and x2. It is possible that the function F could have a very large Lipschitz constant but a moderately sized, or even negative, one-sided Lipschitz constant. For example, the function :\\\\begin{cases} F:\\\\mathbf{R}^2\\\\to\\\\mathbf{R},\\\\\\\\\\\\ F(x,y)=-50(y-\\\\cos(x)) \\\\end{cases} has Lipschitz constant K = 50 and a one-sided Lipschitz constant C = 0. An example which is one-sided Lipschitz but not Lipschitz continuous is F(x) = e‚àíx, with C = 0.

A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium‚Äîthe conveyor belt‚Äîthat rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.  Overview  Point of contact between a power transmission belt and its pulley. A conveyor belt uses a wide belt and pulleys and is supported by rollers or a flat pan along its path. Conveyors are durable and reliable components used in automated distribution and warehousing, as well as manufacturing and production facilities. In combination with computer-controlled pallet handling equipment this allows for more efficient retail, wholesale, and manufacturing distribution. It is considered a labor-saving system that allows large volumes to move rapidly through a process, allowing companies to ship or receive higher volumes with smaller storage space and with less labor expense. Belt conveyors are the most commonly used powered conveyors because they are the most versatile and the least expensive. Products are conveyed directly on the belt so both regular and irregular shaped objects, large or small, light and heavy, can be transported successfully. Belt conveyors are also manufactured with curved sections that use tapered rollers and curved belting to convey products around a corner. These conveyor systems are commonly used in postal sorting offices and airport baggage handling systems. Belt conveyors are generally fairly similar in construction consisting of a metal frame with rollers at either end of a flat metal bed. Rubber conveyor belts are commonly used to convey items with irregular bottom surfaces, small items that would fall in between rollers (e.g. a sushi conveyor bar), or bags of product that would sag between rollers. The belt is looped around each of the rollers and when one of the rollers is powered (by an electrical motor) the belting slides across the solid metal frame bed, moving the product. In heavy use applications, the beds in which the belting is pulled over are replaced with rollers. The rollers allow weight to be conveyed as they reduce the amount of friction generated from the heavier loading on the belting. The exception to the standard belt conveyor construction is the Sandwich Belt conveyor. The Sandwich Belt conveyor uses two conveyor belts, instead of one. These two conventional conveyor belts are positioned face to face, to firmly contain the items being carried in a \\"sandwich-like\\" hold. Belt conveyors can be used to transport products in a straight line or through changes in elevation or direction. For conveying Bulk Materials like Grains, Ore, Coal, Sand etc., over gentle slopes or gentle curvatures, a troughed belt conveyor is used. The trough of the belt ensures that the flowable material is contained within the edges of the belt. The trough is achieved by keeping the idler rollers in an angle to the horizontal at the sides of the idler frame. A Pipe Conveyor is used for material travel paths that require sharper bends and inclines up to 35 degrees.https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102013106479A1/en A pipe conveyor features the edges of the belt being rolled together to form a circular section like a pipe. Like a Troughed Belt Conveyor, a Pipe Conveyor also uses idler rollers. However, in this case, the idler frame completely surrounds the conveyor belt helping it to retain the pipe section while pushing it forward. In the case of travel paths requiring high angles and snake-like curvatures, a Sandwich Belt is used. The sandwich belt design enables materials carried to travel along a path of high inclines up to 90-degree angles,https://patents.google.com/patent/US4609097A/en enabling a vertical path as opposed to a horizontal one. This transport option is also powered by idlers. Other important components of the Belt Conveying System apart from the Pulleys and Idler rollers include the Drive Arrangement of reducer Gear Boxes, Drive motors, and associated couplings. Scrapers to clean the belt, Chutes for controlling the discharge direction, Skirts for containing the discharge on the receiving belt, Take Up assembly for \\"tensioning\\" the belt and Technological Structures like Stringer, Short Post, Drive Frames, Pulley Frames make up the balance items to complete the Belt Conveying system. In certain applications, Belt conveyors can also be used for static accumulation or cartons.

In 1892, Thomas Robins began a series of inventions which led to the development of a conveyor belt used for carrying coal, ores and other products. In 1901, Sandvik invented and started the production of steel conveyor belts. In 1905, Richard Sutcliffe invented the first conveyor belts for use in coal mines which revolutionized the mining industry. In 1913, Henry Ford introduced conveyor-belt assembly lines at Ford Motor Company's Highland Park, Michigan factory. In 1972, the French society REI created in New Caledonia the longest straight-belt conveyor in the world, at a length of . Hyacynthe Marcel Bocchetti was the concept designer. In 1957, the B. F. Goodrich Company patented a M√∂bius strip conveyor belt, that it went on to produce as the \\"Turnover Conveyor Belt System\\". Incorporating a half-twist, it had the advantage over conventional belts of a longer life because it could expose all of its surface area to wear and tear. Such M√∂bius strip belts are no longer manufactured because untwisted modern belts can be made more durable by constructing them from several layers of different materials. In 1970, Intralox, a Louisiana-based company, registered the first patent for all plastic, modular belting.  Structure  The belt consists of one or more layers of material. It is common for belts to have three layers: a top cover, a carcass and a bottom cover. The purpose of the carcass is to provide linear strength and shape. The carcass is often a woven or metal fabric having a warp & weft. The warp refers to longitudinal cords whose characteristics of resistance and elasticity define the running properties of the belt. The weft represents the whole set of transversal cables allowing to the belt specific resistance against cuts, tears and impacts and at the same time high flexibility. The most common carcass materials are steel, polyester, nylon, cotton and aramid (class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers, with Twaron or Kevlar as brand names). The covers are usually various rubber or plastic compounds specified by use of the belt. Steel conveyor belts are used when high strength class is required. For example, the highest strength class conveyor belt installed is made of steel cords. This conveyor belt has a strength class of and it operates at Chuquicamata mine, in Chile. Polyester, nylon and cotton are popular with low strength classes. Aramid is used in the range . The advantages of using aramid are energy savings, enhanced lifetimes and improved productivity.Lodewijks G. (2011), \\"The Next Generation Low Loss Conveyor Belts\\", Proceedings of the Beltcon 16 conference, Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa, August 3‚Äì4, 2011.

Applications  Today there are different types of conveyor belts that have been created for conveying different kinds of material available in PVC and rubber materials. Material flowing over the belt may be weighed in transit using a beltweigher. Belts with regularly spaced partitions, known as elevator belts, are used for transporting loose materials up steep inclines. Belt Conveyors are used in self-unloading bulk freighters and in live bottom trucks. Belt conveyor technology is also used in conveyor transport such as moving sidewalks or escalators, as well as on many manufacturing assembly lines. Stores often have conveyor belts at the check-out counter to move shopping items, and may use checkout dividers in this processs. Ski areas also use conveyor belts to transport skiers up the hill. Industrial and manufacturing applications for belt conveyors include package handling, trough belt conveyors, trash handling, bag handling, coding conveyors, and more. Integration of Human- Machine Interface(HMI) to operate the conveyor system is in the developing stages and will prove to be an efficient innovation. Some of the major global conveyor belt manufacturers and service providers are Berndorf AG, Continental AG, Fenner plc, Kale Conveyor, Terra Nova Technologies, ThyssenKrupp, HESE Maschinenfabrik GmbH and Tenova Takraf. = Long belt conveyors = Taranto, Paolo Monti, 1964 The longest belt conveyor system in the world is in Western Sahara. It was built in 1972 by Friedrich Krupp GmbH (now thyssenkrupp) and is long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of El-Aaiun. The longest conveyor system in an airport is the Dubai International Airport baggage handling system at . It was installed by Siemens and commissioned in 2008, and has a combination of traditional belt conveyors and tray conveyors. Boddington Bauxite Mine in Western Australia is officially recognized as having the world's longest single flight conveyor. Single flight means the load is not transferred, it is a single continuous systems for the entire length. This conveyor is a cable belt conveyor system with a conveyor feeding a conveyor. Cable belt conveyors are a variation on the more convention idler belt system. Instead of running on top of idlers, cable belt conveyors are supported by two endless steel cables (steel wire rope) which are in turn supported by idler pulley wheels. This system feeds bauxite through the difficult terrain of the Darling Ranges to the Worsley Alumina refinery. The second longest single trough belt conveyor is the Impumelelo conveyor near Secunda, South Africa. It was design by Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. in based in Bellingham, Washington, USA and constructed by ELB Engineering based in Johannesburg South Africa. The conveyor transports of coal from a mine to a refinery that converts the coal to diesel fuel. The third longest trough belt conveyor in the world is the Curragh conveyor near Westfarmers, QLD, Australia. Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. supplied the basic engineering, control system and commissioning. Detail engineering and Construction was completed by Laing O'Rourke. The longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh.Alspaugh, Mark, Bulk Material Handling By Conveyor Belt 7, p 83 It is about long and conveys limestone and shale at , from the quarry in India to the cement factory ( long in India and long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen & Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8 MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive at the tail end in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in lengths on the Indian side and lengths on the Bangladesh side. The idlers, or rollers, of the system are unique in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods. = Belt conveyor safety system = Conveyors used in industrial settings include tripping mechanisms such as trip cords along the length of the conveyor. This allows for workers to immediately shut down the conveyor when a problem arises. Warning alarms are included to notify employees that a conveyor is about to turn on. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued regulations for conveyor safety, as OSHA 1926.555. Some other systems used to safeguard the conveyor are belt sway switches, speed switches, belt rip switch, and emergency stops. The belt sway switch will stop the conveyor if the belt starts losing its alignment along the structure. The speed switch will stop the belt if the switch is not registering that the belt is running at the required speed. The belt rip switch will stop the belt when there is a cut, or a flap indicating that the belt is in danger of further damage. An emergency stop may be located on the conveyor control box in case of trip chord malfunctions.

The duration of a dark moon varies between 1.5 and 3.5 days, depending on its ecliptic latitude. In current astronomical usage, the new moon occurs in the middle of this dark period, when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction. This definition has entered popular usage, so that calendars will typically indicate the date of the \\"new moon\\" rather than the \\"dark moon\\". However, some argue that this term should describe the Moon during the period when it is not reflecting direct sunlight toward Earth. The period when no direct sunlight is reflected by the Moon toward Earth lasts from 21 to 26 hours. The term new moon originally referred to the crescent phase on the first night it is visible, one or two days after conjunction. Maritime records from the 19th century distinguish the dark moon (the time when only earthlight illuminates the near side of the Moon) from the new moon and waning moon. Dark moon as the 30th division The Oxford English Dictionary defines the new moon as \\"the first visible crescent of the Moon, after conjunction with the Sun\\". Dark moon is a term used for a waning crescent moon. When the Moon's orbit is divided into 30 segments, as the ancient Greeks did in the time of Homer, the Babylonians did, and the Indians still do today (calling them tithi), the last phase is called the \\"dark moon\\". In Greek, it was called the \\"old moon\\" and associated with Hecate. In India, it is called Amavasya and associated with Kali.Cole, Freedom. AmƒÅvƒÅsya and Pratipad. Jyotish Digest, Vol XI, Issue II, April-Sep 2014 Both of these goddesses have a dark connotation, hence the term dark moon. In Babylonian, Greek, and Indian culture, the dark moon occurs within the 12¬∞ of angular distance between the Moon and the Sun before conjunction (a type of syzygy). The new moon occurs within the 12¬∞ after syzygy. This 12¬∞ arc is called uma by the Babylonians and tithi by the Indians. The Moon takes a mean duration of 23 hours and 37 minutes to cover this length, but this period can vary from 21 to 26 hours because of the Moon's orbital anomaly. This means that the \\"dark moon\\" actually lasts approximately 23 hours and 37 minutes and includes any time marked as \\"new moon\\" on a lunar calendar, and not 1.5 to 3.5 days as stated earlier.

Oxford University Press, August 2017. Web. 24 August 2017. without an internal structural framework or a keel. Unlike semi-rigid and rigid airships (e.g. Zeppelins), blimps rely on the pressure of the lifting gas (usually helium, rather than hydrogen) inside the envelope and the strength of the envelope itself to maintain their shape. Principle Steerable ducted fans on a Skyship 600 provide thrust, limited direction control, and also serve to inflate the ballonets to maintain the necessary overpressure Since blimps keep their shape with internal overpressure, typically the only solid parts are the passenger car (gondola) and the tail fins. A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas (such as helium) as a lifting medium is called a hot-air airship (sometimes there are battens near the bow, which assist with higher forces there from a mooring attachment or from the greater aerodynamic pressures there). Volume changes of the lifting gas due to temperature changes or to changes of altitude are compensated for by pumping air into internal ballonets (air bags) to maintain the overpressure. Without sufficient overpressure, the blimp loses its ability to be steered and is slowed due to increased drag and distortion. The propeller air stream can be used to inflate the ballonets and so the hull. In some models, such as the Skyship 600, differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of pitch trim control. The engines driving the propellers are usually directly attached to the gondola, and in some models are partly steerable. Blimps are the most commonly built airships because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated. However, because of their unstable hull, their size is limited. A blimp with too long a hull may kink in the middle when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast (this has also happened with semi-rigid airships with weak keels). This led to the development of semi-rigids and rigid airships. Modern blimps are launched somewhat heavier than air (overweight), in contrast to historic blimps. The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power, or by angling the engine thrust. Some types also use steerable propellers or ducted fans. Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump ballast at lift-off and also avoids the need to lose costly helium lifting gas on landing (most of the Zeppelins achieved lift with very inexpensive hydrogen, which could be vented without concern to decrease altitude). Etymology A modern blimp from Airship Management Services showing a strengthened nose, ducted fans attached to the gondola under the hull, and cable-braced fins at the tail The origin of the word \\"blimp\\" has been the subject of some confusion. Ege notes two possible derivations:Ege, L, Balloons and Airships, Blandford, 1973 The onomatopoeic derivation, as the sound the airship makes when one taps the envelope (balloon) with a finger, has been recorded in the British Aeronautical Journal. A 1943 etymology published in the New York Times supports the British origin during the First World War when the British were experimenting with lighter-than-air craft. The initial non-rigid aircraft was called the A-limp; and a second version called the B-limp was deemed more satisfactory.\\"Origin of 'Blimp' Explained,\\" New York Times. January 3, 1943 Yet a third derivation is given by Barnes & James in Shorts Aircraft since 1900: Dr. A.D.

The B-class blimps were patrol airships operated by the United States Navy during and shortly after World War I. The Navy learned a great deal from the DN-1 fiasco. The result was the very successful B-type airships. Dr. Jerome Hunsaker was asked to develop a theory of airship design. This was followed by then-Lieutenant John H. Towers, USN, returning from Europe having inspected British designs, and the U.S. Navy subsequently sought bids for 16 blimps from American manufacturers. On 4 February 1917 the Secretary of the Navy directed that 16 nonrigid airships of Class B be procured. Ultimately Goodyear built 9 envelopes, Goodrich built 5 and Curtiss built the gondolas for all of those 14 ships. Connecticut Aircraft contracted with U.S. Rubber for its two envelopes and with Pigeon Fraser for its gondolas. The Curtiss- built gondolas were modified JN-4 fuselages and were powered by OX-5 engines. The Connecticut Aircraft blimps were powered by Hall-Scott engines. In 1930, a former German airship officer, Captain Anton Heinen, working in the US for the US Navy on its dirigible fleet, attempted to design and build a four-place blimp called the \\"family air yacht\\" for private fliers which the inventor claimed would be priced below $10,000 and easier to fly than a fixed-wing aircraft if placed in production. It was unsuccessful.\\"Aeronautics: Air Yacht\\", Time Magazine, November 3rd 1930\\"Dirigible Air Yacht Has Automobile Cabin\\", Popular Mechanics, December 1930 In 2014, there were approximately 13 active advertising airships in the world.

The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a pedestal desk in a gentleman's study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era. During the Industrial Revolution, draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. They became more utilitarian and were built of steel and plastic instead of fine woods and brass. More recently, engineers and draftsmen use the drawing board for making and modifying drawings on paper with ink or pencil. Different drawing instruments (set square, protractor, etc.) are used on it to draw parallel, perpendicular or oblique lines. There are instruments for drawing circles, arcs, other curves and symbols too (compass, French curve, stencil, etc.). However, with the gradual introduction of computer aided drafting and design (CADD or CAD) in the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, the drawing board is becoming less common. A drawing table is also sometimes called a mechanical desk because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks of the second part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface. Very often a drawing table could look like a writing table or even a pedestal desk when the working surface was set at the horizontal and the height adjusted to 29 inches, in order to use it as a \\"normal\\" desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a standing desk. Many reproductions have been made and are still being produced of drawing tables, copying the period styles they were originally made in during the 18th and 19th centuries. Modern-day idiom The expression \\"back to the drawing board\\" is used when a plan or course of action needs to be changed, often drastically; usually due to a very unsuccessful result; e.g., \\"The battle plan, the result of months of conferences, failed because the enemy retreated too far back. It was back to the drawing board for the army captains.\\" The phrase was coined in the caption to a Peter Arno cartoon of The New Yorker of March 1, 1941 (cartoon) Contemporary drafting tables A drawing board with drafting machine, eliminating the need for a T-square A modern drafting table with a parallel motion rule Despite the prevalence of computer aided drafting, many older architects and even some structural designers still rely on paper and pencil graphics produced on a drafting table. Modern drafting tables typically rely on a steel frame. Steel provides as much strength as the old oak drafting table frames and much easier portability. Typically the drafting board surface is a thick sheet of compressed fibreboard with sheets of Formica laminated to all its surfaces. The drafting board surface is usually secured to the frame by screws which can easily be removed for drafting table transportation. The steel frame allows mechanical linkages to be installed that control both the height and angle of the drafting board surface. Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which clamps the board in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained to ensure that this safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface. The drafting table surface is usually covered with a thin vinyl sheet called a board cover. This provides an optimum surface for pen and pencil drafting. It allows compasses and dividers to be used without damaging the wooden surface of the board. A board cover must be frequently cleaned to prevent graphite buildup from making new drawings dirty. At the bottom edge of the table, a single strip of aluminum or steel may serve as a place to rest drafting pencils. More purpose-built trays are also used which hold pencils even while the board is being adjusted. Various types of drafting machine may be attached to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. Drafting machines use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement. Some drafting tables incorporate electric motors to provide the up and down and angle adjustment of the drafting table surface. These tables are at least as heavy as the original oak and brass drafting tables and so sacrifice portability for the convenience of push button table adjustment.

It is difficult to judge the issue of quality but, based on the number of times a title published by Baen Books appeared in the bestseller lists produced by the major bookselling chains, it is ranked the seventh most popular science fiction publisher. In 2005, Baen moved up to the eighth position in the total books published with 72 books published (of which 40 were original titles).Locus, February 2006, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 50‚Äì53. Electronic publishing Initially, the company invested resources in \\"Baen's Bar\\", its online community service that provides a forum for customers, authors and editors to interact, beginning as a BBS. In the early 2000s, a blogger wrote: \\"Like every other publisher, Jim Baen set up a website. But several of his authors and fan friends convinced him to put a chat client on his site. Since he was interested, and since several of those authors (like Jerry Pournelle, former columnist for Byte Magazine, for instance) were very Internet savvy, he did. The chat client grew into an incredibly vibrant community called Baen's Bar.\\" Beginning in mid-1999, Baen emphasized electronic publishing and Internet-focused promotions for its publications. The discussions on Baen's bar convinced him to do so. Baen's electronic strategy is explained exhaustively in a series of \\"letters\\" or \\"essays\\" called The Prime Palaver by Baen Free Library \\"First Librarian\\" Eric Flint, but in a nutshell, emphasizes distribution of unencrypted digital versions of its works free of Digital Rights Management copy protection schemes through Baen Ebooks (formerly Webscriptions, which was not formally part of Baen Books, but in effect an independent e-publisher). Baen and his successors believe that DRM does more harm than good to a publisher. Consequently, Baen also makes its entire catalog available in multiple formats for downloading and typically prices electronic versions of its books at or below that of paperback editions‚Äîand makes a profit doing it. According to essays on Baen's science fiction e-magazine Jim Baen's Universe, also edited by Flint, the strategy is if anything, getting stronger and more fruitful with the passage of time, especially with the advent of e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle, and the Barnes & Noble Nook. =Baen's Webscriptions= In addition to selling individual titles in electronic format, Baen has distributed serialized e-book versions of new books at reduced prices in monthly bundles. Originally called Webscriptions, these Monthly Baen Bundles are scheduled three months in advance of print publication. Webscription.net was implemented by Baen's preferred website expert, Arnold Bailey, who also sold e-books for other publishers. At the start of 2012, the Webscription.net website was redesigned, renamed to Baen Ebooks, and moved to http://www.baenebooks.com/. Despite the new name, Baen Ebooks continues to sell e-books for other publishers, notably science fiction genre rival Night Shade Books. Baen's standard setup is based on monthly bundles. Each month, whichever books Baen has coming out in paper (paperback or hardcover, new or reissued) are bundled put together in a fixed price (currently $18) bundle regardless of a number of books (historically 4‚Äì9 books, average 5‚Äì6). The Monthly Baen Bundles are released in installments beginning three months prior to physical publication. The first installment, released three months prior to paper publication includes roughly a half of every book in the bundle, with some books usually included in their entirety. The second installment, two months prior to print publication includes roughly three quarters, and the third installment on the 16th of the month prior to official print release includes the full text. The first two installments are generally available only as HTML, while the last includes all formats supported. Each bundle can only be bought until the 15th of the month prior to official print publication, which is about the time the printed books reach retailers. (Until December 2012, bundles remained on sale indefinitely.) Another avenue for distribution that Baen uses for some of its new titles is the offering of (electronic advance reading copies) 3 to 5 months prior to publication. Marketed as a premium product for the fans who absolutely positively have to read it now, they are priced at $15 per single title and can differ from the final text (as they are electronic proofs). After print publication, the \\"cleaned up and finalized\\" electronic copy is available both on line through the monthly bundle or as a single title (priced variably $7‚Äì10, older titles are less). The electronic versions by Baen are produced in five common formats (HTML, Palm Pilot/Mobipocket/Kindle format, Rocketbook, EPUB/Stanza, Sony LRF, RTF and MS Reader versions), all unencrypted in drastic contrast to the rest of the e-publishing industries strategy. Jim Baen disliked Adobe's portable document format for reading purposes, but Baen Ebooks offers some non-Baen titles in that format. When customers purchases a title from Baen, they can read it online or download in any format they want as often as they want. Baen instituted a parallel practice of using promotional CD-ROMs with permissive copyright licenses containing many of its stable of authors works. Whether downloaded or by CD-ROM, the source material is available in all the formats Baen supports. The great majority of books published by Baen are still available as e-books, long after the hardcover or paperback versions have gone out of print. This is especially important for midlist titles, which rarely get reprinted. Until December 2012, it was also possible to purchase older monthly bundles. Baen has made liberal use of free content in its marketing efforts. For example, free sample chapters of its books are typically available on the Baen Web site. The \\"Baen Free Library\\" allows free access to dozens of titles from the company's backlist, often the first book published in a series by a Baen author. Baen also provides free electronic copies of its books to readers who are blind, paralyzed, dyslexic, or are amputees. Baen's emphasis on electronic publishing has generated press coverage for the company. In 2001, Wired magazine described Webscriptions as \\"innovative\\". Charles N. Brown, publisher of Locus magazine, has praised Baen's approach in an interview in The New York Times, saying \\"Baen has shown that putting up electronic versions of books doesn't cost you sales. It gains you a larger audience for all of your books. As a result, they've done quite well.\\" =Magazine experiments= Baen's first run at magazine-style book publishing took place in the late 1970s, in the form of Destinies, a quarterly 'bookazine' that featured fiction and non-fiction by well-known and new authors that Baen was promoting. It was published by Ace, where Baen was employed at the time. Under the aegis of Baen Books in the 1980s he published two more bookazine series. The first was Far Frontiers. The second was New Destinies, edited by Baen, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Michael A. Banks. The Grantville Gazettes Baen's began the experimental publication of The Grantville Gazette, an e-magazine anthology series specifically related to the popular Ring of Fire alternate history plenum. The Gazettes are professionally edited and approved fan fiction. They are published on a regular schedule and available individually at Baen Books or Amazon, or by subscription. Jim Baen's Universe In the early 2000s, Baen tried magazine-like publishing again, establishing two self-sustaining e-zine enterprises with a separate staff for each, both spearheaded by Eric Flint: Jim Baen's Universe and the Grantville Gazette series, which was reconfigured after Grantville Gazette V. The general audience speculative fiction anthology Baen's Universe is available only online. At approximately 120,000 words, this latter publication is unusually large when compared to most traditional print editions of science fiction magazines, and the average size of the newly reconfigured Gazettes is similarly generous. =Baen Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)= From 1999 to 2011, Baen's e-books were produced by Webscriptions under contract for Baen Books in various (at least five) common digital formats. Because these multiple formats complicate the issue of identifying electronic versions, Baen and Webscriptions did not use DOIs to identify their e-books (even though some of their books had DOIs). The electronic e-ARC practices also complicates things in \\"publications dates\\", since the first released text starts two to three months before the release of the print copy, though the released text is not guaranteed to be fully copy edited‚Äîand so occasionally differs from the final released fully copy edited versions. Thus, like the Grantville Gazettes the e-publication date antedates the print copy by about two months‚Äîthe interval before the release of the last third and the hardcover print edition is simultaneously released.

The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to tall. Description The leaves are sessile, but have a narrow part near the stem which is a pseudo-petiole. They have three or five parallel veins that diverge in the wider part of the leaf. Leaves are broad or narrow, depending on the species. The inflorescences are borne on stalks typically tall, and can be a short cone or a long spike, with numerous tiny wind-pollinated flowers. Distribution They are found all over the world, including the Americas, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Europe. Many species in the genus are cosmopolitan weeds. They are found in many different habitats, most commonly in wet areas like seepages or bogs. They can also be found in alpine and semi-alpine or coastal areas. The cosmopolitan weeds can be frequently seen at the side of roads. Species The boundaries of the genus Plantago have been fairly stable, with the main question being whether to include Bougueria (one species from the Andes) and Littorella (2‚Äì3 species of aquatic plants).Albach, D.

In Latin the name was formed from the classical Latin word = \\"sole of the foot\\". The name was so formed in Latin because the leaves of these species grow out near flat at ground level. The suffix in Latin means \\"a sort of\\".\\"Plantago\\" in The Names of Plants, by David Gledhill, year 2008. Compare the definitions of \\"planta\\", \\"plantago\\" and \\"plantarium\\" in Lewis and Short's Latin-English Dictionary. See \\"planta\\" at Latin-Dictionary.net. Ecology Plantains are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth)‚Äîsee list of Lepidoptera that feed on plantains. Uses Plantago species have been used since prehistoric times as herbal remedies. The herb is astringent, anti-toxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine, as well as demulcent, expectorant, styptic and diuretic. Externally, a poultice of the leaves is useful for insect bites, poison-ivy rashes, minor sores, and boils. In folklore it is even claimed to be able to cure snakebite and was used by the Dakota Indian tribe of North America for this. Internally, it is used for coughs and bronchitis, as a tea, tincture, or syrup. The broad-leaved varieties are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable for salads, green sauce, and so on. Plantain seed husks expand and become mucilaginous when wet, especially those of P. psyllium, which is used in common over-the-counter bulk laxative and fiber supplement products such as Metamucil. P. psyllium seed is useful for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, dietary fiber supplementation, and diverticular disease. Plantain has been consumed as human food since prehistory. For example, archaeological recovery along California's Central Coast has demonstrated use of this species as a food since the Millingstone Horizon.C. Michael Hogan (2008). Morro Creek, ed. by A. Burnham. In particular, tender young plantain leaves can be eaten raw, and older leaves can be cooked. The seeds can be cooked like rice. Psyllium supplements are typically used in powder form, along with adequate amounts of fluids. A dose of at least 7 grams daily taken with adequate amounts of fluid (water, juice) is used by some for management of elevated cholesterol. There are a number of psyllium products used for constipation. The usual dose is about 3.5 grams twice a day. Psyllium is also a component of several ready-to-eat cereals. Mucilage from desert indianwheat (Plantago ovata) is obtained by grinding off the husk. This mucilage, also known as psyllium, is commonly sold as Isabgol, a laxative which is used to control irregular bowel syndrome and constipation.Sangwan et al. (2011). Mucilages and their Pharmaceutical Applications: an Overview. Pharmacology Online 2: 1265‚Äì1271. It has been used as an indigenous Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for a whole range of bowel problems. As Old English Wegbrade the plantago is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century. In Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, leaves from Plantago major are used as a folk remedy to preventing infection on cuts and scratches because of its antiseptic properties. In Slovenia and other Central European regions, the leaves were traditionally used topically as a cure for blisters resulting from friction (such as caused by tight shoes etc.). There may also be a use for plantains in the abatement of enteric methane from ruminants,Ram√≠rez-Restrepo, C. and T. Barry (2005). \\"Alternative temperate forages containing secondary compounds for improving sustainable productivity in grazing ruminants\\", Animal Feed Science and Technology, 120(3-4), 179‚Äì201. as the natural compounds present (e.g. condensed tannins; ~14 g/kg DM), affect the acetate-propionate ratio in the rumen, which is a primary mechanism by which methanogenesis is restricted.Louren√ßo, M., G. Van Ranst, B. Vlaeminck, S. De Smet, and V. Fievez (2008). \\"Influence of different dietary forages on the fatty acid composition of rumen digesta as well as ruminant meat and milk\\", Animal Feed Science and Technology, 145(1-4), 418‚Äì437.

Examples of tercet forms English-language haiku is an example of an unrhymed tercet poem. A poetic triplet is a tercet in which all three lines follow the same rhyme, AAA; triplets are rather rare; they are more customarily used sparingly in verse of heroic couplets or other couplet verse, to add extraordinary emphasis.Baer 2006. Other types of tercet include an enclosed tercet where the lines rhyme in an ABA pattern and terza rima where the ABA pattern of a verse is continued in the next verse by making the outer lines of the next stanza rhyme with the central line of the preceding stanza, BCB, as in the terza rima or terzina form of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. There has been much investigation of the possible sources of the Dantesque terzina, which Benedetto Croce characterised as \\"linked, enclosed, disciplined, vehement and yet calm\\".Croce, (M.E. Moss, tr.) Essays on Literature and Literary Criticism, 1990, \\"Dante's poetry\\", p 290. William Baer observes of the tercets of terza rima, \\"These interlocking rhymes tend to pull the listener's attention forward in a continuous flow.... Given this natural tendency to glide forward, terza rima is especially well-suited to narration and description\\".Baer 2006, p. 130. The tercet also forms part of the villanelle, where the initial five stanzas are tercets, followed by a concluding quatrain. A tercet may also form the separate halves of the ending sestet in a Petrarchan sonnet, where the rhyme scheme is ABBAABBACDCCDC, as in Longfellow's \\"Cross of Snow\\". For example, while \\"Cross of Snow\\" is indeed a Petrarchan sonnet, it does not follow the form of ABBAABBA CDCCDC. Instead, its form is ABBA CDDC EFG EFG.

It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It also often results in an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves ophthalmopathy. About 25 to 80% of people with the condition develop eye problems. The exact cause is unclear; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A person is more likely to be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by physical or emotional stress, infection or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid and TSI antibodies. The three treatment options are radioiodine therapy, medications and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth, which is then concentrated in the thyroid and destroys it over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers may control some of the symptoms, and antithyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. Eye problems may require additional treatments. Graves disease will develop in about 0.5% of males and 3% of females. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men. Often, it starts between the ages of 40 and 60 but can begin at any age. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases). The condition is named after Irish surgeon Robert Graves, who described it in 1835. A number of prior descriptions also exist. Signs and symptoms Graves disease symptoms The signs and symptoms of Graves disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with main exceptions being Graves ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, periodic partial muscle weakness or paralysis in those especially of Asian descent, and skin warmth and moistness.page 157 in: Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive lacrimation due to Graves ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions, and hypertension. People with hyperthyroidism may experience behavioral and personality changes, including psychosis, mania, anxiety, agitation, and depression. Cause The exact cause is unclear; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While a theoretical mechanism occurs by which exposure to severe stressors and high levels of subsequent distress such as PTSD(Post traumatic stress disorder) could increase the risk of autoimmune disease and cause an aggravation of the autoimmune response that leads to Graves disease, more robust clinical data are needed for a firm conclusion. =Genetics= A genetic predisposition for Graves disease is seen, with some people more prone to develop TSH receptor activating antibodies due to a genetic cause. Human leukocyte antigen DR (especially DR3) appears to play a role. To date, no clear genetic defect has been found to point to a single- gene cause. Genes believed to be involved include those for thyroglobulin, thyrotropin receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte‚Äìassociated antigen 4, among others. =Infectious trigger= Since Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease which appears suddenly, often later in life, a viral or bacterial infection may trigger antibodies which cross-react with the human TSH receptor, a phenomenon known as antigenic mimicry. The bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica bears structural similarity with the human thyrotropin receptor and was hypothesized to contribute to the development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Y. enterocolitica may be an associated condition with both diseases having a shared inherited susceptibility. More recently, the role for Y. enterocolitica has been disputed. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is another potential trigger. Mechanism Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins recognize and bind to the thyrotropin receptor (TSH receptor) which stimulates the secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH in a negative feedback loop. The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level. =Pathophysiology = Histopathological image of diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (clinically presenting as hyperthyroidism) Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body produces antibodies to the receptor for thyroid- stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 may also be produced.) These antibodies cause hyperthyroidism because they bind to the TSHr and chronically stimulate it. The TSHr is expressed on the thyroid follicular cells of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as goiter. The infiltrative exophthalmos frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball. The \\"orange peel\\" skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques. The three types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor currently recognized are: *Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins: these antibodies (mainly IgG) act as long-acting thyroid stimulants, activating the cells in a longer and slower way than TSH, leading to an elevated production of thyroid hormone. *Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles. *Thyrotrophin binding-inhibiting immunoglobulins: these antibodies inhibit the normal union of TSH with its receptor. Some actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function. Other types may not stimulate the thyroid gland, but prevent TSI and TSH from binding to and stimulating the receptor. Another effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. Thyrotoxicosis can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function. Diagnosis Graves' disease may present clinically with one or more of these characteristic signs: *Rapid heartbeat (80%) *Diffuse palpable goiter with audible bruit (70%) *Tremor (40%) *Exophthalmos (protuberance of one or both eyes), periorbital edema (25%) *Fatigue (70%), weight loss (60%) with increased appetite in young people and poor appetite in the elderly, and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis *Heat intolerance (55%) *Tremulousness (55%) *Palpitations (50%) Two signs are truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (i.e., not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (i.e., spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or ultrasound examination of the thyroid. Another sign of Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, i.e., overproduction of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4. Other useful laboratory measurements in Graves' disease include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, usually undetectable in Graves' disease due to negative feedback from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound iodine (elevated). Serologically detected thyroid-stimulating antibodies, radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake, or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler all can independently confirm a diagnosis of Graves' disease. Biopsy to obtain histiological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed. The goiter in Graves' disease is often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. The differentiation among these entities has advanced, as imaging and biochemical tests have improved. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was the most practical approach found in one study. =Eye disease= Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), or thyroid eye disease (TED), is the most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease. It is a form of idiopathic lymphocytic orbital inflammation, and although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, autoimmune activation of orbital fibroblasts, which in TAO express the TSH receptor, is thought to play a central role. Hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and deposition of nonsulfated glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes expansion of the orbital fat and muscle compartments, which within the confines of the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to chemosis and periorbital edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy. Severity of eye disease may be classified by the mnemonic: \\"NO SPECS\\": *Class 0: No signs or symptoms *Class 1: Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag) *Class 2: Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.) *Class 3: Proptosis *Class 4: Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia) *Class 5: Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos) *Class 6: Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement) Typically the natural history of TAO follows Rundle's curve, which describes a rapid worsening during an initial phase, up to a peak of maximum severity, and then improvement to a static plateau without, however, resolving back to a normal condition. Management Treatment of Graves' disease includes antithyroid drugs which reduce the production of thyroid hormone; radioiodine (radioactive iodine I-131); and thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a frankly hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, prior to thyroidectomy, preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient \\"euthyroid\\" (i.e. normothyroid). Each of these treatments has advantages and disadvantages. No one treatment approach is considered the best for everyone. Treatment with antithyroid medications must be given for six months to two years to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. The risk of recurrence is about 40‚Äì50%, and lifelong treatment with antithyroid drugs carries some side effects such as agranulocytosis and liver disease. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world. Œ≤-Blockers (such as propranolol) may be used to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system symptoms of tachycardia and nausea until such time as antithyroid treatments start to take effect. Pure Œ≤-blockers do not inhibit lid-retraction in the eyes, which is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors. =Antithyroid drugs= The main antithyroid drugs are carbimazole (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine may be used to block hormone synthesis before surgery. A randomized control trial testing single-dose treatment for Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150 mg groups). No difference in outcome was shown for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However, two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are a positive TSHr antibody (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% (sensitivity 39%, specificity 98%), a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent to a positive TSHR- Ab. =Radioiodine= Scan of affected thyroid before (top) and after (bottom) radioiodine therapy Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was developed in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid. Contraindications to RAI are pregnancy (absolute), ophthalmopathy (relative; it can aggravate thyroid eye disease), or solitary nodules. Disadvantages of this treatment are a high incidence of hypothyroidism (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation in the form of a daily pill(s). The radioiodine treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves' disease-associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by radioiodine, but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of radioiodine which is administered. In rare cases, radiation induced thyroiditis has been linked to this treatment. =Surgery= This modality is suitable for young and pregnant people. Indications for thyroidectomy can be separated into absolute indications or relative indications. These indications aid in deciding which people would benefit most from surgery. The absolute indications are a large goiter (especially when compressing the trachea), suspicious nodules or suspected cancer (to pathologically examine the thyroid), and people with ophthalmopathy and additionally if it is the person's preferred method of treatment or if refusing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Pregnancy is advised to be delayed for 6 months after radioactive iodine treatment. Both bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy and the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy on one side and partial lobectomy on other side) are possible. Advantages are immediate cure and potential removal of carcinoma. Its risks are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of the parathyroid glands), hematoma (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and scarring. The increase in the risk of nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after complete thyroidectomy. Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid). No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (i.e., near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be levothyroxine, or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient's life. A 2013 review article concludes that surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of Graves' disease, with total thyroidectomy being the preferred surgical option. =Eyes= Mild cases are treated with lubricant eye drops or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops. Severe cases threatening vision (corneal exposure or optic nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases, cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while). Difficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night, or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep. Orbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat back into the head. Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull. Eyelid surgery can be performed on upper and/or lower eyelids to reverse the effects of Graves' disease on the eyelids. Eyelid muscles can become tight with Graves' disease, making it impossible to close eyes all the way. Eyelid surgery involves an incision along the natural crease of the eyelid, and a scraping away of the muscle that holds the eyelid open. This makes the muscle weaker, which allows the eyelid to extend over the eyeball more effectively. Eyelid surgery helps reduce or eliminate dry eye symptoms. For management of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score >2) with at least mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered in the form of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves' orbitopathy. Prognosis If left untreated, more serious complications could result, including birth defects in pregnancy, increased risk of a miscarriage, bone mineral loss and, in extreme cases, death. Graves' disease is often accompanied by an increase in heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur ‚Äì with the risk of a secondary corneal infection, which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss, as well. Prolonged untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss, which may resolve when treated. Epidemiology Graves' disease occurs in about 0.5% of people. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men. Often it starts between the ages of 40 and 60. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases). History Graves' disease owes its name to the Irish doctor Robert James Graves, who described a case of goiter with exophthalmos in 1835.Graves, RJ. Newly observed affection of the thyroid gland in females . (Clinical lectures.) London Medical and Surgical Journal (Renshaw), 1835; 7 (part 2): 516‚Äì517. Reprinted in Medical Classics, 1940;5:33‚Äì36. Medical eponyms are often styled nonpossessively; thus Graves' disease and Graves disease are variant stylings of the same term. The German Karl Adolph von Basedow independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in 1840.Von Basedow, KA. Exophthalmus durch Hypertrophie des Zellgewebes in der Augenh√∂hle. [Casper's] Wochenschrift f√ºr die gesammte Heilkunde, Berlin, 1840, 6: 197‚Äì204; 220‚Äì228. Partial English translation in: Ralph Hermon Major (1884‚Äì1970): Classic Descriptions of Disease. Springfield, C. C. Thomas, 1932. 2nd edition, 1939; 3rd edition, 1945.Von Basedow, KA. Die Glotzaugen. [Casper's] Wochenschrift f√ºr die gesammte Heilkunde, Berlin, 1848: 769‚Äì777. As a result, on the European Continent, the terms Basedow's syndrome, Basedow's disease, or Morbus Basedow, pages 82, 294, and 295. are more common than Graves' disease. ‚Äì the history and naming of the disease Graves' disease has also been called exophthalmic goiter. Less commonly, it has been known as Parry's disease, Begbie's disease, Flajani's disease, Flajani‚ÄìBasedow syndrome, and Marsh's disease. These names for the disease were derived from Caleb Hillier Parry, James Begbie, Giuseppe Flajani, and Henry Marsh. Early reports, not widely circulated, of cases of goiter with exophthalmos were published by the Italians Giuseppe FlajaniFlajani, G. Sopra un tumor freddo nell'anterior parte del collo broncocele. (Osservazione LXVII). In Collezione d'osservazioni e reflessioni di chirurgia. Rome, Michele A Ripa Presso Lino Contedini, 1802;3:270‚Äì273. and Antonio Giuseppe Testa,Testa, AG. Delle malattie del cuore, loro cagioni, specie, segni e cura. Bologna, 1810. 2nd edition in 3 volumes, Florence, 1823; Milano 1831; German translation, Halle, 1813. in 1802 and 1810, respectively. Prior to these, Caleb Hillier Parry, a notable provincial physician in England of the late 18th century (and a friend of Edward Miller-Gallus), described a case in 1786. This case was not published until 1825, which was still ten years ahead of Graves. However, fair credit for the first description of Graves' disease goes to the 12th century Persian physician Sayyid Ismail al-Jurjani,Sayyid Ismail Al-Jurjani.

On the other hand, the city of Trevi no longer has a bishop, although it once did, and the erstwhile cathedral of Emilianus of Trevi is now a mere church. By contradistinction, the Italian word for a cathedral sensu stricto is cattedrale. Many people refer to particular churches simply as il Duomo, the Duomo, without regard to the full proper name of the church. Similar words exist in other European languages: Dom (German), dom (Romanian), d√≥m (Hungarian and Slovak), d√¥me (French), domo (Portuguese), doms (Latvian), tum (Polish), domkirke (Danish and Norwegian), d√≥mkirkja (Icelandic), domkyrka (Swedish), toomkirik (Estonian), tuomiokirkko (Finnish) and so on. Also in these languages the respective terms do not necessarily refer to a church functioning as a cathedral, but also to proto-cathedrals or simply prominent church buildings, which have never been a cathedral in the exact sense of that word. German Dom and Polish tum became the synecdoche used ‚Äì pars pro toto ‚Äì for most existing or former collegiate churches. Therefore, the uniform translation of these terms into English as \\"cathedrals\\" may not always be appropriate and should be used on a contextual basis. According to the Oxford English Dictionary and the Zingarelli, the word duomo derives from the Latin word domus, meaning \\"house\\", as a cathedral is the \\"house of God\\", or domus Dei. The Garzanti online dictionary also gives the etymology as deriving from \\"house\\", but \\"house of the bishop\\" instead. Italian cathedrals are often highly decorated and contain notable artworks; in many cases the buildings themselves are true artworks.

In 1989 he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas R. Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA. Family and education Altman was born on May 7, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His parents, Ray (Arlin), a textile worker, and Victor Altman, a grocer, were immigrants to Canada, each coming from Eastern Europe as a young adult, in the 1920s. Altman's mother was from Bia≈Çystok in Poland, and had come to Canada with her sister at the age of eighteen, learning English and working in a textile factory to earn money to bring the rest of their family to Quebec. Altman's father, born in Ukraine, had been a worker on a collective farm in the Soviet Union. He was sponsored to come to Canada as a farm worker, but later, as a husband and a father of two sons, he supported the family by running a small grocery store in Montreal. Sidney Altman was later to look back on his parents' lives as an illustration of the value of the work ethic: \\"It was from them I learned that hard work in stable surroundings could yield rewards, even if only in infinitesimally small increments.\\" As Altman reached adulthood, the family's financial situation had become secure enough that he was able to pursue a college education. He went to the United States to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While at MIT, he was a member of the ice hockey team. After achieving his bachelor's degree from MIT in 1960, Altman spent 18 months as a graduate student in physics at Columbia University. Due to personal concerns and the lack of opportunity for beginning graduate students to participate in laboratory work, he left the program without completing the degree. Some months later, he enrolled as a graduate student in biophysics at the University of Colorado Medical Center. His project was a study of the effects of acridines on the replication of bacteriophage T4 DNA. He received his Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of Colorado in 1967 with thesis advisor Leonard Lerman; Lerman went in 1967 to Vanderbilt University, where Altman worked briefly as a researcher in molecular biology before leaving for Harvard. Altman was married to Ann M. K√∂rner (daughter of Stephan K√∂rner) in 1972. They are the parents of two children, Daniel and Leah. Having lived primarily in the United States since departing Montreal to attend MIT in 1958, Altman became a U.S. citizen in 1984, maintaining dual citizenship as a Canadian citizen as well. Career After receiving his Ph.D., Altman embarked upon the first of two research fellowships. He joined Matthew Meselson's laboratory at Harvard University to study a DNA endonuclease involved in the replication and recombination of T4 DNA. Later, at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, Altman started the work that led to the discovery of RNase P and the enzymatic properties of the RNA subunit of that ribozyme. John D. Smith, as well as several postdoctoral colleagues, provided Altman with very good advice that enabled him to test his ideas. \\"The discovery of the first radiochemically pure precursor to a tRNA molecule enabled me to get a job as an assistant professor at Yale University in 1971, a difficult time to get any job at all\\". Altman's career at Yale followed a standard academic pattern with promotion through the ranks until he became Professor in 1980. He was Chairman of his department from 1983 to 1985 and in 1985 became the Dean of Yale College for four years. On July 1, 1989, he returned to the post of Professor on a full-time basis. His doctoral students include Ben Stark. While at Yale, Altman's Nobel Prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme RNase P, a ribonucleoprotein particle consisting of both a structural RNA molecule and one (in prokaryotes) or more (in eukaryotes) proteins. Originally, it was believed that, in the bacterial RNase P complex, the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex, which is involved in the maturation of tRNAs. During experiments in which the complex was reconstituted in test tubes, Altman and his group discovered that the RNA component, in isolation, was sufficient for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the RNA itself had catalytic properties, which was the discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize. Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms, his later work revealed that in those organisms, the protein subunits of the complex are essential to the catalytic activity, in contrast to the bacterial RNase P. Recognition Altman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988.

This occurs when external forces such as gravity are balanced by a pressure- gradient force.White (2008). p 63, 66. For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing Earth's atmosphere into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space. Hydrostatic equilibrium is the distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies, and has other roles in astrophysics and planetary geology. This qualification means that the object is symmetrically rounded into an ellipsoid shape, where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid crust. In addition to the Sun, there are a dozen or so equilibrium objects confirmed to exist in the Solar System, with others possible. To put it simply, hydrostatic equilibrium is the balance struck between pressure-gradient force and gravity. This phenomenon is why Earth's atmosphere neither dissipates into space nor collapses into a thin, dense shell, and is also what gives large celestial objects their ellipsoidal shape. Mathematical consideration If the highlighted volume of fluid is not accelerating, the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwards. =Derivation from force summation= Newton's laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium. The fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived. There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of pressure, :F_{top} = - P_{top} \\\\cdot A. Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is :F_{bottom} = P_{bottom} \\\\cdot A. Finally, the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards. If the density is œÅ, the volume is V and g the standard gravity, then: :F_{weight} = -\\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot V. The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height ‚Äî the formula for finding the volume of a cube. :F_{weight} = -\\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot h By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is :\\\\sum F = F_{bottom} + F_{top} + F_{weight} = P_{bottom} \\\\cdot A - P_{top} \\\\cdot A - \\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot h. This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant. Dividing by A, :0 = P_{bottom} - P_{top} - \\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot h. Or, :P_{top} - P_{bottom} = - \\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot h. Ptop ‚àí Pbottom is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element‚Äîa change in the distance above the ground. By saying these changes are infinitesimally small, the equation can be written in differential form. :dP = - \\\\rho \\\\cdot g \\\\cdot dh. Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be: :dP = - \\\\rho(P) \\\\cdot g(h) \\\\cdot dh. =Derivation from Navier‚ÄìStokes equations= Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three- dimensional Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for the equilibrium situation where :u=v=\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y}=0. Then the only non-trivial equation is the z-equation, which now reads :\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial z}+\\\\rho g=0. Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. =Derivation from general relativity= By plugging the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid :T^{\\\\mu u}=(\\\\rho c^{-2}+P)u^\\\\mu u^ u+Pg^{\\\\mu u} into the Einstein field equations :R_{\\\\mu u}=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}(T_{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u}T) and using the conservation condition : abla_\\\\mu T^{\\\\mu u}=0 one can derive the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates: :\\\\frac{dP}{dr}=-\\\\frac{G M(r)\\\\rho(r)}{r^2}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{P(r)}{\\\\rho(r)c^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\\\\right)^{-1} In practice, Œ° and œÅ are related by an equation of state of the form f(Œ°,œÅ)=0, with f specific to makeup of the star. M(r) is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density œÅ(r), with the largest sphere having radius r: :M(r)=4\\\\pi\\\\int_0^r dr' r'^2\\\\rho(r'). Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let c‚Üí‚àû, so that the factor :\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{P(r)}{\\\\rho(r)c^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\rightarrow 1 Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium: :\\\\frac{dP}{dr}=-\\\\frac{GM(r)\\\\rho(r)}{r^2}=-g(r)\\\\,\\\\rho(r)\\\\longrightarrow dP = - \\\\rho(h)\\\\,g(h)\\\\, dh (we have made the trivial notation change h=r and have used f(Œ°,œÅ)=0 to express œÅ in terms of P). A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial_i P}{P+\\\\rho} - \\\\partial_i \\\\ln u^t + u_t u^{\\\\phi}\\\\partial_i\\\\frac{u_{\\\\phi}}{u_t}=0 Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates (t,r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi), the index i runs for the coordinates r and \\\\theta). Applications =Fluids= The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to hydrostatics and the principles of equilibrium of fluids. A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water. Hydrostatic balance allows the discovery of their specific gravities. This equilibrium is strictly applicable when an ideal fluid is in steady horizontal laminar flow, and when any fluid is at rest or in vertical motion at constant speed. It can also be a satisfactory approximation when flow speeds are low enough that acceleration is negligible. =Astrophysics= In any given layer of a star, there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward. The isotropic gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an oblate spheroid up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star Vega, which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid, and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but piriform or oviform, with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable. If the star has a massive nearby companion object then tidal forces come into play as well, distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid. An example of this is Beta Lyrae. Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the intracluster medium, where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a cluster of galaxies. We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the velocity dispersion of dark matter in clusters of galaxies. Only baryonic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits X-ray radiation. The absolute X-ray luminosity per unit volume takes the form \\\\mathcal{L}_X=\\\\Lambda(T_B)\\\\rho_B^2 where T_B and \\\\rho_B are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and \\\\Lambda(T) is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation dP=-\\\\rho gdr: :p_B(r+dr)-p_B(r)=-dr\\\\frac{\\\\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\\\\int_0^r 4\\\\pi r^2\\\\,\\\\rho_M(r)\\\\, dr. The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with r being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the ideal gas law p_B=kT_B\\\\rho_B/m_B (k is Boltzmann's constant and m_B is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at :\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(\\\\frac{kT_B(r)\\\\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\\\\right)=-\\\\frac{\\\\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\\\\int_0^r 4\\\\pi r^2\\\\,\\\\rho_M(r)\\\\, dr. Multiplying by r^2/\\\\rho_B(r) and differentiating with respect to r yields :\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left[\\\\frac{r^2}{\\\\rho_B(r)}\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(\\\\frac{kT_B(r)\\\\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\\\\right)\\\\right]=-4\\\\pi Gr^2\\\\rho_M(r). If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density \\\\rho_D=\\\\rho_M-\\\\rho_B satisfies the non-linear differential equation :\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left[\\\\frac{r^2}{\\\\rho_D(r)}\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left(\\\\frac{kT_D(r)\\\\rho_D(r)}{m_D}\\\\right)\\\\right]=-4\\\\pi Gr^2\\\\rho_M(r). With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion \\\\sigma^2_D of the dark matter, which is given by :\\\\sigma^2_D=\\\\frac{kT_D}{m_D}. The central density ratio \\\\rho_B(0)/\\\\rho_M(0) is dependent on the redshift z of the cluster and is given by :\\\\rho_B(0)/\\\\rho_M(0)\\\\propto (1+z)^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{s}\\\\right)^{3/2} where \\\\theta is the angular width of the cluster and s the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from .11 to .14 for various surveys. =Planetary geology= The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body. According to the definition of planet adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will often have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a planemo), though near-hydrostatic or formerly hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 Vesta may also be differentiated and some hydrostatic bodies (notably Callisto) have not thoroughly differentiated since their formation. Often the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid, as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid. Also, the purported dwarf planet is scalene due to its rapid rotation, though it may not currently be in equilibrium. Icy objects were previously believed to need less mass to attain hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that appears to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon Mimas at 396 km, whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid Vesta at 525 km (573 √ó 557 √ó 446 km). However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet Ceres, which is icy, at 945 km, whereas the largest body known body to have a noticeable deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium is Iapetus (moon) being made of mostly permeable ice and almost no rock http://www.ciclops.org/media/sp/2011/6794_16344_0.pdf. At 1,469 km the moon is neither spherical or ellipsoid. Instead, it is rather in a strange walnut-like shape due to its unique equatorial ridge. . Thusly due to this Iapetus is the largest object not in hydrostatic equilibrium despite its size. Some icy bodies may be in equilibrium at least partly due to a subsurface ocean, which is not the definition of equilibrium used by the IAU (gravity overcoming internal rigid-body forces). Solid bodies have irregular surfaces, but local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest mountain on Earth, Mauna Kea, has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium. =Atmospheric modeling= In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the pressure-gradient force. The force of gravity balances this out, keeping the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude.

The Church of Satan was established at the Black House in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, who was the Church's High Priest until his death in 1997. In 2001, Peter H. Gilmore was appointed the position of High Priest, and the church's headquarters were moved to Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City. The church does not believe in the Devil, neither a Christian nor Islamic notion of Satan. Peter H. Gilmore describes its members as \\"skeptical atheists\\", embracing the Hebrew root of the word \\"Satan\\" as \\"adversary\\". The church views Satan as a positive archetype who represents pride, individualism, and enlightenment, and as a symbol of defiance against the Abrahamic faiths which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. The Church of Satan describes its structural basis as a cabal that is \\"an underground cell-system of individuals who share the basis of [our] philosophy\\". Membership in the Church of Satan is available on two levels: registered membership and active membership. Registered members are those who choose to affiliate on a formal level by filling out the required information and sending a one time registration fee. Active membership is available for those who wish to take a more active role in the organization, and is subject to the completion of a more comprehensive application. The organization does not disclose official membership numbers. The church provides wedding, funeral, and baptismal services to members. Such ceremonies are performed by a member of the church's priesthood. The Church maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey, rejecting the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists.n:Satanism: An interview with Church of Satan High Priest Frank Acosta Scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented \\"the first public, highly visible, and long- lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse\\". Beliefs The Church views Satan as an archetype of pride, individualism, and enlightenment. The Church does not espouse a belief in Satan as an entity who literally exists, and LaVey did not encourage the worship of Satan as a deity. High Priest Peter H. Gilmore has stated \\"My real feeling is that anybody who believes in supernatural entities on some level is insane. Whether they believe in the Devil or God, they are abdicating reason\\". Gilmore defines the word \\"Satan\\" as \\"a model or a mode of behavior\\", noting that in Hebrew the word means \\"adversary\\" or \\"opposer\\", which can be regarded as \\"one who questions\\". Gilmore describes Satanism as beginning with atheism, and taking the view that the universe is indifferent: \\"There's no God, there's no Devil. No one cares!\\"Interview with Peter H. Gilmore, David Shankbone, Wikinews, November 5, 2007. LaVey sought to cement his belief system within the secularist world-view that derived from natural science, thus providing him with an anti-theistic basis with which to criticize Christianity and other supernaturalist beliefs. He legitimized his religion by highlighting what he claimed was its rational nature, contrasting this with what he saw as the supernaturalist irrationality of established religions. Church members may also participate in a system of magic which LaVey defined as greater and lesser magic. Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose; lesser magic is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology and glamour (or \\"wile and guile\\") to bend an individual or situation to one's will. Although many of LaVey's ideas are shaped around a secular and scientific world-view, others express the belief that there are various magical forces in existence; rather than characterising these as supernatural, LaVey expressed the view that they were part of the natural world yet thus far undiscovered by science. He believed that the successful use of magic involved the magician manipulating these natural forces using the force of their own willpower, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology. Outlined in The Satanic Bible, LaVey defined magic as \\"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable.\\" The term \\"Theistic Satanism\\" has been described as \\"oxymoronic\\" by the church and its High Priest. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, atheistic or otherwise, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers. Prominent Church leader Blanche Barton described Satanism as \\"an alignment, a lifestyle\\". LaVey and the Church espoused the view that \\"Satanists are born, not made\\"; that they are outsiders by their nature, living as they see fit, who are self- realized in a religion which appeals to the would-be Satanist's nature, leading them to realize they are Satanists through finding a belief system that is in line with their own perspective and lifestyle. Adherents to the philosophy have described Satanism as a non-spiritual religion of the flesh, or \\"...the world's first carnal religion\\". The \\"central convictions\\" of the Church are formulated in the Nine Satanic Statements, Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth, Nine Satanic Sins, and Pentagonal Revisionism, which are regularly reproduced within the Church of Satan's written material. History =Pre- establishment (1950s‚Äì1965)= In 1956, LaVey purchased a Victorian house in the Richmond District of San Francisco, which he painted black. During the late 1950s, LaVey hosted Friday night lectures on occult subjects at his house. The process of writing his lectures led him to distill his philosophy based on his earlier research into topics considered bizarre and arcane, and experiences as a psychic investigator and hypnotist, as well as work in the carnivals. He gradually gathered regular visitors who became known as the \\"Magic Circle\\". During this time, LaVey also held \\"witches workshops\\", classes to instruct women on the art of seduction and manipulation through glamour and feminine wiles. According to sociologist and early group affiliate, Randall Alfred, these \\"workshops\\" included \\"various aspects of Satanism\\" and were part of the Friday night lectures. Though actual numbers are unknown, it has been suggested that the group comprised around twenty people. Accounts suggest that the \\"circle\\" included authors, artists, doctors, policemen, and academics among other professions. In the early 1960s Anton LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later became the governing body of the Church of Satan. The group included: \\"The Baroness\\" Carin de Plessen, Dr. Cecil Nixon, Kenneth Anger, City Assessor Russell Wolden, and Donald Werby. According to the Church of Satan historiography, other LaVey associates from this time include noted science fiction and horror writers Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, and Fritz Leiber Jr. In the mid-60's, prior to the publishing of The Satanic Bible, LaVey's writings were disseminated among his circle in the form of a series of papers known as the \\"rainbow sheets\\", an assortment of essays describing the philosophy, presented as \\"an introduction to Satanism\\". These essays were later featured in The Book of Lucifer. In addition was a paper describing magic and containing instructions for the practice or ritual. =Formation, rituals and publicity (1966‚Äì1978)= LaVey founded the Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht of 1966, which he proclaimed to be \\"the Year One\\", Anno Satanas‚Äîthe first year of the \\"Age of Satan\\". LaVey began performing weekly Satanic rituals with followers at his house in San Francisco, which was known as \\"the Black House\\". In February 1967, LaVey and the Church performed a much publicized Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The ceremony was attended by Joe Rosenthal. LaVey performed the first publicly recorded Satanic baptism in history for his youngest daughter Zeena, which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on The Satanic Mass LP. LaVey attracted a number of celebrities to join his Church, most notably Sammy Davis Jr. and Jayne Mansfield. LaVey also established branches of the Church, known as grottos, in various parts of the United States; these included the Babylon Grotto in Detroit, the Stygian Grotto in Dayton, and the Lilith Grotto in New York City. The Church of Satan was the subject of a number of books, magazine and newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s. It is also the subject of a documentary, Satanis (1970). LaVey appeared in Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother and acted as technical adviser on The Devil's Rain, which starred Ernest Borgnine and William Shatner, and introduced John Travolta. LaVey ceased conducting group rituals and workshops in his home in 1972. In 1973, church leaders in Michigan, Ohio and Florida split to form their own Church of Satanic Brotherhood, however this disbanded in 1974 when one of its founders publicly converted to Christianity. Subsequently, members of the Church of Satan based in Kentucky and Indiana left to found the Ordo Templi Satanis. In 1975, LaVey phased out the Church's \\"Grotto\\" system and eliminated people he thought were using the Church as a substitute for accomplishment in the outside world. Thereafter, conventional achievement in society would be the criterion for advancement within the Church of Satan. =1980s and early 1990s and \\"Satanic Panic\\"= In the 1980s the media reported concerns of criminal conspiracies within the Church of Satan. The FBI would later issue an official report refuting the criminal conspiracy theories of this time. This phenomenon became known as the \\"Satanic Panic\\". LaVey's daughter Zeena was the spokesperson and High Priestess in the Church of Satan during the 1980s. During this period, she appeared on television and radio broadcasts, in part to educate about the Church, and in part to debunk the mythology surrounding the Satanic Panic‚Äîa period of time in the same era in which Satanism was blamed for the actions of Satanic ritual abuse. From then until her renunciation of the Church of Satan in 1990, Zeena appeared in such nationally syndicated programs as The Phil Donahue Show, Nightline with Ted Koppel, Entertainment Tonight, The Late Show, Secrets & Mysteries and the Sally Jesse Raphael Show. The appearances were made at the behest of the Church of Satan as its spokesperson. She did this on behalf of her father Anton LaVey, who was no longer interested in making media appearances, as she stated while being interviewed alongside her husband by televangelist Bob Larson. In the 1980s and 1990s remaining members of the Church of Satan became active in media appearances to refute allegations of criminal activity. The Church of Satan and its members were very active in producing movies, music, films, and magazines devoted to Satanism. Most notably Adam Parfrey's Feral House publishing, the music of Boyd Rice, musician King Diamond, and the films of Nick Bougas (a.k.a. A. Wyatt Mann), including his documentary Speak of the Devil: The Canon of Anton LaVey. The Church of Satan and Anton LaVey were also the subject of numerous magazine and news articles during this time. =After LaVey= High Priest Peter H. Gilmore. After LaVey's death in 1997, leadership of the Church was turned over to his partner, Blanche Barton. On November 7, 1997, Karla LaVey made a press release about continuing the church with fellow high priestess Blanche Barton. Barton eventually received ownership of the organization, which she held for 4 years. Karla LaVey ultimately left the Church of Satan and founded First Satanic Church.'Black Pope' of Satanic Church dies aged 67. San Francisco: Reuters. November 7, 1997, by Andrew Quinn That year, the Church established an official website. In 2001, Blanche ceded her position to longtime members Peter H. Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia, the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of The Black Flame, the official magazine of The Church of Satan. The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. After LaVey's death, conflict over the nature of Satanism intensified within the Satanic community. The Church of Satan became increasingly doctrinally-rigid and focused on maintaining the purity of LaVeyan Satanism. The Church's increased emphasis on their role as the bearer of his legacy was partly a response to the growth in non-LaVeyan Satanists. Some Church members ‚Äì including Gilmore ‚Äì claimed that only they were the \\"real\\" Satanists and that those belonging to different Satanic traditions were \\"pseudo\\" Satanists. After examining many of these claims on the Church's website, Lewis concluded that it was \\"obsessed with shoring up its own legitimacy by attacking the heretics, especially those who criticize LaVey\\". Meanwhile, the Church experienced an exodus of its membership in the 2000s, with many of these individuals establishing new groups online. In October 2004 the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist, 24-year- old Chris Cranmer, as a technician on . On June 6, 2006, the Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles to mark the Church's fortieth birthday. The ritual, based on the rites outlined in The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals, was conducted by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz. In December 2007 the Associated Press reported on a story concerning the Church of Satan, in which a teenager had sent an email to High Priest Gilmore stating he wanted to \\"kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan\\". Gilmore then reported the message to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who informed local police, who arrested the teenager. ;Timeline Membership Membership to the Church is gained by paying $225 and filling out a registration statement, and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees. The church emphasizes that one does not have to join the organization to consider oneself a Satanist, and that one only needs to recognize himself in the Satanic Bible and live according to the tenets outlined therein. The Church states they do not solicit memberships nor proselytize. As the Church does not publicly release membership information, it is not publicly known how many members belong to the Church. The 1973 US Army Chaplain's Handbook written by Cecil D Lewis stated that once memberships reached ten thousand the figures were no longer made public. The 2000 edition of the Chaplain's handbook edited by J. Gordon Melton, removed this observation and simply stated the Church does not publish membership information. According to the Church of Satan web page, memberships are for a lifetime and membership has \\"always grown as the years pass\\". Despite no official published membership number, the issue of membership size continues to be debated. According to Maxwell Davies, estimates have placed membership from 300 to 20,000. Sociologist Massimo Introvigne placed membership at 1,000 in 1997, and in his 2016 book Satanism: A Social History stated that Church membership probably \\"never exceeded one or two thousand\\". In a 1988 TV appearance, then Church of Satan spokesperson Zeena LaVey answered Geraldo Rivera's question about membership numbers by stating \\"hundreds of thousands? I can't say, thousands easily.\\" According to scholar of religion and ordained minister in the United Methodist Church J. Gordon Melton, Church of Satan \\"always counted its active membership in the hundreds\\".\\"Active membership\\" is an application dependent subset of the total membership. According to an interview with the Church of Satan, \\"interest in the Church of Satan and Satanism is growing all the time if our mailboxes, answering and fax machines, and e-mail is any indication.\\" While not indicative of active membership, the organization's social media accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers. Memberships may be terminated on written request of the member, at the discretion of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess, and the Council of Nine. Church membership operates on a system of degrees, with active membership being the first degree. One must apply and be approved for an active membership, and this is subject to one's answers to a lengthy series of questions. Promotion to a higher degree is by invitation only, and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public. Members of the third through fifth degrees constitute the Priesthood. LaVey implemented a system of five initiatory levels that the Satanist could advance through by demonstrating knowledge of Satanic philosophy and personal accomplishments in life. These were known as Apprentice (Satanist I¬∞), Brother/Sister of the Cauldron (Witch or Warlock II¬∞), Priest/ Priestess of Mendes (Wizard or Enchantress III¬∞), Magister Cavemi/Magister Templi/Magister Magnus (Magister IV¬∞), and Magister Satanas (Magus V¬∞). =Hierarchy= * Registered Member (no degree) * Active Member (first degree) * Witch/Warlock (second degree) * Priestess/Priest (third degree) * Magistra/Magister (fourth degree) * Maga/Magus (fifth degree). =Priesthood of Mendes & Council of Nine= Members of the Priesthood make up the Council of Nine, which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan, of which Magistra Templi Rex Blanche Barton is the chairmistress. Individuals who are part of the priesthood are those who act as spokespersons of the Church of Satan. The priesthood is exclusive to third, fourth, and fifth degree members. Members of the priesthood may be referred to as \\"reverend\\". The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and primary public representatives; each position (High Priest and High Priestess) is held by a single individual at a time. The current High Priest is Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priestess is Peggy Nadramia. =The Grotto System= Within the Church, a Grotto (from Italian grotta, a type of cave) is a clandestine association or gathering of Satanists within geographical proximity for means of social, ritual, and special interest activities.The Church of Satan Website , under Affiliation: The Grotto System Retrieved December 3, 2010 The Black House, the founding place and headquarters of the Church of Satan from 1966 to 1997, was effectively the first grotto, and was for a time referred to as the \\"Central Grotto\\". Grottos existed for a time in various parts of the United States; these included the Babylon Grotto in Detroit, the Stygian Grotto in Dayton, and the Lilith Grotto in New York. In 1975, LaVey disbanded all grottos, then reinstated them in the 1980s. The Grotto System was briefly reinstated in 1995 with a Grotto Master Handbook being disseminated to Grotto Masters, who would then submit monthly reports to \\"Central Grotto\\" via Grotto Administrators chosen by Blanche Barton. The Church of Satan no longer formally recognizes or charters grottos. Formal gatherings =6/6/06 High Mass= On June 6, 2006, the Church of Satan conducted a Satanic High Mass at the Center for Inquiry West's Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles, California. The event was by invitation only, and over one hundred members of the Church of Satan from around the world filled the theatre to capacity. The event was documented, and many members of the Church of Satan were interviewed, by the BBC with permission. The main ritual, based on the rites outlined in The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals, was conducted by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz. The music for the mass was created and performed by Lustmord and was subsequently released on his album Rising. Legacy LaVey is thought to be directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious movement. Scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented \\"the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse\\".

The term also refers to a pop subgenre, originating in the United States in the late 1960s, that evolved from garage rock, novelty songs, and the Brill Building sound, and which was also defined by its target demographic of preteens and young teenagers. The Archies' 1969 hit \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" was a representative example that led to cartoon rock, a short-lived trend of Saturday-morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop rock songs in the bubblegum vein. Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz claimed credit for coining \\"bubblegum\\", saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \\"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\\" The term was then popularized by their boss, Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart. Most bubblegum acts were one hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the sound remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Commentators often debate the scope of the genre and have variously argued for the exclusion or inclusion of dance-pop, disco, teen pop, boy bands, and especially the Monkees. During the 1970s, the original bubblegum sound was a formative influence on punk rock, new wave, and melodic metal. Definitions Occasionally invoked as a pejorative, the \\"bubblegum\\" descriptor has several different applications. The 2001 book Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth rules out teen pop or boy bands as inherently bubblegum and defines the term as: # \\"the classic bubblegum era from 1967-1972\\" # \\"disposable pop music\\" # \\"pop music contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens\\" # \\"pop music produced in an assembly-line process, driven by producers and using faceless singers\\" # \\"pop music with that intangible, upbeat 'bubblegum' sound.\\" The artists were typically singles acts, with songs commonly featuring singalong choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual double entendre. Comparing bubblegum to power pop, Mojo writer Dawn Eden said: \\"Power pop aims for your heart and your feet. Bubblegum aims for any part of your body it can get, as long as you buy the damn record.\\" Music critic Lester Bangs described the style as \\"the basic sound of rock 'n' roll - minus the rage, fear, violence and anomie\\". There is debate concerning which artists fit the genre, especially for cases such as the Monkees. In the opinion of music historian Bill Pitzonka: \\"The whole thing that really makes a record bubblegum is just an inherently contrived innocence that somehow transcends that. [...] It has to sound like they mean it.\\" Music critic David Smay argued that disco is merely bubblegum by another name, and that since bubblegum is \\"dance music for pre-teen girls\\", the genre's scope must therefore include dance-pop and such associated figures as Stock Aitken Waterman and Kylie Minogue, however, \\"Not all dance-pop is aimed at kids and shouldn't be presumed to be disposable anymore than bubblegum.\\" Precursors According to music historian Carl Caferelli, \\"You could conceivably think of virtually every cute novelty hit, from pre-rock ditties like ‚ÄúHow Much Is That Doggie In The Window‚Äù to transcendent rock-era staples like ‚ÄúIko Iko,‚Äù as a legitimate precursor to bubblegum's avowedly ephemeral themes.\\" He went on to list such \\"important antecedents\\" as \\"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\\" (Herman's Hermits, 1965), \\"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\\" (Royal Guardsmen, 1966), \\"Ding, Dong! The Witch is Dead\\" (Fifth Estate, 1967), and \\"Green Tambourine\\" (Lemon Pipers, 1967). Original commercial peak (1968‚Äì1972) Bubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 songs \\"Simon Says\\" by the 1910 Fruitgum Company and \\"Yummy Yummy Yummy\\" by the Ohio Express. Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz have claimed credit for coining \\"bubblegum\\" for this music, saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \\"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\\" The term was seized upon by Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart, as Pitzonka added: \\"Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized [the scene] when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\\" The Archies' \\"Sugar Sugar\\" became the best-selling hit of 1969 and inspired a wave of artists to adopt the bubblegum style. The song's success led to \\"cartoon rock\\", a short-lived trend of Saturday morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop-rock songs in the bubblegum vein. However, none of these songs had showings on the pop charts when released as singles, except for The Banana Splits theme song \\"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\\", which managed a number 96 peak on the Billboard Top 100. Later years and influence Most bubblegum acts were one hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the genre remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Bubblegum failed to maintain its chart presence after the early 1970s due in part to changing trends in the industry. Producers such as Kasenetz and Katz subsequently pursued different musical avenues. Writing in Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth, Chuck Eddy offered that bubblegum evolved to be \\"more an attitude than a genre\\" during the 1970s. In the UK, bubblegum caught on in the early 1970s and fell out of popular favor by the end of the decade. In 2010, author and musician Bob Stanley summarized: Many musicians who grew up with the genre later incorporated bubblegum influences in their work. Although it is rarely acknowledged by music critics, who typically dismissed the genre, bubblegum's simple song structures, upbeat tempos, and \\"catchy\\" hooks were carried into punk rock. The Ramones were the most prominent of the bubblegum-influenced punk bands, adopting cartoon personas and later covering two bubblegum standards \\"Little Bit O' Soul\\" and \\"Indian Giver\\".

He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer systemJames Gosling mentioned a multiprocessor Unix in his statement during the US vs Microsoft Antitrust DOJ trial in 1998 while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems. He also developed several compilers and mail systems there. Career & contributions Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window, because Sun did not give it an open source license. He is known as the father of the Java programming language. He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994. He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine. Another contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the \\"bundle\\" program, known as \\"shar\\", a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment. He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation, citing reductions in pay, status, and decision- making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges.Darryl K.

These operating systems are Microsoft Windows NT, and Digital Equipment Corporation: RSX-11M, VAXELN, VMS (now OpenVMS).  Personal history  Cutler was born in Lansing, Michigan and grew up in DeWitt, Michigan. After graduating from Olivet College, Michigan, in 1965, he went to work for DuPont. Cutler holds at least 20 patents, and is affiliate faculty in the Computer Science Department at the University of Washington. Cutler is an avid auto racing driver. He competed in the Atlantic Championship from 1996 to 2002, scoring a career best of 8th on the Milwaukee Mile in 2000. Cutler is a member of Adelphic Alpha Pi Fraternity at Olivet College, Michigan. DuPont (1965 to 1971) Cutler's first exposure to computers came when he was tasked to perform a computer simulations model for one of DuPont's customers using IBM's GPSS-3 language on an IBM model 7044. This work led to an interest in how computers and their operating systems worked. Digital Equipment Corporation (1971 to 1988) Cutler left DuPont to pursue his interest in computer systems, beginning with Digital Equipment Corporation in 1971. He worked at the famous \\"Mill\\" facility in Maynard, Massachusetts. = RSX-11M = = VMS = In April 1975, Digital began a hardware project, code-named Star, to design a 32-bit virtual address extension to its PDP-11. In June 1975, Cutler, together with Dick Hustvedt and Peter Lipman, were appointed the technical project leaders for the software project, code-named Starlet, to develop a totally new operating system for the Star family of processors. These two projects were tightly integrated from the beginning. The three technical leaders of the Starlet project together with three technical leaders of the Star project formed the \\"Blue Ribbon Committee\\" at Digital who produced the fifth design evolution for the programs. The design featured simplifications to the memory management and process scheduling schemes of the earlier proposals and the architecture was accepted. The Star and Starlet projects culminated in the development of the VAX-11/780 superminicomputer and the VAX/VMS operating system, respectively. = Prism and Mica projects = Digital began working on a new CPU using RISC design principles in 1986. Cutler, who was working in DEC's DECwest facility in Bellevue, Washington, was selected to head Prism, a project to develop the company's RISC machine. Its operating system, code named Mica, was to embody the next generation of design principles and have a compatibility layer for Unix and VMS. The RISC machine was to be based on ECL technology, and was one of three ECL projects Digital was undertaking at the time. Funding the Research and Development (R&D;) costs of multiple ECL projects yielding products that would ultimately compete against each other was a strain. Of the three ECL projects, the VAX 9000 was the only one that was directly commercialized. Primarily because of the early successes of the PMAX advanced development project and the need for differing business models, Prism was canceled in 1988 in favor of PMAX. Prism later surfaced as the basis of Digital's Alpha family of computer systems. = Attitude towards Unix = Cutler is known for his disdain for all things Unix. His sardonic nature showed through in the VMS versus Unix debates at Digital in the early 1980s. He expressed his low opinion of the Unix process input/output model by reciting \\"Get a byte, get a byte, get a byte byte byte\\" to the tune of the finale of Rossini's William Tell Overture. Microsoft (1988 to Present) = Microsoft Windows NT = Cutler left Digital for Microsoft in October 1988 and led the development of Windows NT. Later, he worked on targeting Windows NT to Digital's 64-bit Alpha architecture then on Windows 2000. After the demise of Windows on Alpha (and the demise of Digital), he was instrumental in porting Windows to AMD's new 64-bit AMD64 architecture. He was officially involved with the Windows XP Pro 64-bit and Windows Server 2003 SP1 64-bit releases. He moved to working on Microsoft's Live Platform in August 2006. Dave Cutler was awarded the prestigious status of Senior Technical Fellow at Microsoft. = Microsoft Windows Azure = At the 2008 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft announced Azure Services Platform, a cloud-based operating system which Microsoft is developing. During the conference keynote, Cutler was mentioned as a lead developer on the project, along with Amitabh Srivastava. = Microsoft Xbox = , a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed that Cutler was no longer working on Windows Azure, and had joined the Xbox team. No further information was provided as to what Cutler's role was, nor what he was working on within the team. In May 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One console, and Cutler was mentioned as having worked in the development of host OS portion of the system running inside the new gaming device. Apparently his work was focused in creating an optimized version of Microsoft's Hyper-V Host OS specifically designed for Xbox One.

Uses Side-scan sonar may be used to conduct surveys for marine archaeology; in conjunction with seafloor samples it is able to provide an understanding of the differences in material and texture type of the seabed. Side-scan sonar imagery is also a commonly used tool to detect debris items and other obstructions on the seafloor that may be hazardous to shipping or to seafloor installations by the oil and gas industry. In addition, the status of pipelines and cables on the seafloor can be investigated using side-scan sonar. Side-scan data are frequently acquired along with bathymetric soundings and sub-bottom profiler data, thus providing a glimpse of the shallow structure of the seabed. Side-scan sonar is also used for fisheries research, dredging operations and environmental studies. It also has military applications including mine detection. How it works Side-scan uses a sonar device that emits conical or fan-shaped pulses down toward the seafloor across a wide angle perpendicular to the path of the sensor through the water, which may be towed from a surface vessel or submarine, or mounted on the ship's hull. The intensity of the acoustic reflections from the seafloor of this fan-shaped beam is recorded in a series of cross-track slices. When stitched together along the direction of motion, these slices form an image of the sea bottom within the swath (coverage width) of the beam. The sound frequencies used in side-scan sonar usually range from 100 to 500 kHz; higher frequencies yield better resolution but less range. History Side-scan sonar image of shipwreck \\"Aid\\" in Estonia Lake Murray in South Carolina =Technology= The earliest side-scan sonars used a single conical-beam transducer. Next, units were made with two transducers to cover both sides. The transducers were either contained in one hull-mounted package or with two packages on either side of the vessel. Next the transducers evolved to fan-shaped beams to produce a better \\"sonogram\\" or sonar image. In order to get closer to the bottom in deep water the side-scan transducers were placed in a \\"tow fish\\" and pulled by a tow cable. Up until the mid-1980s, commercial side scan images were produced on paper records. The early paper records were produced with a sweeping plotter that burned the image into a scrolling paper record. Later plotters allowed for the simultaneous plotting of position and ship motion information onto the paper record. In the late 1980s, commercial systems using the newer, cheaper computer systems developed digital scan-converters that could mimic more cheaply the analog scan converters used by the military systems to produce TV and computer displayed images of the scan, and store them on video tape. Currently data is stored on computer hard drives or solid-state media. =Military application= One of the inventors of side-scan sonar was German scientist, Dr. Julius Hagemann, who was brought to the US after World War II and worked at the US Navy Mine Defense Laboratory, Panama City, FL from 1947 until his death in 1964. His work is documented in US Patent 4,197,591 which was first disclosed in Aug 1958, but remained classified by the US Navy until it was finally issued in 1980. Experimental side-scan sonar systems were made during the 1950s in laboratories including Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Hudson Laboratories and by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT. Military side-scan sonars were made in the 1950s by Westinghouse. Advanced systems were later developed and built for special military purposes, such as to find H-Bombs lost at sea or to find a lost Russian submarine, at the Westinghouse facility in Annapolis up through the 1990s. This group also produced the first and only working Angle Look Sonar that could trace objects while looking under the vehicle. =Commercial application= The first commercial side-scan system was the Kelvin Hughes \\"Transit Sonar\\", a converted echo-sounder with a single-channel, pole-mounted, fan-beam transducer introduced around 1960. In 1963 Dr. Harold Edgerton, Edward Curley, and John Yules used a conical-beam 12 kHz side-scan sonar to find the sunken Vineyard Lightship in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. A team led by Martin Klein at Edgerton, Germeshausen & Grier (later E.G. & G., Inc.) developed the first successful towed, dual-channel commercial side-scan sonar system from 1963 to 1966. Martin Klein is generally considered to be the \\"father\\" of commercial side-scan sonar. In 1967, Edgerton used Klein's sonar to help Alexander McKee find Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose. That same year Klein used the sonar to help archaeologist George Bass find a 2000-year-old ship off the coast of Turkey. In 1968 Klein founded Klein Associates (now Klein Marine Systems) and continued to work on improvements including the first commercial high frequency (500 kHz) systems and the first dual-frequency side-scan sonars, and the first combined side-scan and sub-bottom profiling sonar. In 1985, Charles Mazel of Klein Associates (now Klein Marine Systems, Inc.) produced the first commercial side-scan sonar training videos and the first Side Scan Sonar Training Manual and two oceanographers found the wreck of the RMS Titanic. For surveying large areas, the GLORIA sidescan sonar was developed by Marconi Underwater Systems and the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) for NERC. GLORIA stands for Geological Long Range Inclined Asdic.Rusby et al. 1973 It was used by the US Geological Survey and the IOS in the UK to obtain images of continental shelves worldwide. It operated at relatively low frequencies to obtain long range. Like most side-scan sonars, the GLORIA instrument is towed behind a ship. GLORIA has a ping rate of two per minute, and detects returns from a range of up to 22 km either side of the sonar fish.

Russ in Estonia is considered a national heritage monument. Underwater archaeology is archaeology practiced underwater. As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research. The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity. Though often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged. At the end of the last ice age, the North Sea was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths, are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of crannogs, bridges and harbours) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater archaeological sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels; wells, cenotes, wrecks (shipwrecks; aircraft); the remains of structures created in water (such as crannogs, bridges or harbours); other port-related structures; refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste, garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by dumping into the water. Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship Zuytdorp lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area. The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.  Research potential  There are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost. Sometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the Hunley, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (Hunley also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact); the Resurgam II, the first powered submarine; and Holland 5, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.  UNESCO Convention  All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.UNESCO, Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage On the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project for in situ conservation planning of underwater archaeological artefacts.  Challenges  Underwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submarines or remote sensing equipment are needed. For a marine site, while some form of working platform (typically a boat or ship) is often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by logistics problems. A working platform for underwater archeology needs to be equipped to provide for the delivery of air for example, recompression and medical facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including water dredge and airlifts create additional hazards and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong tidal flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety. Underwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by currents, surf, storm damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make in-situ conservation infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as piddocks. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form concretions. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need special care. Visibility may be poor, because of sediments or algae in the water and lack of light penetration. This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water. In addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good outreach possibilities or access for the general public. Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the World Wide Web for webcasting projects, or dedicated virtual reality systems that allow users to perform a virtual diving into an interactive 3D reconstruction of the underwater archaeological site. An example is the excavation of the Queen Anne's Revenge and the QAR DiveLive program, a live interactive virtual field trip to the wrecksite.  Techniques  Although specialised techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one. An important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the Mary Rose have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time. As with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualisation). = Position fixing = Knowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so position fixing is generally achieved using GPS. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using transects. A site may also be located by visually surveying some form of marker (such as a buoy) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding sonar equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location. = Site survey = Side-scan sonar image of shipwreck Aid in Estonia. The type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post- industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded. The simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional surveying by divers using depth gauges and tape measurements. Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land. Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface. The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning. ROV technology was used during the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project. The \\"Mardi Gras Shipwreck\\" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. Remote sensing or Marine Geophysics is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site. Sensitive sonar, especially side-scan sonar or multi-beam sonarMultibeam sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology as part of ALSF funded \\"Wrecks on the Seabed\\" project may be used to image an underwater site. MagnetometryMagnetometry evaluated by Wessex Archaeology as part of ALSF funded \\"Wrecks on the Seabed\\" project can be used to locate metal remains such as metal shipwrecks, anchors and cannon. Sub-bottom profilingSub-bottom profiling sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology as part of ALSF funded \\"Wrecks on the Seabed\\" projectSub-bottom profile investigation of the Grace Dieu from The University of Southampton utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment. = Recording = LAMP archaeologist recording a scaled drawing of the ship's bell discovered on the late 18th century \\"Storm Wreck\\" off St. Augustine, Florida A variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. Scale drawing is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic dive slates, or matt laminated paper. Photography and videography are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites. = Excavation = Where intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process. = Archaeological science = A variety of archaeological sciences are used in underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea. = Artifact recovery and conservation = Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation. The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of The Mary Rose). Artifacts recovered from salt water, particularly metals and glass need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. In-situ conservation of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration. = Interpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology = Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-divinge.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. & Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York. One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) \\"Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.\\" The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the QAR DiveLive educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.  History   Publications  Publication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ. The specialist journals on maritime archaeology, which include the long established International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA) and the recently launched Journal of Maritime Archaeology publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology. However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals. Some institutions also make their unpublished reports, often called 'Grey Literature', accessible thereby allowing access to far more detail and a wider range of archaeological data than is otherwise the case with books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum. The public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of Jacques Cousteau. The techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks,Archaeology Underwater, The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice; eds Martin dean, Ben Ferrari, Ian Oxley, Mark Redknap and Kit Watson. Published by Nautical Archaeology Society, Archetype Press, 1992 and Muckelroy's classic work on Maritime Archaeology.

Typical choices include monarchs, important figures of history, politicians, cultural leaders, and (more recently) celebrities. The usual practice is for the stamp to feature a portrait of the person, either full- length or head alone. In a few cases, the person being honored is represented by an image relating to the person's life. However, the depiction of a work of art (such as for a Christmas stamp) is not considered to be honoring the artist. The list that follows is an index to the lists of people for individual countries. In some cases, several short lists from related countries are merged into a single list, while entries without links indicate entities that never had any people on their stamps. The parenthesized dates following each entry indicates the first and last dates of stamp issuance; within each country's list, the date or dates indicates the year of the person's appearance on a stamp.

Jason"},{"id":"51803","text":"Azotemia (azot, \\"nitrogen\\" + -emia, \\"blood condition\\") is a medical condition characterized by abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood. It is largely related to insufficient or dysfunctional filtering of blood by the kidneys. It can lead to uremia and acute kidney injury (kidney failure) if not controlled. Signs and symptoms * Oliguria or anuria (decreased or absent urine output) * Fatigue * Asterixis (flapping tremor) * Decreased alertness * Confusion * Pale skin * Tachycardia (rapid pulse) * Xerostomia (dry mouth) * Thirst * Edema, anasarca (swelling) * Orthostatic blood pressure (fluctuates depending on body position) * Uremic frost, a condition that occurs when urea and urea derivatives are secreted through the skin in sweat, which evaporates away to leave solid uric compounds, resembling a frost. A urinalysis will typically show a decreased urine sodium level, a high urine creatinine-to-serum creatinine ratio, a high urine urea-to-serum urea ratio, and concentrated urine (determined by osmolality and specific gravity). None of these is particularly useful in diagnosis. In pre-renal and post-renal azotemias, elevation of the BUN exceeds that of the creatinine (i.e., BUN>12*creatinine). This is because BUN is readily reabsorbed by the kidneys while creatinine is not. In congestive heart failure (a cause of pre-renal azotemia) or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys, the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of BUN and elevation of its value in blood. Creatinine, however, is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly. Stasis of urine in post-renal azotemia has the same effect. Types Azotemia has three classifications, depending on its causative origin: prerenal azotemia, renal azotemia, and postrenal azotemia. The BUN:Cr ratio is a useful measure in determining the type of azotemia and will be discussed in each section below. A normal BUN:Cr is equal to 15. =Prerenal azotemia= Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal artery among other things. The BUN:Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of BUN and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a proportional decrease in GFR. In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent arteriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal artery) baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through Œ≤ 1 -receptors. Constriction of the afferent arterioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR proportionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule. A decrease in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity. = Primary renal azotemia = Renal azotemia (acute kidney failure) typically leads to uremia. It is an intrinsic disease of the kidney, generally the result of kidney parenchymal damage. Causes include kidney failure, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or other kidney disease. The BUN:Cr in renal azotemia is less than 15. In cases of kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate decreases, so nothing gets filtered as well as it normally would. However, in addition to not being normally filtered, what urea does get filtered is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule as it normally would be. This results in lower levels of urea in the blood and higher levels of urea in the urine as compared to creatinine. Creatinine filtration decreases, leading to a higher amount of creatinine in the blood. Third spacing of fluids such as peritonitis, osmotic diuresis, or low aldosterone states such as Addison's disease all elevate urea. =Postrenal azotemia= Blockage of urine flow in an area below the kidneys results in postrenal azotemia. It can be caused by congenital abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, blockage of the ureters by kidney stones, pregnancy, compression of the ureters by cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, or blockage of the urethra by kidney or bladder stones. Like in prerenal azotemia, there is no inherent renal disease. The increased resistance to urine flow can cause back up into the kidneys, leading to hydronephrosis. The BUN:Cr in postrenal azotemia is initially >15. The increased nephron tubular pressure (due to fluid back-up) causes increased reabsorption of urea, elevating it abnormally relative to creatinine. Persistent obstruction damages the tubular epithelium over time, and renal azotemia will result with a decreased BUN:Cr ratio. Treatment Prompt treatment of some causes of azotemia can result in restoration of kidney function; delayed treatment may result in permanent loss of renal function. Treatment may include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, medications to increase cardiac output and increase blood pressure, and the treatment of the condition that caused the azotemia.

It operates from inside the Department of Defense, but is editorially separate from it, and its First Amendment protection is safeguarded by the United States Congress to whom an independent ombudsman, who serves the readers' interests, regularly reports. As well as a website, Stars and Stripes publishes four daily print editions for the military service members serving overseas; these European, Middle Eastern, Japanese, and South Korean editions are also available as free downloads in electronic format, and there are also seven digital editions.

Retrieved on October 12, 2010. \\"529 14th Street NW, Suite 350, Washington, D.C. 20045-1301.\\"  History  = Creation = On November 9, 1861, during the Civil War, soldiers of the 11th, 18th, and 29th Illinois Regiments set up camp in the Missouri city of Bloomfield. Finding the local newspaper's office empty, they decided to print a newspaper about their activities. They called it the Stars and Stripes. Tradition holds this as the origin story for the newspaper, and the Stars and Stripes Museum/Library Association is located in Bloomfield. = World War I = The last issue of the WWI Stars and Stripes on June 13, 1919 1918-July 18  A Stars and Stripes illustration by Cyrus LeRoy Baldridge During World War I, the staff, roving reporters, and illustrators of the Stars and Stripes were veteran reporters or young soldiers who would later become such in the post-war years. It was published by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) from February 8, 1918, to June 13, 1919. Harold Ross, editor of the Stars and Stripes, returned home to found The New Yorker magazine. Cyrus Baldridge, its art director and principal illustrator, became a major illustrator of books and magazines, as well as a writer, print maker and stage designer. Sports page editor Grantland Rice had a long career in journalism and founded a motion picture studio called Grantland Rice Sportlight. Drama critic Alexander Woollcott's essays for Stars and Stripes were collected in his 1919 book, The Command Is Forward. The Stars and Stripes was then an eight-page weekly which reached a peak of 526,000 readers, relying on the improvisational efforts of its staff to get it printed in France and distributed to U.S. troops. = World War II = Hitler's death. During World War II, the newspaper was printed in dozens of editions in several operating theaters. Again, both newspapermen in uniform and young soldiers, some of whom would later become important journalists, filled the staffs and showed zeal and talent in publishing and delivering the paper on time. Some of the editions were assembled and printed very close to the front in order to get the latest information to the most troops. Also, during the war, the newspaper published the 53-book series G.I. Stories. After Bill Mauldin did his popular \\"Up Front\\" cartoons for the World War II Stars and Stripes, he returned home to a successful career as an editorial cartoonist and two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and war correspondent Ernie Pyle was regularly published in Stars and Stripes before he was killed by a Japanese machine-gunner on Iejima during the Battle of Okinawa. The magazine frequently posted photographs of a young Marilyn Monroe, then known as Norma Jeane Dougherty which later led her as being named 'Miss Cheesecake 1952' by \\"Stars & Stripes\\" magazine. = Modern era = Stars and Stripes being delivered to US troops, 2003. Funding and relevance in the digital age have threatened the paper's budget. In 2013, the paper faced job cuts, printing-schedule changes, a pay-raise freeze and travel limitations for staff under the Federal budget sequestration. The print newspapers provide the news back home to service members who are forward- deployed in areas lacking reliable internet access. Coverage of pay and benefits is of direct concern to service members and their families along with life on base and in the field. The paper helps them be better-informed citizens about global geopolitics. Budget cuts by the Pentagon were again considered in 2016. The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2020, that a draft budget would reduce the newspaper's federal support in 2021 under a $5 billion shift to higher priorities in the defense budget. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker indicated its funding would be cut and said: ‚ÄúWe have essentially decided that, you know, kind of coming into the modern age that newspaper is probably not the best way that we communicate any longer.‚Äù The subsidy is more than $15 million a year, which represents approximately half the publication's budget and roughly 0.002 percent of the Department of Defense budget, which was $721,500 million in 2020. It was described by the Stars and Stripes ombudsman as \\"a fatal cut‚Äù. In September, Defense Secretary Mark Esper justifies the decision to discontinue publication of the paper as a result of his department-wide budget review. An order for the newspaper to shutter was issued, specifically by presenting a plan for it to dissolve by September 15, including \\"specific timeline for vacating government owned/leased space worldwide\\" and to end publication by September 30, 2020. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) led a bipartisan group opposed to the move, including Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a veteran, and Susan Collins (R-ME). On September 4, Trump appeared to reverse his position by tweeting that funding would not be cut. Operations Stars and Stripes is authorized by Congress and the US Department of Defense to produce independent daily military news and information distributed at U.S. military installations in Europe and Mideast and East Asia. A weekly derivative product is distributed within the United States by its commercial publishing partners. Stars and Stripes newspaper averages 32 pages each day and is published in tabloid format and online at www.stripes.com/epaper. With the website, a social media presence and a couple of podcasts, it is a modern multimedia operation. Stars and Stripes employs civilian reporters, and U.S. military senior non- commissioned officers as reporters, at a number of locations around the world and on any given day has an audience just shy of 1.0 million. Stars and Stripes also serves independent military news and information to an online audience of about 2.0 million unique visitors per month, 60 to 70 percent of whom are located in the United States. Stars and Stripes is a non-appropriated fund (NAF) organization, only partially subsidized by the Department of Defense. A large portion of its operating costs is earned through the sale of advertising and subscriptions but it relies on government funding to back overseas reporting and distribution. Unique among the many military publications, Stars and Stripes operates as a First Amendment newspaper and is part of the newly formed Defense Media Activity. The other entities encompassed by the Defense Media Activity (the DoD News Channel and Armed Forces Radio and Television Service, for example), are command publications of the Department of Defense; only Stars and Stripes maintains complete editorial independence. Stars and Stripes is in the process of digitizing its World War II editions. Newspaper microfilm from 1949 to 1999 is now in searchable format through a partnership with Heritage Microfilm and has been integrated into an archives website. Newspaper Archive has also more recently made the England, Ireland and Mediterranean editions from World War II available. Former staffers The newspaper has been published continuously in Europe since 1942 and in the Pacific since 1945. Notable former Stars and Stripes staffers include: CBS 60 Minutes Andy Rooney and Steve Kroft; songwriter and author Shel Silverstein; comic book illustrator Tom Sutton; authors Gustav Hasford and Ralph G. Martin; painter and cartoonist Paul Fontaine; author and television news correspondent Tony Zappone; cartoonist Vernon Grant (A Monster Is Loose in Tokyo); Hollywood photographer Phil Stern; and stock market reporter and host of public television's Wall Street Week, Louis Rukeyser, and the first and only Black reporter in WWII, Allen Morrison. In popular culture A photograph in Stars and Stripes loosely inspired the exploits of PFC Jack Agnew in the 1965 novel and its 1967 film adaptation, The Dirty Dozen. American comic strips have been presented in a 15-page section, Stripes' Sunday Comics. Sergeant Joker and Private First Class Rafterman from Full Metal Jacket were war correspondent and combat photographer from Stars and Stripes in Da Nang.

He joined the Nazi party in 1928 and was the Gauleiter of North Westphalia from 1931 to 1945, the Oberpr√§sident of the Province of Westphalia from 1938 to 1945 and the Reichsstatthalter of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe from 1933 to 1945. By the time of his death at the end of World War II in Europe, he was a State Secretary and Deputy Reichsminister in the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (Reichministerium f√ºr die Besetzten Ostgebiete or Ostministerium). He represented the ministry with Georg Leibbrandt in the Wannsee Conference. Meyer committed suicide in April 1945.  Early life  Meyer was born in G√∂ttingen, the son of a Prussian civil servant who was stationed in G√∂ttingen due to his official duties. The middle-class family was originally from Essen. He was educated at the Gymnasium in Soest, graduating in 1911. In 1912 he became a Fahnenjunker (cadet officer) with Infanterieregiment 68 (Koblenz), passing his officer exam in 1913 and being promoted to lieutenant. During World War I he fought with Infanterieregiment 363 on the Western Front, earning the Iron Cross First and Second Class and the Wound Badge. In 1917 he was injured and captured by the French. This experience, according to Meyer, was especially traumatic and left him with a hatred against France. Released from captivity in March 1920, the downsized Reichswehr had no use for him and he left the army with the rank of Hauptmann (Captain). After the war, Meyer studied jurisprudence and political science at the Universities of Bonn and then W√ºrzburg. He graduated with a Ph.D. in 1922 and joined the legal department of a Gelsenkirchen mining firm. In 1924, he joined the local Masonic lodge. Meyer was also the chairman of the local Kyffh√§userbund unit. He married Dorothee Capell in 1925 and had five daughters with her.  Third Reich  In April 1928, Meyer joined the Nazi Party. The party was still extremely weak in Westphalia during the late 1920s, and had only circa three hundred members in the city of Gelsenkirchen during this period. In less than a year Meyer rose to the position of Ortsgruppenleiter (\\"local group leader\\") and in November 1929 he was promoted to Bezirksleiter (\\"district leader\\") of the Emscher-Lippe district within Westphalia. In November 1929, he was also elected as the only Nazi party representative to the Gelsenkirchen city council. In September 1930 he became a member of the Reichstag and on 31 January 1931 NSDAP Gauleiter in north Westphalia. On 14 September 1932, he was elected to the Prussian Landtag. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Meyer was appointed federal Reichsstatthalter (Governor) of the German States of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe on 16 May 1933. He also was made Staatsminister (Minister of State) in the state governments of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe effective 1 February 1936. Finally, on 4 November 1938 he was made Oberpr√§sident of the Prussian Province of Westphalia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in all his jurisdictions. He was promoted to SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer on 20 April 1936 and to SA- Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 9 November 1938.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust). R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, pp. 91-93 . On 6 September 1939, Meyer was made Chef der Zivilverwaltung (Chief of Civil Administration) in the West. On 29 May 1940 he was appointed Acting Reich Defense Commissioner for Military District VI during the absence in Norway of Josef Terboven. On 17 July 1941 he became State Secretary and Deputy to Alfred Rosenberg in the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. Meyer was responsible for the departments of politics, administration and economics. In his role in the East, he used workers that were mainly Jewish for slave labor assigned to a variety of works. Meyer attended the Wannsee Conference in January 1942 as a representative for Rosenberg. on 16 November that year, he was also made Reichsverteidigungskommissar (Reich Defence Commissioner) for his Gau Westphalia-North.  Death  Meyer was found dead on 11 April 1945, by the River Weser. The cause of death was suicide, most likely prompted by Germany's impending defeat in the war.  Fictional portrayals  In the 2001 HBO film Conspiracy, Meyer was played by Brian Pettifer.

There, his company was responsible for a variety of successful aircraft including the Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor, a successful passenger aircraft of the inter-war years. He died in New York in 1939. Later authors suggest he was personally charismatic but unscrupulous in business and a controversial character. Early life Anthony (Tony) Fokker was born in Blitar, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), to Herman Fokker, a Dutch coffee plantation owner. Some sources say that he was born in Kediri. At that time, Blitar was a part of the \\"Kediri Residency\\", a colonial administrative division the capital of which was Kediri. When Fokker was four, the family returned to the Netherlands and settled in Haarlem in order to provide Fokker and his older sister, Toos, with a Dutch upbringing. Fokker was not a studious boy and did not complete his high school education. However, he showed an early interest in mechanics, and preferred making things, playing with model trains and steam engines, and experimenting with model aeroplane designs. He devoted considerable effort to the development of a wheel that would not suffer from punctures, basically a wheel with a perimeter formed by a series of metal plates. Move to Germany  Fokker in de Spin Grote Kerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911 Fokker's first interest in flight stemmed from Wilbur Wright's exhibition flights in France in the summer and fall of 1908. In 1910, aged 20, Fokker was sent by his father to Germany to receive training as an automobile mechanic at Bingen Technical school, but his interest was in flying, so he transferred to the Erste deutsche Automobil-Fachschule in Mainz.van Weezepoel, Paul. \\"Anthony Fokker Biography.\\" dutch-aviation.nl. Retrieved: 15 August 2010. That same year Fokker built his first aircraft \\"de Spin\\" (\\"the Spider\\"), which was destroyed by his business partner who flew it into a tree. He gained his flying certificate in his second \\"Spin\\" aircraft, which shortly thereafter was also destroyed by the same business partner, prompting Fokker to end their cooperation. In his own country, he became a celebrity by flying around the tower of the Grote or St.-Bavokerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911, with the third version of the \\"Spin\\". One day earlier, on Queen's Day (31 August, Queen Wilhelmina's birthday), Fokker had already taken the opportunity to make a couple of demonstration flights in Haarlem in the same aircraft. In 1912, Fokker moved to Johannisthal near Berlin where he founded his first own company, Fokker Aeroplanbau. In the following years he constructed a variety of aircraft. He relocated his factory to Schwerin where it was renamed Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH, and later shortened to Fokker Werke GmbH. Involvement in World War I At the outbreak of World War I the German government took control of the factory. Fokker remained as director and alleged designer of many aircraft for the Imperial German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkr√§fte), including the Fokker Eindecker and the Fokker Dr.I, the triplane made famous in the hands of aces such as Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). In all, his company delivered about 700 military aircraft to the German air force as well as supplying the German navy and Austria-Hungary. Fokker himself was a skilled pilot, demonstrating his aircraft on many occasions. On 13 June 1915, Fokker demonstrated the new Eindecker (monoplane) at Stenay in the German 5th Army Sector in front of the German Crown Prince and other VIPs. Fokker worked closely with an accomplished military pilot, Otto Parschau, to bring the Eindecker into military use and on this occasion both men demonstrated the aircraft. Max Immelmann, later to become a high- scoring Flying Ace with the Eindecker, commented in a letter written shortly after this event on 25 June 1915 that: \\"Fokker, especially, amazed us with his skill\\". Author A.R. Weyl (Fokker: the creative years, Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits back into his factory which consequently struggled to fulfill war contracts as the factory floor was often muddled with prototype development and production taking place at the same time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not), and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive, as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed, but Kreuzer was able to give a verbal report on the accident before he died. \\"Fokker hurried to the scene, and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man\\". Weyl says this incident was witnessed by Reinhold Platz, who succeeded Kreuzer. While Weyl's biography paints an unpleasant picture of Fokker as a businessman, he was a popular and charismatic figure with service pilots, and could charm even senior officers. This charm enabled him to deal with the first major crisis of his German career when his newly delivered Fokker Dr.I triplanes began to experience sudden fatal accidents in late 1917, and the type was temporarily grounded as too dangerous to fly. The triplanes' top wings frequently ripped off under aerobatic conditions and even Lothar von Richthofen (brother of Manfred) was lucky to survive one such crash. Fokker was able to prove to the German high command that the basic design was not at fault, but the German military inquiry concluded that shoddy workmanship due to poor supervision and quality control at the Fokker factory were to blame. Fokker received a stern warning about future conduct. Unfortunately the same scenario repeated itself a few months later, with the introduction of his E.V/D.VIII monoplane in mid-1918. A further high level German inquiry revealed more production and workmanship issues. Weyl asserts that the German authorities were now willing to file criminal charges against Fokker, and might have done so, had he not returned to the Netherlands shortly after the end of World War I. Fokker's own account of the D.VIII places the blame on officious German Air Force inspectors requiring an ill-conceived design change. \\"When the first D-8[sic] was submitted to the engineering division to be sandload tested, the wings proved to be sufficiently strong, but the regulations called for a proportionate strength in the rear spar compared to the front spar... Complying with the government's edict, we strengthened the rear spar and started to produce in quantity...\\" The D.VIIIs immediately ran into trouble with the wing collapsing at high speed. Fokker recalled the aircraft for further testing, and successfully demonstrated that the reinforced rear spar caused the wings to flex unevenly at speed, increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips and causing the wing to shear apart under the increased loads. The problem was resolved by restoring the rear spar to its original specifications. Weyl also discusses claims of Fokker's outright plagiarism or taking sole credit for the work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as 'the designer' but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker's behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz really did play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz's role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is based on the fact that Platz was still alive to tell his side of the story in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear. Another book by Henri Hegener (who knew both Fokker and Platz personally) depicts a rather different story, saying that Platz, while a skilled craftsman (and excellent welder), had received no formal technical training, and that his contributions to the Fokker designs are exaggerated, although Hegener grants that Platz was a good \\"rule of thumb\\" designer. Hegener also contradicts the claims that Platz was treated badly by Fokker, at least not financially because Platz's year-end bonuses often exceeded his yearly salary. The interrupter gear Fokker is often credited with having invented the synchronization device which enabled World War I aircraft to fire through the spinning propeller. His role was certainly significant, but there were a number of prior developments before the result was achieved for which Fokker is commonly credited. The famous French pilot Roland Garros was shot down on 18 April 1915. His aircraft had been fitted with a deflector device, whereby metal deflector wedges were fitted to the airscrew. Garros was able to set fire to the airframe before being taken prisoner but the aircraft's gun and the armoured propeller remained intact and came into German hands.van Wyngarden, G. Early German Aces of World War 1. Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing, 2006. . This initiated a phase of consideration of the interrupter gear concept in the Imperial German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkr√§fte). Fokker was heavily involved in this process but the story of his conception, development and installation of a synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorized biography of Fokker written in 1929) has been shown to be not factual. The available evidence points to a synchronisation device having been in development with Fokker's company for perhaps six months prior to the capture of Garros' machine. Additionally there were patents filed in France, Germany and Austria-Hungary as far back as 1910 which show a very similar device to that pioneered by Fokker. Author A. J. Weyl suggests that Fokker ‚Äì or more probably someone on his production team ‚Äì was aware of these patents. One patentee, Franz Schneider and his employer LVG, later sued Fokker in the German courts and won their case; but Fokker (by now in America) refused to pay up. However, the final result of the development was Fokker's pushrod control mechanism, Gest√§ngesteuerung, which allowed the aircraft's forward-firing machine gun to fire only when the propeller was out of the line of fire. As incorporated into the famous Fokker Eindecker, its use directly led to a phase of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge. Despite its shock effect on the enemy, the first Fokker interrupters remained unreliable and were prone to failures. Both Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann survived failures which resulted in propellers being shot off and even engines pulled out of their mountings due to the engine becoming unbalanced by the loss of the propeller. Immelmann's eventual death in combat has also been attributed to interrupter gear failure as the aircraft was seen to break up in mid-air while engaged against a Royal Flying Corps F.E.2b.  Other works on aircraft armament  Fokker and his armament team, including L√ºbbe and Leimberger, also worked on lesser known projects, including a multi-barrelled machine gun, known as the Fokker-Leimberger.\\"Motor Guns-A flashback to 1914‚Äì18\\", Flight, 8 March 1957, pp. 313‚Äì314 Although superficially similar to a Gatling, the action of the Fokker-Leimberger was substantially different. Problems with the gun, especially with ruptured cases, prevented its adoption into production during the war.Anthony G Williams (8 November 2005), SPLIT BREECH GUNS: THE NUTCRACKER AND THE 40MM MK 18 . quarry.nildram.co.uk After moving to the US, Fokker continued to work on the design, but he was ultimately unsuccessful‚Äîproperly sealing the rotary split-breech was apparently very difficult. A single surviving prototype is known today at the Kentucky Military Treasures.Gun, Machine . Kentucky Historical Society Return to the Netherlands Fokker in the Netherlands in 1934 After the war's end, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build any aircraft or aircraft engines. The Armistice, not the Treaty of Versailles, singled out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be so named. In 1919, Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the Fokker Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the Treaty, Fokker did not return home empty- handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains' worth of D.VII and C.I military aircraft and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This initial stock enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor. Fokker's admitted bribery has contributed to his reputation for sharp business practices. Weyl also points out that ‚Äì in addition to possible criminal charges for the Fokker D.VIII fatal crashes ‚Äì Fokker also failed to pay taxes to German authorities, and actually owed more than 14 million marks. Fokker's autobiography tells a similar story, but focuses on the rampant corruption, hyper-inflation, economic meltdown, and violent revolutionary forces of the pre-Weimar days. According to Fokker's account, as WWI progressed, the German High Command became increasingly brazen, even forcing Fokker into German citizenship against his will. Fokker describes his escape from Germany as a harrowing tale in which he protected as many workers as possible and escaped with less than a quarter of his net worth. He takes pains to rebuff the claim that he left the country owing any taxes. Personal life Time cover, 31 Dec 1923 On 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgen in Haarlem. This marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Eastman in New York City. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to 'vertigo victim' at the request of her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, \\"I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more\\". Move to the US and death Fokker's grave in Driehuis In or about 1926 or 1927, Fokker moved to the United States. Here he established the North American branch of his company, the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. The company gained high visibility in daring exploits by pilots. The Fokker F.VII aircraft was used by pilot Richard E. Byrd and Machinist Floyd Bennett to fly over or near the North Pole on 9 May 1926. In June 1928, Amelia Earhart crossed the Atlantic to Wales in a Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor (details here), and in 1930 Charles Kingsford Smith circumnavigated the globe in another. However the reputation was hurt when the famous Notre Dame University football coach Knute Rockne was killed in a crash of a Fokker F.10A in March 1931. Fokker's Dutch and American companies were at the peak of their success in the late 1920s, but he lost control by going public to sell stock. In 1929, General Motors took over Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America, and merged it in the General Aviation Corporation. Fokker was appointed director of engineering. He resigned in 1931. Fokker designs were increasing outdated and in 1934 General Aviation discontinued their production. They were still built in the Netherlands. Neville Shute in 1934 negotiated with Fokker for a manufacturing licensing agreement for Airspeed Ltd (England), and found him genial, shrewd and helpful but already a sick man; and he was difficult to deal with as his domestic life was irregular. He worked at all hours and in strange places. Frequently his very efficient legal advisor and secretary could not tell us where he was. Shute said he was a good chooser of men and had a most efficient staff of Dutchmen and ex-Germans. Fokker died at age 49 in New York in 1939 from pneumococcal meningitis, after a three-week-long illness. In 1940, his ashes were brought to Westerveld Cemetery in Driehuis, North Holland, where they were buried in the family grave. In 1970, Fokker was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . Popular culture Fokker's nickname was The Flying Dutchman.Fokker, Anthony and Bruce Gould. Flying Dutchman: The Life of Anthony Fokker. London: George Routledge, 1931. In popular media, Hurd Hatfield portrayed him in the 1971 film Von Richthofen and Brown and the character Roy Fokker from the animated series Macross was named in honor of Anthony Fokker. Fokker is portrayed by Craig Kelly in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles: Attack of the Hawkmen. See also * Jan Hilgers References Bibliography * Boyne, Walter J.

The Dr.I saw widespread service in the spring of 1918. It became famous as the aircraft in which Manfred von Richthofen gained his last 19 victories, and in which he was killed on 21 April 1918. Design and development Fokker V.4 prototype In February 1917, the Sopwith Triplane began to appear over the Western Front.Franks 2004, p. 9. Despite its single Vickers machine gun armament, the Sopwith swiftly proved itself superior to the more heavily armed Albatros fighters then in use by the Luftstreitkr√§fte.Franks 2004, p. 21.Leaman 2003, pp. 30, 32. In April 1917, Anthony Fokker viewed a captured Sopwith Triplane while visiting Jasta 11. Upon his return to the Schwerin factory, Fokker instructed Reinhold Platz to build a triplane, but gave him no further information about the Sopwith design.Weyl 1965, p.223. Platz responded with the V.4, a small, rotary-powered triplane with a steel tube fuselage and thick cantilever wings,Leaman 2003, p. 34. first developed during Fokker's government-mandated collaboration with Hugo Junkers. Initial tests revealed that the V.4 had unacceptably high control forces resulting from the use of unbalanced ailerons and elevators.Weyl 1965, p. 226. Instead of submitting the V.4 for a type test, Fokker produced a revised prototype designated V.5. The most notable changes were the introduction of horn-balanced ailerons and elevators, as well as longer-span wings. The V.5 also featured interplane struts, which were not necessary from a structural standpoint, but which minimized wing flexing.Weyl 1965, p. 228. On 14 July 1917, Idflieg issued an order for 20 pre-production aircraft. The V.5 prototype, serial 101/17, was tested to destruction at Adlershof on 11 August 1917.Weyl 1965, p. 229. Operational history Jasta 12 flightline at Toulis, France Jasta 26 at Erchin, France The first two pre-production triplanes were designated F.I, in accord with Idflieg's early class prefix for triplanes. These aircraft, serials 102/17 and 103/17, were the only machines to receive the F.I designationWeyl 1965, p. 231. and could be distinguished from subsequent aircraft by a slight convex curve of the tailplane's leading edge. The two aircraft were sent to Jastas 10 and 11 for combat evaluation, arriving at Markebeeke, Belgium on 28 August 1917. Richthofen first flew 102/17 on 1 September 1917 and shot down two enemy aircraft in the next two days. He reported to the Kogenluft (Kommandierender General der Luftstreitkr√§fte) that the F.I was superior to the Sopwith Triplane.Weyl 1965, p. 232. Richthofen recommended that fighter squadrons be reequipped with the new aircraft as soon as possible.Weyl 1965, p. 232. The combat evaluation came to an abrupt conclusion when Oberleutnant Kurt Wolff, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 11, was shot down in 102/17 on 15 September, and Leutnant Werner Voss, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 10, was killed in 103/17 on 23 September. The remaining pre-production aircraft, designated Dr.I, were delivered to Jasta 11.Leaman 2003, p. 53. Idflieg issued a production order for 100 triplanes in September, followed by an order for 200 in November.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 22. Apart from the straight leading edge of the tailplane, these aircraft were almost identical to the F.I. The primary distinguishing feature was the addition of wingtip skids, which proved necessary because the aircraft was tricky to land and prone to ground looping.Leaman 2003, p. 96. In October, Fokker began delivering the Dr.I to squadrons within Richthofen's Jagdgeschwader I. Compared with the Albatros and Pfalz fighters, the Dr.I offered exceptional maneuverability. Though the ailerons were not very effective, the rudder and elevator controls were light and powerful.Leaman 2003, p. 95. Rapid turns, especially to the right, were facilitated by the triplane's marked directional instability.Leaman 2003, p. 95. Vizefeldwebel Franz Hemer of Jasta 6 said, \\"The triplane was my favorite fighting machine because it had such wonderful flying qualities. I could let myself stunt ‚Äì looping and rolling ‚Äì and could avoid an enemy by diving with perfect safety. The triplane had to be given up because although it was very maneuverable, it was no longer fast enough.\\"VanWyngarden 2004, p. 75. Manfred von Richthofen's red Dr.I, serial 425/17 As Hemer noted, the Dr.I was considerably slower than contemporary Allied fighters in level flight and in a dive. While initial rate of climb was excellent, performance fell off dramatically at higher altitudes because of the low compression of the Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rh√¥ne 9J rotary engine.Nowarra 1990, p. 12. As the war continued, chronic shortages of castor oil made rotary operation increasingly difficult. The poor quality of German ersatz lubricant resulted in many engine failures, particularly during the summer of 1918.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 83. The Dr.I suffered other deficiencies. The pilot's view was poor during takeoff and landing.Weyl 1965, p. 245. The cockpit was cramped and furnished with materials of inferior quality.Weyl 1965, pp. 244‚Äì245. Furthermore, the proximity of the gun butts to the cockpit, combined with inadequate crash padding, left the pilot vulnerable to serious head injury in the event of a crash landing.Weyl 1965, p. 410. =Wing failures= Heinrich Gontermann's wrecked Dr.I On 29 October 1917, Leutnant der Reserve Heinrich Gontermann, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 15, was performing aerobatics when his triplane broke up.Weyl 1965, p. 233. Gontermann was killed in the ensuing crash landing. Leutnant der Reserve G√ºnther Pastor of Jasta 11 was killed two days later when his triplane broke up in level flight.Weyl 1965, p. 233. Inspection of the wrecked aircraft showed that the wings had been poorly constructed. Examination of other high-time triplanes confirmed these findings. On 2 November, Idflieg grounded all remaining triplanes pending an inquiry. Idflieg convened a Sturzkommission (crash commission) which concluded that poor construction and lack of waterproofing had allowed moisture to damage the wing structure.Weyl 1965, pp. 233‚Äì234. This caused the wing ribs to disintegrate and the ailerons to break away in flight.Weyl 1965, pp. 233‚Äì234. In response to the crash investigation, Fokker was forced to improve quality control on the production line, particularly varnishing of the wing spars and ribs, to combat moisture. Fokker also strengthened the rib structures and the attachment of the auxiliary spars to the ribs.Weyl 1965, pp. 236, 239. Existing triplanes were repaired and modified at Fokker's expense.Weyl 1965, p. 235. After testing a modified wing at Adlershof, Idflieg authorized the triplane's return to service on 28 November 1917.Weyl 1965, pp. 238‚Äì239. Production resumed in early December. By January 1918, Jastas 6 and 11 were fully equipped with the triplane. Only 14 squadrons used the Dr.I as their primary equipment. Most of these units were part of Jagdgeschwadern I, II, or III.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 55. Frontline inventory peaked in late April 1918, with 171 aircraft in service on the Western Front. Despite corrective measures, the Dr.I continued to suffer from wing failures. On 3 February 1918, Leutnant Hans Joachim Wolff of Jasta 11 successfully landed after suffering a failure of the upper wing leading edge and ribs.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 25. On 18 March 1918, Lothar von Richthofen, Staffelf√ºhrer of Jasta 11, suffered a failure of the upper wing leading edge during combat with Sopwith Camels of No. 73 Squadron and Bristol F.2Bs of No. 62 Squadron.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, pp. 26‚Äì27. Richthofen was seriously injured in the ensuing crash landing. Postwar research revealed that poor workmanship was not the only cause of the triplane's structural failures. In 1929, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) investigations found that the upper wing carried a higher lift coefficient than the lower wing ‚Äì at high speeds it could be 2.55 times as much. The triplane's chronic structural problems destroyed any prospect of large-scale orders.Weyl 1965, p. 236. Production eventually ended in May 1918, by which time only 320 had been manufactured.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 100. The Dr.I was withdrawn from frontline service as the Fokker D.VII entered widespread service in June and July. Jasta 19 was the last squadron to be fully equipped with the Dr.I.Leaman 2003, p. 69. Surviving triplanes were distributed to training and home defense units. Several training aircraft were reengined with the 75 kW (100 hp) Goebel Goe.II.Leaman 2003, p. 222. At the time of the Armistice, many remaining triplanes were assigned to fighter training schools at Nivelles, Belgium, and Valenciennes, France.Weyl 1965, p. 246. Allied pilots tested several of these triplanes and found their handling qualities to be impressive.Weyl 1965, p. 246. One of Richthofen's Fokker Dr.Is, on display at the Zeughaus =Experimental engines= Several Dr.Is were used as testbeds for experimental engines. One aircraft, designated V.7, was fitted with the Siemens-Halske Sh.III bi-rotary engine.Weyl 1965, p. 248. The V.7 exhibited exceptional rate of climb and ceiling, but it proved difficult to handle.Weyl 1965, p. 248. Serial 108/17 was used to test the 118 kW (160 hp) Goebel Goe. III, while serial 469/17 was used to test the 108 kW (145 hp) Oberursel Ur. III.Weyl 1965, pp. 249‚Äì250. None of these engines were used on production aircraft. One triplane was used as a testbed for an experimental Schwade gear- driven supercharger. Postwar Three triplanes are known to have survived the Armistice. Serial 528/17 was retained as a testbed by the Deutschen Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt (German Aviation Research Institute) at Adlershof. After being used in the filming of two movies, 528/17 is believed to have crashed sometime in the late 1930s.Leaman 2003, p. 181. Serial 152/17, in which Manfred von Richthofen obtained three victories, was displayed at the Zeughaus museum in Berlin.Leaman 2003, p. 181. This aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid during World War II. In 1932, Fokker assembled a Dr.I from existing components. It was displayed in the Deutsche Luftfahrt-Sammlung in Berlin. In 1943, the aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. Today, only a few original Dr.I artifacts survive in museums. Replica and reproduction aircraft Dr.I replica at Filton Aerodrome, United Kingdom Replica of Richthofen's Dr.I at the Berlin Air Show in 2006 Large numbers of replica and reproduction aircraft have been built for both individuals and museums. Bitz Flugzeugbau GmbH built two Dr.I replicas for use in Twentieth Century Fox‚Äôs 1966 film The Blue Max.

The size and shape have been determined from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting. The amphora complements the large storage container, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than . The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters. Stoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the neck amphora, in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the one-piece amphora, in which the neck and body form a continuous curve upwards. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward. Most were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines. Amphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with calcium hydroxide (calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, high and more than 1 kilometre in circumference. Etymology Amphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in ancient Greek during the Bronze Age. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the Roman Republic. Cato is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard -a declension noun, amphora, pl. amphorae. Undoubtedly, the word and the vase were introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery. It is remarkable that even though the Etruscans imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of amphora. left The Latin word derived from the Greek amphoreus (),. a shortened form of amphiphoreus (), a compound word combining amphi- (\\"on both sides\\", \\"twain\\"). and phoreus (\\"carrier\\"), from pherein (\\"to carry\\"),, . referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides. The amphora appears as , a-pi-po-re-we, in the Linear B Bronze Age records of Knossos, , a-po-re-we, at Mycenae, and the fragmentary ]-re-we at Pylos, designated by , Bennett's AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorƒìwes (plural) and amphorƒìwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is \\"carried on both sides.\\" Weights and measures Dressel 1B type amphora Key : 1: rim; 2: neck; 3: handle; 4: shoulder; 5: belly or body; 6: foot Amphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as 1.5 metres (5 ft) high, while some were less than 30 centimetres (12 in) high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi (literally \\"little amphorae\\"). Most were around 45 centimetres (18 in) high. There was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified. Further, the term also stands for an ancient Roman unit of measurement for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora was one cubic foot, c. 26.026 L. Production Roman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially. Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids.Rizzo 2003, 141. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean. Amphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, sgraffito, and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the figlina (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, tituli picti, recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled. Classification The first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called \\"Dressel table\\",Dressel 1879, Di un grande deposito di anfore rinvenuto nel nuovo quartiere del Castro Pretorio, in BullCom, VII, 36‚Äì112, 143‚Äì196. which still is used today for many types. Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Ma√±a published in 1951,Ma√±a, Sobre tipologia de √°nforas p√πnicas, in VI Congreso Arqueologico del Sudeste Espa√±ol, Alcoy, 1950, Cartagena, 1951, 203‚Äì210 and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977‚Äì1978.Amphores de tradition punique √† Uzita, in BaBesch 52-53, 171-200 The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989,Laubenheimer, Les amphores gauloises sous l‚Äôempire: recherches nouvelles sur leur production et chronologie, in Amphores romaines et histoire √©conomiqu√©: dis ans de recherche.

History =Prehistoric origins= Amphora found in Banpo (China), made by the Yangshao culture; 5000‚Äì3000 BC; Guimet Museum (Paris) Ceramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. For example, the kvevri, common in the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus, may be traced back to approximately 6000 BC. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in Banpo, a Neolithic site of the Yangshao culture in China. Amphorae first appeared on the Phoenician coast at approximately 3500 BC. In the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient Mediterranean world, being used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as the principal means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other commodities. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. Wooden and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter. They influenced Chinese ceramics and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west. =Ancient Greece: fancy shapes for painting= Large late Geometric Attic amphora; 725‚Äì700 BC; Louvre (Paris, France) Besides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand. amphorae were used as prizes in the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove. Surviving examples bear the inscription \\"I am one of the prizes from Athens\\", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for. Painted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the loutrophoros. Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced. Greek amphora types Various different types of amphorae were popular at different times: =Neck amphora (c. 6th‚Äì5th century BC)= On a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae: * the Nolan amphora (late 5th century BC), named for its type site, Nola near Naples, and * the Tyrrhenian amphora. There are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example: * the Pointed amphora, with a notably pointed toe, sometimes ending in a knob-like protrusion * the Loutrophoros, used for storing water during ritual ceremonies, such as marriages and funerals. =Belly amphora (c. 640‚Äì450 BC)= In contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The pelike is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The pelike was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC. =Panathenaic prize amphora= Another special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the Panathenaia and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription \\"Œ§Œ©Œù ŒëŒòŒóŒùŒóŒòŒïŒù ŒëŒòŒõŒ©Œù\\" meaning \\"[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena\\". They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess Athena for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc. File:Terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora MET GR147.jpgPanathenaic prize amphora for runners; circa 530 BC; terracotta; height: 62.2 cm (24 in.); Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpgGreek amphora; 2nd half of the 2nd century BC; glass; from Olbia (Roman-era Sardinia); Altes Museum (Berlin) =Ancient Rome= Miniature Roman Holy Land 1st‚Äì3rd century AD lead pilgrim's votive amphora \\"Ampulla\\" By the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced. The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC. This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used. This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2-4 in the same space. Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used. At the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the cadii cumani type starts (Dressel 21-22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times. In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2-4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types. Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The Hispania Baetica and Hispania Tarraconensis regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7-13, for garum (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for defrutum (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2-4. North- African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Ma√±a C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3.Van der Werff 1977-78. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the Camulodunum 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times. Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased. The largest known wreck of an amphorae cargo ship, carrying 6,000 pots, was discovered off the coast of Kefalonia, an Ionian island off the coast of Greece. Modern use Some modern winemakers and brewers are using amphoras to provide a different palate and tastes to their products than are available with other aging methods.

Sumo originated in Japan, the only country where it is practiced professionally, where it is considered the national sport. It is considered a gendai bud≈ç, which refers to modern Japanese martial arts, but the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto. Life as a wrestler is highly regimented, with rules regulated by the Japan Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal sumo training stables, known in Japanese as heya, where all aspects of their daily lives‚Äîfrom meals to their manner of dress‚Äîare dictated by strict tradition. From 2008 to 2016, a number of high-profile controversies and scandals rocked the sumo world, with an associated effect on its reputation and ticket sales. These have also affected the sport's ability to attract recruits. Despite this setback, sumo's popularity and general attendance has rebounded due to having multiple yokozuna (or grand champions) for the first time in a number of years and other high-profile wrestlers such as End≈ç and Ichinoj≈ç grabbing the public's attention. History Sumo wrestler Somagahana Fuchiemon, =Antiquity (pre-1185)= Prehistoric wall paintings indicate that sumo originated from an agricultural ritual dance performed in prayer for a good harvest. The first mention of sumo can be found in a Kojiki manuscript dating back to 712, which describes how possession of the Japanese islands was decided in a wrestling match between the kami Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata. Takemikazuchi was the ruler of the common people and Takeminakata was the god of wind, water and agriculture. Takeminakata challenged Takemikazuchi for his land. Takemikazuchi had a grip on Takeminakata's arm and crushed it \\"like a reed,\\" defeating Takeminakata and claiming his land for his gods. The Nihon Shoki, published in 720, dates the first sumo match between mortals to the year 23 BC, when a man named Nomi no Sukune fought against Taima no Kuehaya at the request of Emperor Suinin and eventually killed him, making him the mythological ancestor of sumo. According to The Nihon Shoki, Nomi broke a rib of Taima with one kick, and killed him with a kick to the back as well. Until the Japanese Middle Ages, this unregulated form of wrestling was often fought to the death of one of the fighters. The first historically-attested sumo fights were held in 642 at the court of Empress K≈çgyoku to entertain a Korean legation. In the centuries that followed, the popularity of sumo within the court increased its ceremonial and religious significance. Regular events at the Emperor's court, the sumai no sechie, and the establishment of the first set of rules for sumo fall into the cultural heyday of the Heian period. =Japanese Middle Ages (1185‚Äì1603)= With the collapse of the Emperor's central authority, sumo lost its importance in the court; during the Kamakura period, sumo was repurposed from a ceremonial struggle to a form of military combat training among samurai. By the Muromachi period, sumo had fully left the seclusion of the court and became a popular event for the masses, and among the daimy≈ç it became common to sponsor wrestlers. Sumotori who successfully fought for a daimy≈ç's favor were given generous support and samurai status. Oda Nobunaga, a particularly avid fan of the sport, held a tournament of 1,500 wrestlers in February 1578. Because several bouts were to be held simultaneously within Nobunaga's castle, circular arenas were delimited to hasten the proceedings and to maintain the safety of the spectators. This event marks the invention of the dohy≈ç, which would be developed into its current form up until the 18th century. The winner of Nobunaga's tournament was given a bow for being victorious and he began dancing to show the war-lord his gratitude. =Edo period (1603‚Äì1867)= Sumo wrestling scene The 11th Yokozuna, Shiranui K≈çemon and the 13th Yokozuna, Kimenzan Tanigor≈ç (1866) Because sumo had become a nuisance due to wild fighting on the streets, particularly in Edo, sumo was temporarily banned in the city during the Edo period. In 1684, sumo was permitted to be held for charity events on the property of Shinto shrines, as was common in Kyoto and Osaka. The first sanctioned tournament took place in the Tomioka Hachiman Shrine at this time. An official sumo organization was developed, consisting of professional wrestlers at the disposal of the Edo administration. Many elements date from this period, such as the dohy≈ç-iri, the heya system, the gy≈çji and the mawashi. The 18th century brought forth several notable wrestlers such as Raiden Tameemon, Onogawa Kisabur≈ç and Tanikaze Kajinosuke, the first historical yokozuna. =Since 1868= Sumo match in Tokyo The Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about the end of the feudal system, and with it the wealthy daimy≈ç as sponsors. Due to a new fixation on Western culture, sumo had come to be seen as an embarrassing and backward relic, and internal disputes split the central association. The popularity of sumo was restored when Emperor Meiji organized a tournament in 1884; his example would make sumo a national symbol and contribute to nationalist sentiment following military successes against Korea and China. The Japan Sumo Association reunited on 28 December 1925 and increased the number of annual tournaments from two to four, and then to six in 1958. The length of tournaments was extended from ten to fifteen days in 1949. Winning a sumo bout The winner of a sumo bout is generally either the first wrestler to force his opponent to step out of the ring, or the first wrestler to force his opponent to touch the ground with any part of his body other than the bottom of his feet. Also, a number of other less common rules can be used to determine the winner. For example, a wrestler using an illegal technique (kinjite) automatically loses, as does one whose mawashi (belt) comes completely undone. A wrestler failing to show up for his bout (even if due to prior injury) also automatically loses (fusenpai). The initial crouch and charge are crucial. Upon positioning themselves opposite each other, the wrestlers perform a deep squat; without taking their feet off the ground, they then move forwards into a head-first crouched position, whilst also resting on one or two fists. This position is important because it allows them to adopt a more efficient posture to charge from and also isometrically preloads their muscles: this enables them to spring up and charge their opponents more powerfully when the referee signals the bout to begin. A successful charge is usually a powerful charge and is often a key determining factor in who wins the bout. Azumafuji defeating Tochinishiki via the \\"overarm throw\\" (uwatenage) technique, 1953 Bouts consist solely of a single round and often last only a few seconds, as usually one wrestler is quickly ousted from the circle or thrown to the ground. However, they can occasionally last for several minutes. Each match is preceded by an elaborate ceremonial ritual. Traditionally, sumo wrestlers are renowned for their great girth and body mass, which is often a winning factor in sumo. No weight divisions are used in professional sumo; a wrestler can sometimes face an opponent twice his own weight. However, with superior technique, smaller wrestlers can control and defeat much larger opponents. The average weight of top division wrestlers has continued to increase, from in 1969 to over by 1991, and was a record as of January 2019. In some situations, a review of the gy≈çji's decision may be needed. The judges outside the ring, who sit at eye level (the shimpan) may convene a conference in the middle of the ring, called a mono-ii. This is done if the judges decide that the decision over who won the bout needs to be reviewed; for example, if both sumotori appear to touch the ground or step out of the ring at the same time. In these cases, sometimes video is reviewed to see what happened. Once a decision is made, the chief judge will announce the decision to the spectators and the wrestlers alike. They may order a bout to be restarted, or leave the decision as given by the gy≈çji. Occasionally the shimpan will overrule the gy≈çji and give the bout to the other wrestler. After the winner is declared, an off-stage gy≈çji (referee) determines the kimarite (or winning technique) used in the bout, which is then announced to the audience. The Japan Sumo Association recognizes 82 different kimarite and 5 different hiwaza (or non-technique) in a win. On rare occasions the referee or judges may award the win to the wrestler who touched the ground first. This happens if both wrestlers touch the ground at nearly the same time and it is decided that the wrestler who touched the ground second had no chance of winning, his opponent's superior sumo having put him in an irrecoverable position. The losing wrestler is referred to as being shini-tai (\\"dead body\\") in this case. Wrestling ring (dohy≈ç) Sumo matches take place in a dohy≈ç (Âúü‰øµ): a ring, in diameter and in area, of rice-straw bales on top of a platform made of clay mixed with sand. A new dohy≈ç is built for each tournament by the bout callers (or yobidashi). At the center are two white lines, the shikiri-sen, behind which the wrestlers position themselves at the start of the bout. A roof resembling that of a Shinto shrine may be suspended over the dohy≈ç. Women are traditionally forbidden from entering or touching the ring. http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/female-medics-rushed-to-help-a- man-who-collapsed-on-a-sumo -ring-they-were-promptly-told-to-leave/ar- AAvuhSO?li=BBnb7Kz&ocid;=ASUDHP Professional sumo Sumo wrestlers gather in a circle around the gy≈çji (referee) in the dohy≈ç-iri (ring-entering ceremony). Professional sumo is organized by the Japan Sumo Association. The members of the association, called oyakata, are all former wrestlers, and are the only people entitled to train new wrestlers. Most practicing wrestlers are members of a training stable (or heya) run by one of the oyakata, who is the stablemaster for the wrestlers under him. In 2007, 43 training stables hosted 660 wrestlers. All sumo wrestlers take wrestling names called , which may or may not be related to their real names. Often, wrestlers have little choice in their names, which are given to them by their trainers (or stablemasters), or by a supporter or family member who encouraged them into the sport. This is particularly true of foreign-born wrestlers. A wrestler may change his wrestling name during his career, with some wrestlers changing theirs several times. Sumo wrestling is a strict hierarchy based on sporting merit. The wrestlers are ranked according to a system that dates back to the Edo period. Wrestlers are promoted or demoted according to their performance in six official tournaments held throughout the year. A carefully prepared banzuke listing the full hierarchy is published two weeks prior to each sumo tournament. In addition to the professional tournaments, exhibition competitions are held at regular intervals every year in Japan, and roughly once every two years, the top-ranked wrestlers visit a foreign country for such exhibitions. None of these displays is taken into account in determining a wrestler's future rank. Rank is determined only by performance in grand sumo tournaments (or honbasho). =Sumo divisions= Foreigner and sumo wrestler, 1861 The six divisions in sumo, in descending order of prestige, are: * makuuchi (ÂπïÂÜÖ). Maximum 42 wrestlers; Further divided into five ranks * j≈´ry≈ç (ÂçÅ‰∏°). Fixed at 28 wrestlers * makushita (Âπï‰∏ã). Fixed at 120 wrestlers * sandanme (‰∏âÊÆµÁõÆ). Fixed at 200 wrestlers * jonidan (Â∫è‰∫åÊÆµ). About 200 wrestlers * jonokuchi (Â∫è„ÉéÂè£ or Â∫è„ÅÆÂè£). Around 50 wrestlers Wrestlers enter sumo in the lowest jonokuchi division and, ability permitting, work their way up to the top division. A broad demarcation in the sumo world can be seen between the wrestlers in the top two divisions known as sekitori (Èñ¢Âèñ) and those in the four lower divisions, known commonly by the more generic term rikishi (ÂäõÂ£´). The ranks receive different levels of compensation, privileges, and status. The topmost makuuchi division receives the most attention from fans and has the most complex hierarchy. The majority of wrestlers are maegashira (ÂâçÈ†≠) and are ranked from the highest level 1 down to about 16 or 17. In each rank are two wrestlers, the higher rank is designated as \\"east\\" and the lower as \\"west\\", so the list goes #1 east, #1 west, #2 east, #2 west, etc. Above the maegashira are the three champion or titleholder ranks, called the san'yaku, which are not numbered. These are, in ascending order, komusubi (Â∞èÁµê), sekiwake (Èñ¢ËÑá), and ≈çzeki (Â§ßÈñ¢). At the pinnacle of the ranking system is the rank of yokozuna (Ê®™Á∂±). Yokozuna, or grand champions, are generally expected to compete for and to win the top division tournament title on a regular basis, hence the promotion criteria for yokozuna are very strict. In general, an ≈çzeki must win the championship for two consecutive tournaments or an \\"equivalent performance\\" to be considered for promotion to yokozuna. More than one wrestler can hold the rank of yokozuna at the same time. In antiquity, sumo was solely a Japanese sport. Since the 1900s, however, the number of foreign- born sumo wrestlers has gradually increased. In the beginning of this period, these few foreign wrestlers were listed as Japanese, but particularly since the 1960s, a number of high-profile foreign-born wrestlers became well-known, and in more recent years have even come to dominate in the highest ranks. In the 10 years since January 2009, five of the nine wrestlers promoted to ≈çzeki, have been foreign-born, and a Japanese had not been named yokozuna from 1998 until the promotion of Kisenosato Yutaka in 2017. This and other issues eventually led the Sumo Association to limit the number of foreigners allowed to one in each stable. =Women and sumo= Women are not allowed to compete in professional sumo. They are also not allowed to enter the wrestling ring (dohy≈ç), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are \\"impure\\" because of menstrual blood. Professional sumo tournaments The sumo hall of Ry≈çgoku in Tokyo during the May, 2006 tournament Since 1958, six Grand Sumo tournaments (Japanese: honbasho) have been held each year: three at the Sumo Hall (or Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan) in Ry≈çgoku, Tokyo (January, May, and September), and one each in Osaka (March), Nagoya (July), and Fukuoka (November). Each tournament begins on a Sunday and runs for 15 days, ending also on a Sunday.An exception to this rule occurred when Hirohito, the former Emperor of Japan, died on Saturday, January 7, 1989. The tournament that was to start on the following day was postponed to start on Monday, January 9 and finish on Monday, January 24. The tournaments are organized in a manner akin to a McMahon system tournament; each wrestler in the top two divisions (sekitori) has one match per day, while the lower-ranked wrestlers compete in seven bouts, about one every two days. Each day is structured so that the highest-ranked contestants compete at the end of the day. Thus, wrestling starts in the morning with the jonokuchi wrestlers and ends at around six o'clock in the evening with bouts involving the yokozuna. The wrestler who wins the most matches over the 15 days wins the tournament championship (y≈´sh≈ç) for his division. If two wrestlers are tied for the top, they wrestle each other and the winner takes the title. Three-way ties for a championship are rare, at least in the top division. In these cases, the three wrestle each other in pairs with the first to win two in a row take the tournament. More complex systems for championship playoffs involving four or more wrestlers also exist, but these are usually only seen in determining the winner of one of the lower divisions. Sumo nobori flags The matchups for each day of the tournament are announced a day in advance. They are determined by the sumo elders who are members of the judging division of the Sumo Association. As many more wrestlers are in each division than matchups during the tournament, each wrestler only competes against a selection of opponents from the same division, though small overlaps can occur between two divisions. With the exception of the san'yaku-ranked wrestlers, the first bouts tend to be between wrestlers who are within a few ranks of each other. Afterwards, the selection of opponents takes into account a wrestler's prior performance. For example, in the lower divisions, wrestlers with the same record in a tournament are generally matched up with each other and the last matchups often involve undefeated wrestlers competing against each other, even if they are from opposite ends of the division. In the top division, in the last few days, wrestlers with exceptional records often have matches against much more highly ranked opponents, including san'yaku wrestlers, especially if they are still in the running for the top division championship. Similarly, more highly ranked wrestlers with very poor records may find themselves fighting wrestlers much further down the division. For the yokozuna and ≈çzeki, the first week and a half of the tournament tends to be taken up with bouts against the top maegashira, komusubi, and sekiwake, with the bouts within these ranks being concentrated into the last five days or so of the tournament (depending on the number of top-ranked wrestlers competing). Traditionally, on the final day, the last three bouts of the tournament are between the top six ranked wrestlers, with the top two competing in the final matchup, unless injuries during the tournament prevent this. Certain match-ups are prohibited in regular tournament play. Wrestlers who are from the same training stable cannot compete against each other, nor can wrestlers who are brothers, even if they join different stables. The one exception to this rule is that training stable partners and brothers can face each other in a championship-deciding playoff match. The last day of the tournament is called sensh≈´raku, which literally means \\"the pleasure of a thousand autumns\\". This colorful name for the culmination of the tournament echoes the words of the playwright Zeami to represent the excitement of the decisive bouts and the celebration of the victor. The Emperor's Cup is presented to the wrestler who wins the top- division makuuchi championship. Numerous other (mostly sponsored) prizes are also awarded to him. These prizes are often rather elaborate, ornate gifts, such as giant cups, decorative plates, and statuettes. Others are quite commercial, such as one trophy shaped like a giant Coca-Cola bottle. Promotion and relegation for the next tournament are determined by a wrestler's score over the 15 days. In the top division, the term kachikoshi means a score of 8‚Äì7 or better, as opposed to makekoshi, which indicates a score of 7‚Äì8 or worse. A wrestler who achieves kachikoshi almost always is promoted further up the ladder, the level of promotion being higher for better scores. See the makuuchi article for more details on promotion and relegation. A top-division wrestler who is not an ≈çzeki or yokozuna and who finishes the tournament with kachikoshi is also eligible to be considered for one of the three prizes awarded for \\"technique\\", \\"fighting spirit\\", and defeating the most yokozuna and ≈çzeki the \\"outstanding performance\\" prize. For more information see sansh≈ç. For the list of upper divisions champions since 1909, refer to the list of top division champions and the list of second division champions. =A professional sumo bout= Sumo wrestlers at the Grand Tournament in Osaka, March 2006 Sumo fight at the Kokugikan in Tokyo, Japan At the initial charge, both wrestlers must jump up from the crouch simultaneously after touching the surface of the ring with two fists at the start of the bout. The referee (gy≈çji) can restart the bout if this simultaneous touch does not occur. Upon completion of the bout, the referee must immediately designate his decision by pointing his gunbai or war-fan towards the winning side. The winning technique (kimarite) used by the winner would then be announced to the audience. The referee's decision is not final and may be disputed by the five judges seated around the ring. If this happens, they meet in the center of the ring to hold a mono-ii (a talk about things). After reaching a consensus, they can uphold or reverse the referee's decision or order a rematch, known as a torinaoshi. The wrestlers then return to their starting positions and bow to each other before retiring. A winning wrestler in the top division may receive additional prize money in envelopes from the referee if the matchup has been sponsored. If a yokozuna is defeated by a lower-ranked wrestler, it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers), though this practice is technically prohibited. In contrast to the time in bout preparation, bouts are typically very short, usually less than a minute (most of the time only a few seconds). Extremely rarely, a bout can go on for several minutes. If a bout lasts up to four minutes, the referee or one of the judges sitting around the ring may call a mizu-iri or \\"water break\\". The wrestlers are carefully separated, have a brief break, and then return to the exact position they left, as determined by the referee. If after four more minutes, they are still deadlocked, they may have a second break, after which they start from the beginning. Further deadlock with no end of the bout in sight can lead to a draw (hikiwake), an extremely rare result in modern sumo. The last draw in the top division was in September 1974. Life as a professional sumo wrestler Tomozuna Stable in Tokyo end their daily workout routine with a footwork drill. A sumo wrestler leads a highly regimented way of life. The Sumo Association prescribes the behavior of its wrestlers in some detail. For example, the association prohibits wrestlers from driving cars, although this is partly out of necessity as many wrestlers are too big to fit behind a steering wheel. Breaking the rules can result in fines and/or suspension for both the offending wrestler and his stablemaster. On entering sumo, they are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot, or chonmage, similar to the samurai hairstyles of the Edo period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the chonmage and traditional Japanese dress when in public, allowing them to be identified immediately as wrestlers. The type and quality of the dress depends on the wrestler's rank. Rikishi in jonidan and below are allowed to wear only a thin cotton robe called a yukata, even in winter. Furthermore, when outside, they must wear a form of wooden sandal called geta. Wrestlers in the makushita and sandanme divisions can wear a form of traditional short overcoat over their yukata and are allowed to wear straw sandals, called z≈çri. The higher-ranked sekitori can wear silk robes of their own choice, and the quality of the garb is significantly improved. They also are expected to wear a more elaborate form of topknot called an ≈çich≈ç (big ginkgo leaf) on formal occasions. Similar distinctions are made in stable life. The junior wrestlers must get up earliest, around 5 am, for training, whereas the sekitori may start around 7 am. When the sekitori are training, the junior wrestlers may have chores to do, such as assisting in cooking the lunch, cleaning, and preparing the bath, holding a sekitori's towel, or wiping the sweat from him. The ranking hierarchy is preserved for the order of precedence in bathing after training, and in eating lunch. Wrestlers are not normally allowed to eat breakfast and are expected to have a siesta-like nap after a large lunch. The most common type of lunch served is the traditional sumo meal of chankonabe, which consists of a simmering stew of various fish, meat, and vegetables cooked at the table. It is usually eaten with rice and washed down with beer. This regimen of no breakfast and a large lunch followed by a sleep is intended to help wrestlers put on a lot of weight so as to compete more effectively. In the afternoon, the junior wrestlers again usually have cleaning or other chores, while their sekitori counterparts may relax, or deal with work issues related to their fan clubs. Younger wrestlers also attend classes, although their education differs from the typical curriculum of their non-sumo peers. In the evening, sekitori may go out with their sponsors, while the junior wrestlers generally stay at home in the stable, unless they are to accompany the stablemaster or a sekitori as his tsukebito (manservant) when he is out. Becoming a tsukebito for a senior member of the stable is a typical duty. A sekitori has a number of tsukebito, depending on the size of the stable or in some cases depending on the size of the sekitori. The junior wrestlers are given the most mundane tasks such as cleaning the stable, running errands, and even washing or massaging the exceptionally large sekitori while only the senior tsukebito accompany the sekitori when he goes out. The sekitori are given their own room in the stable, or may live in their own apartments, as do married wrestlers; the junior wrestlers sleep in communal dormitories. Thus, the world of the sumo wrestler is split broadly between the junior wrestlers, who serve, and the sekitori, who are served. Life is especially harsh for recruits, to whom the worst jobs tend to be allocated, and the dropout rate at this stage is high. The negative health effects of the sumo lifestyle can become apparent later in life. Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy between 60 and 65, more than 10 years shorter than the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler's body. Many develop type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, and they are prone to heart attacks due to the enormous amount of body mass and fat that they accumulate. The excessive intake of alcohol can lead to liver problems and the stress on their joints due to their excess weight can cause arthritis. Recently, the standards of weight gain are becoming less strict, in an effort to improve the overall health of the wrestlers. Physical requirements Some sumo organizations have minimum height and weight requirements for their competitors. In 1994, the Japanese Sumo Association required that all sumo wrestlers be a minimum in height. This prompted 16-year-old Takeji Harada of Japan (who had failed six previous eligibility tests) to have four separate cosmetic surgeries over a period of 12 months to add an extra of silicone to his scalp, which created a large, protruding bulge on his head. In response to this, the JSA stated that they would no longer accept aspiring wrestlers who surgically enhanced their height, citing health concerns. In 2019, The Japan Times reported that the height requirement was , while the weight requirement was . Although, they also claimed that a \\"blind eye\\" is turned for those \\"just shy\\" of the minimums. Salary and payment , the monthly salary figures (in Japanese yen) for the top two divisions were: Yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ performing the distinctive dohy≈ç-iri of his rank *yokozuna: ¬•3 million, about US$26,500 *≈çzeki: ¬•2.5 million, about US$22,000 *san'yaku: ¬•1.8 million, about US$16,000 *maegashira: ¬•1.4 million, about US$12,500 *j≈´ry≈ç: ¬•1.1 million, about US$9,500 Wrestlers lower than the second-highest division, who are considered trainees, receive only a fairly small allowance instead of a salary. In addition to the basic salary, sekitori wrestlers also receive additional bonus income, called mochiky≈´kin, six times a year (once every tournament, or basho) based on the cumulative performance in their career to date. This bonus increases every time the wrestler scores a kachikoshi (with larger kachikoshi giving larger raises). Special increases in this bonus are also awarded for winning the top division championship (with an extra large increase for a \\"perfect\\" championship victory with no losses or zensh≈ç-yusho), and also for scoring a gold star or kinboshi (an upset of a yokozuna by a maegashira). San'yaku wrestlers also receive a relatively small additional tournament allowance, depending on their rank, and yokozuna receive an additional allowance every second tournament, associated with the making of a new tsuna belt worn in their ring entering ceremony. Also, prize money is given to the winner of each divisional championship, which increases from ¬•100,000 for a jonokuchi victory up to ¬•10 million for winning the top division. In addition to prizes for a championship, wrestlers in the top division giving an exceptional performance in the eyes of a judging panel can also receive one or more of three special prizes (the sansh≈ç), which are worth ¬•2 million each. Individual top division matches can also be sponsored by companies. These prizes are called kensh≈çkin. For bouts involving yokozuna and ≈çzeki, the number of sponsors can be quite large, whereas for lower-ranked matchups, no bout sponsors may be active at all unless one of the wrestlers is particularly popular, or unless a company has a policy of sponsoring all his matchups. , a single sponsorship cost ¬•70,000, with ¬•60,000 going to the winner of the bout and ¬•10,000 deducted by the Japan Sumo Association for costs and fees. Immediately after the match, the winner receives an envelope from the referee with half of his share of the sponsorship, while the other half is put in a fund for his retirement. No prize money is awarded for bouts decided by a fusensh≈ç or forfeit victory. Amateur sumo Bulgarian amateurs ‚Äì on the right is the national coach Hristo Hristov Sumo is also practised as an amateur sport, with participants in college, high school, and grade school in Japan. In addition to college and school tournaments, open amateur tournaments are also held. The sport at this level is stripped of most of the ceremony. The most successful amateur wrestlers in Japan (usually college champions) can be allowed to enter professional sumo at makushita (third division) or sandanme (fourth division) rather than from the very bottom of the ladder. These ranks are called makushita tsukedashi and sandanme tsukedashi, and are currently equivalent to makushita 10, makushita 15, or sandanme 100 depending on the level of amateur success achieved. Many of the current top division wrestlers entered professional sumo by this route. All amateur athletes entering the professional ranks must be under 23 to satisfy the entry, except those who qualify for makushita tsukedashi or sandanme tsukedashi, who may be up to 25. The International Sumo Federation was established to encourage the sport's development worldwide, including holding international championships. A key aim of the federation is to have sumo recognized as an Olympic sport. Accordingly, amateur tournaments are divided into weight classes (men: Lightweight up to , Middleweight up to , Heavyweight over , and Open Weight (unrestricted entry), and include competitions for female wrestlers (Lightweight up to , Middleweight up to , Heavyweight over , and Open Weight). Amateur sumo clubs are gaining in popularity in the United States, with competitions regularly being held in major cities across the country. The US Sumo Open, for example, was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center in 2007 with an audience of 3,000.My First Date With Sumo (2007) Gould, Chris The sport has long been popular on the West Coast and in Hawaii, where it has played a part in the festivals of the Japanese ethnic communities. Now, however, the sport has grown beyond the sphere of Japanese diaspora and athletes come from a variety of ethnic, cultural, and sporting backgrounds. Amateur sumo is particularly strong in Europe. Many athletes come to the sport from a background in judo, freestyle wrestling, or other grappling sports such as sambo. Some Eastern European athletes have been successful enough to be scouted into professional sumo in Japan, much like their Japanese amateur counterparts. The most notable of these to date is the Bulgarian Koto≈çsh≈´, who is the highest-ranking foreign wrestler who was formerly an amateur sumo athlete. Brazil is another center of amateur sumo, introduced by Japanese immigrants who arrived during the first half of the twentieth century. The first Brazilian sumo tournament was held in 1914. Sumo took root in immigrant centers in southern Brazil, especially S√£o Paulo, which is now home to the only purpose-built sumo training facility outside Japan. Beginning in the 1990s, Brazilian sumo organizations made an effort to interest Brazilians without Japanese ancestry in the sport, and by the mid-2000s an estimated 70% of participants came from outside the Japanese-Brazilian community. Brazil is also a center for women's sumo. A small number of Brazilian wrestlers have made the transition to professional sumo in Japan, including Ry≈´k≈ç G≈ç and Kaisei Ichir≈ç.  Clothing  Sumo wrestlers wear mawashi which is essentially a thick 30-foot-long belt, that they tie in knots in the back. They have an official thickness and strength requirement. During matches, the wrestler will grab onto the other wrestler's mawashi and use it to help them and make moves during a match. The mawashi they wear practicing versus in a tournament is essentially the same except for the material. The different mawashi that the wrestlers wear differentiate their rank. Top rated wrestlers wear different colors of silk mawashi during tournament, while lower rated wrestlers are limited to just black cotton. Their hair is put in what they call a topknot, and they use wax to get it to stay. Wax is applied to sumo wrestlers' hair daily by sumo hairdressers (Tokoyama). The topknot is a type of Samurai hairstyle which was once popular in Japan during the Edo period. The topknot is hard for some foreigner's hair because their hair is not as coarse and straight as Japanese hair. Once a wrestler joins a stable, they are required to grow out their hair in order to form a topknot. Outside of tournaments and practices, in daily life, sumo wrestlers are required to wear traditional Japanese clothes. They must wear these traditional clothes all the time in public. What you can wear in public is also determined by rank. Lower rated wrestlers must wear a yukata at all times, even in winter, where higher rated wrestlers have more choice in what they wear.

The Informix products were originally developed by Informix Corporation, whose Informix Software subsidiary was acquired by IBM in 2001. In April 2017, IBM and HCL Technologies (Products & Platforms Division) agreed to a long-term, 15-year partnership to co-develop, support, and market the product. IBM has continued active development and marketing of the key Informix products, the current version of which (14.10) forms the basis of several product editions with variation in capacity and functionality. The Informix database has been used in many high transaction rate OLTP applications in the retail, finance, energy and utilities, manufacturing and transportation sectors. More recently the server has been enhanced to improve its support for data warehouse workloads. The Informix server supports the object-relational model, which has permitted IBM to offer extensions that support data types that are not a part of the SQL standard. The most widely used of these are the JSON, BSON, time series and spatial extensions, which provide both data type support and language extensions that permit high performance domain specific queries and efficient storage for data sets based on semi-structured, time series, and spatial data.  Key products  The current version of IBM Informix is 14.10. The major enhancements made over previous releases were adding built-in index compression, integration of JSON collections with support for MongoDB JSON drivers into the server, and an enhancement permitting database objects to be partitioned across multiple servers in a cluster or grid (aka sharding). Queries can optionally return data from the locally connected server instance or from an entire grid with the same SQL. Informix version 14.10 introduced support for partial indexing where only a subset of the rows in a table are indexed and for multi-valued key indexes which support indexing the elements within multi-valued data types such as LIST, SET, MULTISET, and BSON array fields. Heterogeneous clusters are fully supported, and there are several deployment options that are available, including some that provide very high levels of data redundancy and fault tolerance. This feature is marketed by IBM as Informix Flexible Grid. Informix is offered in a number of editions, including free developer editions, editions for small and mid-sized business, and editions supporting the complete feature set and designed to be used in support of the largest enterprise applications. There is also an advanced data warehouse edition of Informix. This version includes the Informix Warehouse Accelerator which uses a combination of newer technologies including in-memory data, tokenization, deep compression, and columnar database technology to provide extreme high performance on business intelligence and data warehouse style queries. Informix TimeSeries is a unique feature of the database system that allows for efficient and fast manipulation of time series data, such as that generated by devices such as smart electric meters, or as found in financial trading systems with time stamped stock 'ticks'. This type of data is not well suited to storage or use in the normal SQL supported style of data organization.  Positioning  IBM has several database products with capabilities which overlap in some areas. Informix is often compared to IBM's other major database product, DB2, which is offered on the mainframe zSeries platform as well as on Windows, Unix and Linux. Speculation that IBM would combine Informix with DB2, or with other database products has proven to be unfounded. IBM has instead continued to expand the variety of database products it offers, such as Netezza, a data warehouse appliance, and Cloudant, a NoSQL database. IBM has described its approach to the market as providing \\"workload optimized systems.\\" Informix is generally considered to be optimized for environments with very low or no database administration, including use as an embedded database. It has a long track record of supporting very high transaction rates and providing uptime characteristics needed for mission critical applications such as manufacturing lines and reservation systems. Informix has been widely deployed in the retail sector, where the low administration overhead makes it useful for in-store deployments. With the ability to deeply embed Informix in gateways and routers, timeseries support, small footprint, and low administration requirements, Informix is also targeted at Internet-of-Things solutions, where many of the data-handling requirements can be handled with gateways that embed Informix and connect sensors and devices to the internet. In April 2017 IBM announced that they were outsourcing development of Informix to Indian IT specialists HCL, and that a number of IBM employees working on Informix would also move to HCL. As part of this arrangement IBM will continue to market and sell Informix to their customers.  Other products  In addition to the products based on the version 14.1 engine the IBM Informix family also includes a number of legacy database products which are still supported in market. These include Informix OnLine, Informix Standard Edition (SE) and Informix C-ISAM. These products are simpler and smaller footprint database engines that are also frequently embedded in third party applications. Collectively these products are often referred to as the \\"Informix Classics\\". The IBM Informix family also includes a client-side development environment, the Client-SDK, which supports a number of different environments including .net for Windows developers and a variety of protocols for Unix and Linux environments.  Obsolete and non-IBM Informix heritage products   Plans  IBM has long-term plans for both Informix and DB2, with both databases sharing technology with each other, although IBM has continually denied fusion of the two products.  Training and certification  IBM Training includes a complete set of core Data Servers Training courses that apply to Informix. These courses delve into many essential Informix concepts, from fundamentals to advanced SQL topics. As part of IBM's Academic Initiative, IBM is offering Informix software, documentation and training to higher education institutions worldwide through its new Informix on Campus program. IBM is offering an inclusive package of Informix materials to college faculty called \\"Informix In a Box\\",developerWorks: Wikis - Informix on Campus - Informix in a Box which offers hands-on labs and PowerPoints to use in lessons, recorded training for teachers, DVDs with class material and VMware virtual appliance images, as well as T-shirts for students.  Users groups  Users groups remain active in Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, the United States, and many other countries. The IIUG (International Informix Users Group) acts as a federation of those user groups and provides numerous services to its members.

The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the \\"Point\\" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio River by both Native Americans and European settlers. The shallow river has been made navigable upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady by a series of locks and dams constructed in the early 20th century. A 24-mile long portion of the upper river in Warren and McKean counties of Pennsylvania and Cattaraugus County in New York is the Allegheny Reservoir also known as Lake Kinzua, created by the erection of the Kinzua Dam in 1965 for flood control. The name of the river comes from one of a number of Delaware/Unami phrases which are homophones of the English name, with varying translations. Etymology The Allegheny River is named as Ohio on a sketch by George Washington. The name Allegheny probably comes from Lenape welhik hane\\"Heckewelder here does not give the strict meaning of hanne. The word in common use among Algonkin [i.e., Algonquian] tribes for river is sipu, and this includes the idea of 'a stream of flowing water'. But in the mountainous parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia sipu did not sufficiently convey the idea of a rapid stream, roaring down mountain gorges, and hanne takes its place to designate not a mere sipu, or flowing river, but a rapid mountain stream.\\" or oolikhanna, which means 'best flowing river of the hills' or 'beautiful stream'. There is a Lenape legend of a tribe called \\"Allegewi\\" who used to live along the river. Hernando de Soto in 1540 and others such as Henry Schoolcraft in subsequent years report the \\"Allegewi\\" were the Cherokees. The following account of the origin of the name Allegheny was given in 1780 by Moravian missionary David Zeisberger: \\"All this land and region, stretching as far as the creeks and waters that flow into the Alleghene the Delawares called Alligewinenk, which means 'a land into which they came from distant parts'. The river itself, however, is called Alligewi Sipo. The whites have made Alleghene out of this, the Six Nations calling the river the Ohio.\\" Indians, including the Lenni Lenape and Iroquois, considered the Allegheny and Ohio rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as OhiÀêyo'. The Geographic Names Information System lists O-hee-yo and O-hi-o as variant names. The river is called Ohi:'i:o\` (river beautiful) in the Seneca language. In New York, areas around the river are often named with the alternate spelling Allegany in reference to the river; for example, the Village of Allegany and Allegany State Park. Port Allegany, located along the river in Pennsylvania near the border with New York, also follows this pattern. Course Much of the Allegheny River's course is through hilly woodlands. The Allegheny River rises in north central Pennsylvania, on Cobb Hill in Alleghany Township in north central Potter County,Sweden Valley, PA, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1969 (1972 rev.) 8 miles (16 km) south of the New York border and a few miles northwest of the eastern triple divide. The stream flows south and passes under Pennsylvania Route 49 11 miles northeast of Coudersport where a historical marker that declares the start of the river is located. Cobb Hill is about a mile north. The stream flows southwest paralleling Route 49 to Coudersport. It continues west to Port Allegany then turns north into western New York,Bradford, PA, 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Map, USGS, 1980 looping westward across southern Cattaraugus County for approximately 30 miles (48 km), past Portville, Olean, Allegany and Salamanca and flowing through Seneca Indian Nation lands close to the northern boundary of Allegany State Park before re-entering northwestern Pennsylvania within the Allegheny Reservoir just east of the Warren-McKean county line, approx. 10 miles (32 km) northeast of Warren.Olean, NY, 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Map, USGS, 1986 It flows in a broad zigzag course generally southwest across Western Pennsylvania; first flowing southwest past Warren, Tidioute, Tionesta, Oil City, and Franklin, forming much of the northwestern boundary of Allegheny National Forest. South of Franklin it turns southeast across Clarion County in a meandering course, then turns again southwest across Armstrong County, flowing past Kittanning, Ford City, Clinton, and Freeport.Warren, PA, 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Map, USGS, 1983Oil City, PA, 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Map, USGS, 1983Indiana, PA, 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Map, USGS, 1983 The Highland Park Bridge crosses the Allegheny River at Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, just above Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 2. The river enters both Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, the Pittsburgh suburbs, and the City of Pittsburgh from the northeast. It passes the North Side, downtown Pittsburgh, and Point State Park. The Allegheny joins with the Monongahela River at the \\"Point\\" in downtown Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.Pittsburg East and Pittsburg West 1:100,000 Scale Topographic Maps, USGS, 1986  Hydrography  The headwaters of the Allegheny River are in this meadow in Potter County The Allegheny River drainage basin covers parts of New York and Pennsylvania in the United States. The river is approximately long, running through the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It drains a rural dissected plateau of in the northern Allegheny Plateau, providing the northeasternmost drainage in the watershed of the Mississippi River. Its tributaries reach to within of Lake Erie in southwestern New York. Water from the Allegheny River eventually flows into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The Allegheny Valley has been one of the most productive areas of fossil fuel extraction in United States history, with its extensive deposits of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. =Tributaries= In its upper reaches, the Allegheny River is joined from the south by Potato Creek downstream of Coryville, Pennsylvania and from the north by Olean Creek at Olean, New York. Tunungwant \\"Tuna\\" Creek joins the river from the south in Carrollton, New York (flowing north from Bradford, Pennsylvania); the Great Valley Creek and Little Valley Creek join the river from the north at Salamanca, New York before becoming the Allegheny Reservoir. After re-entering Pennsylvania, the river is joined from the east by Kinzua Creek upstream of Warren; from the north by Conewango Creek at Warren; from the west by Brokenstraw Creek; from the east by East Hickory Creek at East Hickory; from the east by Tionesta Creek at Tionesta; from the north by Oil Creek at Oil City; from the west by French Creek at Franklin; from the east by the Clarion River, a principal tributary, at Parker; from the east by Crooked Creek southeast of Kittanning; and from the east by the Kiskiminetas River, another principal tributary, at Schenley. Buffalo Creek enters at Freeport, Chartiers Run enters at Lower Burrell, Bull Creek enters at Tarentum, Pucketa Creek enters near New Kensington, Riddle Run enters at Springdale, and Girtys Run enters at Millvale. Many additional streams enter or join with the Allegheny River along its course. =Locks, dams and bridges= The eastern part of Allegheny Islands State Park and the C. W. Bill Young Lock and Dam (No. 3) on the Allegheny River Several locks were built in the early 20th century to make the Allegheny River navigable for 72 miles upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady. The Allegheny River has eight locks and fixed-crest dams numbered two through nine: Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which form corresponding reservoirs. The river is also impounded by the Kinzua Dam in northwestern Pennsylvania, resulting in the Allegheny Reservoir also known as Kinzua Lake and Lake Perfidy among the Seneca. The Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station is associated with Kinzua Dam. Numerous bridges and tunnels span the river throughout its course. The Allegheny River Tunnel, utilized by Pittsburgh Light Rail, went into service in 2012. History In the latter half of the 17th century, control of the river valley passed back-and-forth between Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and the Iroquois. By the time of the arrival of the French in the early 18th century, the Shawnee were once again in control and formed an alliance with the French against the incursion of British settlement across the Allegheny Mountains. The conflict over the expansion of British settlement into the Allegheny Valley and the surrounding Ohio Country was a primary cause of the French and Indian War in the 1750s. During the war, the village of Kittanning ‚Äì the principal Shawnee settlement on the river ‚Äì was completely destroyed by British reprisal raids from Central Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, the British, after gaining control of the area in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, kept the area closed to white settlement, in part to repair and maintain relations with the Native Americans. After the war, the entire river valley became part of the United States of America. During the 19th century, the river became a principal means of navigation in the upper Ohio valley, especially for the transport of coal. Although the building of the railroads lessened the importance of the river somewhat, the lower river (navigable as far as East Brady, Pennsylvania through locks) has continued to serve as a route of commercial transportation until the present day. In 1859, the first U.S. petroleum was drilled north of the river at Titusville. One of the underlying premises of the Genesee Valley Canal was its connection to the river, opening a trade route from Rochester, New York to the west. The advent of the railroads obviated any interest Pennsylvania might have had in participating to improve navigation on the river. The canal was closed in 1877 and the right-of-way sold to the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad. Seneca Chief Cornplanter In 1965, the completion of the federally sponsored Kinzua Dam for flood-control in northwestern Pennsylvania east of Warren created the long Allegheny Reservoir, known as Lake Perfidy among the Seneca, part of which is included in the Allegheny National Recreation Area. The dam flooded parts of lands deeded \\"forever\\" to the Seneca Nation of Indians by the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, and lands given to Cornplanter and his descendants. The event was described in the Johnny Cash song \\"As Long as the Grass Shall Grow\\" from the 1964 album Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian, which focused on the history of and problems facing Native Americans in the United States. The construction of the dam and the filling of the Allegheny Reservoir also necessitated the elimination of the small village of Corydon, which was located at the confluence of Willow Creek with the Allegheny River; and the small village of Kinzua, which was located at the confluence of Kinzua Creek with the Allegheny River. All residents of both villages were forced to move. The Kinzua Dam and Allegheny Reservoir Many prominent individuals opposed the construction of the dam at that time because of the damage it would do to Seneca lands, including Pennsylvania Congressman John P. Saylor of Johnstown, and Howard Zahniser, executive director of The Wilderness Society and native of Tionesta‚Äîa small settlement located along the Allegheny River several miles downstream from Warren. During the campaign for the 1960 United States presidential election, John F. Kennedy assured the Seneca Nation that he would oppose the dam if elected. However, he failed to follow through on his pledge upon becoming president. In 1992, of the Allegheny River was designated Wild and Scenic. This designation comprises three segments of the river located in Warren, Forest, and Venango counties.Allegheny Wild and Scenic River ‚Äì Allegheny National Forest. Retrieved June 16, 2018.

Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia (2013). ) was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, an influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as stratagem, delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.Ancient warfare edited by John Carman and Anthony Harding, page 41 Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was Sun Wu () and he was known outside of his family by his courtesy name Changqing (). The name Sun Tzu by which he is best known in the Western World is an honorific which means \\"Master Sun\\". Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian Sima Qian and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to King Hel√º of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544‚Äì496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity place the extant text of The Art of War in the later Warring States period based on its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled The Art of War. Since Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical, prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972. Sun Tzu's work has been praised and employed in East Asian warfare since its composition. During the twentieth century, The Art of War grew in popularity and saw practical use in Western society as well. It continues to influence many competitive endeavors in the world, including culture, politics, business and sports, as well as modern warfare. Life The Yinqueshan Han Slips unearthed in 1972 include Sun Tzu's Art of War, collection of Shandong Museum The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi.. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving king Hel√º of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.. One of the better-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 360 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.. Sima Qian claimed that Sun Tzu later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective (for example, at the Battle of Boju), that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote The Art of War based on his tested expertise. However, the Zuozhuan, a historical text written centuries earlier than the Shiji, provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all. =Historicity= Around the 12th century AD, some Chinese scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sun Tzu, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic Zuo zhuan, which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. The name \\"Sun Wu\\" () does not appear in any text prior to the Records of the Grand Historian, and may have been a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \\"the fugitive warrior\\"the surname \\"Sun\\" can be glossed as the related term \\"fugitive\\" (x√πn ), while \\"Wu\\" is the ancient Chinese virtue of \\"martial, valiant\\" (w«î ), which corresponds to Sun Tzu's role as the hero's doppelg√§nger in the story of Wu Zixu.Mair, Victor H. (2007). The Art of War: Sun Zi's Military Methods. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 9‚Äì10. . The only historical battle attributed to Sun Tzu, the Battle of Boju, has no record of him fighting in that battle. 13 March 2015 Situation during the Battle of Boju Skeptics cite possible historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, and that the book was actually a compilation from different authors and military strategists. Attribution of the authorship of The Art of War varies among scholars and has included people and movements including Sun; Chu scholar Wu Zixu; an anonymous author; a school of theorists in Qi or Wu; Sun Bin; and others.. Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure \\"Sun Tzu\\" through a form of euhemerism. The name Sun Wu does appear in later sources such as the Shiji and the Wu Yue Chunqiu, but were written centuries after Sun Tzu's era.. The use of the strips in other works however, such as The Methods of the Sima is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority.. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.. Skeptics who identify issues with the traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that should not have been available to Sun Wu.Yang, Sang. The Art of War. Wordsworth Editions Ltd (5 December 1999). pp. 14‚Äì15. 4 February 2015 Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active in the last years of the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722‚Äì481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481‚Äì221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yinque Shan in 1972 AD. The Art of War alt=A bamboo book The Art of War is traditionally ascribed to Sun Tzu. It presents a philosophy of war for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.. There are numerous theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han.. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved.. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu. Of the military texts written before the unification of China and Shi Huangdi's subsequent book burning in the second century BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the Seven Military Classics. As a central part of that compilation, The Art of War formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.. Sun Tzu's The Art of War uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy.. For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be \\"serene and inscrutable\\" and capable of comprehending \\"unfathomable plans\\". The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the East Asian context. The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of Taoist thought and practice. Sun Tzu viewed the ideal general as an enlightened Taoist master, which has led to The Art of War being considered a prime example of Taoist strategy. The book has also become popular among political leaders and those in business management. Despite its title, The Art of War addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon public administration and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state. On 10 April 1972, the Yinqueshan Han Tombs were accidentally unearthed by construction workers in Shandong. Scholars uncovered a collection of ancient texts written on unusually well-preserved bamboo slips. Among them were The Art of War and Sun Bin's Military Methods. Although Han dynasty bibliographies noted the latter publication as extant and written by a descendant of Sun, it had previously been lost. The rediscovery of Sun Bin's work is regarded as extremely important by scholars, both because of Sun Bin's relationship to Sun Tzu and because of the work's addition to the body of military thought in Chinese late antiquity. The discovery as a whole significantly expanded the body of surviving Warring States military theory. Sun Bin's treatise is the only known military text surviving from the Warring States period discovered in the twentieth century and bears the closest similarity to The Art of War of all surviving texts. Legacy Sun Tzu's Art of War has influenced many notable figures. The Chinese historian Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the Warring States. In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to The Art of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world. The Art of War was introduced into Japan and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals. Through its later influence on Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu,. it significantly affected the unification of Japan in the early modern era. Before the Meiji Restoration, mastery of its teachings was honored among the samurai and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential daimy≈çs and sh≈çguns. It remained popular among the Imperial Japanese armed forces. The Admiral of the Fleet T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, who led Japan's forces to victory in the Russo-Japanese War, was an avid reader of Sun Tzu.. Ho Chi Minh translated the work for his Vietnamese officers to study. His general V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, the strategist behind victories over French and American forces in Vietnam, was likewise an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas. America's Asian conflicts against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to the attention of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings.. The Art of War is mentioned for each unit's acquisition in \\"Military History Libraries for Duty Personnel\\" on page 18. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society. Daoist rhetoric is a component incorporated in the Art of War. According to Steven C. Combs in \\"Sun-zi and the Art of War: The Rhetoric of Parsimony\\", warfare is \\"used as a metaphor for rhetoric, and that both are philosophically based arts.\\" Combs writes \\"Warfare is analogous to persuasion, as a battle for hearts and minds.\\" The application of The Art of War strategies throughout history is attributed to its philosophical rhetoric. Daoism is the central principle in the Art of War. Combs compares ancient Daoist Chinese to traditional Aristotelian rhetoric, notably for the differences in persuasion. Daoist rhetoric in the art of war warfare strategies is described as \\"peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech\\". This form of communication is parsimonious. Parsimonious behavior, which is highly emphasized in The Art of War as avoiding confrontation and being spiritual in nature, shapes basic principles in Daoism. Mark McNeilly writes in Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare that a modern interpretation of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history is critical in understanding China's push to becoming a superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and The Art of War in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.. In 2008, the Chinese television producer Zhang Jizhong adapted Sun Tzu's life story into a 40-episode historical drama television series entitled Bing Sheng, starring Zhu Yawen as Sun Tzu. The video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition contains challenge missions based on Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War', which explains the military tactics and strategies.

It was renamed 'Rodinia' by who also were the first to produce a reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent. Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0‚Äì1.8 Ga collisional events.; Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633‚Äì573 million years ago. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known yet about the exact configuration and geodynamic history of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust, but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed. The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717‚Äì635 million years ago (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes. Geodynamics =Paleogeographic reconstructions= Rodinia at 900 Ma. \\"Consensus\\" reconstruction of Li et al. 2008. The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons.; the name 'Rodinia' was first used in Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons.See for example the correlation between the North American Grenville and European Dalslandian orogenies in ; for the correlation between the Australian Musgrave orogeny and the Grenville orogeny see Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data. Most reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian craton (\\"Amazonia\\") and the West African craton; in the south with the R√≠o de la Plata and S√£o Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica.

Paleomagnetic and geologic data are only definite enough to form reconstructions from the breakup of Rodinia onwards. Rodinia is considered to have formed between 1.3 and 1.23 billion years ago and broke up again before 750 million years ago. Rodinia was surrounded by the superocean geologists call Mirovia (from Russian –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π, mirovoy, meaning \\"global\\"). According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the latter part of Proterozoic times and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent \\"Paleopangaea\\" supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 million years ago and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 million years. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between Precambrian and Phanerozoic times. =Break up= In 2009 UNESCO's IGCP project 440, named 'Rodinia Assembly and Breakup', concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825‚Äì550 Ma: * The break up was initiated by a superplume around 825‚Äì800 Ma whose influence‚Äîsuch as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions‚Äîhave been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton. * Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800‚Äì750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia. India (including Madagascar) and the Congo-S√§o Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent. * As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750‚Äì700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia. * 650‚Äì550 Ma several events coincided: the opening of the Iapetus Ocean; the closure of the Braziliano, Adamastor, and Mozambique oceans; and the Pan-African orogeny. The result was the formation of Gondwana. The Rodinia hypothesis assumes that rifting did not start everywhere simultaneously. Extensive lava flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents, evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago. As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed between the continental masses of present-day Australia, East Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side and later Laurentia, Baltica, Amazonia and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the other. This rift developed into the Adamastor Ocean during the Ediacaran. Around 550 million years ago, on the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian, the first group of cratons eventually fused again with Amazonia, West Africa and the Rio de la Plata cratons.See for example reconstructions in This tectonic phase is called the Pan-African orogeny. It created a configuration of continents that would remain stable for hundreds of millions of years in the form of the continent Gondwana. In a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the Iapetus Ocean formed. The eastern part of this ocean formed between Baltica and Laurentia, the western part between Amazonia and Laurentia. Because the exact moments of this separation and the partially contemporaneous Pan-African orogeny are hard to correlate, it might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia. Influence on paleoclimate and life Unlike later supercontinents, Rodinia would have been entirely barren. Rodinia existed before complex life colonized dry land. Based on sedimentary rock analysis Rodinia's formation happened when the ozone layer was not as extensive as it is today. Ultraviolet light discouraged organisms from inhabiting its interior. Nevertheless, its existence did significantly influence the marine life of its time. In the Cryogenian period the Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap. Low temperatures may have been exaggerated during the early stages of continental rifting. Geothermal heating peaks in crust about to be rifted; and since warmer rocks are less dense, the crustal rocks rise up relative to their surroundings. This rising creates areas of higher altitude, where the air is cooler and ice is less likely to melt with changes in season, and it may explain the evidence of abundant glaciation in the Ediacaran period. The eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less dense oceanic lithosphere. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere will not lie as deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the eustatic sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas. The increased evaporation from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the weathering of exposed rock. By inputting data on the ratio of stable isotopes 18O:16O into computer models, it has been shown that, in conjunction with quick weathering of volcanic rock, this increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels to below the threshold required to trigger the period of extreme glaciation known as Snowball Earth. Increased volcanic activity also introduced into the marine environment biologically active nutrients, which may have played an important role in the development of the earliest animals.

He was taken captive by the Persian Emperor, Shapur I, after the Battle of Edessa, becoming the first Roman emperor to be captured as a prisoner of war, causing shock and instability throughout the Roman Empire. The unprecedented event and the unknown fate of the captured emperor generated a variety of different reactions and \\"new narratives about the Roman Empire in diverse contexts\\". Biography =Origins and rise to power= Unlike many of the would-be emperors and rebels who vied for imperial power during the Crisis of the Third Century of the Roman Empire, Valerian was of a noble and traditional senatorial family. Details of his early life are sparse, except for his marriage to Egnatia Mariniana, with whom he had two sons: later emperor Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus and Valerianus Minor. He was Consul for the first time either before 238 AD as a Suffectus or in 238 as an Ordinarius. In 238 he was princeps senatus, and Gordian I negotiated through him for senatorial acknowledgement for his claim as emperor. In 251 AD, when Decius revived the censorship with legislative and executive powers so extensive that it practically embraced the civil authority of the emperor, Valerian was chosen censor by the Senate, though he declined to accept the post. During the reign of Decius he was left in charge of affairs in Rome when that prince left for his ill-fated last campaign in Illyricum. Under Trebonianus Gallus he was appointed dux of an army probably drawn from the garrisons of the German provinces which seems to have been ultimately intended for use in a war against the Persians. However, when Trebonianus Gallus had to deal with the rebellion of Aemilianus in 253 AD it was to Valerian he turned for assistance in crushing the attempted usurpation. Valerian headed south but was too late: Gallus was killed by his own troops, who joined Aemilianus before Valerian arrived. The Raetian soldiers then proclaimed Valerian emperor and continued their march towards Rome. Upon his arrival in late September, Aemilianus's legions defected, killing Aemilianus and proclaiming Valerian emperor. In Rome, the Senate quickly acknowledged Valerian, not only for fear of reprisals but also because he was one of their own. Radiate of Valerian =Rule and fall= A bas relief of Emperor Valerian standing at the background and held captive by Shapur I found at Naqsh-e Rustam, Shiraz, Iran. The kneeling man is probably Philip the Arab. Valerian's first act as emperor on October 22, 253, was to appoint his son Gallienus caesar. Early in his reign, affairs in Europe went from bad to worse, and the whole West fell into disorder. In the East, Antioch had fallen into the hands of a Sassanid vassal and Armenia was occupied by Shapur I (Sapor). Valerian and Gallienus split the problems of the empire between them, with the son taking the West, and the father heading East to face the Persian threat. In 254, 255, and 257, Valerian again became Consul Ordinarius. By 257, he had recovered Antioch and returned the province of Syria to Roman control. The following year, the Goths ravaged Asia Minor. In 259, Valerian moved on to Edessa, but an outbreak of plague killed a critical number of legionaries, weakening the Roman position, and the town was besieged by the Persians. At the beginning of 260, Valerian was decisively defeated in the Battle of Edessa and held prisoner for the remainder of his life. Valerian's capture was a tremendous defeat for the Romans.Valerian =Persecution of Christians= While fighting the Persians, Valerian sent two letters to the Senate ordering that firm steps be taken against Christians. The first, sent in 257, commanded Christian clergy to perform sacrifices to the Roman gods or face banishment. The second, the following year, ordered the execution of Christian leaders. It also required Christian senators and equites to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods or lose their titles and property, and directed that they be executed if they continued to refuse. It also decreed that Roman matrons who would not apostatize should lose their property and be banished, and that civil servants and members of the Imperial household who would not worship the Roman gods should be reduced to slavery and sent to work on the Imperial estates. This indicates that Christians were well-established at that time, some in very high positions. The execution of Saint Prudent at Narbonne is taken to have occurred in 257. Prominent Christians executed in 258 included Pope Sixtus II (6 August), Saint Romanus Ostiarius (9 August) and Saint Lawrence (10 August). Others executed in 258 included the saints Denis in Paris, Pontius in Cimiez, Cyprian in Carthage and Eugenia in Rome. In 259 Saint Patroclus was executed at Troyes and Saint Fructuosus at Tarragona. When Valerian's son Gallienus became Emperor in 260, the decree was rescinded. Cameo of Shapur I capturing Valerian at the Battle of Edessa =Death in captivity= Eutropius, writing between 364 and 378 AD, stated that Valerian \\"was overthrown by Shapur king of Persia, and being soon after made prisoner, grew old in ignominious slavery among the Parthians.\\"Eutropius. Abridgement of Roman History. Translated by the Rev. John Selby Watson. London: Henry G. Bohn, 1853. (Book 9.7) An early Christian source, Lactantius, thought to be virulently anti-Persian, thanks to the occasional persecution of Christians by some Sasanian monarchs, maintained that, for some time prior to his death, Valerian was subjected to the greatest insults by his captors, such as being used as a human footstool by Shapur when mounting his horse. According to this version of events, after a long period of such treatment, Valerian offered Shapur a huge ransom for his release. In reply, according to one version, Shapur was said to have forced Valerian to swallow molten gold (the other version of his death is almost the same but it says that Valerian was killed by being flayed alive) and then had Valerian skinned and his skin stuffed with straw and preserved as a trophy in the main Persian temple. It was further alleged that it was only after a later Persian defeat against Rome that his skin was given a cremation and burial.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum, v; Wickert, L., \\"Licinius (Egnatius) 84\\" in Pauly- Wissowa, Realencyclop√§die 13.1 (1926), 488‚Äì495; Parker, H., A History of the Roman World A.D. 138 to 337 (London, 1958), 170. From . The captivity and death of Valerian has been frequently debated by historians without any definitive conclusion. Shapur I, pen and ink, Hans Holbein the Younger, ca. 1521. Kunstmuseum Basel. According to the modern scholar Touraj Daryaee, without any evidence and contrary to the account of Lactantius, Shapur I sent Valerian and some of his army to the city of Bishapur or Gundishapur where they lived in relatively good conditions. Shapur used the remaining soldiers in engineering and development plans. Band-e Kaisar (Caesar's dam) is one of the remnants of Roman engineering located near the ancient city of Susa.Abdolhossein Zarinkoob \\"Ruzgaran: tarikh-i Iran az aghz ta saqut saltnat Pahlvi\\" pp. 195 In all the stone carvings on Naghshe-Rostam, in Iran, Valerian is represented holding hands with Shapur I, a sign of submission. According to the early Persian Muslim scholar Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Shapur settled the prisoners of war in Gundishapur and released Valerian, as promised, after the construction of Band-e Kaisar. It has been alleged that the account of Lactantius is coloured by his desire to establish that persecutors of the Christians died fitting deaths; the story was repeated then and later by authors in the Roman Near East fiercely hostile to Persia. The joint rule of Valerian and Gallienus was threatened several times by usurpers. Nevertheless, Gallienus held the throne until his own assassination in 268 AD. Family * Gallienus * Publius Licinius Valerianus Minor or Valerian the Younger was another son of Valerian I. Consul in 265, he was probably killed by usurpers, some time between the capture of his father in 260 and the assassination of his brother Gallienus in 268.  In popular fiction  Valerian appears in Harry Sidebottom's historical fiction series of novels Warrior of Rome. He also appears in Anthony Hecht's poem \\"Behold the Lilies of the Field\\" in the collection The Hard Hours.

Coyote and the Road Runner cartoon The Acme Corporation is a fictional corporation that features prominently in the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote animated shorts as a running gag featuring outlandish products that fail or backfire catastrophically at the worst possible times. The name is also used as a generic title in many cartoons, especially those made by Warner Bros., and films, TV series, commercials and comic strips. The company name in the Road Runner cartoons is ironic,http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/03/the-origin-of-the- looney-tunes-acme-name/ since the word acme is derived from Greek (Œ±Œ∫ŒºŒÆ; English transliteration: akmƒì) meaning the peak, zenith or prime, yet products from the fictional Acme Corporation are often generic, failure-prone, or explosive.  History  Acme means \\"pinnacle\\", so the name was popularized by companies wanting to symbolize the best. A real-world advertisement for ACME anvils The usage of Acme Corporation in cartoons has its root in real-world companies using that name. An early global Acme brand name was the \\"Acme City\\" whistle made from mid 1870s onwards by J Hudson & Co, followed by the \\"Acme Thunderer\\", and \\"Acme siren\\" in 1895. The name became particularly popular for businesses in the 1920s, when alphabetized business telephone directories such as the Yellow Pages began to be widespread: A name at the beginning of the alphabet would be listed first, and a name implying \\"the best\\" was even better. There was a flood of businesses named Acme; some survive to this day, including Acme Brick, Acme Markets, and Acme Boots. Early Sears catalogues contained a number of products with the \\"Acme\\" trademark, including anvils, which are frequently used in Warner Bros. cartoons. The name Acme also had other connotations for people in Los Angeles at the time. During the time the Warner Bros. cartoons were being produced, the traffic lights in Los Angeles were manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Company. The traffic lights paired \\"Stop\\" and \\"Go\\" semaphore arms with small red and green lights. Bells played the role of today's amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changed‚Äîa process that took five seconds.CityDig: Should I Stop or Should I Go? Early Traffic Signals in Los Angeles.

Warner Brothers animator Chuck Jones has said the name Acme was chosen because of its prevalence: The Acme semaphore traffic lights were often used in Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons for comedic effect due to their loud bell which was often followed by screeching tires and many sight gags.  Fictional depiction  The company is never clearly defined in Road Runner cartoons but appears to be a conglomerate which produces every product type imaginable, no matter how elaborate or extravagant‚Äîmost of which never work as desired or expected (some products do work very well, but backfire against the coyote). In the Road Runner cartoon Beep, Beep, it was referred to as \\"Acme Rocket-Powered Products, Inc.\\" based in Fairfield, New Jersey. Many of its products appear to be produced specifically for Wile E. Coyote; for example, the Acme Giant Rubber Band, subtitled \\"(For Tripping Road Runners)\\". While their products leave much to be desired, Acme delivery service is second to none; Wile E. can merely drop an order into a mailbox (or enter an order on a website, as in the Looney Tunes: Back in Action movie), and have the product in his hands within seconds. Appearances A mural of Wile E. Coyote smashed into an ACME Instant Tunnel on the wall of the Rotch Library at MIT The name \\"Acme\\" is used as a generic corporate name in a huge number of cartoons, comics, television shows, such as in early episodes of I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show, and film, from the silent era onward in such titles as Buster Keaton's silent film Neighbors (1920) and Harold Lloyd's Grandma's Boy (1922). Acme is also briefly featured in the Walt Disney Donald Duck episode Cured Duck released in 1945. Examples which specifically reference the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character include: = Animated films and TV series = * The 1988 Disney/Touchstone and Amblin Entertainment film Who Framed Roger Rabbit attempted to explain Acme's inner workings in detail. The movie's plot is centered on the murder of the founder of Acme Incorporated, Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye).

The show's young protagonists attended \\"Acme Looniversity\\". In one episode, the coyote sues Acme, accusing it of making products that are unsafe. At the legal hearing, however, an Acme representative argues the products are not dangerous if used properly. For example, the coyote would attempt to launch himself using an Acme catapult by cutting the rope used to wind it, but the Acme representative pointed out that he was supposed to simply pull a lever. * The corporation is also mentioned in Animaniacs, such as the Acme song from Cookies for Einstein, and Pinky and the Brains home in Acme Labs. * Acme Corporation is the main antagonist of the movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).

Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, the character has appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, in which he usually has been depicted as a foil for Bugs Bunny. Daffy was one of the first of the new \\"screwball\\" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier during the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 167 appearances and Porky Pig's 153 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character. Directors such as Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones are notable examples of the character. Daffy was number 14 on TV Guides list of top 50 greatest cartoon characters. History =Origin= Daffy first appeared in Porky's Duck Hunt, released on April 17, 1937. The cartoon was directed by Tex Avery and animated by Bob Clampett. Porky's Duck Hunt is a standard hunter/prey pairing, but Daffy (barely more than an unnamed bit player in this short) was something new to moviegoers: an assertive, completely unrestrained, combative protagonist. Clampett later recalled: : \\"At that time, audiences weren't accustomed to seeing a cartoon character do these things. And so, when it hit the theaters it was an explosion. People would leave the theaters talking about this daffy duck.\\" This early Daffy is less anthropomorphic and resembles a normal black duck. In fact, the only aspects of the character that have remained consistent through the years are his voice characterization by Mel Blanc; and his black feathers with a white neck ring. Blanc's characterization of Daffy once held the world record for the longest characterization of one animated character by their original actor: 52 years. The origin of Daffy's voice, with its lateral lisp, is a matter of some debate. One often-repeated \\"official\\" story is that it was modeled after producer Leon Schlesinger's tendency to lisp. However, in Mel Blanc's autobiography, That's Not All Folks!, he contradicts that conventional belief, writing, \\"It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an s sound. Thus 'despicable' became 'desth-picable.'\\" Daffy's slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time, and it is barely noticeable in the early cartoons. In Daffy Duck & Egghead, Daffy does not lisp at all except in the separately drawn set-piece of Daffy singing \\"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\\" in which just a slight lisp can be heard. In The Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950), Daffy has a middle name, Dumas as the writer of a swashbuckling script, a nod to Alexandre Dumas. Also, in the Baby Looney Tunes episode \\"The Tattletale\\", Granny addresses Daffy as \\"Daffy Horatio Tiberius Duck\\". In The Looney Tunes Show (2011), the joke middle names \\"Armando\\" and \\"Sheldon\\" are used. =Golden Age Years= Daffy as he first appeared in Porky's Duck Hunt (1937). in drag as Carmen Miranda in Yankee Doodle Daffy (1943). Daffy's early years, 1937‚Äì1940 Tex Avery and Bob Clampett created the original version of Daffy in 1937. Daffy established his status by jumping into the water, hopping around, and yelling, \\"Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!\\" Animator Bob Clampett immediately seized upon the Daffy Duck character and cast him in a series of cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s. The early Daffy is a wild and zany screwball, perpetually bouncing around the screen with cries of \\"Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!\\" (In his autobiography, Mel Blanc stated that the zany demeanor was inspired by Hugh Herbert's catchphrase, which was taken to a wild extreme for Daffy.) Clampett physically redesigned the character, making him taller and lankier and rounding out his feet and bill. He was often paired with Porky Pig; Daffy won out over several characters created as potential foils for Porky in the late 1930s after Beans the Cat fell out of favor (beating out competitors such as Gabby Goat and Petunia Pig). World War II Daffy, 1941‚Äì45 600 Bomb Squadron emblem Daffy Duck. Daffy would also feature in several war-themed shorts during World War II, remaining true to his unbridled nature. He battles a Nazi goat intent on eating Daffy's scrap metal in Scrap Happy Daffy (1943), hits Adolf Hitler's head with a giant mallet in Daffy the Commando (1943) and outwits Hitler, Goebbels and Goering in Plane Daffy (1944). Oddly enough, it was only after these wartime escapades that Daffy is actually subject to conscription into military service, in the form of \\"the little man from the draft board\\", whom he tries to dodge in Draftee Daffy (1945). In the real world, Daffy was indeed \\"drafted\\" as a mascot for the 600th Bombardment Squadron. Daffy 1946‚Äì1952 For Daffy Doodles (his first Looney Tunes cartoon as a director), Robert McKimson tamed Daffy a bit, redesigning him yet again to be rounder and less elastic. The studio also instilled some of Bugs Bunny's savvy into the duck, making him as brilliant with his mouth as he was with his battiness. Daffy was teamed up with Porky Pig; the duck's one-time rival became his straight man. Arthur Davis, who directed Warner Bros. cartoon shorts for a few years in the late 1940s until upper management decreed there should be only three units (McKimson, Friz Freleng, and Jones), presented a Daffy similar to McKimson's. McKimson is noted as the last of the three units to make his Daffy uniform with Jones', with even late shorts, such as Don't Axe Me (1958), featuring traits of the \\"screwball\\" Daffy. Starting in You Were Never Duckier, Daffy's personality evolved to be from being less loony and more greedy. Daffy 1953‚Äì1964 While Daffy's looney days were over, McKimson continued to make him as bad or good as his various roles required him to be. McKimson would use this Daffy from 1946 to 1961. Friz Freleng's version took a hint from Chuck Jones to make the duck more sympathetic, as in the 1957 Show Biz Bugs. Here, Daffy is overemotional and jealous of Bugs, yet he has real talent that is ignored by the theater manager and the crowd. This cartoon finishes with a sequence in which Daffy attempts to wow the Bugs- besotted audience with an act in which he drinks gasoline and swallows nitroglycerine, gunpowder, and uranium-238 (in a greenish solution), jumps up and down to \\"shake well\\" and finally swallows a lit match that detonates the whole improbable mixture. When Bugs tells Daffy that the audience loves the act and wants more, Daffy, now a ghost floating upward (presumably to Heaven), says that he can only do the act once. Some TV stations, and in the 1990s the cable network TNT, edited out the dangerous act, afraid of imitation by young children. =Pairing of Daffy and Porky in parodies of popular movies, 1951‚Äì1965= While Bugs Bunny became Warner Bros.' most popular character, the directors still found ample use for Daffy. Several cartoons place him in parodies of popular movies and radio serials; Porky Pig was usually a comic relief sidekick. For example, Daffy in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery (1946) as \\"Duck Twacy\\" (Dick Tracy) by Bob Clampett; The Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950) Daffy was the hero and Porky Pig was the villain. In Drip-Along Daffy (1951), named after the Hopalong Cassidy character, throws Daffy into a Western with him labeled \\"Western-Type Hero\\" and Porky Pig labeled \\"Comedy Relief\\". In Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century (1953), a parody of Buck Rogers, Daffy trades barbs (and bullets) with Marvin the Martian, with Porky Pig retaining the role of Daffy's sidekick. In Rocket Squad (1956), a parody of Dragnet and Racket Squad Daffy and Porky Pig pair up once again. Daffy also played Stupor Duck a parody of the Adventures of Superman television series. Robin Hood Daffy (1958) casts the duck in the role of the legendary outlaw Robin Hood with Porky Pig as Friar Tuck. Besides being playing parodies, Daffy also played a salesman-who continually annoys a potential customer to buying something: in Fool Coverage Daffy actually succeeds into selling Porky Pig a $1,000,000 accident policy which only works under impossible conditions-unfortunately for Daffy, all the conditions occur! =Pairing of Bugs and Daffy, 1951‚Äì1964= Bugs' ascension to stardom also prompted the Warner Bros. animators to recast Daffy as the rabbit's rival, intensely jealous, insecure and determined to steal back the spotlight, while Bugs either remained cool headed but mildly amused or indifferent to the duck's jealousy or/and used it to his advantage. Daffy's desire to achieve stardom at almost any cost was explored as early as 1940 in Freleng's You Ought to Be in Pictures, but the idea was most successfully used by Chuck Jones, who redesigned the duck once again, making him scrawnier and scruffier. In Jones' \\"Hunting Trilogy\\" (or \\"Duck Season/Rabbit Season Trilogy\\") of Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning and Duck! Rabbit, Duck! (each respectively launched in 1951, 1952, and 1953), Daffy's attention-grabbing ways and excitability provide Bugs Bunny the perfect opportunity to fool the hapless Elmer Fudd into repeatedly shooting the duck's bill off. Also, these cartoons reveal Daffy's catchphrase, \\"Youuu're deththpicable!\\" Jones' Daffy sees himself as self-preservationist, not selfish. However, this Daffy can do nothing that does not backfire on him, more likely to singe his tail feathers as well as his ego and pride than anything. It is thought that Chuck Jones based Daffy Duck's new personality on his fellow animator Bob Clampett, who, like Daffy, was known as a loud self- promoter. In Beanstalk Bunny Daffy, Bugs and Elmer are once again teamed up in a parody of Jack and the Beanstalk (with Elmer as the giant); in A Star Is Bored Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny; while in the spoofs of the TV shows The Millionaire and This Is Your Life, The Million Hare Daffy tries to defeat his arch-rival Bugs Bunny for a $1,000,000.00 prize given out by his favorite TV show and This Is a Life? Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny in order to be the guest of honor on the show; in all four of these cartoons Daffy ends up a loser because of his own overemotional personality (which impairs Daffy's common sense and reasoning ability) and his craving for attention. Solo Daffy Film critic Steve Schneider calls Jones' version of Daffy \\"a kind of unleashed id.\\" Jones said that his version of the character \\"expresses all of the things we're afraid to express.\\" This is evident in Jones' Duck Amuck (1953), \\"one of the few unarguable masterpieces of American animation\\" according to Schneider. In the episode, Daffy is plagued by a godlike animator whose malicious paintbrush alters the setting, soundtrack, and even Daffy. When Daffy demands to know who is responsible for the changes, the camera pulls back to reveal none other than Bugs Bunny. Duck Amuck is widely heralded as a classic of filmmaking for its illustration that a character's personality can be recognized independently of appearance, setting, voice, and plot. In 1999, the short was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Daffy's pairing with Speedy in 1965‚Äì68 When the Warner Bros. animation studio briefly outsourced cartoon production to DePatie- Freleng Enterprises (DFE) in the 1960s, Daffy Duck became an antagonist in several cartoons opposite Speedy Gonzales, who refers to Daffy as \\"the loco duck.\\" In Well Worn Daffy (1965), Daffy is determined to keep the mice away from a desperately needed well seemingly for no other motive than pure maliciousness. Furthermore, when he draws all the water he wants, Daffy then attempts to destroy the well in spite of the vicious pointlessness of the act, forcing Speedy to stop him. The Warner Bros. studio was entering its twilight years, and even Daffy had to stretch for humor in the period. In many of the later DFE cartoons, such as Feather Finger and Daffy's Diner, Daffy is portrayed as a more sympathetic character (often forced to turn against Speedy at the behest of a common enemy) rather than the full-blown villain he is in cartoons like Well Worn Daffy and Assault and Peppered. The last cartoon featuring Daffy and Speedy is See Ya Later Gladiator, in what animation fans call the worst cartoon made by Warner Bros. =The Daffy Duck Show= In light of the longstanding popularity of The Bugs Bunny Show and its various incarnations on CBS and ABC, NBC commissioned their own half-hour series, The Daffy Duck Show, which began airing in the fall of 1978. While some well-known titles were included in the program, most of the cartoons featured on the series were from the late '60s Depatie-Freleng run. The program ran on NBC for two years, then in 1981 was rechristened The Daffy/Speedy Show and ran for another two years. Eventually, NBC cancelled the series, and many of the cartoons were reintegrated into the lineups for the respective CBS and ABC Bugs Bunny shows. =More recent years= Daffy appeared in later cartoons. He was one of many Looney Tunes characters licensed by Warner Bros. to appear in the 1988 Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In the film, Daffy (utilizing his original, wacky characterization) shares a scene with his Disney counterpart and rival Donald Duck whilst performing in a piano duel. In 1987, to celebrate Daffy's 50th anniversary, Warner Bros. released \\"The Duxorcist\\" as its first theatrical Looney Tunes short in two decades. Daffy Duck also appeared in several feature-film compilations, including two films centering on Daffy. The first was released in 1983, Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island; the second came in 1988, Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, which is considered one of the Looney Tunes' best compilation films and featured another new theatrical short, \\"The Night of the Living Duck\\". Daffy has also had major roles in films such as Space Jam in 1996 and Looney Tunes: Back in Action in 2003. The latter film does much to flesh out his character, even going so far as to cast a sympathetic light on Daffy's glory-seeking ways in one scene, where he complains that he works tirelessly without achieving what Bugs does without even trying. That same year, Warner Bros. cast him in a brand-new Duck Dodgers series. (It should be stressed that in this show, Duck Dodgers actually is Daffy Duck due to him being frozen in suspended animation in some unknown incident.) He had a cameo appearance in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries episode \\"When Granny Ruled the Earth\\", first airing on March 27, 1999. Daffy has also been featured in several webtoons, which can be viewed online. Daffy has also made appearances on numerous television series. In Tiny Toon Adventures, Daffy is a teacher at Acme Looniversity, where he is the hero and mentor of student Plucky Duck. Daffy is shown as a baby in Baby Looney Tunes and appears to have a similar personality to some of his earlier years with him being a rival of Bugs and saying Woo-hoo! a lot. show and made occasional cameo appearances on Animaniacs and Histeria!. In Loonatics Unleashed, his descendant is Danger Duck (voiced by Jason Marsden), who is also lame and unpopular to his teammates. A majority of these appearances try to emulate Chuck Jones of the characters. Daffy has also been given larger roles in more recent Looney Tunes films and series. Following Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Warner Bros. has slowly moved the spotlight away from Bugs and more towards Daffy, as shown in the 2006 direct-to-video movie Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas, where Daffy plays the lead, while Bugs appears in a minor supporting role. Daffy's appearance in The Looney Tunes Show. However, more recent merchandise of the duck as well as that featured on the official website have been shown to incorporate elements of the zanier, more light- hearted Daffy of the 1930s and 1940s. Producer Larry Doyle noted that recent theatrical cartoons were planned that would portray a more diverse Daffy closer to that of Robert McKimson's design; however, due to the box office bomb of Looney Tunes: Back in Action, these new films ceased production. Daffy returned to Cartoon Network in The Looney Tunes Show, voiced by Jeff Bergman. His characterization here seems to incorporate some elements of Clampett's and Jones' designs while giving him an overall cheery if dimwitted personality. In the show, he has moved out of the forest and shares Bugs's house with him. Unlike Bugs and their neighbors, Daffy has no way of earning money and relies on Bugs for food and shelter. He tried on numerous occasions to get rich quick, but ended up failing repeatedly. Daffy's one possession he is proud of is his paper-mache parade float, constructed on top of a flatbed truck, which is his main means of transportation. While Daffy's greed and jealousy of Bugs remains, he appears to be less antagonistic in this show, as Bugs even tells Daffy in spite of his faults, he is Bugs' best friend and vice versa. Daffy serves as a sort of mentor to Gossamer. Daffy has difficulty telling fiction from reality; he often confuses television shows for his own life, believes Bugs is Superman, and at one point hallucinates he is a wizard. Daffy starred in the 3-D short Daffy's Rhapsody with Elmer Fudd that was originally set to premiere before Happy Feet Two but instead debuted prior to Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. The short features Daffy and Elmer in the first CG or 3-D depiction of these specific Looney Tunes characters. According to Matthew O‚ÄôCallaghan, who directed the short, the audio comes from a 1950s recording for a children's album. Daffy is performing in a hunting musical, when Elmer, who is in the audience, pursues him. Daffy is initially unaware of the danger, but quickly realizes the threat Elmer poses and outwits him by using the props against him. Daffy appeared shortly in the 2015 DTV movie Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run. Daffy appears in the Cartoon Network series New Looney Tunes where he is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and has the screwball personality that Tex Avery and Bob Clampett originally gave him in the 30s and 40s. Daffy is often paired with Porky where Daffy will annoy and bedevil the pig, though occasionally Porky one ups Daffy. Daffy appears in Looney Tunes Cartoons, where he is voiced by Eric Bauza and is once again depicted as his original screwball self. Comics Dell Comics published several Daffy Duck comic books, beginning in Four Color Comics #457, #536, and #615 and then continuing as Daffy #4-17 (1956‚Äì59), then as Daffy Duck #18-30 (1959‚Äì62). The comic book series was subsequently continued in Gold Key Comics Daffy Duck #31-127 (1962‚Äì79). This run was in turn continued under the Whitman Comics imprint until the company completely ceased comic book publication in 1984. In 1994, corporate cousin DC Comics became the publisher for comics featuring all the classic Warner Bros. cartoon characters, and while not getting his own title, Daffy has appeared in many issues of Looney Tunes.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles. He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \\"Th-th-th-that's all folks!\\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series (when Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying, in his Brooklynese accent, \\"And Dat's De End!\\"). He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character. Porky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \\"What's going on?\\" might become \\"What's guh-guh-guh-guh‚Äî...what's happening?\\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in Porky's Preview), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head, and his attempt to close the show with \\"The End\\" becomes \\"Th- Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks!\\" Porky Pig appeared in 153 cartoons in the Golden age of American animation. Early films The character was introduced in the short I Haven't Got a Hat (first released on March 2, 1935), directed by Friz Freleng. Studio head Leon Schlesinger suggested that Freleng do a cartoon version of the popular Our Gang films. Porky only has a minor role in the film, but the fat little stuttering pig quickly became popular. Porky's name came from two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng, nicknamed \\"Porky\\" and \\"Piggy\\".Beck, Jerry. Audio commentary for I Haven't Got a Hat on the Warner Brothers DVD set Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3. (2005) citing Freleng's autobiography. Since Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had left the studio in 1933, taking the studio's star character Bosko with them, Looney Tunes had been kept afloat by cartoons featuring the bland Buddy. Porky's introduction ushered Buddy out the door and pointed to things to come. Tex Avery was hired to the studio in 1935, and his film Gold Diggers of '49 reused much of the cast from I Haven't Got a Hat, albeit in wildly different roles. Porky transitioned from a shy little boy to an immensely fat adult. Though he was still in a supporting role, Porky got most of the laughs. The directors realized they had a star on their hands. Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him, Joe Dougherty, who was actually a person who stuttered. Because Dougherty could not control his stutter, however, production costs became too high as his recording sessions took hours, and Porky's additional lines were done by Count Cutelli.\\"Who Was Count Cutelli?\\". Retrieved 2019-11-08. The versatile Mel Blanc replaced Dougherty in 1937. Blanc continued the stutter; however, it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect (such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty, or vice versa). This is parodied in A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court, where Bugs Bunny struggles to pronounce the word \\"porcupine\\", which Porky pronounces with no trouble. Porky's Duck Hunt was released in 1937, and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989. In later interviews, Blanc often said that he intended Porky's stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs. Porky's Duck Hunt was also the first film of another Looney Tunes star, Daffy Duck. Clampett's Porky Bob Clampett's Porky Pig intro in 1938‚Äì1939 Porky starred in dozens of films in the late 1930s. The directors still did not have a grasp on the character, however; his appearance, age, and personality all varied from picture to picture. Several such cartoons show Porky as a child with parents: father Phineas (Porky the Rainmaker, Milk and Money, Porky's Poppa, and Porky and Teabiscuit) and an unnamed mom (Wholly Smoke and Porky's Hero Agency). Bob Clampett finally pinned Porky down in 1939, making him a permanent young adult: cuter, slimmer, smarter, and eventually less of a stutterer. Also, some cartoons show Porky as an antagonist (Porky's Duck Hunt, Porky's Hare Hunt, My Favorite Duck, A Corny Concerto, Duck Soup to Nuts, Daffy Doodles, Daffy Duck Hunt, Boobs in the Woods, Thumb Fun and Cracked Quack). Eventually, he settled into a kind persona. Clampett's Porky was an innocent traveler, taking in the wonders of the world‚Äîand in Clampett's universe, the world is a very weird place indeed.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons (Revised Edition), 1987, Plume (Softcover) (Hardcover). This principle is perhaps best demonstrated in Porky in Wackyland, a film that sends Porky on a quest to find the last of the surreal Dodos, Yoyo Dodo. Porky in Wackyland was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry in 2000. In his commentary as part of the 1970s documentary film Bugs Bunny: Superstar, Clampett said that his early version of Tweety Bird had to be redesigned after his first picture because the producers thought he \\"looked naked\\". Meanwhile, as Clampett noted, nothing was ever made of the fact that \\"all those years, Porky never wore any pants!\\" However, Porky was seen with pants in Porky's Badtime Story, Tick Tock Tuckered and Brother Brat. As a sidekick Porky's post at the pinnacle of the Warners' pantheon was short- lived. In 1937, the studio tried pairing Porky with various sidekicks, such as love interest Petunia Pig, cantankerous foil Gabby Goat, and a screwy black duck, Daffy. Daffy Duck, the creation of Tex Avery, was by far the most popular, eventually outshining even Porky. In fact, Friz Freleng satirized this phenomenon when he directed You Ought to Be in Pictures (1940), where Daffy convinces Porky to quit his job at Warner Bros. to find better-paying work elsewhere. In turn, Porky convinces studio head Leon Schlesinger to release him from his contract. After a highly unsuccessful foray into the real world, Porky returns happily to the studio that created him. To this day, Porky remains as a loyal sidekick while Daffy refuses to be a second banana to Bugs Bunny, who rose to prominence shortly after Daffy. Porky always remained a sentimental favorite of the Warner directors. His mild-mannered nature and shy demeanor made him the perfect straight man for zanier characters such as Daffy. He still starred in a few solo cartoons as well, such as Frank Tashlin's Brother Brat. Other cartoons dumbed Porky down and cast him as a duck hunter after Daffy, largely paralleling the Elmer Fudd/Bugs Bunny pairings. Chuck Jones perfected the Porky-as-straightman scenarios, pairing the pig with Daffy Duck in a series of film and television parodies such as Drip-Along Daffy, Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century, Rocket Squad, Deduce, You Say! and Robin Hood Daffy. Jones also paired Porky with Sylvester in a series of cartoons in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in which Porky plays the curmudgeonly and naive owner of the cat and remains clueless that Sylvester is constantly saving him from homicidal mice, space aliens and other threats. Later years Porky was used in regular rotation in television syndication beginning in the 1960s, as was the rest of his Looney Tunes co-stars. A Saturday morning cartoon, The Porky Pig Show, ran from 1964 to 1967.imdb.com - The Porky Pig Show. In 1971, he starred in another show, Porky Pig and Friends. Both of these programs were collections of old theatrical shorts. Porky also appeared in all the classic film-feature compilations in the 1970s and 1980s. Another such collection was the 1986 film, Porky Pig in Hollywood, which ran in art and college theaters. In the 1990s animated series Tiny Toon Adventures, Porky appears as the mentor of Hamton J. Pig. Porky also made cameo appearances on Animaniacs and Histeria!. Porky has a cameo at the end of the Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), where, paired with Disney's Tinkerbell, he has the duty of closing the movie with his famous line \\"Th-Th-Th-That's All Folks!\\". It was the last time that Mel Blanc voiced Porky before his death in 1989. Porky is the star of the Super NES video game Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday (1995). He also made appearances in the games Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal, Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!, Looney Tunes: Space Race, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage and The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout. Porky appears in the movie Space Jam (1996) and collaborates with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and Sylvester in challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. He tries to get Michael Jordan's autograph when the basketball star is first recruited to join the team and later plays for the Toon Squad in the game itself, scoring one basket. Porky tries to end the movie with his famous line but is prevented through the combined efforts of Bugs, Daffy and the Nerdlucks. In the movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003), Porky makes a cameo appearance alongside Speedy Gonzales, where they both lament their politically incorrect status. At the end of the movie, Porky tries to say his classic line, but stutters so much, the lights are turned off around him as the studio closes for the night; so an irritated Porky simply says, \\"Go home, folks.\\" Porky appears as a toddler version of himself in Baby Looney Tunes (2002), albeit only in the show's musical numbers. Petunia functioned as the show's more major pig character. Porky appears as the \\"Eager Young Space Cadet\\" in the animated series Duck Dodgers (2003‚Äì2005). Porky has a descendant in Loonatics Unleashed (2005‚Äì2007) named Pinkster Pig (who was also voiced by Bob Bergen). Pinkster had been an old friend of Danger Duck (Daffy Duck's descendant), but became a villain when he was adopted by Stoney and Bugsy (descendants of Rocky and Mugsy). Porky also appears in most episodes of Cartoon Network's animated series The Looney Tunes Show (2011‚Äì2014), voiced here by Bob Bergen. He is still friends with Daffy Duck and often sucked into Daffy's schemes. Porky is also Bugs' nervous, fall guy buddy, similar to their relationship in classic comic books. It is also revealed in the show that in his high school years, he was a jock who bullied Daffy. In the documentary I Know That Voice (2013), Bob Bergen explains how to recreate the pig's famous stutter, demonstrating how difficult it is to do it without practice. He finishes the segment by joking \\"Nobody [else] can do that, and that's why I have job security!\\" Porky appears in the direct-to-video movie Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run (2015). Porky Pig appears as a recurring character in New Looney Tunes, voiced once again by Bob Bergen. Here, he is shown to be fatter, like some of his earlier appearances in the mid-1930s. Porky was first mentioned in \\"Dust Bugster\\", where he told Bugs about a television series whose name was not mentioned that led to Bugs binge-watching it. In the 2018 DC Comics and Looney Tunes comic crossovers, Porky appeared in a story which paired him with Lex Luthor. This version of Porky was the successful owner of a company named Porkybux before it was hacked and ran him out of business. He is later approached by Lex to be in charge of LexCorp's social media division and lets Lex get away with harassing his employees and stealing their sandwiches as repayment for the second chance. It is later revealed that Lex gave him the position so he could frame Porky when Lex used his social media website to steal important passwords from their users. Porky begins an autobiography in prison to expose Lex for his actions. In the backup story stylized more like Looney Tunes, Porky tries selling Acme office supplies to Lex, but ends up stopping Lex from defeating Superman.Lex Luthor/Porky Pig #1 Porky's latest appearance is in Looney Tunes Cartoons, where he is once again voiced by Bob Bergen. His personality is based on the earlier shorts, however, his appearance is based on later shorts like The Looney Tunes Show for example. He is mostly paired with Daffy Duck who always drives him crazy. A humanoid version of Porky also appeared in Tom King's Batman/Elmer Fudd Special, where he ran a bar called Porky's which often featured attendants that were humanoid versions of other Looney Tunes characters. The bar and Porky also made a cameo in Tom King's Batman series.Batman/Elmer Fudd Special #1 \\"Blooper\\" A very short black-and-white cartoon was made in 1938 as part of a Warner Bros. blooper reel. It was shown on the Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary TV show. Porky is shown doing some carpentry work, pounding nails, when he smacks his thumb with the hammer. Grimacing in pain, he cries, \\"Oh, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-bi-... gun!\\" He then turns to the viewers and says \\"Ha-ha-ha!

Unlike politburos (political bureaus) of other Communist parties, power within the politburo is centralized in the Politburo Standing Committee, a smaller group of Politburo members. The Politburo is nominally elected by the Central Committee. In practice, however, scholars of Chinese elite politics believe that the Politburo is a self-perpetuating body, with new members of both the Politburo and its Standing Committee chosen through a series of deliberations by current Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members. The current and former Politburo members conduct a series of informal straw polls to determine the group's level of support for each new candidate's membership in the Politburo. The process for selecting the new Politburo begins with a closed door meeting by the incumbent Politburo Standing Committee in Beidaihe in the summer before the Party National Congress convenes. The power of the Politburo resides largely in the fact that its members generally simultaneously hold positions within the People's Republic of China state positions and with the control over personnel appointments that the Politburo and Secretariat have. In addition, some Politburo members hold powerful regional positions. How the Politburo works internally is unclear, but it appears that the full Politburo meets once a month and the standing committee meets weekly. This is believed to be much more infrequent than the former Soviet Politburo had met. The agenda for the meetings appears to be controlled by the General Secretary and decisions are made by consensus rather than by majority vote.

Usually constructed of concrete or asphalt, it is designed for pedestrians. A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb. There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the sidewalk and the roadway or between the sidewalk and the boundary. In some places, the same term may also be used for a paved path, trail or footpath that is not next to a road, for example, a path through a park. Terminology The term \\"sidewalk\\" is preferred in most of North America. The term \\"pavement\\" is more common in the United Kingdom and other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as parts of the Mid-Atlantic United States such as Philadelphia and parts of New Jersey.Cassidy, Frederic Gomes, and Joan Houston Hall (eds). (2002) Dictionary of American Regional English. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Many Commonwealth countries use the term \\"footpath\\". The professional, civil engineering and legal term for this in North America is \\"sidewalk\\" while in the United Kingdom it is \\"footway\\". In the United States, the term sidewalk is used for the pedestrian path beside a road. \\"Shared use paths\\" or \\"multi-use paths\\" are available for use by both pedestrians and bicyclists. \\"Walkway\\" is a more comprehensive term that includes stairs, ramps, passageways, and related structures that facilitate the use of a path as well as the sidewalk. In the UK, the term \\"footpath\\" is mostly used for paths that do not abut a roadway. The term \\"shared-use path\\" is used where cyclists are also able to use the same section of path as pedestrians. History East India House, Leadenhall Street, London, 1766. The sidewalk is separated from the main street by six bollards in front of the building. Raised wooden sidewalk by a dirt road, Staten Island, N.Y. early 20th century Sidewalks have operated for at least 4000 years. The Greek city of Corinth had sidewalks by the 4th-century BCE, and the Romans built sidewalks ‚Äì they called them sƒìmitae.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/semita#Latin semita However, by the Middle Ages, narrow roads had reverted to being simultaneously used by pedestrians and wagons without any formal separation between the two categories. Early attempts at ensuring the adequate maintenance of foot-ways or sidewalks were often made, as in the 1623 Act for Colchester, but they were generally not very effective. Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, attempts were slowly made to bring some order to the sprawling city. In 1671, 'Certain Orders, Rules and Directions Touching the Paving and Cleansing The Streets, Lanes and Common Passages within the City of London' were formulated, calling for all streets to be adequately paved for pedestrians with cobblestones. Purbeck stone was widely used as a durable paving material. Bollards were also installed to protect pedestrians from the traffic in the middle of the road. The British House of Commons passed a series of Paving Acts from the 18th century. The 1766 Paving & Lighting Act authorized the City of London Corporation to establish foot-ways throughout all the streets of London, to pave them with Purbeck stone (the thoroughfare in the middle was generally cobblestone) and to raise them above the street level with curbs forming the separation. The Corporation was also made responsible for the regular upkeep of the roads, including their cleaning and repair, for which they charged a tax from 1766. Another turning point was the construction of Paris's Pont Neuf (1578-1606) which set several trends including wide, raised sidewalks separating pedestrians from the road traffic, plus the first Parisian bridge without houses built on it, and its generous width plus elegant, durable design that immediately became popular for promenading at the beginning of the century that saw Paris take its form renown to this day. It was also a cultural phenomenon because all classes mixed on the new walkways. By the 19th-century large and spacious sidewalks were routinely constructed in European capitals, and were associated with urban sophistication. In the United States, adjoining property owners must in most situations finance all or part of the cost of sidewalk construction. In a legal case in 1917 involving E. L. Stewart, a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and a lawyer in Minden in Webster Parish, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that owners must pay whether they wish for the sidewalk to be constructed or not. Benefits =Transportation= Pedestrians walking on the pavement (sidewalk) in London. Sidewalk at Kauppakatu in Tampere, Finland. Sidewalks play an important role in transportation, as they provide a safe path for people to walk along that is separated from the motorized traffic. They aid road safety by minimizing interaction between pedestrians and motorized traffic. Sidewalks are normally in pairs, one on each side of the road, with the center section of the road for motorized vehicles. In rural roads, sidewalks may not be present as the amount of traffic (pedestrian or motorized) may not be enough to justify separating the two. In suburban and urban areas, sidewalks are more common. In town and city centers (known as downtown in North America) the amount of pedestrian traffic can exceed motorized traffic, and in this case the sidewalks can occupy more than half of the width of the road, or the whole road can be reserved for pedestrians, see Pedestrian zone. =Environment= Sidewalks may have a small effect on reducing vehicle miles traveled and carbon dioxide emissions. A study of sidewalk and transit investments in Seattle neighborhoods found vehicle travel reductions of 6 to 8% and CO2 emission reductions of 1.3 to 2.2% =Road traffic safety= Sidewalk with bike path Research commissioned for the Florida Department of Transportation, published in 2005, found that, in Florida, the Crash Reduction Factor (used to estimate the expected reduction of crashes during a given period) resulting from the installation of sidewalks averaged 74%. Research at the University of North Carolina for the U.S. Department of Transportation found that the presence or absence of a sidewalk and the speed limit are significant factors in the likelihood of a vehicle/pedestrian crash. Sidewalk presence had a risk ratio of 0.118, which means that the likelihood of a crash on a road with a paved sidewalk was 88.2 percent lower than one without a sidewalk. ‚ÄúThis should not be interpreted to mean that installing sidewalks would necessarily reduce the likelihood of pedestrian/motor vehicle crashes by 88.2 percent in all situations. However, the presence of a sidewalk clearly has a strong beneficial effect of reducing the risk of a ‚Äòwalking along roadway‚Äô pedestrian/motor vehicle crash.‚Äù The study does not count crashes that happen when walking across a roadway. The speed limit risk ratio was 1.116, which means that a 16.1-km/h (10-mi/h) increase in the limit yields a factor of (1.116)10 or 3. The presence or absence of sidewalks was one of three factors that were found to encourage drivers to choose lower, safer speeds. On the other hand, the implementation of schemes which involve the removal of sidewalks, such as shared space schemes, are reported to deliver a dramatic drop in crashes and congestion too, which indicates that a number of other factors, such as the local speed environment, also play an important role in whether sidewalks are necessarily the best local solution for pedestrian safety. In cold weather, black ice is a common problem with unsalted sidewalks. The ice forms a thin transparent surface film which is almost impossible to see, and so results in many slips by pedestrians. Riding bicycles on sidewalks is discouraged since some research shows it to be more dangerous than riding in the street. Some jurisdictions prohibit sidewalk riding except for children. In addition to the risk of cyclist/pedestrian collisions, cyclists face increase risks from collisions with motor vehicles at street crossings and driveways. Riding in the direction opposite to traffic in the adjacent lane is especially risky. =Health= Since residents of neighborhoods with sidewalks are more likely to walk, they tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other health issues related to sedentary lifestyles. Also, children who walk to school have been shown to have better concentration. =Social uses= Native Americans busking at Orchard Road, Singapore Some sidewalks may be used as social spaces with sidewalk cafes, markets, or busking musicians, as well as for parking for a variety of vehicles including cars, motorbikes and bicycles. Construction Contemporary sidewalks are most often made of concrete in North America, while tarmac, asphalt, brick, stone, slab and (increasingly) rubber are more common in Europe. Different materials are more or less friendly environmentally: pumice-based trass, for example, when used as an extender is less energy-intensive than Portland cement concrete or petroleum-based materials such as asphalt or tar-penetration macadam. Multi- use paths alongside roads are sometimes made of materials that are softer than concrete, such as asphalt. =Wood= In the 19th century and early 20th century, sidewalks of wood were common in some North American locations. They may still be found at historic beach locations and in conservation areas to protect the land beneath and around, called boardwalks. =Brick= Most sidewalks in Cambridge, Massachusetts are made of brick, formerly locally produced Brick sidewalks are found in some urban areas, usually for aesthetic purposes. Brick sidewalks are generally consolidated with brick hammers, rollers, and sometimes motorized vibrators. Four tessellations used in laying brick sidewalks =Stone= Stone slab sidewalk Stone slabs called flagstones or flags are sometimes used where an attractive appearance is required, as in historic town centers. =Stone and concrete pavers= Pre-cast concrete pavers are used for sidewalks, often colored or textured to resemble stone. Sometimes cobblestones are used, though they are generally considered too uneven for comforable walking. File:Sidewalk construction.JPGInstallation of crushed stone underlayment for drainage File:Sidewalk construction 2.JPGInstallation of paver blocks =Concrete= Freshly laid concrete sidewalk, with horizontal strain-relief grooves faintly visible In the United States and Canada, the most common type of sidewalk consists of a poured concrete ribbon, examples of which from as early as the 1860s can be found in good repair in San Francisco, and stamped with the name of the contractor and date of installation. When Portland cement was first imported to the United States in the 1880s, its principal use was in the construction of sidewalks. Today, most sidewalk ribbons are constructed with cross-lying strain-relief grooves placed or sawn at regular intervals typically apart. This partitioning, an improvement over the continuous slab, was patented in 1924 by Arthur Wesley Hall and William Alexander McVay, who wished to minimize damage to the concrete from the effects of tectonic and temperature fluctuations, both of which can crack longer segments.Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions ‚Äì 1833‚Äì1950, Goose Lane Editions, 2001, p. 73 The technique is not perfect, as freeze-thaw cycles (in cold-weather regions) and tree root growth can eventually result in damage which requires repair. In highly variable climates which undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles, concrete blocks will be formed with separations, called expansion joints, to allow for thermal expansion without breakage. The use of expansion joints in sidewalks may not be necessary, as the concrete will shrink while setting. =Tarmac and asphalt= In the United Kingdom, Australia and France suburban sidewalks are most commonly constructed of tarmac. In urban or inner-city areas sidewalks are most commonly constructed of slabs, stone, or brick depending upon the surrounding street architecture and furniture.

They are called \\"John Doe\\" or \\"Jane Doe\\" followed by a number sign (#) and a number. In the same cemetery, the murdered Deanna Criswell was called \\"Jane Doe 19\\" for 27 years until she was genetically identified in 2015 by her relatives with help from the FBI and The Doe Network. \\"John Doe\\" (for males) and \\"Jane Doe\\" (for females) are multiple-use names that are used when the true name of a person is unknown or is being intentionally concealed. In the context of law enforcement in the United States, such names are often used to refer to a corpse whose identity is unknown or unconfirmed. Secondly, such names are also often used to refer to a hypothetical \\"everyman\\" in other contexts, in a manner similar to \\"John Q. Public\\" or \\"Joe Public\\". There are many variants to the above names, including \\"John Roe\\", \\"Richard Roe\\", \\"Jane Roe\\" and \\"Baby Doe\\", \\"Janie Doe\\" or \\"Johnny Doe or comedic Dill\\" (for children). Use in criminal investigation In other English-speaking countries, unique placeholder names, numbers or codenames have become more often used in the context of police investigations. This has included the United Kingdom, where usage of \\"John Doe\\" originated during the Middle Ages. However, the legal term John Doe injunction or John Doe order has survived in English law and other legal systems influenced by it. Other names such as \\"Joe Bloggs\\" or \\"John Smith\\" have sometimes been informally used as placeholders for an everyman in the UK, Australia and New Zealand; such names are seldom used in legal or police circles in the same sense as John Doe. Well-known legal cases named after placeholders include: * the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decisions regarding abortion: Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton (1973) and; * the civil cases Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544 (England), McKeogh v. John Doe (Ireland; 2012) and Uber Technologies, Inc. v. Doe I (California, 2015). Use of \\"John Doe\\" in the sense of an everyman, includes: * the 1941 film Meet John Doe. Use of \\"John Doe\\" in the sense of an unidentified man (anonymous), includes: * the 1995 film Seven. Use of \\"Jane Doe\\" in the sense of an unidentified corpse, includes: * the 2016 film The Autopsy of Jane Doe. History Under the legal terminology of Ancient Rome, the names \\"Numerius Negidius\\" and \\"Aulus Agerius\\" were used in relation to hypothetical defendants and plaintiffs. The name \\"John Doe\\" (or \\"John Doo\\"), \\"Richard Roe\\", along with \\"John Roe\\", were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England's King Edward III (1327‚Äì1377). Though the rationale behind the choices of Doe and Roe is unknown, there are many suggested folk etymologies. Other fictitious names for a person involved in litigation in medieval English law were \\"John Noakes\\" (or \\"Nokes\\") and \\"John- a-Stiles\\" (or \\"John Stiles\\"). The Oxford English Dictionary states that John Doe is \\"the name given to the fictitious lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe\\". This usage is mocked in the 1834 English song \\"John Doe and Richard Roe\\": This particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852: In the UK, usage of \\"John Doe\\" survives mainly in the form of John Doe injunction or John Doe order (see above). Unlike the United States, the name \\"John Doe\\" does not actually appear in the formal name of the case, for example: X & Y v Persons Unknown [2007] HRLR 4. Well-known cases of unidentified corpses include \\"Cali Doe\\" (1979) and \\"Princess Doe\\" (1982). The baby victim in a 2001 murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, was referred to as Precious Doe. In 2009, the New York Times reported the difficulties and unwanted attention experienced by a man actually named John Doe, who had often been suspected of using a pseudonym. He had been questioned repeatedly by airport security staff. Another man named John Doe was often suspected of being an incognito celebrity. Other variants In cases where a large number of unidentified individuals are mentioned, numbers may be appended, such as \\"Doe #2\\" or \\"Doe II\\". Operation Delego (2009), which targeted an international child sexual abuse ring, cited 21 numbered \\"John Does\\", as well as other people known by the surnames \\"Doe\\", \\"Roe\\", and \\"Poe\\". \\"John Stiles\\", \\"Richard Miles\\" have been used for the third and fourth participants in an action. \\"Mary Major\\" has been used in some federal cases in the US. \\"James Doe\\" and \\"Judy Doe\\" are among other common variants. Less often, other surnames ending in -oe have been used when more than two unknown or unidentified persons are named in U.S. court proceedings, e.g., Poe v. Snyder, 834 F.Supp.2d 721 (W. D. Mich. 2011), whose full style is * Jane Poe, John Doe, Richard Roe, Robert Roe, Mark Moe, Larry Loe, Degage Ministries, and Mel Trotter Ministries, Plaintiffs, v.

In Massachusetts, \\"Mary Moe\\" is used to refer to pregnant women under the age of 18 petitioning the Superior Court for a judicial bypass exception to the parental consent requirement for abortion. \\"Mary Moe\\" is also used to refer to such cases generally, i.e. \\"Mary Moe cases\\". Sometimes \\"Mary Doe\\" may be used for the individuals.

With 2,252 stores as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 270,000 employees as of fiscal year 2020, the company is the second-largest supermarket chain in North America after Kroger, which has 2,750 stores. Albertsons ranked 53rd in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Prior to its January 2015 merger with Safeway Inc. for $9.2 billion, it had 1,075 supermarkets located in 29 U.S. states under 12 different banners. Its predecessor company, Albertsons, Inc., was reorganized as Albertsons LLC and sold to AB Acquisition LLC, a Cerberus Capital Management-led consortium. After buying back the majority of its former stores it sold to SuperValu in 2006, AB Acquisition announced it would change its name to Albertsons Companies Inc. in 2015. The company's corporate name was Albertson's Inc. until 2002, when the apostrophe was removed. History =Beginnings= Albertsons was founded by Joe Albertson on July 21, 1939, in Boise, Idaho. An ad in the Idaho Statesman newspaper touted Joe Albertson's first store as \\"Idaho's largest and finest food store.\\" The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop. The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979 and a replacement store built on the same property. A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store. The cheese department of an Albertsons in Seattle (1955) Joe Albertson's grocery store was an enormous success, and he reinvested his profits back into the business. New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west, Nampa, Caldwell, and Emmett, before Pearl Harbor in late 1941. The company grew steadily in the years following World War II. When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with much children's clothing hanging on clotheslines; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores. Albertsons, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its 100th store in Seattle in 1964. In 1966, Albertsons expanded to southern California by acquiring Greater All American Markets, a small chain in Orange County. =Partnership with Skaggs/Expansion in the 1970's= In 1969, Albertsons partnered with Skaggs Drug Centers, owned by The Skaggs Companies, Inc., to create the first combination food/drug stores, first in Texas. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy each other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and Albertsons kept stores in Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, as well as some Texas stores (based in San Antonio). Albertsons continued to expand its base in the West during this time, buying Fazio's-Shopping Bag in 1972 from Fisher Foods, adding 46 stores to the Los Angeles area. In 1974, Albertson's bought the 4-store Monte Mart chain in northern California. =Expansion in the 1980s= In 1982, Albertsons reorganized its management into four regions: California, Northwest, Intermountain, and South. Albertsons continued to add stores in the 1980s, building or acquiring about 283 stores during the decade. Albertsons continued to expand in Texas beyond the Skaggs base in north Texas and San Antonio, entering the Dallas-Fort Worth market in 1984, and adding three Skaggs-Alpha Beta stores in Austin within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six Tom Thumb stores. In March 1989, Albertsons opened its 500th store, in Temecula, California. =Expansion in the 1990s= Albertsons began to expand heavily in the 1990s. In 1992, Albertsons bought the stores American Stores (formerly Skaggs Drugs Cos.) had in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida. Many of the stores had been opened as Skaggs Albertsons originally (later turning into \\"Skaggs Alpha Beta\\" under American Stores ownership) but by 1991 had been rebranded as Jewel-Osco. These included a few stores that American Stores opened in the late 1980s under that name in Florida. Additionally, a non-food distributions center in Ponca City, Oklahoma, was purchased from ASC. In 1994, Albertsons would acquire 4 stores from San Diego County chain Big Bear Markets. The Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons' Southern division. The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons' high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale. In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons purchased Seessel's and 14 other stores from Bruno's, Buttrey Food & Drug (divesting seven Buttrey stores and six Albertsons stores to Smith's and another two Buttrey stores to SuperValu), the Springfield, Missouri Smitty's chain, and three Super One Foods stores from Miner's Inc. in the Des Moines market, all while building new stores across all divisions. These acquisitions brought Albertsons into five new states: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Tennessee. =American Stores= A typical Albertsons in Boise, Idaho, in June 2007 In 1999, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition yet: American Stores Company, which included the chains ACME in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware; Lucky in California and Nevada; Jewel, Jewel- Osco in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, and two drug store chains: Osco Drug, with a presence in the Midwest and Arizona; and Sav-on Drugs, with a presence in Southern California, Nevada, Western Arizona, and New Mexico. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American food and drug operator, with over 2,500 stores (including stand-alone drug stores) in 37 states, until Kroger's acquisition of Fred Meyer closed the following month. To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to divest 146 stores, primarily in California, Nevada, and New Mexico to Certified Grocers, Raley's, Ralphs, Stater Bros., and Vons. In California, there were already Albertsons, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired. In January 2001, Albertsons restructured its \\"districts\\" to a divisional structure mostly based around distribution centers, with a drug store division and 18 regional division offices. =2001‚Äì2004 restructuring= On July 18, 2001, Larry Johnston, the new chairman and CEO of Albertson's, announced it would close 165 \\"underperforming\\" stores spread across 25 states, cut jobs, and reduce its newly created operating divisions. The first change was that the Utah, Idaho, and Big Sky (Montana) division were merged back into Intermountain, while Oregon, Washington, and the Inland Empire (eastern Washington and Northern Idaho) division would be consolidated back into a single Northwestern division. Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drug store company (those stores were re-branded as Brooks Pharmacy after the sale was completed in January 2002). In 2001, the short-lived Des Moines stores would close as well\\"Albertson's plans to close all 3 metro-area groceries\\" Des Moines Register ‚Äì Des Moines, Iowa Subjects: Business closings Author: Bergstrom, Kathy Date: October 3, 2001 Start Page: D.1 Section: BUSINESS Abstract (Document Summary) The Des Moines area stores closing are at 100 Army Post Road and 3400 E. 33rd St. and in Urbandale at 3799 86th St. Albertson's said it would seek a buyer for the locations of the stores, the firm's only supermarkets in Iowa. and Albertsons began to issue Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards for all of its stores. The following year, three more divisions were closed entirely: * San Antonio: Having been in San Antonio since the Skaggs Albertsons days, at the time Albertsons was ranked as the area's number two grocer by market share, compared to H-E-B's top position in the market. At the time of the withdrawal, the 44-store H-E-B chain held a commanding 61 percent market share, while Albertsons held a 15 percent market share. Albertsons had held the third position at the time Kroger exited the market in mid-1993 when it closed its 15 area stores. Then, H-E-B's 37 area stores held a 43.2 percent market share, Kroger's 15 area stores a 13.7 percent share, and Albertsons' 10 stores a 13.1 percent share. The remaining stores in the San Antonio division, primarily in the Austin area, became part of the Dallas division. The last store in South Texas to close, a store in Victoria, Texas, was closed in October. * Mid-South: In 2002, Albertsons shuttered its Mid- South division by selling its Seessel's supermarket chain in Memphis to Schnucks and stores in Mississippi to Brookshire's. The stores in the Nashville area, most of which were former Bruno's stores, were sold to Publix. * Houston: After entering the market in the early 1990s, the troubled Houston division would be gone too, with Albertsons closing its 43 area stores, with most reopening as Kroger or Randalls (acquired with Safeway in 2015 and subsequent return to Houston), with 2 of them becoming H-E-B stores. The Louisiana stores from that division joined the Florida division (though they would move to the Dallas division soon after), while the stores in the Bryan‚ÄìCollege Station area became part of the Dallas division. The Greater Houston distribution center near Katy, built in 1996 was sold to 99 Cents Only Stores in 2003. Additionally, the distribution center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (home of the Great Plains division) was sold to Fleming Companies, though no stores were closed. The Great Plains division stretched all the way into Omaha, Nebraska. The sale of the distribution center included a distribution deal for Fleming to continue to supply Oklahoma and Omaha. After stabilizing the company's finances and consolidating divisions, in 2004, Albertsons acquired Shaw's Supermarkets and Star Market from Sainsbury's for $2.5 billion. Albertsons also purchased Bristol Farms for $135 million. During the same time, Albertsons exited the markets of Omaha, Nebraska, where it closed or sold 21 stores, and New Orleans, Louisiana where it closed seven, selling four to A&P;, which converted them to Sav-A-Center. =Sale to Cerberus and SuperValu= Despite this, the acquisition spree had caused significant problems for Albertsons, Inc. Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt. Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as Walmart and Costco that impacted sales. After several assessments of the company and months of rumors, it was announced on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc. was to be sold to a consortium of companies. SuperValu would take the bulk of the company including the brand names and what was considered to be the stronger divisions, including the Albertsons divisions of Southern California, Northwest, and Intermountain, as well as the ACME, Shaw's Supermarkets and Star Market, Bristol Farms, and Jewel-Osco brands. CVS would acquire 702 stand-alone Osco and Sav-on Drug stores (closing about 100 of them) and converting them to CVS/pharmacy stores. What was left of Albertsons Inc. became Albertsons, LLC, purchased by a Cerberus-led group of investors, and CVS Pharmacy. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006, with the Cerberus-led group (who also included Kimco Realty Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corp., Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty). They held Albertsons LLC as \\"AB Acquisition LLC\\". Albertsons LLC included 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions. These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons' five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators. As of June 2, 2006, the company's retail stores were divided as follows: * SuperValu had acquired 1,124 stores in the deal, including:  ACME (134 locations)  ACME Express, Jewel Express, and Albertsons Express (107 fuel centers)  Albertsons (564 locations in Southern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) ‚Äì New Albertsons Inc. (later sold to Albertsons LLC)  Bristol Farms (11 locations)  Jewel and Jewel-Osco (198 locations)  Lazy Acres (1 location)  Max Foods (4 locations) (3 converted into Lucky, 1 became Albertsons in July 2006)  Osco Pharmacy and Sav-on Pharmacy (906 in-store pharmacies)  Save-A-Lot (2 stores franchised by Shaw's)  Shaw's (169 locations)  Star Market (20 locations)  Distribution centers (11 centers) * CVS acquired all (approximately 702) of the stand-alone Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs rebranding them all as CVS Pharmacy, though they closed approximately 100 of the acquired stores. Many CVS locations were close to Sav-on stores. CVS also acquired one distribution center. * The Cerberus-led Albertsons LLC retained:  Albertsons (655 locations in Arizona, Northern California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming ‚Äì Albertsons LLC)  County Line Liquors (1 location)  Grocery Warehouse (1 location)  Jewel-Osco (2 locations)  Max Foods (2 locations)  Super Saver Foods (23 locations, 21 closed in late 2006) Following the sale, Albertson's, Inc., was removed from the NYSE. Albertsons LLC was technically the successor company to Albertsons according to SEC filings but it was New Albertsons Inc. that assumed most of the debt, got most of the property, and transitioned Albertsons stock into SuperValu stock. The five Albertsons Inc. divisions that remained as Albertsons LLC were the Dallas/Fort Worth division (Texas excluding El Paso, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas), the Rocky Mountain division (Colorado, Wyoming (excluding Rock Springs and Jackson stores), Nebraska, and South Dakota), the Southwest division (Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas), the Florida division (Florida), and the Northern California division (northern California and northern Nevada). Albertson's LLC has concentrated on rebuilding market share and its store base in its strongest areas and divesting stores and other property in its weaker areas. On June 6, 2006, only one week after Albertsons LLC was created, the company announced its intent to close 100 Albertsons stores by August 2006, including all but two Super Saver stores.Albertsons to close 100 of its stores Deseret News (Salt Lake City), June 8, 2006. Those closures were spread across all five divisions. Soon after, the company announced that it would be shutting down its online delivery service on July 21, 2006.Albertson's LLC to Close Shutter Online Shopping Service Progressive Grocer/AllBusiness.com, July 13, 2006 To distinguish the two companies, Albertsons LLC created a second website, AlbertsonsMarket.com. =A leaner company= In November 2006, it was announced that the Northern California division, consisting of stores located in northern California and northern Nevada, would be sold to Save Mart, with the deal closing in February 2007.Albertsons is sold in Northern California AllBusiness, November 28, 2006. The company gradually converted all the stores to its Save Mart banner over summer 2007, except for stores in the San Francisco Bay area, which were rebranded as Lucky. The deal included two Northern California distribution centers. Most of the Albertsons locations had originally been branded as Lucky before Albertson's 1999 purchase of American Stores. Most of the changes in the next six years would downscale the remaining divisions. In the Dallas-Fort Worth division, in 2007, the distribution center was sold to Associated Wholesale Grocers, and Albertsons would exit both Oklahoma and Austin. The Oklahoma stores were sold to Associated Wholesale Grocers associates while the Austin stores were sold to H-E-B. With the closures, only four stores south of the Dallas-Fort Worth area existed in Texas, all of which were closed or sold by December 2011. Additionally, many of the Dallas-Fort Worth stores closed during this time, even into 2011. The Florida division, which was always discontiguous with Albertsons' main market, suffered a blow in June 2008 when Albertsons LLC entered into an agreement with Lakeland, Florida-based Publix stores to sell 49 Florida Albertsons locations to the chain. This included 15 stores in Northern and Northwest Florida, 30 locations in Central Florida, and four locations in South Florida. The sale was completed in September.Publix buying 49 Albertsons Stores, AllBusiness, June 9, 2008 In April 2012, the company closed most of its stores in Florida. The Plant City distribution center was sold to Gordon Food Service though the Florida Division continued to be located there. By April 2012, only four stores remained in the entire state of Florida. The Rocky Mountain division slowly shed stores.Albertsons to close nine stores, Rocky Mountain News, January 20, 2007. Albertsons closing 5 Denver-area stores, Denver Business Journal, August 25, 2009. By April 2007, there were only 32 stores left in the state of Colorado. In December 2007, SuperValu acquired the eight remaining Wyoming locations from Albertson's LLC not already owned by the company. These stores continued to operate under the Albertsons banner.Supervalu will acquire Albertsons stores, The Casper Star Tribune, December 20, 2007. 2008 also brought the sale of Albertsons' lone South Dakota and Nebraska stores to Nash Finch. In August 2009, the distribution center and division office closed and the 26 remaining stores moved to the Southwest division. Only the Southwest division was spared the major cuts suffered by the other divisions. On June 12, 2007, Albertson's LLC agreed to acquire all Raley's locations in New Mexico. The acquisition includes one closed and eight operating stores in Albuquerque and one store in Taos, thus doubling Albertsons store base in the Albuquerque region.Albertson's LLC to Acquire Raley's New Mexico Stores , PR Newswire, June 13, 2007. A typical Albertsons-Savon store in Dallas, Texas in October 2005. This store has since been sold as part of FTC-ordered divestment, and later became Minyard Sun Fresh Market, but has since closed. In June 2007, Albertson's LLC decided to discontinue its Preferred Savings Card Program, choosing instead offer discounted items to all of its customers.Albertsons to discontinue loyalty cards today, The Arizona Republic, June 20, 2007. In September 2007, all Albertsons stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Florida markets began collecting their Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards.Albertsons's ditches loyalty cards, Dallas Morning News, September 27, 2007. and in May 2008, Albertsons exited the fuel business and sold 72 Albertsons Express gas stations to Valero Energy, which converted most of them to Corner Store locations. =New Albertsons acquisition= While Albertsons LLC had restored its stores to profitability, SuperValu's New Albertsons Inc. had done poorly. While SuperValu did remodel many stores and open a few new stores, New Albertsons had shrunk. Of the 1100+ stores SuperValu acquired in 2006, less than 900 remained by 2013. Under SuperValu, Bristol Farms had been sold off, 36 Utah stores were sold to Associated Food Stores (leaving just three traditional Albertsons stores in the state), the Wisconsin Jewel-Osco stores had been sold or closed, as well as the Shaw's stores in Connecticut. Additionally, like Albertsons LLC, most of the fuel stations had been shuttered or sold to other operators. On January 10, 2013, it was announced that SuperValu was selling New Albertsons (Albertsons, ACME, Shaw's/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, though they had previously sold off Bristol Farms in 2010) to Cerberus Capital Management. The deal was closed in March 2013. On February 23, 2013, AB Acquisition announced it would split operations of the newly combined company into eight divisions: Northwestern, Intermountain, Southern California, Southern, Jewel-Osco, ACME, Shaw's, and Southwestern, and in March 2013, the deal was officially closed. On paper, Albertsons LLC controlled the Albertsons-branded stores and New Albertsons Inc. controlled ACME, Shaw's/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, but it was operated as one company. On June 11, 2013, Albertsons announced its plans to merge its duplicate websites, social media accounts and mobile apps onto one of each kind, ending the use of the Albertsons Market branding (though this was never used on store exteriors) and AlbertsonsMarket.com. While its website consolidation appeared to take place as expected, its applications received bad reviews‚Äîbut the biggest consequence was the mistaken deletion of their previous Facebook page and loss of over 200,000 fans. While no details were given as to the mistake made, Albertsons simply admitted that while attempting to join their Albertsons page with over 200,000 Likes and their Albertsons Market page with over 80,000 Likes, something went wrong resulting in the loss of thousands of Likes and comments. That same month, Albertsons did away with the Preferred Savings Card in the former SuperValu stores that Albertsons LLC had dispensed with in 2007. The cards briefly continued in Southern California stores before being discontinued in July 2013. =United Supermarkets acquisition= On September 9, 2013, the company acquired Lubbock-based supermarket United Supermarkets LLC. On February 4, 2014 the FTC voted 4‚Äì0 to approve the deal. The acquisition deal cost Albertsons $385 million and required Albertsons to sell its single stores in the Amarillo, Texas and Wichita Falls, Texas markets. The United Supermarkets family brands include Market Street, Amigos, and United Express. After the deal was finalized, the Albertsons Market brand was revived for Albertsons stores operated by United. The first to be branded as such opened in Alamogordo, New Mexico in January 2015. =Safeway acquisition= On February 19, 2014, Safeway began to explore selling itself, and by February 21, 2014, it was in advanced negotiations with Cerberus Capital Management. On March 6, 2014, Cerberus (parent company of Albertsons) announced it would purchase Safeway for $9.4 billion in a deal expected to close in the 4th quarter of the year. On July 25, 2014, Safeway stockholders approved the merger with Albertsons. In December 2014, Albertsons announced that the Haggen Company, a Bellingham, Washington, based grocery chain, was buying 146 Safeway, Albertsons and Vons stores, as required by the antitrust review of the merger. On January 30, 2015, Albertsons officially acquired Safeway Inc. after being cleared by the FTC, thus giving it control of the Safeway store banners, including Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs Safeway, Vons, and Pavilions, plus Safeway's 49% share of Casa Ley, a Mexican grocery chain. Following the merger, Albertsons announced the new company would have 14 divisions led by three regional offices. ;East Region *Acme Division: East Region, existing Acme Markets (based in Malvern, PA). *Eastern Division: East Region, existing Eastern Division of Safeway (based in Lanham, MD). Includes stores in Maryland and Virginia. *Jewel-Osco Division: East Region, existing Jewel-Osco (based in Itasca, IL). *Shaw's Division: East Region, existing Shaw's/Star Market (based in West Bridgewater, MA). ;North Region *Denver Division: North Region, existing Safeway Denver division with some Albertsons stores from Intermountain. Includes stores in most of Colorado (except for the Grand Junction stores which are part of Intermountain, and the Durango stores which are part of Southwest), the eastern two-thirds of Wyoming, all of Nebraska and South Dakota, and Farmington, New Mexico. *Intermountain Division: North Region, most of the existing Albertsons division with some Safeway stores from the Seattle Division. Includes all stores in North Dakota, most of Idaho except for the northern panhandle (which is part of the Seattle Division), most of Utah except for the far southern portion (which is part of the Southwest Division), northeastern Nevada, the western third of Wyoming, and stores in the Grand Junction, Colorado area. *Northern California Division: North Region, existing Safeway division (based in Pleasanton, CA). Includes stores in northern California and northwestern Nevada. *Portland Division: North Region, existing Safeway Portland division with Albertsons stores from Northwestern in Oregon. Includes the entire state of Oregon except for Ontario, plus Clark County, Washington. *Seattle Division: North Region, existing Safeway division with some Albertsons stores from Northwestern. Includes all stores in the state of Washington (except Clark County) and in the northern Idaho Panhandle. ;South Region *Houston Division: South Region, existing Randalls/Tom Thumb division of Safeway, with the inclusion of South's Florida stores and southern Louisiana stores. Tom Thumb moved to Southern Division. Includes stores in Houston and Austin-areas and all Louisiana and Florida stores. *Southern Division: South Region, existing Albertsons South division (based in Fort Worth, TX) combined with Tom Thumb stores. Includes stores in northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana, and all of Arkansas. *Southern California Division: South Region, merged Vons Safeway division (excluding southern Nevada/Las Vegas stores, which became part of the new Southwest Division) with Albertsons division (based in Fullerton, CA). Includes stores in southern California. *Southwest Division: South Region, merged Southwest Safeway and Albertsons divisions (based in Phoenix, AZ). Includes all stores in Arizona, southern Nevada, and Utah, most of New Mexico (except for Farmington which is part of the Denver Division and southeastern New Mexico which is part of the United Division), and El Paso, Texas. *United Division: South Region, existing United division (based in Lubbock, TX). Includes stores in the Texas Panhandle and western Texas (excluding El Paso, which is part of the Southwest Division), and southeastern New Mexico. =Announcement and postponement of going public and A&P; acquisition= After several months of rumors, the combined operation announced it would go public as Albertsons Companies, Inc. (the new name of AB Acquisition LLC). Albertsons attempted to IPO with the ticker ABS on October 14, 2015, planning to raise as much as $1.7 billion, selling 65.3 million shares with a range of $23 - $26 per share. However, the company postponed the listing due to market conditions, particularly after Wal-Mart warned of more challenged sales earlier that day. Albertsons has reportedly postponed the IPO indefinitely, as of October 2015. All during this time, Albertsons continued to expand, purchasing 70 stores owned by the bankrupt Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (operating under the names of The Food Emporium, A&P;, A&P; Fresh, Superfresh, and Pathmark), which were quickly reopened as ACME stores after two-day store resets. =Post-Safeway acquisitions= Albertsons in Weatherford, Texas in May 2017 At the time of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, the 18-store Pacific Northwest chain Haggen purchased 146 West Coast Vons, Pavilions, Albertsons, and Safeway locations that had to be sold due to anti- trust concerns, paying $300 million, plus spending $100 million to rebrand the stores. The FTC had hoped this would create a regional competitor for Albertsons. On September 1, 2015, Haggen announced that the company had filed a lawsuit against Albertsons LLC and Albertsons Holdings LLC (\\"Albertsons\\") seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The complaint, which was filed that day in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleged that following Haggen's December 2014 purchase of 146 Albertsons and Safeway stores, Albertsons engaged in \\"coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition and Haggen as a viable competitor in over 130 local grocery markets in five states,\\" and \\"made false representations to both Haggen and the FTC about Albertsons' commitment to a seamless transformation of the stores into viable competitors under the Haggen banner.\\" A week later Haggen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began the process of closing all but a few dozen 'core' stores in the Pacific Northwest. Albertsons would buy back 33 of the stores being sold at auction. In January 2016, Albertsons settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay $5.75 million to Haggen, and subsequently reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 29 'core' Haggen stores located in Washington and Oregon for $106 million, the deal being approved on March 29, 2016. As part of the deal, 15 stores would still operate under the Haggen banner, with the rest converted to Albertsons locations. During this time, the Albertsons family experienced further changes. On January 11, 2016, it was announced that the three remaining Albertsons stores in Florida, located in Largo, Altamonte Springs and Oakland Park, would be re-bannered as Safeway; this marked the first time that the Safeway brand would exist on a supermarket operation in Florida. It would also re-align the stores toward the Eastern Division. In 2016, smaller acquisitions included Homedale, Idaho-based Paul's Market and Santa Rosa, California-based G&G; Supermarkets. Both brands were closed before they were converted into Albertsons and Safeway stores, respectively. Additionally, the United Supermarkets subsidiary acquired seven locations from Sweetwater, Texas-based Lawrence Brothers. These were converted into United Supermarkets or Albertsons Market stores. In late 2016, it was announced that Andronico's in the San Francisco area would be acquired as well. These stores would become \\"Safeway Community Markets\\" and still hold what made Andronico's unique, including chef-prepared items. When the first store reopened in February 2017 under the ownership of the Northern California division, it was still bannered as Andronico's due to an issue in obtaining local permits but the other stores were able to reopen as Safeway Community Markets. On February 17, 2017, the Randalls store in south Katy, Texas, serving the Cinco Ranch area closed. On March 6, 2017, shortly after the Katy Randalls closure, it was announced that the Houston-area distribution center near Cypress, Texas, would be closed and the operations consolidated in the Roanoke, Texas Tom Thumb distribution center in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex to supply the Houston and Austin-area stores instead. Also, the Houston Division offices would be folded into the legacy Albertsons' South Division offices in Fort Worth. Additionally, the stores in the Albuquerque, New Mexico, market were realigned toward the United Supermarkets division. On September 20, 2017, Albertsons acquired meal kit company Plated for $200 million. On February 20, 2018, Albertsons announced plans to acquire Rite Aid, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In addition to retaining the stand-alone Rite Aid pharmacies, its Osco and Sav-on pharmacies located in Albertsons' existing stores were expected to be rebranded as Rite Aid pharmacies. On August 8, 2018, Rite Aid announced that the plan had failed to please shareholders and the proposed acquisition would be canceled. That same year, Albertsons closed several stores across multiple divisions, including all three Safeway stores in Florida. These stores were sold to Publix for an undisclosed price. With the closing, Albertsons officially exited the state, which it had been since the late 1970s when acquiring their Skaggs Albertsons stores, as well as other stores across divisions. Additionally, the company divested its share in Casa Ley, selling it to Tenedora CL del Noroeste. In 2019, Albertsons opened Albertsons Market Street in Meridian, Idaho, a flagship store located in a converted Shopko store and based on the Market Street brand of United Supermarkets. This became Albertsons largest store at 110,000 square feet and featured a variety of departments exclusive to the store or found rarely in the chain, including an oyster bar, a full bar area, and in-house sausages. Additionally, around the same time, a new Andronico's Community Markets opened in Monterey, California, the first new store to be branded as such. In 2020, Albertsons announced the closing of a distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, laying off up 520 people. Albertsons said its duties will be shifted to an existing distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which will add up to 300 workers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Albertsons' total sales experienced a growth of 27% compared to the previous year. The rose in sales and higher traffic came as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; it made $22.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the company finally went public in June 2020 after years of delays. The potential IPO for the company could be valued at around $19 billion.Form S-1 of Albertsons Companies Inc., as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2020. During the time of going public, one more division change was announced when the Mid-Atlantic Division was created by combining Eastern and ACME Markets, and based out of ACME's headquarters in Malvern. In October 2020, Albertsons submitted a winning bid for the Kings Food Markets/Balducci's chain. These were announced to be combined into the Mid-Atlantic Division.https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/acme- markets-wins-bid-buy-27-kings-balducci-s-stores Chains Albertsons operates stores under the following banners: * Acme Markets (aka Acme): 163 locations (CT, DE, MD, NJ, NY and PA) * Albertsons: 400 locations (AZ, AR, CA, CO, ID, LA, MT, NV, NM, ND, OR, TX, UT, WA and WY) * Albertsons Market: 23 locations (NM) * Amigos: 4 locations (TX) * Andronico's: 6 locations (CA) * Carrs: 11 locations (AK) * Haggen: 15 locations (WA) * Jewel-Osco: 187 locations (IL, IA, and IN) * Lucky: 4 locations (UT) * Market Street: 19 locations (NM and TX) * Pak 'n Save: 3 locations (CA) * Pavilions: 26 locations (Southern California) * Randalls: 32 locations (Greater Houston and Greater Austin, TX) * Safeway: 896 locations (AK, AZ, CA, CO, DC, DE, HI, ID, MD, MT, NE, NV, NM, OR, SD, VA, WA, WY) * Shaw's: 129 locations (MA, ME, NH, RI and VT) * Star Market: 21 locations (MA) * Tom Thumb: 63 locations (Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, TX) * United Supermarkets: 48 locations (Texas Panhandle) * Vons: 199 locations (Southern California and Southern Nevada) Brands Albertsons once owned several store brands (\\"private label\\" brands), often bearing the name of the chain sold under, e.g. \\"Jewel\\" brand products in the Jewel and Jewel-Osco locations. Other Albertsons brands over the years have included A+, Good Day, Janet Lee (named after the executive vice-president's daughter), Master's Choice, and Village Market. The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name \\"Equaline\\", rather than the previous \\"Sav-On Osco by Albertsons\\" brand. Albertsons introduced an upscale private label brand, \\"Essensia\\", in 2003, which was later renamed by SuperValu as Culinary Circle. Store brand items in Albertsons stores included Albertsons (national brand quality food), Arctic Shores (frozen seafood), Baby Basics (diapers and infant care items), Culinary Circle (\\"gourmet\\" foods and ready-made meals), Equaline (health and beauty products), Farm Fresh (fresh produce), Flavorite (national brand quality foods, used throughout Supervalu stores), Homelife (national brand quality non-foods), Java Delight (coffee), Shoppers Value (value-priced items), Stockman & Dakota (high-quality beef), Stone Ridge (ice cream and sherbet), Super Chill (soft drinks and mixers), Whole Care Pet (pet foods and supplies), and Wild Harvest (natural and organic foods). In 2011, SuperValu announced it would eliminate Flavorite and all brands named after the chains it operates (such as Albertsons, Jewel, Shaw's, etc.) and would replace those labels with a new label, Essential Everyday. After its purchase of Safeway, Albertsons began replacing some of its brands with Safeway's. O Organics and Open Nature replaced Wild Harvest, Pantry Essentials replaced Shoppers Value, and Refreshe replaced Super Chill. By late 2015, the remaining store brands were replaced with \\"Signature\\" (formerly Safeway Care, Farms, Home, and Kitchens). Albertsons started selling Lucerne dairy products, Mom To Mom baby products, and Priority Pet Food as well.

Jewel-Osco currently has 188 stores across northern, central, and western Illinois; eastern Iowa; and portions of northwest Indiana. Jewel-Osco and Jewel are currently wholly owned subsidiaries of Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons. The company originally started as a door-to-door coffee delivery service before it expanded into delivering non-perishable groceries and later into grocery stores, and supermarkets. Prior to its 1984 acquisition by American Stores, Jewel evolved into a large multi-state holding company that operated several supermarket chains and other non-food retail chain stores located from coast to coast and had operated under several different brand names. History Jewel Food Stores logo until 1980. Jewel Osco former logo =Beginnings with home deliveries= In 1899, Frank Vernon Skiff founded Jewel in Chicago, Illinois, as a door-to-door coffee delivery service. In 1902, Skiff partnered with his brother-in-law Frank P. Ross, renaming the venture the Jewel Tea Company. By 1903, they had six routes, then 12 routes in 1904 with expansion into Michigan City, Kankakee, and Kewanee. Alternate Link via ProQuest. There were 850 routes by 1915. During WWI, the company faced soaring costs for materials and production. Compounding this, the US government commandeered a key Jewel production facility. As a result, by 1919 the company was experiencing severe financial setbacks. Within a few years, it returned to profitability through the leadership of new company officials: retired Commanders John M. Hancock and Maurice H. Karker, who had both gained extensive logistics experience as US Navy supply officers during the war.Rear Admiral Frank J. Allston, ret., \\"World War I Supply Corps Officers Wartime Logistics Experience Benefits Food Company,\\" The Navy Supply Corps Newsletter, May‚ÄìJune 1999. In 1929, the company built a new office, warehouse, and coffee roasting facility in suburban Barrington, Illinois, creating hundreds of local jobs despite the Great Depression. The Barrington location served as the headquarters and main warehouse facility for both the home delivery and food store divisions until the completion of the new warehouse and office complex at Melrose Park in 1953. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1949, deliveries were provided on 1876 routes in 43 states to customers mostly in small towns. Customers in cities could visit 154 company-owned grocery stores. Later, the service expanded to include 350 grocery and 10,000 general merchandise items by 1981 when Jewel decided to sell its \\"Jewel Home Shopping Service\\" division to its employees and divest itself from its roots. Alternate Link via ProQuest. At the time of the divesture, the division provided service to customers in mostly small towns located along 1000 routes in 42 states. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The division became a 700-member owned cooperative called \\"J.T.'s General Store\\" in which each route sales persons were independent self-employed agents. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In October 1994, a group of the company's managers acquired the assets of \\"J.T.'s General Store\\" and \\"created J.T. Dealers Sales and Service\\". By 1995, \\"J.T. Dealer Sales and Service\\" was providing service to 60,000 customers along 250 routes in 35 states. =Grocery stores= The company's expansion continued throughout the mid-20th century. In 1932, Jewel acquired the Chicago unit of the Canadian firm Loblaw Groceterias, Inc., then a chain of 77 self-service stores, Alternate Link via ProQuest. as well as four Chicago grocery stores operated by the Middle West Stores Company, and began operating them under the name Jewel Food Stores. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1934, Jewel Food Stores merged with Jewel Tea Company. The name of the parent company remained \\"Jewel Tea Company\\" until 1967 when the stockholders voted to change the name to Jewel Companies, Inc. to better reflect the expansion of the company into different markets. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1967, the company went public and its stock was traded on the Midwest Stock Exchange. Alternate Link via ProQuest. =Eisner acquisition and expansion south= In 1957, Jewel acquired the Champaign, Illinois-based Eisner Food Stores, located in downstate Illinois and later in west central Indiana (Lafayette, West Lafayette, and Bloomington). Alternate Link via ProQuest. This acquisition was significant since it was the first time Jewel maintained the new acquisition as a separate division within the Jewel organization with the acquired stores keeping their original names, setting the pattern for future acquisitions. After Jewel's hostile takeover by American Stores in 1984, American Stores decided to save money by merging Eisner directly into Jewel, converting all stores to the Jewel name and slowly started to sell off the former Eisner properties. One of the first properties to let go was the former Eisner warehouse facility in Champaign in 1986. With the Champaign warehouse facility gone, many former Eisner locations became less profitable since they had to be serviced from the more distant Jewel warehouse at Melrose Park, justifying the elimination of those locations. The west central Indiana stores, three in Lafayette and two in Bloomington, were sold off in 1990. Jewel also closed central Illinois locations that were formerly Eisner in Decatur (in 1995), Champaign-Urbana (in 1998), and Springfield (2006). =Non-food retail expansion= In 1961, Jewel acquired two growing non-food related retail chains, Chicago-based Osco Drug stores, Alternate Link via ProQuest. and Brighton, Massachusetts-based Turn Style discount department stores, Link via ProQuest. to complement their food store division when building one-stop shopping destinations, such as the new Family Centers and Jewel-Osco (Eisner-Osco, Star-Osco, Buttrey-Osco) food-drug combinations. The acquisition of both Osco and Turn Style allowed Jewel to expand into non-food related retailing that would complement their existing food retailing business and also to expand the geographic range of its main food distribution business since the non-food companies had a different geographical footprint. Jewel expanded into the home improvement retail market by acquiring Republic Lumber in 1972. =1960s‚Äì1970s expansion= During the 1960s, Jewel expanded by acquiring several chains. Jewel expanded their food store holdings by acquiring Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Star Market in 1964 Alternate Link via ProQuest. and the Great Falls, Montana-based Buttrey Food Stores in 1966 to add to their existing Jewel and Eisner food store chains. The acquisition of Star Market also gave Jewel control of Brigham's Ice Cream, which had been a part of Star since 1961. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Jewel later sold off Brigham's in 1982. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1965, Jewel expanded into the convenience store business by opening Kwik Shoppe, a chain that was quickly renamed White Hen Pantry within a few months. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Before 1970 Jewel stores were typically located on arterial city streets. Between 1970 and 1990, Jewel moved or expanded most of its stores to be freestanding buildings with ample parking. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Jewel built and operated many Jewel- Osco side-by-side stores, but most construction after 1983 consolidated Jewel and Osco stores together as one large store under one roof. Today, the two stores present to the customer as one unit; for instance, a customer can check out any items at Jewel or Osco registers, find Jewel and Osco merchandise commingled throughout the store, and can call one telephone number to reach their Jewel-Osco. However, each operating unit keeps its own separate marketing identity to the public as a \\"food store\\" or a \\"drug store.\\" The first Jewel-Osco food-drug combination stores were built in 1962. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Jewel opened five stores in Michigan in the 1970s, but closed all five in 1996. In 1971, Jewel expanded their brand into Wisconsin by acquiring eight failing stores from Kroger and rebranded the stores Jewel. Alternate Link via ProQuest. After a decade of operations, Jewel closed all their stores in Wisconsin in 1980. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Those locations were sold to Sentry Foods. Jewel did not return to Wisconsin until 1998. Until 2010, Jewel and Osco stores under the same roof have had separate operations, managers, ordering and receiving procedures, budgets, and employees. A 2010 cost-saving measure brought both Jewel and Osco oversight under one store director for each site. In 1978, Jewel Companies, Inc. attempted to acquire Skaggs Companies, Inc. through an exchange in stock in which Jewel would have been the surviving company and still based in Melrose Park instead of Salt Lake City. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. A few months later, Skaggs turned down the merger offer. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. At that time, Skaggs had 229 stores. After six years, Jewel suffered many losses due to failing marketing concepts and general mismanagement while Skaggs became larger and strong enough to perform a hostile take over of Jewel under its new name, American Stores. =American Stores= A current Jewel-Osco combo store. American Stores made an offer to acquire the Jewel Companies in 1984. The Jewel Companies, Inc. chairman Weston Christopherson was opposed to a merger and Sam Skaggs was forced to engineer a hostile takeover. On June 1, 1984, American Stores tendered an offer worth $1.1 billion for 67% of Jewel's outstanding shares at $70 per share. For two weeks, Jewel's management refused all comment on the offer, maintaining its silence even at a stormy shareholder's meeting before which Jewel shareholder groups controlling 20% of the company's stock were in favor of negotiating with American Stores. On June 14, Sam Skaggs and Jewel president Richard Cline reached an agreement after an all-night bargaining session. American Stores raised its bid for Jewel's preferred stock, increasing the total bid to $1.15 billion in cash and securities. In return, Jewel dropped plans for a defensive acquisition of Household International Inc. and accepted American Stores' offer. American Stores soon sold Buttrey Food Stores (in 1990), Star Market (in 1994), and White Hen Pantry (in 1985), Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. to pay off debt and for other reasons. 1990s expansion under American Stores In 1989, American Stores expanded to Florida using the Jewel-Osco name, but operating as a separate division distinct from the midwest Jewel-Osco operations.Jewel Osco dazzles Tampa with sparkling new format, Drug Store News, April 3, 1989. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Link via ProQuest. The Jewel name returned to Florida five years after the company closed all of its Jewel-T discount food stores in 1984. Florida was considered a good market for Jewel because of the high number of Chicagoans who had relocated to that state. After three years of operations, American Stores closed those Jewel-Osco stores and sold them to Albertsons in 1992. To consolidate the names of some of its subsidiaries under one title with nationwide recognition, American Stores renamed some of its Skaggs-Alpha Beta stores to Jewel-Osco in mid-September 1991. American replaced the Skaggs-Alpha Beta name with that of Jewel-Osco on all 76 stores in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arkansas, expanding the chain toward the southwestern states. Link via ProQuest. Within six months, American Stores sold all of the Jewel-Osco locations in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Florida to Albertsons but kept the locations in the state of New Mexico for a few more years. In 1998, American Stores rebranded the Jewel-Osco stores in New Mexico to Lucky/Sav-on, a grocery store/drug store brand which American Stores had used in neighboring Arizona. After the acquisition of American Stores by Albertsons just a few months later, the New Mexico stores were rebranded again to Albertsons Sav-on in 1999. Under American Stores, Jewel returned to Wisconsin by opening a Jewel-Osco store in a new shopping center in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1995. Jewel returned to Milwaukee in 1998 by purchasing a Pick 'n Save store and four Cub Foods stores and converting them into Jewel Osco stores. In the late 1990s, Jewel purchased a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, food chain and opened fifteen Jewel-Osco combo stores in the Milwaukee metro area, some of which employed urban designs. =Albertsons and SuperValu= Albertsons acquired American Stores' holdings, including Jewel and Jewel-Osco stores, in 1999. Seven years later, parent company Albertsons and its stores would be taken over by two separate groups. On May 30, 2006, shareholders approved the break- up of Albertsons. All Jewel-Osco and Jewel Food Stores outside of Springfield, Illinois were now wholly owned by SuperValu. The Springfield stores were acquired by an investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management. Both of those have since been sold to Niemann Foods, an independent operator of grocery stores, supermarkets and convenience stores in Central Illinois which now operates them under the County Market brand. All free-standing Osco drugstores are now owned by CVS Pharmacy. The Osco name is still used for pharmacies within Albertsons, Jewel, Star Market and Shaw's. SuperValu announced on January 5, 2007, that it would offer for sale its Jewel-Osco stores in the Milwaukee area. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Pick 'n Save agreed to take five of the 15 stores. Two other stores were purchased by Lena's Food Market. SuperValu announced to its workers that the remaining stores, if unsold, would close at the end of March. In 2008, the headquarters for the Illinois-based Jewel-Osco division was moved from Melrose Park to Itasca. =Jewel Express= In 1997, Albertsons experimented by adding gas pumps and a small convenience store in front one of its stores in Eagle, Idaho. Since the experiment was successful, Albertsons decided to expand this concept to all stores that would be able to support it and was allowed by local governmental zoning. The new concept was called Albertsons Express. After Albertsons acquired American Stores in 1999, Albertsons wanted to expand the Albertsons Express concept to the former American Stores chains. Link via ProQuest. The first Jewel Express was opened in front of a Jewel-Osco in South Elgin in October 2000. Link via ProQuest. Link via ProQuest. In attempt to increase revenue in 2009, Supervalu enhanced the Express concept by enlarging the convenience store, added more marketing tie ins with the main store, and even added a car wash. This change did not help Supervalu's bottom line so in 2011 Supervalu announced that it was exiting the fuel business and that it would sell or close all fuel stations that it received when it purchased Albertsons which includes the 29 Jewel Express stations that it received. The same announcement said that 27 of the Jewel Express locations would be sold to Alimentation Couche-Tard, the parent of Circle K, and all remaining unsold locations would be closed. Some of these new Circle K locations were paired with the Shell fuel brand. =Urban Fresh= In 2008, SuperValu converted one of its closed Sunflower Market stores on Clybourn Avenue to an Urban Fresh by Jewel, a smaller store than the usual Jewel, with more upscale and organic products. It was announced that this store would close on October 31, 2009, and there are no plans to open more stores under this banner. =LEED certified= In October 2008, Jewel-Osco opened its first LEED certified store at Kinzie & Des Plaines in Chicago. This new store was built with recycled materials and recycled 98% of its construction debris. It features a rooftop garden, uses water-saving devices, has non-ozone-depleting refrigerants in cooling equipment, uses a refrigerant detection system, and has energy efficient lighting. =Today= Jewel-Osco locations in purple, ACME in red, Shaw's in orange, and Albertsons in blue (1995‚Äì2007) Jewel-Osco employs more than 45,000 associates. Its customer base gave it a 45% share of the grocery market in Chicago, trailed by the Safeway Inc.-owned Dominick's chain (ranking second at 15 percent) before its closure. Consumers from 80% of all households in the Chicago metropolitan area visit a Jewel-Osco store at least once a month. On January 10, 2013, SuperValu announced the sale of Jewel food stores to Cerberus Capital Management in a $3.3 billion deal. The deal closed on March 21, 2013. =Acquisition of Strack & Van Til= On May 15, 2017, Jewel- Osco made a bid to purchase all 19 Strack & Van Til grocery stores for $100 million. The Jewel-Osco bid was ultimately unsuccessful and the stores were sold in the bankruptcy auction to the Strack and Van Til families and the Indiana Grocery Group. Past ventures Over the years, Jewel has tried other concepts and ideas. It is credited with selling the first generic brand product line in 1977. The packaging had no name or pictures ‚Äî just a list of contents, UPC, and required nutritional information on a white package with a pseudo-army-surplus, olive-green stripe. The generic line was given the brand \\"Econo Buy\\" in the early 1990s. =Jewel Grand Bazaar= In 1973, Jewel Companies opened an experimental Jewel Grand Bazaar, on the southwest side of Chicago; a store that encompassed an entire city block at the northwest corner of 54th Street and Pulaski Road. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. This store featured bulk packaging, free samples on weekends, and 24-hour service. See photos: photos This experimental store was in service from 1973 until the 1980s, when it was reformatted as a standard Jewel-Osco combo store. A second Grand Bazaar was opened in 1974 at 87 W. 87th St in Chicago Alternate Link via ProQuest. and in 1977, a \\"Jewel Grand Bazaar\\" was opened at 6505 W. Diversey in the Brickyard Mall. A fourth location was opened in Franklin Park in 1975. Alternate Link via ProQuest. During the 1990s, the Diversey Avenue Grand Bazaar was reformatted to a regular Jewel grocery store, but continued to carry some of the traditional \\"Grand Bazaar\\" features such as bulk foods. With the reconstruction of the Brickyard Mall in 2003, the Grand Bazaar store was demolished and replaced with a smaller Jewel grocery store. Rockford, Illinois also had a Jewel Grand Bazaar. There was also one on Grand Ave. and Kostner Ave. on Chicago's West side. The last \\"Grand Bazaar\\" format store was opened in 1976 at Grand ave. and Mannheim road in Franklin Park, Illinois. This building is currently being operated as a Jewel-Osco. Neither the Chicago Tribune nor the Chicago Sun-Times record when these stores were actually converted or closed. =Turn Style= In 1961, Jewel Companies, then Jewel Tea, acquired a chain of discount stores in the Chicago area called Turn Style. This chain was moderately successful throughout the 1960s. Some locations were combined with Jewel's supermarket brands to form Family Centers. In 1978, 19 of 22 locations were sold to May Department Stores and converted to the Venture format. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Link via ProQuest. Other stores were converted into large Osco Drug Stores. =Jewel T= In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jewel Companies operated a no-frills grocery chain called Jewel T. The typical store tend to be rather small, 8,000 square feet instead of the typical 30,000 for a full-service supermarket, with a selection rather limited to canned and dry foods and non-perishable, but everything sold at a steep discount. To avoid cannibalizing sales from their existing markets in the Midwest and North East Atlantic States, the first Jewel T location was opened in New Port Richey, Florida in 1977, quickly followed by 2 other stores in the St. Petersburg area during the same year. Jewel T expanded into Pennsylvania in 1978 and many suburban Philadelphia kids in this gas crisis era remember mom driving the Vega or Pinto out to Jewel T, and bringing back powdered milk, frozen pretzels, and bulk frozen cherry pielettes. Alternate Link via ProQuest. They expanded to Atlanta in 1979. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Jewel T had approximately 30 stores in two states at the beginning of 1979 and 44 stores in four states by the following June. Alternate Link via ProQuest. By the end of 1979, Jewel T had 87 stores located in the states of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Alabama. In the first month of 1980, Jewel T opened eight stores in highly competitive Southern California. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1981, Jewel T opened stores in Atlanta Link via ProQuest. and its 150th store in Louisiana. At its height in 1981, Jewel T operated 150 stores in 10 states located mainly in the Mid-Atlantic, South East, the Gulf Coast, the Deep South, and also Southern California. At the same time it began to start having problems in competing against the full service supermarkets which fought back by dropping prices, in some cases at or below costs, on the same limited items that Jewel T and other discount food stores specialized in stocking. Within a few years, the company began to sell unprofitable locations. By the beginning of 1984, approximately 131 locations remained. In March 1984, the company closed all 21 Jewel T stores in Southern California. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Seven of the leases and most of the inventory was sold to the 99 Cents Only Stores. A few months later, 105 stores remained when the chain was finally sold off in two separate transactions in June 1984, 28 stores in Texas were sold to a group of managers while the other 77 stores in Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were sold to Save-A-Lot. Alternate Link via NewsBank. =Republic Lumber= Jewel Companies expanded into the hardware and home improvement business by acquiring Republic Lumber in 1972. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1979, Jewel, under the Osco division, sold four of its five Republic Lumber locations to R & L Lumber, parent company of Handy Andy Home Improvement Center, and closed the fifth. Alternate Link via ProQuest. They were located on the west side of Chicago at 4052 W. Grand Ave (a former Jewel opened in 1957 to celebrate the chain's 25th anniversary), Oak Lawn, Arlington Heights and Chicago Heights. A fifth location in Norridge was closed early in 1979 when the lease was not renewed, which later became a Joseph Lumber location. President's Choice house brand As a subsidiary division of American Stores, Jewel-Osco began offering the Canadian staple President's Choice branded products in 1992. President's Choice is a house brand created and distributed by Loblaw Companies Limited of Toronto, Ontario. Loblaw makes extra money by offering their President's Choice to other retailers who do not compete in their home marketing areas. Under American Stores marketing agreement with Loblaw, American Stores were the exclusive distributor of the President's Choice brand within each American Stores, marketing area. The marketing agreement between Jewel and Loblaw ceased when Albertsons acquired American Stores. In 2011, Supervalu replaced the house brand at Jewel with their own Culinary Circle and Wild Harvest private label brands. Organizational philosophy A 1972 book written by Jewel senior leaders, The Jewel Concepts, stressed good citizenship within the community, \\"watching the horizon,\\" and sponsorship of young people. In an Illinois Retail Merchants Association online article, retired Jewel-Osco chairman Don Perkins reflects, \\"Jewel has a tradition of people orientation.\\" One of these traditions came in the form of the \\"first assistant\\" philosophy of management. Each higher-level manager was to see himself or herself as serving the employees he or she managed. On the store level, this would mean that the manager would be the \\"first assistant\\" to the employees by making personal contact and taking personal interest, solving problems, suggesting solutions, and using flexibility in order to best serve the employees' concerns. Then the floor employees' duty was to be in service as the \\"first assistant\\" to the customers. Jewel also was progressive in creating partnerships with vendors, at a time when the practice was rare. Stores =Current stores= *Albertsons LLC owns these Jewel-Osco stores: Jewel- Osco and Jewel stores (168 stores), located in Chicago metro area, including northwestern Indiana.

Osco Drug was founded by the Skaggs family. Alpha Beta grocery store was purchased by American Stores in 1961. Skaggs Drug Centers bought American Stores in 1979 and assumed the American Stores name. Sav-on Drugs was a California-based pharmacy chain that was acquired by Osco's parent company in 1980. Both Osco and Sav-on stores eventually came under the ownership of American Stores, then Albertsons, and finally SuperValu before the stores were sold off. The Osco and Sav-on brands survive today as brandings for in-store pharmacies in the Albertsons chain of stores. Osco pharmacies can be found in Jewel stores, which are co-branded Jewel-Osco, as well as in Shaw's and Star Markets. Sav-on pharmacies are found largely in Acme stores. Pharmacies in Albertsons stores are called Osco in Arizona and Montana stores, and Sav-On in other markets, predominantly in Texas for example.  History  Osco Drug logo. =Roots= In 1915, S.M. Skaggs, a Baptist minister, opened a grocery store in American Falls, Idaho with lower prices on goods. In 1917, O.P Skaggs started a chain of self-service stores, and later sold the franchise in the western states to Christian Call. In 1926, the Skaggs brothers merged the chain with Sam Seelig stores, which had become Safeway in 1925. L.J. Skaggs retired from Safeway in 1932, and in 1934, he opened the first self-service drugstore in the US in Tacoma, Washington. = First store = Loronzo L. (L.L.) Skaggs owned a controlling stock in a company called Quality Food in Minnesota and subsequently left the Safeway business. L.L. opened a chain of self-service drugstores in the Midwest similar to his brother L.J.'s stores in the west. The first store opened in 1937 in Rochester, Minnesota and was named \\"Pay-Less\\" (different from the drug chain Payless founded later in the century), and was managed by George Hilden. The store remained in operation until 1987, when it closed due to redevelopment in downtown Rochester. In 1937, while in the process of opening a second store in Mason City, Iowa it was learned that another company had already registered the name \\"Payless\\" in the state. L.L changed \\"Payless\\" to \\"Self-Service Drug, Inc.\\" and formed a new corporation. = Name change to Osco= In 1942, the corporation \\"Self-Service Drug, Inc.\\" was dissolved and succeeded by \\"Owners Service Company\\", a partnership of L.L Skaggs, H.B. Finch, Paul Stratton and George Hilden. From this company 'Osco' was coined. That year Osco moved its headquarters from Waterloo, Iowa to the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, Illinois. Acquisitions =The Jewel Companies, Inc.= Osco Drug logo until 1980. In 1961, The Jewel Companies, Inc. acquired the 31 Osco Drug stores in six Midwest states. In 1962, Osco's headquarters was moved from Chicago's Merchandise Mart to Melrose Park, Illinois and the first side- by-side \\"Jewel-Osco\\" store opened. The early Jewel-Osco combination (combo) stores were two individual stores, separated by an interior wall (and in some locations, a half-wall), allowing a customer to go back and forth between each store without having to go outside. After the merger, all of Jewel's subsidiaries soon had an Osco Drug. Some Eisner Food Stores locations were re- branded \\"Eisner-Osco\\". When Jewel acquired Star Market in 1964, the first Osco Drug in New England was opened, and some were next to Star Market locations and were branded as \\"Star-Osco\\". By 1968, Osco grew to 168 stores in sixteen states. During most of the 1960s, Osco operated as two divisions ‚Äì 'City Osco', comprising the Chicago, Illinois and Chicago suburb stores and 'Country Osco' (all the other Oscos). These two divisions were combined in 1968 and formed Osco Drug, Inc. Also in 1968, Osco's headquarters relocated from Melrose Park, Illinois to Franklin Park, Illinois. Later that year, the Jewel Imports procurement group was established to import a broad range of general merchandise from around the world to sell in Osco stores. When The Jewel Companies Inc. acquired Buttrey Food Stores in 1966, many of the stores were converted to a combination store format and bannered as \\"Buttrey-Osco\\" with common checkout stands but separate store management, all under one roof. By the early 1980s, Buttrey eventually operated 60 stores in Montana, North and South Dakota, western Minnesota, Wyoming, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Utah, and Idaho. Stores were spread thinly over a wide territory. Outside of Chicago metropolitan area, Osco operated as stand-alone pharmacies (or free standing stores). In the early years, many of the Jewel and Osco combination stores maintained different operating hours from one another and on certain days such as holidays, one side of the combo store would be open, while the other would be closed. By the early 1980s, new and remodeled combo stores had the 'wall' removed and the store became one, and to this day, Osco retains control over drug, general merchandise, pharmacy and liquor departments in the Jewel Osco combo stores. In the late 1960s, Osco was seeking to purchase or build a photofinishing plant to service its stores. At the time, the company was using outside vendors, and the film developing quality and service was inconsistent. In 1970, working with Kodak, Osco built a photofinishing lab in Elgin, Illinois. The facility, Crest Photo Lab opened in 1971, and serviced Osco's Chicago, Central and Eastern region stores. The Elgin photo lab expanded several times over the years. As both Osco and its photofinishing market share grew, three more photo plants were added: Alves Photo Service Braintree, Massachusetts in 1980, Rich Photo Lab Salt Lake City, Utah in 1984 and Drewry Photocolor Burbank, California in 1987 (renamed Crest Photo in 1988). The photo labs were sold to Kodak's Qualex photo processing division in 1996, prompted by the emergence of in-store one-hour photo labs and digital photography technology. In 1974, Osco's headquarters were relocated from Franklin Park, Illinois to a new facility at 1818 Swift Drive in Oak Brook, Illinois.  Acquisition of Sav-on Drugs  Sav-on Drugs logo. In November 1980, The Jewel Companies Inc. purchased Sav-on Drugs, Inc. which was headquartered in Anaheim, California and had 150 stores in California, Nevada and Texas. The Sav-on chain became Osco's 'Western Region'. =American Stores Company = In 1984, American Stores Company, which consisted of Alpha Beta, Acme Markets, and Skaggs, acquired The Jewel Companies Inc. American Drug Stores, Inc. American Drug Stores In 1989, a new subsidiary American Drug Stores, Inc. was formed and consisted of American Stores drugstore holdings of Osco Drug, Sav-on Drugs, the Osco side of the Jewel-Osco food-drug combination stores and RxAmerica. RxAmerica began earlier in 1989 as a mail service prescription fulfillment center with a facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. Sav-on re-branding and relaunching American Stores had a strategy to build a nationwide network of pharmacies, streamline operations and advertising to gain national recognition for the brand, especially for the high-margin private label products. The name Osco Drug was chosen as the national chain banner because of the large number of stores which already had that name and existed in various parts of the US. The name change was completed for the Skaggs drugstores in 1985 and then for the Sav-on stores in 1986. The name \\"Osco\\" did not resonate well with Sav-on's southern California customer base. American Stores eventually made the decision to change the name of the former Sav-on stores back to Sav-on Drugs. Rumors circulated at the time claiming that the reason for the name change back to ‚ÄòSav-on‚Äô was due to \\"Osco\\" having the same pronunciation as the Spanish word \\"asco\\" (oss-ko), which means \\"nausea\\" or \\"disgust\\", a considerable factor within southern California's heavily Hispanic market. This explanation for the name change was refuted by American Stores. The name change on all stores was completed in 1989 and the Sav-on Drugs brand was re-launched in southern California and Nevada. Sav-on Express, Reliable Drug, Clark Drug At the same time that the company was making major divestments in the early 1990s, American Stores also looked for opportunities to make strategic minor acquisitions that would enhance its position in the main markets where it needed to strengthen market share. * The company's California drugstore operations were enhanced through the early 1992 $60 million purchase of 85 CVS Stores (63 CVS Pharmacy drugstores and the rights to operate 22 CVS health and beauty aid stores) from the Melville Corporation. These stores converted to the Sav-on Drugs and Sav- on Express banners. Later that year, 30 Thrifty and Rx Plus drugstores in Arizona and Nevada were acquired. * The following year Reliable Drug (a 55 unit chain) in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri was bought. These stores were soon re-bannered as Osco Drug stores. * In February 1995, American Stores spent about $37 million for 17 Clark Drug stores in southern California, which were then converted to the Sav-on Drugs name. Consolidation of operations In 1992, American Stores shifted its strategy from that of a holding company to a centralized operating company. As a result of the decision, common functions among American Stores' operating divisions (procurement, distribution logistics, payroll, human resources, etc.) were removed from the operating divisions, consolidated and run centrally. From 1992 through 1998, American Stores consolidated operations and moved responsibilities of their division offices to their headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. Although 'American Stores' food divisions retained an operating presence in their geographical locations and other centralized marketing, merchandising and other staff functions were relocated between 1992 and 1998 from Oak Brook, Illinois to Salt Lake City to occupy the then-new American Stores Tower. Pharmacy operations were relocated to Scottsdale Arizona with certain pharmacy systems-related resources continuing to operate from the Chicago area after being relocated to 3030 Cullerton Drive in Franklin Park, Illinois. After American Drug Stores' move to Salt Lake City, Utah was complete in 1998, Osco's Oak Brook, Illinois 1818 Swift Drive headquarters was sold to the Follett Corporation. Osco Foodmarts In 1994, American Stores converted 25 Jewel Food Stores in Chicago, Illinois to Osco Drug free-standing stores. These older and smaller Jewel stand-alone stores were closed so that American Stores could focus on the combination formats only for Jewel and to expand Osco's presence in Chicago as a response to Walgreens increasing market dominance. The Osco stores replacing the Jewel stores contained expanded food and produce presentations and were coined 'Osco Foodmarts'. Health 'n' Home To extend its core drugstore business, in November 1995 American Drug Stores launched a new format called Health 'n' Home, which was a , 18,000-item home health care superstore. The first Health 'n' Home opened in Phoenix, Arizona, and by late 1997 there were 20 Health 'n' Home stores in four states. RxAmerica In 1998, American Stores RxAmerica division and Longs Drug Stores Integrated Health Concepts (IHC) division agreed to merge their Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) ventures. Under terms of the joint venture, RxAmerica and its former corporate partner, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, parted ways, and RxAmerica combined with Longs' IHC division in a 50/50 partnership. The alliance created a national PBM of nearly 1,400 Longs and American Stores pharmacy outlets and a nationwide network of 40,000 pharmacies serving some 3 million patients under contract. Longs and Albertsons remained equal partners up though 2001, when Albertsons sold their 50% interest to Longs. Albertsons, Inc. 200px 200px During 1999, the drugstore operations division and general merchandise procurement functions were moved from Salt Lake City, Utah to Scottsdale, Arizona operating as Albertsons Drug Region. In 2002, Albertsons sold its 84 free-standing Osco Drug stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine to the Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drugstore company. Jean Coutu re-branded the acquired Osco stores as Brooks Pharmacy. Also in 2002, Albertsons, due to financial difficulties, closed several of its stores across the country including all stores in the Des Moines, Iowa metro market. In March 2005, Albertsons re-introduced the Osco brand name to the New England region by way of its Shaw's and Star Market pharmacies. SuperValu, CVS Corporation, and Cerberus On June 2, 2006, the sale of Albertsons essentially split the company into three parts. * CVS Corporation purchased the 700 free-standing drug stores (Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs). By 2007, these stores were rebranded as CVS Pharmacy. * A Cerberus-led group of investors, (who included Kimco Realty Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corp., Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty) purchased the Albertsons stores in northern California, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona, and New Mexico forming a new corporation called Albertsons LLC. Many of these stores have since been sold to other grocery chains or closed altogether. * SuperValu purchased the Jewel, ACME, Shaw's divisions and the remaining Albertsons stores not acquired by Cerberus. SuperValu retains the Osco and Sav-on drug trademarks allowing the pharmacies in their grocery stores to remain branded as Sav-on Pharmacy or Osco Pharmacy. The SuperValu owned Albertsons stores and the chains it acquired were in turn sold to Cerberus in 2013 and Osco and Sav-On pharmacies moved their operations to the base of Albertsons LLC in Boise, Idaho. Certain store support functions exist in the Franklin Park, Illinois office.

A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic). Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire. Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper. When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two \\"tongues\\" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together. Shape and composition Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes. The most common material is steel or some other metal, but molded plastic is also used. Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system. Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic- coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips. History According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent child was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867. This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together. Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867. Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today. Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright on July 24, 1877, patent #193,389. This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening together loose leaves of papers, documents, periodicals, newspapers etc. The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by \\"The Gem Manufacturing Company\\", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.Petroski, Henry: \\"Polishing the Gem: A First-Year Design Project\\", Journal of Engineering Education, October 1998, p. 445 He refers to an 1883 article about \\"Gem Paper- Fasteners\\", praising them for being \\"better than ordinary pins\\" for \\"binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript\\".Penn, Arthur: The Home Library, Appleton, New York, 1883 Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early \\"Gem\\", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name. The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the \\"Gem Paper Clip\\".History of the Paper Clip. Ad from Cushman & Denison, in The American Lawyer, Sept 1893, p. 3. In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the \\"Gem\\" name in connection with paper clips. The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States. Paper clips are still sometimes called \\"Gem clips\\", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is \\"gem\\". Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a \\"Machine for making wire paper clips.\\" The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.; \\"From Pins to Paper Clips\\"; \\"Paper Clips and Design\\" The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time. Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented. Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip. In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes. Appendix: A selected list of U.S. Patents for paper clips. Journal of Engineering Education, 1998, p. 449. But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular. Its qualities‚Äîease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling‚Äîhave been difficult to improve upon. National Paperclip Day is May 29.

W. Trompf, \\"Radical Conservatism in Herbert Spencer's Educational Thought\\", British Journal of Educational Studies, Vol. 17, No. 3 (October 1969), pp. 267‚Äì280. though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term \\"survival of the fittest\\", invented the paper clip. Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a \\"binding- pin\\" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H). This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together. It is approximately 15 cm unfolded. Norwegian claim Johan Vaaler in 1887 as a student of the Christiania University. The paper clip patented by Johan Vaaler in 1899 and 1901. A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866‚Äì1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip. He was granted patents in GermanyApplication dated 12 November 1899, Patentschrift no. 121067, patent granted 6 June 1901. and in the United StatesUS Patent No. 675,761 June 4, 1901. (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire. Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway. His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available. Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius. Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip,\\"Binders\\" Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon, Oslo 1975, vol. 2, p. 695. and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips. Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.Petroski, Henry \\"The Evolution of Artifacts\\", American Scientist, Volume 80, 1992, pp. 416‚Äì20. Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.Holst, Wilhelm: \\"Johan Vaaler\\", Studenterne fra 1887, Kristiania 1912. As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway. His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market. Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the \\"Gem\\" was used worldwide, including his own country. The failure of his design was its impracticality. Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip. One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle. The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper. The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip. =National symbol= The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country. He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.Vaaler's forgotten German patent was found by patent engineer Halvard Foss of The Norwegian Industrial Property Office (Patentstyret) while looking for patents granted to Norwegians in the German patent office. \\"I made this discovery known to my colleagues\\", Foss stated in an interview with the weekly A-magasinet no. 52, 1988. In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.Foss, Halvard: \\"Den frittst√•ende oppfinner\\", Styret for det industrielle rettsvern 50 √•r, Oslo 1961, p. 190. This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II. Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip. Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden. Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time. The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity (\\"we are bound together\\"). The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.B√∏, Finn: Forbuden frukt (First edition 1945), Oslo 1995, . The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon, supplementsbind, Oslo 1952. That information was added in later editions. According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France. A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as \\"deux gaules\\" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon, Oslo 1974, Vol. 2, p. 695. The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol. Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial. They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.Hesstvedt, Ola: \\"Den lille norske hjelperen fyller 90 √•r\\", A-magasinet nr. 52, 1988. In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem- type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler. The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent. A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness. The background shows a facsimile of the German \\"Patentschrift\\". However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known \\"Gem\\". In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.\\"Vaaler, Johan\\", Norsk biografisk leksikon, Kunnskapsforlaget, Oslo 2005.

The depicted paper clip is not the one he invented, but the successful Gem clip. Other uses Wire is versatile in its nature. Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an \\"emergency eject\\" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh). Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device. The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel. A paper clip bent into a \\"U\\" can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header). One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces). A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop. A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post. Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device. Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips. There are two approaches. The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator. The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed. A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client. Trade In 1994, the US imposed anti- dumping tariffs against China, on paper clips.

In Australia, it is usually referred to as a wrong'un, or occasionally as a Bosie or Bosey, the last two eponyms in honour of its inventor Bernard Bosanquet. A leg spin bowler bowls in a leg spin way but it goes in the off spin direction.  Explanation  Reggie Schwarz, known for using the googly as his stock delivery While a normal leg break spins from the leg to the off side, away from a right-handed batsman, a googly spins the other side, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the ball rolls out of the hand (from the side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released. The change of wrist action can be seen by a skilled batsman and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batsmen, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one direction off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction. If the batsman is expecting a leg break, he will play outside the line of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential leg before wicket (lbw) appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the wicket, or catch the edge of the bat. The googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. It is used infrequently, because its effectiveness comes mostly from its surprise value. Left-arm unorthodox spinners bowlers, can bowl with the googly action using the left arm. This delivery turns away from a right-handed batsman, like a leg break or left-arm orthodox spinner. The googly is similar in principle to the doosra, the ball from an off-spinner which turns the opposite way from his stock ball. Chambers Dictionary describes the whole of etymology of the word as \\"dubious\\".  Mechanics  To grip the ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.  In popular culture  In a scene from John Boorman's 1987 film Hope and Glory, David Hayman plays a father who, before leaving to fight in WWII, passes on \\"the secret of the googly\\" to his young son.

The party was considered right-wing populist and nationalist as well as adhering to its own distinct ideology of Fortuynism according to some commentators.Andeweg, R. and G. Irwin Politics and Governance in the Netherlands, Basingstoke (Palgrave) p.49 The LPF supported tougher measures against immigration and crime, opposition to multiculturalism, greater political reform, a reduction in state bureaucracy and endorsed some eurosceptic positions but differed somewhat from other European right-wing or nationalist parties by taking a liberal stance on social issues and sought to describe its ideology as pragmatic and not populistic. Pim Fortuyn had initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election as leader of the Livable Netherlands (LN) party. He was however dismissed as leader of LN in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later. After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election. The party held onto its support, and went on to become the second-largest party in the election. The LPF formed part of a coalition government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) as part of the first Balkenende cabinet, but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months. Following the 2003 election, the party was left in opposition. It became clear that the party was not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008. History =Background= Fortuyn announced his intention to run for parliament in a television interview on 20 August 2001\\\\. An unusual aspect of this was that it was not yet clear which political party he would be a candidate for. Although he was already in contact with the Livable Netherlands (LN) party, he initially also considered running for the CDA or creating his own list. On 25 November he was chosen as party leader for the LN. The LN functioned as the national extension of a movement that had contested municipal but never national elections. Fortuyn concluded his acceptance speech by saying the words that would become his slogan; \\"At your service!\\" Almost immediately after Fortuyn became leader, LN went from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%. In January 2002, it was announced that Fortuyn also would head the Livable Rotterdam (LR) list for the March 2002 local elections. The official 2002 election study found that immigration and integration problems were the second most important issue for voters after issues concerning the health care system. Helped by the many speeches and interviews given by Fortuyn, immigration issues became the major topic of the national political agenda, thereby forcing other parties to react. Founder and Leader Pim Fortuyn on 4 May 2002. Until February, the LN had received disproportionate and generally sympathetic coverage in the media. The situation took a dramatic turn on 9 February, when Fortuyn was interviewed in de Volkskrant, one of the leading national newspapers. Against the strong advice of his campaign team, he made several controversial statements; including one that said Islam was \\"a backward culture\\", that no more asylum seekers would be allowed into the country, and, if necessary, the possible repeal of anti-racism clauses in the Dutch Constitution to protect freedom of speech. Fortuyn was dismissed as party leader the next day, and in a television interview said that the split was irreparable, although he would have preferred to remain in the party. He founded Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11 February. Opinion polls soon showed that he took most of LN's supporters with him, leaving LN with its original 2%, while Fortuyn soared to 17%. The local LR‚Äîwhich held on to Fortuyn as its leader‚Äîwas hugely successful in the March 2002 local elections, as it won more than one third of the vote and became Rotterdam's strongest party. =Fortuyn assassination= It was reported in February 2002 that Fortuyn did not dare to appear in public owing to death threats. In March, he was attacked by pie-throwing activists at the presentation of his new book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars (which became the bestselling book by a Dutch author in the Netherlands in 2002). Despite this, the authorities did not provide protection for Fortuyn, nor did he request protection. On 6 May, Fortuyn was assassinated outside a radio studio. This was the first political murder in the Netherlands for centuries (excluding the Second World War). Some claimed that by \\"demonising\\" Fortuyn, the political left and the media had created a climate of opinion that had made the assassination possible. Campaigning immediately stopped, and although some suggested postponing the elections, the campaign resumed (half-heartedly) after his funeral four days later. His funeral was broadcast live on television and, according to Cas Mudde, lead \\"to scenes of mass hysteria not seen since the Dutch national football team won the European Championship in 1988.\\" The murder of Fortuyn, together with that of Theo van Gogh two years later, would result in a polarisation in the political debate in the Netherlands, and subsequently radical changes in immigration-related policies and public discourse. =First Balkenende cabinet (2002‚Äì2003)= The LPF decided to maintain Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming a new leader until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives‚Äîby far a record number of seats in the Netherlands for a new party‚Äîto become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains - later attributed in part to the fact that CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had remained neutral and not joined in attacking Fortuyn with other party leaders during debates. Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers and tighten some of the Netherlands's immigration policies, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's multicultural society. Some commentators claimed that the CDA was able to draw in voters who otherwise would have supported the LPF (but felt it was no longer viable without Fortuyn in charge) or that the CDA was seen as a stabilizing force after a tense election. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister. Following the election, Mat Herben was chosen as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the governing coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. The following day after the cabinet's formation, LPF State Secretary for Social Affairs and Work Opportunity Philomena Bijlhout resigned after it was reported that she had been a member of a Surinamese militia.\\"Dutch minister resigns within hours\\", BBC News (Tuesday, 23 July 2002) She was replaced by fellow LPF MP Khee Liang Phoa. Without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure and political experience among its members, the LPF also succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October 2002, the break-up of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek. =Opposition and disintegration (2003‚Äì2006)= In the January 2003 general election, the LPF shrank to 5.7% support and gained eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 in the government coalition. The LPF found it hard to maintain support in opposition as besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible or considered as charismatic as Fortuyn, while party leader Herben had enough work keeping the party from further infighting. The LPF also went into financial straits as many of its former financial backers left. Other commentators later claimed that the relative inexperience of some of the LPF's members hampered its ability to function as a coherent movement. As the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies and Balkenende stated that he agreed with some of Fortuyn's views on multiculturalism and immigration, it became increasingly difficult for the LPF to present an alternative image to the government. The LPF won just 2.6% of the vote in the 2004 European Parliament election, and did not win a seat. In this election, Paul van Buitenen surprisingly won two seats with his anti-corruption Europe Transparent (although it was not successful in the long term). By 2004, the LPF had fallen to a less than 1% support and disintegrated. The party had lost most of its members, and the parliamentary faction had declared itself independent from the party. LPF 2002 election poster featuring Pim Fortuyn with his slogan \\"At your service!\\" Eduard Bomhoff, Deputy Prime Minister in the First Balkenende cabinet. =List Five Fortuyn (2006‚Äì2008)= The LPF participated in the 2006 general election under its new name List Five Fortuyn (Lijst Vijf Fortuyn). On 25 September 2006, the party released a controversial campaign commercial which featured new leader Olaf Stuger coming down from \\"heaven\\" with a parachute and presenting himself as a \\"reincarnation\\" of Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, brother of Pim Fortuyn, declared it \\"outrageous and tasteless.\\" In the election, LVF did not receive enough votes to secure a seat with support of only 0.2%. In July 2007, the party voted to dissolve itself on 1 January 2008. Fortuyn's political heritage became scattered among various politicians in the Netherlands who founded parties of their own, most of which were unsuccessful. These included Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the Party for the Netherlands‚Äînone of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. The LPF also influenced politicians in the Flemish region of Belgium, such as lawyer and Open VLD member Hugo Coveliers who went on to found the VLOTT party based on Fortuyn's ideas. However, in the Netherlands the LPF became been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration and integration issues taken by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV). Ideology =Fortuynism= The ideology or political style that is derived from Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called Fortuynism. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch purple coalitions or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one \\"of openness, directness and clearness\\", populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just one ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism. During the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn was accused of being on the \\"extreme right\\", although others saw only certain similarities. While he employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he was neither a radical nationalist nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values. On the contrary, Fortuyn wanted to protect the socio-culturally liberal values of the Netherlands, women's rights and sexual minorities (he was openly homosexual himself), from the \\"backward\\" Islamic culture.Rydgren; van Holsteyn, 2005, p. 49. The LPF also won support from some ethnic minorities; one of Fortuyn's closest associates was of Cape Verdean origin, one of the party's MPs was a young woman of Turkish descent while another LPF politician was the first elected Dutch-Chinese MP.Alexander Bakker, Late biecht van ex- staatssecretaris, Algemeen Dagblad, January 1, 2006. =Domestic policy= Many of the LPF's policies for the 2002 general election were based on proposals put forward in Fortuyn's book De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars. The LPF campaigned on a strong law and order message at both local and national levels. The party supported cutting state bureaucracy while strengthening public services. It also wanted to sharply reduce the number of immigrants and asylum seekers coming into the Netherlands, particularly from Islamic societies, as well as put an end to the Dutch government's policy of pursuing multiculturalism. However, Fortuyn also maintained that asylum seekers or illegal immigrants already living in the Netherlands should not be deported and instead be assimilated into Dutch society while potential migrants would be offered financial incentives to stay in their own country. The party also supported the right to freedom of speech and took a socially liberal stance on issues such as gay rights, soft drug legalization and gender equality. =Foreign policy= Although the LPF was established post-9/11, Fortuyn had already developed a worldview based on the \\"clash between civilizations\\", namely between \\"modernity\\" and Islam, or Western society and Islamic culture. The LPF supported NATO, but was eurosceptic and saw the European Union as a \\"bureaucracy which barely interests its citizens, let alone inspires them.\\" Fortuyn also campaigned to reduce Dutch financial contributions to the European Union and criticised the EU as \\"elite\\" and \\"technocratic\\". The LPF was not necessarily opposed to the idea of European integration and cooperation in general, but rather its present organization, lack of democracy and threat to national sovereignty. Opposing the full membership of Turkey, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, the LPF maintained that the European Union \\"shouldn't cross the Bosporus and the Ural\\". The LPF was also supportive of Israel.

A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler who is also a competent batter is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a no-ball. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a wide. There are different types of bowlers, from fast bowlers, whose primary weapon is pace, through swing and seam bowlers who try to make the ball deviate in its course through the air or when it bounces, to slow bowlers, who will attempt to deceive the batter with a variety of flight and spin. A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while bouncing off the pitch. History Pakistani Shoaib Akhtar holds the world record for delivering the fastest ball (). In the early days of cricket, underarm bowling was the only method employed. Many theories exist about the origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the wicket gate into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon 'cricce', a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a 'cricket' in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used in the early days of the game (originally from the Flemish 'krickstoel', a low stool on which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages. In 1706 William Goldwyn published the first description of the game. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a \\"milk-white\\" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called \\"play\\" and the \\"leathern orb\\" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, the umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches. The first written \\"Laws of Cricket\\" were drawn up in 1744. They stated, \\"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail across them six inches. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart\\". There were no limits on the shape or size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches was viewed as a very big score, probably due to the bowlers bowling quickly at shins unprotected by pads. The world's first cricket club was formed in Hambledon in the 1760s and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787. During the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ball through the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This innovation gave bowlers the weapons of length, deception through the air, plus increased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swerve. In response, batters had to master timing and shot selection. One immediate consequence was the replacement of the curving bat with the straight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and lessened the influence of rough ground and brute force. It was in the 1770s that the modern game began to take shape. The weight of the ball was limited to between five and a half and five and three-quarter ounces, and the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followed an innings by a batter called Thomas \\"Daddy\\" White, who appeared with a bat the width of the wicket. In 1774, the first leg before law was published. Also around this time, a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Between 1750 and 1760, this figure rose to 230, and between 1770 and 1790 over 500. The 19th century saw a series of significant changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified for the first time in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available for the first time in 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced ‚Äì previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler. At the start of the century, all bowlers were still delivering the ball under-arm. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a \\"round-arm\\" technique after practising with his sister Christina, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide dress impeding her delivery of the ball. The round-arm action came to be employed widely in matches but was quickly determined to be illegal and banned by the MCC, who stated that \\"the ball must be delivered underhand, not thrown or jerked, with the hand underneath the elbow at the time of delivering the ball\\". When it was accepted the rules stated that the arm could not be raised above the shoulder. It was quickly found, however, that a raised arm imparted more accuracy and generated more bounce than the roundarm method. Again, the governing body banned the method. It was not until the method was finally accepted by the MCC in 1835 that it grew rapidly in popularity amongst all players. Underarm bowling hitherto had almost disappeared from the game. =Modern-day underarm bowling= An infamous \\"underarm bowling incident\\" occurred during a match in 1981, in which the Australian bowler, Trevor Chappell, took advantage of the fact that underarm bowling was still legal by rolling the ball along the ground. By doing so he avoided the possibility that the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, would score a six from the last ball to tie the match, as the bat would not be able to hit the ball high enough to score a six. As a result of this incident underarm bowling was subsequently made illegal in all grades of cricket, except by prior agreement of both teams, as it was not considered to be within the spirit of the game. The bowling action The typical bowling action of a fast bowler. fast bowler Brett Lee in action in 2005. Bowling the ball is distinguished from simply throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition. Originally, this definition said that the elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it near the top of the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no-ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position. In 2005, this definition was deemed to be physically impossible by a scientific investigative commission. Biomechanical studies that showed that almost all bowlers extend their elbows somewhat throughout the bowling action, because the stress of swinging the arm around hyperextends the elbow joint. A guideline was introduced to allow extensions or hyperextensions of angles up to 15 degrees before deeming the ball illegally thrown. Bowling actions are typically divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands parallel to the bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This differs from a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action. Philadelphian cricketer Bart King bowling Goals of bowling In a game of cricket, the ultimate priority of the fielding side is to restrict the total number of runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving this is by dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side's run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends to have a positive effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batsmen from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batsmen and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets. Depending upon the format of the match, these two strategies will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able to tell which strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it. Bowling tactics Jim Allenby in midflight, illustrating the position of the body during a delivery at the end of a run up, prior to bowling the ball. The simultaneous twin objectives of bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling the ball in such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball in such a way that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three. =Line and length= The fundamental skill of bowling on a good length incorporates the ability to pitch the ball such a distance from the batsman that he is unable to move forward and drive the ball on the half volley, and is also unable to step back and play the ball on the back foot. This removes many of the batsman's attacking options, and also increases the probability of him misjudging a delivery and losing his wicket. A good length delivery is one in which the ball has had sufficient time to move far enough off the pitch to beat the bat but the batsman has not had time to react to the movement and adjust his shot. The faster the bowler and the greater the movement he is able to generate, the larger the area of the pitch that can be designated an effective \\"good\\" length. Other areas of the pitch may also often be used as a variation to a good length delivery. Primarily these are the yorker, in which the ball is bowled directly at the batsman's feet as a surprise delivery intended to dismiss the batsman bowled, and the bouncer in which the ball is bowled on such a short length that it rises towards the batsman's throat or head as a means of physical intimidation. But the height of an attempted yorker or full toss must not be higher than the batsman's waist, or else it will be called a no-ball beamer, which could have bowlers banned from the match. The line a bowler chooses to bowl will depend on several factors: the movement he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic with the intention of dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw. It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips. Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics. Some different types of bowling tactic: *Bodyline *Leg theory *Off theory =Pace and movement= Other than the ability to land the ball on a strategically optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability to move the ball sideways as it approaches the batsman and his ability to deliver the ball at a high velocity. The velocities of cricket bowlers vary between . In professional cricket, a bowler in the 40‚Äì60 mph range would be said to be a slow bowler, in the 60‚Äì80 mph range a medium pace bowler, and a bowler 80 mph+ a fast bowler. In the amateur game, these distinctions would be approximately 10 mph slower. Many professional fast bowlers are able to reach speeds of over 85 mph, with a handful of bowlers in the world able to bowl at 95 mph+. The ability to react to a cricket ball travelling at 85 mph is a skill that only professional and high level amateur cricketers possess. The pace of a bowler not only challenges the reaction speed of the batsman, but also his physical courage. Fast bowlers are able to exploit this by bowling bouncers, either regularly or as an occasional surprise delivery. Bowlers are also able to get the ball to move sideways by using either spin or swing. Adding a spin to a cricket ball will make it deviate due to the Magnus effect in its flight, and then produce sideways movement off the ground. Swing is obtained by using air pressure differences caused by angling the seam of the cricket ball to produce a lateral movement in the air. Fast bowlers will generally only use swing to obtain movement, but medium pace and slow bowlers will often use a combination of the two. The intention is that in creating movement in the delivery, the batsman will misjudge the line of the ball as it arrives, causing him to miss it entirely, in which case he may be dismissed bowled or lbw, or miss-hit it, in which case he may be out caught. To avoid becoming predictable, a bowler will typically bowl a variety of different deliveries with different combinations of pace and movement. A tactically astute bowler may be able to spot a potential weakness in a batsman that a particular delivery may be able to exploit. Bowlers will often also bowl deliveries in preplanned sets, with the intention of dismissing the batsman with the final delivery in the set. This is known as \\"setting a trap\\" for the batsman. Batsmen and bowlers will often also engage in a game of \\"cat and mouse\\", in which the bowler varies his tactics to try and trap and dismiss the batsman, but the batsman also keeps adjusting his tactics in response.  Limited overs  In limited overs cricket, there is a limitation on the number of overs each bowler can bowl. This number depends on the match length, and is usually 20% of the total overs in the innings. For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over cricket eight per bowler and for fifty-over cricket ten per bowler. There is, however, no limit on the number of overs each bowler may bowl in first-class cricket matches, except that no two overs can be bowled consecutively thus restricting any one bowler from a maximum of 50% (plus 1 over) of each innings total. The rule also applies in terms of breaks within a Test innings (Drinks, Lunch and Tea breaks, end of day and beginning of next day). The rule can only been broken if one finishes the end of the previous match starts the next match.

Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year. Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Mohamed Naguib under house arrest and assumed executive office. He was formally elected president in June 1956. Nasser's popularity in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal and his political victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria from 1958 to 1961. In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War and eventually the much larger Arab Cold War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself Prime Minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world. Nasser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies and anti- imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan city. Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt. Early life alt=A boy wearing a jacket, a white shirt with a black tie and a fez on his head Nasser was born on 15 January 1918 in Bakos, Alexandria, Egypt. Nasser's father was Abdel Nasser Hussein and his mother was Fahima Nasser. Nasser's father was a postal worker born in Beni Mur in Upper Egypt,Aburish, 2004, p.12.Stephens, 1972, p. 22. and raised in Alexandria, and his mother's family came from Mallawi, el-Minya. His parents married in 1917. Nasser had two brothers, Izz al-Arab and al-Leithi. Nasser's biographers Robert Stephens and Said Aburish wrote that Nasser's family believed strongly in the \\"Arab notion of glory\\", since the name of Nasser's brother, Izz al- Arab, translates to \\"Glory of the Arabs\\". Nasser's family traveled frequently due to his father's work. In 1921, they moved to Asyut and, in 1923, to Khatatba, where Nasser's father ran a post office. Nasser attended a primary school for the children of railway employees until 1924, when he was sent to live with his paternal uncle in Cairo, and to attend the Nahhasin elementary school. Nasser exchanged letters with his mother and visited her on holidays. He stopped receiving messages at the end of April 1926. Upon returning to Khatatba, he learned that his mother had died after giving birth to his third brother, Shawki, and that his family had kept the news from him. Nasser later stated that \\"losing her this way was a shock so deep that time failed to remedy\\". He adored his mother and the injury of her death deepened when his father remarried before the year's end. In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city's Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out. Nasser joined the paramilitary wing of the group, known as the Green Shirts, for a brief period in 1934. His association with the group and active role in student demonstrations during this period \\"imbued him with a fierce Egyptian nationalism\\", according to the historian James Jankowski. Nasser's name circled in Al-Gihad When his father was transferred to Cairo in 1933, Nasser joined him and attended al-Nahda al-Masria school. He took up acting in school plays for a brief period and wrote articles for the school's paper, including a piece on French philosopher Voltaire titled \\"Voltaire, the Man of Freedom\\". On 13 November 1935, Nasser led a student demonstration against British rule, protesting against a statement made four days prior by UK foreign minister Samuel Hoare that rejected prospects for the 1923 Constitution's restoration. Two protesters were killed and Nasser received a graze to the head from a policeman's bullet. The incident garnered his first mention in the press: the nationalist newspaper Al Gihad reported that Nasser led the protest and was among the wounded. On 12 December, the new king, Farouk, issued a decree restoring the constitution. Nasser's involvement in political activity increased throughout his school years, such that he only attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school. Despite it having the almost unanimous backing of Egypt's political forces, Nasser strongly objected to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty because it stipulated the continued presence of British military bases in the country. Nonetheless, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda, where he received his leaving certificate later that year. =Early influences= Aburish asserts that Nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations, which broadened his horizons and showed him Egyptian society's class divisions. His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser spent most of his spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. He read the Qur'an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad's companions), and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atat√ºrk, Otto von Bismarck, and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill. Nasser was greatly influenced by Egyptian nationalism, as espoused by politician Mustafa Kamel, poet Ahmed Shawqi, and his anti-colonialist instructor at the Royal Military Academy, Aziz al-Masri, to whom Nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview. He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel Return of the Spirit, in which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only in need of a \\"man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective\\". Nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the 1952 coup d'√©tat. Military career alt=A man wearing a tweed, pinstriped jacket and a tie. His hair is raised and black and he has a thin mustache. In 1937, Nasser applied to the Royal Military Academy for army officer training, but his police record of anti-government protest initially blocked his entry. Disappointed, he enrolled in the law school at King Fuad University, but quit after one semester to reapply to the Military Academy. From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of \\"dignity, glory, and freedom\\" in his youth, became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority. Convinced that he needed a wasta, or an influential intermediary to promote his application above the others, Nasser managed to secure a meeting with Under-Secretary of War Ibrahim Khairy Pasha, the person responsible for the academy's selection board, and requested his help. Khairy Pasha agreed and sponsored Nasser's second application, which was accepted in late 1937. Nasser focused on his military career from then on, and had little contact with his family. At the academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, both of whom became important aides during his presidency. After graduating from the academy in July 1938, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, and posted to Mankabad. It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades, including Sadat and Amer, first discussed their dissatisfaction at widespread corruption in the country and their desire to topple the monarchy. Sadat would later write that because of his \\"energy, clear-thinking, and balanced judgement\\", Nasser emerged as the group's natural leader. Nasser (center) with Ahmed Mazhar (left) in army, 1940 In 1941, Nasser was posted to Khartoum, Sudan, which was part of Egypt at the time. Nasser returned to Egypt in September 1942 after a brief stay in Sudan, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943. In 1942, the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, \\"I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack\\", and wished for \\"calamity\\" to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution. Nasser stayed in touch with the group's members primarily through Amer, who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them. =1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War= Faluja pocket, displaying weapons captured from the Israeli Army during the 1948 war. Nasser's first battlefield experience was in Palestine during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. He initially volunteered to serve with the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) led by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. Nasser met with and impressed al-Husayni, but was ultimately refused entry to the AHC's forces by the Egyptian government for reasons that were unclear. In May 1948, following the British withdrawal, King Farouk sent the Egyptian army into Israel, with Nasser serving as a staff officer of the 6th Infantry Battalion. During the war, he wrote of the Egyptian army's unpreparedness, saying \\"our soldiers were dashed against fortifications\\". Nasser was deputy commander of the Egyptian forces that secured the Faluja pocket (commanded by Said Taha Bey nicknamed the \\"Sudanese tiger\\" by the Israelis). On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting. By August, his brigade was surrounded by the Israeli Army. Appeals for help from Jordan's Arab Legion went unheeded, but the brigade refused to surrender. Negotiations between Israel and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel. According to veteran journalist Eric Margolis, the defenders of Faluja, \\"including young army officer Gamal Abdel Nasser, became national heroes\\" for enduring Israeli bombardment while isolated from their command. Still stationed after the war in the Faluja enclave, Nasser agreed to an Israeli request to identify 67 killed soldiers of the \\"religious platoon\\". The expedition was led by Rabbi Shlomo Goren and Nasser personally accompanied him, ordering the Egyptian soldiers to stand at attention. They spoke briefly, and according to Goren, after learning what the square phylacteries found with the soldiers were, Nasser told him that he \\"now understands their courageous stand\\". During an interview on Israeli TV in 1971, Rabbi Goren claimed the two agreed to meet again when the time of peace comes.Israeli TV, \\"Such a Life\\" 1971, interviewing Rabbi Shlomo Goren along with witnesses to the event (in Hebrew)67 dead, Who remembers \\"God's platoon\\" Maariv (NRG website, in Hebrew) The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum hosted a public celebration for the officers' return despite reservations from the royal government, which had been pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude between the government and the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple the monarchy. Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege. After the war, Nasser returned to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March. Revolution =Free Officers= The Free Officers after the coup, 1953. Counterclockwise: Zakaria Mohieddin, Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Kamel el-Din Hussein (standing), Nasser (seated), Abdel Hakim Amer, Mohamed Naguib, Youssef Seddik, and Ahmad Shawki. Nasser's return to Egypt coincided with Husni al- Za'im's Syrian coup d'√©tat. Its success and evident popular support among the Syrian people encouraged Nasser's revolutionary pursuits. Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister Ibrahim Abdel Hadi regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers. According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations. Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser. The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities. After 1949, the group adopted the name \\"Association of Free Officers\\" and advocated \\"little else but freedom and the restoration of their country‚Äôs dignity\\". Nasser organized the Free Officers' founding committee, which eventually comprised fourteen men from different social and political backgrounds, including representation from Young Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Communist Party, and the aristocracy. Nasser was unanimously elected chairman of the organization. In the 1950 parliamentary elections, the Wafd Party of el-Nahhas gained a victory‚Äîmostly due to the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted the elections‚Äîand was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own. Accusations of corruption against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront of Egyptian politics. By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members; according to Khaled Mohieddin, \\"nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser\\". Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins. On 11 October 1951, the Wafd government abrogated the 1936 Anglo- Egyptian Treaty, which had given the British control over the Suez Canal until 1956. The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act. According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage \\"a large scale assassination campaign\\". In January 1952, he and Hassan Ibrahim attempted to kill the royalist general Hussein Sirri Amer by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo. Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded an innocent female passerby. Nasser recalled that her wails \\"haunted\\" him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future. Sirri Amer was close to King Farouk, and was nominated for the presidency of the Officer's Club‚Äînormally a ceremonial office‚Äîwith the king's backing. Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy, and with Amer as the intercessor, resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers. They selected Mohamed Naguib, a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War. Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers, through their connection with a leading Egyptian daily, al- Misri, publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army. =Revolution of 1952= Leaders of Egypt following the ouster of King Farouk, November 1952. Seated, left to right: Sulayman Hafez, Mohamed Naguib and Nasser On 25 January 1952, a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia caused 40 Egyptian policemen to die, provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead. Afterwards, Nasser published a simple six-point program in Rose al-Y≈´suf to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt. In May, Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association. The Free Officers' intention was not to install themselves in government, but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy. Nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself (a lieutenant colonel) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected General Naguib to be his \\"boss\\" and lead the coup in name. The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation. In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk. Under pressure from the Americans, Nasser had agreed to exile the deposed king with an honorary ceremony. On 18 June 1953, the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Egypt declared, with Naguib as its first president. According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the \\"guardians of the people's interests\\" against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians. They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes‚Äîagrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties‚Äîas too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect. In Nasser's eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution. Preceding the reform law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile factories in Kafr el-Dawwar, leading to a clash with the army that left nine people dead. While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, who were willing to serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.

In January 1953, Nasser overcame opposition from Naguib and banned all political parties, creating a one-party system under the Liberation Rally, a loosely structured movement whose chief task was to organize pro-RCC rallies and lectures, with Nasser its secretary-general. Despite the dissolution order, Nasser was the only RCC member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer Abdel Latif Boghdadi. Although outvoted, he still advocated holding elections by 1956. In March 1953, Nasser led the Egyptian delegation negotiating a British withdrawal from the Suez Canal. When Naguib began showing signs of independence from Nasser by distancing himself from the RCC's land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt's established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Brotherhood, Nasser resolved to depose him. In June, Nasser took control of the interior ministry post from Naguib loyalist Sulayman Hafez, and pressured Naguib to conclude the abolition of the monarchy. On 25 February 1954, Naguib announced his resignation after the RCC held an official meeting without his presence two days prior. On 26 February, Nasser accepted the resignation, put Naguib under house arrest, and the RCC proclaimed Nasser as both RCC chairman and prime minister. As Naguib intended, a mutiny immediately followed, demanding Naguib's reinstatement and the RCC's dissolution. While visiting the striking officers at Military Headquarters (GHQ) to call for the mutiny's end, Nasser was initially intimidated into accepting their demands. However, on 27 February, Nasser's supporters in the army launched a raid on the GHQ, ending the mutiny. Later that day, hundreds of thousands of protesters, mainly belonging to the Brotherhood, called for Naguib's return and Nasser's imprisonment. In response, a sizable group within the RCC, led by Khaled Mohieddin, demanded Naguib's release and return to the presidency. Nasser acquiesced, but delayed Naguib's reinstatement until 4 March, allowing him to promote Amer to Commander of the Armed Forces‚Äîa position formerly occupied by Naguib. On 5 March, Nasser's security coterie arrested thousands of participants in the uprising. As a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order, the RCC decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the Free Officers' withdrawal from politics. The RCC succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution, namely the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois, to oppose the decrees, with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering Cairo in protest in late March. Naguib sought to crack down on the protesters, but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces. On 29 March, Nasser announced the decrees' revocation in response to the \\"impulse of the street\\". Between April and June, hundreds of Naguib's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed, and Mohieddin was informally exiled to Switzerland to represent the RCC abroad. King Saud of Saudi Arabia attempted to mend relations between Nasser and Naguib, but to no avail. =Assuming chairmanship of RCC= Liberation organization in Alexandria invitation to Nasser speech 26 October 1954 Sound recording of 1954 assassination attempt on Nasser while he was addressing a crowd in Manshia, Alexandria. On 26 October 1954, Muslim Brotherhood member Mahmoud Abdel-Latif attempted to assassinate Nasser while he was delivering a speech in Alexandria, broadcast to the Arab world by radio, to celebrate the British military withdrawal. The gunman was away from him and fired eight shots, but all missed Nasser. Panic broke out in the mass audience, but Nasser maintained his posture and raised his voice to appeal for calm. With great emotion he exclaimed the following: > My countrymen, my blood spills for you and for Egypt. I will live for your > sake and die for the sake of your freedom and honor. Let them kill me; it > does not concern me so long as I have instilled pride, honor, and freedom in > you. If Gamal Abdel Nasser should die, each of you shall be Gamal Abdel > Nasser ... Gamal Abdel Nasser is of you and from you and he is willing to > sacrifice his life for the nation. Nasser greeted by crowds in Alexandria one day after his announcement of the British withdrawal and the assassination attempt against him, 27 October 1954. The crowd roared in approval and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered one of the largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to defend him. With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt. Nasser's street following was still too small to sustain his plans for reform and to secure him in office. To promote himself and the Liberation Rally, he gave speeches in a cross-country tour, and imposed controls over the country's press by decreeing that all publications had to be approved by the party to prevent \\"sedition\\". Both Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez, the leading Arab singers of the era, performed songs praising Nasser's nationalism. Others produced plays denigrating his political opponents. According to his associates, Nasser orchestrated the campaign himself. Arab nationalist terms such \\"Arab homeland\\" and \\"Arab nation\\" frequently began appearing in his speeches in 1954‚Äì55, whereas prior he would refer to the Arab \\"peoples\\" or the \\"Arab region\\". In January 1955, the RCC appointed him as their president, pending national elections. Nasser made secret contacts with Israel in 1954‚Äì55, but determined that peace with Israel would be impossible, considering it an \\"expansionist state that viewed the Arabs with disdain\\". On 28 February 1955, Israeli troops attacked the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip with the stated aim of suppressing Palestinian fedayeen raids. Nasser did not feel that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and did not retaliate militarily. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted a blow to his growing popularity. Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the blockade on Israeli shipping through the Straits of Tiran and restricted the use of airspace over the Gulf of Aqaba by Israeli aircraft in early September. The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September. Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the Arab League and \\"perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism\\". Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September. Through the Czechoslovakian arms deal, the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less equalized and Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced. =Adoption of neutralism= Imam Ahmad of North Yemen facing the camera, Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia in white robes in the background, Amin al- Husayni of the All-Palestine Government in the foreground at the Bandung Conference, April 1955 At the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in late April 1955, Nasser was treated as the leading representative of the Arab countries and was one of the most popular figures at the summit. He had paid earlier visits to Pakistan (9 April), India (14 April), Burma, and Afghanistan on the way to Bandung, and previously cemented a treaty of friendship with India in Cairo on 6 April, strengthening Egyptian‚ÄìIndian relations on the international policy and economic development fronts. Nasser mediated discussions between the pro-Western, pro-Soviet, and neutralist conference factions over the composition of the \\"Final Communique\\" addressing colonialism in Africa and Asia and the fostering of global peace amid the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union. At Bandung, Nasser sought a proclamation for the avoidance of international defense alliances, support for the independence of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco from French rule, support for the Palestinian right of return, and the implementation of UN resolutions regarding the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. He succeeded in lobbying the attendees to pass resolutions on each of these issues, notably securing the strong support of China and India. Following Bandung, Nasser officially adopted the \\"positive neutralism\\" of Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a principal theme of Egyptian foreign policy regarding the Cold War. Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference. Consequently, Nasser's prestige was greatly boosted as was his self-confidence and image. =1956 constitution and presidency= Nasser submitting his vote for the referendum of the proposed constitution, 23 June 1956 With his domestic position considerably strengthened, Nasser was able to secure primacy over his RCC colleagues and gained relatively unchallenged decision-making authority, particularly over foreign policy. In January 1956, the new Constitution of Egypt was drafted, entailing the establishment of a single-party system under the National Union (NU), a movement Nasser described as the \\"cadre through which we will realize our revolution\\". The NU was a reconfiguration of the Liberation Rally, which Nasser determined had failed in generating mass public participation. In the new movement, Nasser attempted to incorporate more citizens, approved by local-level party committees, in order to solidify popular backing for his government. The NU would select a nominee for the presidential election whose name would be provided for public approval. Nasser's nomination for the post and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection for women in the workplace. Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet. Nationalization of the Suez Canal Nasser raising the Egyptian flag over the Suez Canal city of Port Said to celebrate the final British military withdrawal from the country, June 1956 After the three-year transition period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly collided with the regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project. Nasser was informed of the British‚ÄìAmerican withdrawal in a news statement while aboard a plane returning to Cairo from Belgrade, and took great offense. Although ideas for nationalizing the Suez Canal were in the offing after the UK agreed to withdraw its military from Egypt in 1954 (the last British troops left on 13 June 1956), journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal asserts that Nasser made the final decision to nationalize the waterway between 19 and 20 July. Nasser himself would later state that he decided on 23 July, after studying the issue and deliberating with some of his advisers from the dissolved RCC, namely Boghdadi and technical specialist Mahmoud Younis, beginning on 21 July. The rest of the RCC's former members were informed of the decision on 24 July, while the bulk of the cabinet was unaware of the nationalization scheme until hours before Nasser publicly announced it. According to Ramadan, Nasser's decision to nationalize the canal was a solitary decision, taken without consultation. On 26 July 1956, Nasser gave a speech in Alexandria announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company as a means to fund the Aswan Dam project in light of the British‚ÄìAmerican withdrawal. In the speech, he denounced British imperialism in Egypt and British control over the canal company's profits, and upheld that the Egyptian people had a right to sovereignty over the waterway, especially since \\"120,000 Egyptians had died building it\\". The motion was technically in breach of the international agreement he had signed with the UK on 19 October 1954, although he ensured that all existing stockholders would be paid off. The nationalization announcement was greeted very emotionally by the audience and, throughout the Arab world, thousands entered the streets shouting slogans of support. US ambassador Henry A. Byroade stated, \\"I cannot overemphasize [the] popularity of the Canal Company nationalization within Egypt, even among Nasser's enemies.\\" Egyptian political scientist Mahmoud Hamad wrote that, prior to 1956, Nasser had consolidated control over Egypt's military and civilian bureaucracies, but it was only after the canal's nationalization that he gained near-total popular legitimacy and firmly established himself as the \\"charismatic leader\\" and \\"spokesman for the masses not only in Egypt, but all over the Third World\\". According to Aburish, this was Nasser's largest pan- Arab triumph at the time and \\"soon his pictures were to be found in the tents of Yemen, the souks of Marrakesh, and the posh villas of Syria\\". The official reason given for the nationalization was that funds from the canal would be used for the construction of the dam in Aswan. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. =Suez Crisis= Movietone newsreels reporting Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal and both domestic and Western reactions France and the UK, the largest shareholders in the Suez Canal Company, saw its nationalization as yet another hostile measure aimed at them by the Egyptian government. Nasser was aware that the canal's nationalization would instigate an international crisis and believed the prospect of military intervention by the two countries was 80 percent likely. Nasser dismissed their claims,Nasser 1956 speech mocking the media and the British denunciation of him (in Egyptian Arabic, Youtube) and believed that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as \\"impossible\\". In early October, the UN Security Council met on the matter of the canal's nationalization and adopted a resolution recognizing Egypt's right to control the canal as long as it continued to allow passage through it for foreign ships. According to Heikal, after this agreement, \\"Nasser estimated that the danger of invasion had dropped to 10 percent\\". Shortly thereafter, however, the UK, France, and Israel made a secret agreement to take over the Suez Canal, occupy the Suez Canal zone, and topple Nasser. On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces crossed the Sinai Peninsula, overwhelmed Egyptian army posts, and quickly advanced to their objectives. Two days later, British and French planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone. Nasser ordered the military's high command to withdraw the Egyptian Army from Sinai to bolster the canal's defenses. Moreover, he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the Israeli invading force and the British and French subsequently landed in the canal city of Port Said, Egyptian armor in the Sinai would be cut off from the canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces. Amer strongly disagreed, insisting that Egyptian tanks meet the Israelis in battle. The two had a heated exchange on 3 November, and Amer conceded. Nasser also ordered blockage of the canal by sinking or otherwise disabling forty-nine ships at its entrance. Despite the commanded withdrawal of Egyptian troops, about 2,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed during engagement with Israeli forces, and some 5,000 Egyptian soldiers were captured by the Israeli Army. Amer and Salah Salem proposed requesting a ceasefire, with Salem further recommending that Nasser surrender himself to British forces. Nasser berated Amer and Salem, and vowed, \\"Nobody is going to surrender.\\" Nasser assumed military command. Despite the relative ease in which Sinai was occupied, Nasser's prestige at home and among Arabs was undamaged. To counterbalance the Egyptian Army's dismal performance, Nasser authorized the distribution of about 400,000 rifles to civilian volunteers and hundreds of militias were formed throughout Egypt, many led by Nasser's political opponents. It was at Port Said that Nasser saw a confrontation with the invading forces as being the strategic and psychological focal point of Egypt's defense. A third infantry battalion and hundreds of national guardsmen were sent to the city as reinforcements, while two regular companies were dispatched to organize popular resistance. Nasser and Boghdadi traveled to the canal zone to boost the morale of the armed volunteers. According to Boghdadi's memoirs, Nasser described the Egyptian Army as \\"shattered\\" as he saw the wreckage of Egyptian military equipment en route. When British and French forces landed in Port Said on 5‚Äì6 November, its local militia put up a stiff resistance, resulting in street-to-street fighting. The Egyptian Army commander in the city was preparing to request terms for a ceasefire, but Nasser ordered him to desist. The British-French forces managed to largely secure the city by 7 November. Between 750 and 1,000 Egyptians were killed in the battle for Port Said. The US Eisenhower administration condemned the tripartite invasion, and supported UN resolutions demanding withdrawal and a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to be stationed in Sinai. Nasser commended Eisenhower, stating he played the \\"greatest and most decisive role\\" in stopping the \\"tripartite conspiracy\\". By the end of December, British and French forces had totally withdrawn from Egyptian territory, while Israel completed its withdrawal in March 1957 and released all Egyptian prisoners of war. As a result of the Suez Crisis, Nasser brought in a set of regulations imposing rigorous requirements for residency and citizenship as well as forced expulsions, mostly affecting British and French nationals and Jews with foreign nationality, as well as many Egyptian Jews. Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community, left in 1956, mainly for Israel, Europe, the United States and South America.Nasser refutes Jewish accusations of expulsion or mistreatement in the Southern Israelite (Jewish) Newspaper, 1957 After the fighting ended, Amer accused Nasser of provoking an unnecessary war and then blaming the military for the result. On 8 April, the canal was reopened, and Nasser's political position was enormously enhanced by the widely perceived failure of the invasion and attempt to topple him. British diplomat Anthony Nutting claimed the crisis \\"established Nasser finally and completely\\" as the rayyes (president) of Egypt. Pan-Arabism and socialism The signing of the regional defense pact between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Jordan, January 1957. At the forefront, from left right: Prime Minister Sulayman al-Nabulsi of Jordan, King Hussein of Jordan, King Saud of Saudi Arabia, Nasser, Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali of Syria By 1957, pan-Arabism had become the dominant ideology in the Arab world, and the average Arab citizen considered Nasser his undisputed leader. Historian Adeed Dawisha credited Nasser's status to his \\"charisma, bolstered by his perceived victory in the Suez Crisis\\". The Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station spread Nasser's ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world, so much so that historian Eugene Rogan wrote, \\"Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio.\\" Lebanese sympathizers of Nasser and the Egyptian embassy in Beirut‚Äîthe press center of the Arab world‚Äîbought out Lebanese media outlets to further disseminate Nasser's ideals. Egypt also expanded its policy of secondment, dispatching thousands of high-skilled Egyptian professionals (usually politically-active teachers) across the region. Nasser also enjoyed the support of Arab nationalist civilian and paramilitary organizations throughout the region. His followers were numerous and well-funded, but lacked any permanent structure and organization. They called themselves \\"Nasserites\\", despite Nasser's objection to the label (he preferred the term \\"Arab nationalists\\"). In January 1957, the US adopted the Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged to prevent the spread of communism and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. Relations between Nasser and King Hussein of Jordan deteriorated in April when Hussein implicated Nasser in two coup attempts against him‚Äîalthough Nasser's involvement was never established‚Äîand dissolved al-Nabulsi's cabinet. Nasser subsequently slammed Hussein on Cairo radio as being \\"a tool of the imperialists\\". Relations with King Saud also became antagonistic as the latter began to fear that Nasser's increasing popularity in Saudi Arabia was a genuine threat to the royal family's survival. Despite opposition from the governments of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Lebanon, Nasser maintained his prestige among their citizens and those of other Arab countries. By the end of 1957, Nasser nationalized all remaining British and French assets in Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them a part of his economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product and tens of thousands of jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds. =United Arab Republic= Nasser's announcement of the United Arab Republic, 23 February 1958 Newsreel clip about Nasser and Quwatli's establishment of United Arab Republic Despite his popularity with the people of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians. As political instability grew in Syria, delegations from the country were sent to Nasser demanding immediate unification with Egypt. Nasser initially turned down the request, citing the two countries' incompatible political and economic systems, lack of contiguity, the Syrian military's record of intervention in politics, and the deep factionalism among Syria's political forces. However, in January 1958, a second Syrian delegation managed to convince Nasser of an impending communist takeover and a consequent slide to civil strife. Nasser subsequently opted for union, albeit on the condition that it would be a total political merger with him as its president, to which the delegates and Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli agreed. On 1 February, the United Arab Republic (UAR) was proclaimed and, according to Dawisha, the Arab world reacted in \\"stunned amazement, which quickly turned into uncontrolled euphoria.\\" Nasser ordered a crackdown against Syrian communists, dismissing many of them from their governmental posts. Nasser seated alongside Crown Prince alt=Three important fellows on a couch, two in suits On a surprise visit to Damascus to celebrate the union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds in the hundreds of thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen‚Äîthe United Arab States‚Äîin place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism. A day after announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and the dissolution of all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries. =Influence on the Arab world= In Lebanon, clashes between pro-Nasser factions and supporters of staunch Nasser opponent, then-President Camille Chamoun, culminated in civil strife by May. The former sought to unite with the UAR, while the latter sought Lebanon's continued independence. Nasser delegated oversight of the issue to Sarraj, who provided limited aid to Nasser's Lebanese supporters through money, light arms, and officer training‚Äîshort of the large-scale support that Chamoun alleged. Nasser did not covet Lebanon, seeing it as a \\"special case\\", but sought to prevent Chamoun from a second presidential term. In Oman, the Jebel Akhdar War between the rebels in the interior of Oman against the British-backed Sultanate of Oman prompted Nasser to support the rebels in what was considered a war against colonialism between 1954 and 1959.Gregory Fremont Barnes: A History of CounterinsurgencyThe New York Times: Oman Dispute Highlights U.S.-British Differences Nasser (right) and Lebanese president Fuad Chehab (to Nasser's right) at the Syrian‚ÄìLebanese border during talks to end the crisis in Lebanon. Akram al-Hawrani stands third to Nasser's left, and Abdel Hamid Sarraj stands to Chehab's right, March 1959. On 14 July 1958, Iraqi army officers Abdel Karim Qasim and Abdel Salam Aref overthrew the Iraqi monarchy and, the next day, Iraqi prime minister and Nasser's chief Arab antagonist, Nuri al-Said, was killed. The entire Iraqi royal family was killed, and Al- Said's and Iraqi crown prince 'Abd al-Ilah's bodies were mutilated and dragged across Baghdad. Nasser recognized the new government and stated that \\"any attack on Iraq was tantamount to an attack on the UAR\\". On 15 July, US marines landed in Lebanon, and British special forces in Jordan, upon the request of those countries' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-Nasser forces. Nasser felt that the revolution in Iraq left the road for pan-Arab unity unblocked. On 19 July, for the first time, he declared that he was opting for full Arab union, although he had no plan to merge Iraq with the UAR. While most members of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) favored Iraqi-UAR unity, Qasim sought to keep Iraq independent and resented Nasser's large popular base in the country. In the fall of 1958, Nasser formed a tripartite committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected to the introduction of Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese‚ÄìSyrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis. Nasser waving to crowds in Damascus, Syria, October 1960 Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew increasingly bitter on 9 March, after Qasim's forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched a day earlier by a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who had been allowed to re-enter Egypt in 1956. By December, the political situation in Syria was faltering and Nasser responded by appointing Amer as governor-general alongside Sarraj. Syria's leaders opposed the appointment and many resigned from their government posts. Nasser later met with the opposition leaders and in a heated moment, exclaimed that he was the elected president of the UAR and those who did not accept his authority could \\"walk away\\". =Collapse of the union and aftermath= Opposition to the union mounted among some of Syria's key elements, namely the socioeconomic, political, and military elites. In response to Syria's worsening economy, which Nasser attributed to its control by the bourgeoisie, in July 1961, Nasser decreed socialist measures that nationalized wide-ranging sectors of the Syrian economy. He also dismissed Sarraj in September to curb the growing political crisis. Aburish states that Nasser was not fully capable of addressing Syrian problems because they were \\"foreign to him\\". In Egypt, the economic situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry. In 1960, Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press, which had already been cooperating with his government, in order to steer coverage towards the country's socioeconomic issues and galvanize public support for his socialist measures. On 28 September 1961, secessionist army units launched a coup in Damascus, declaring Syria's secession from the UAR. In response, pro-union army units in northern Syria revolted and pro-Nasser protests occurred in major Syrian cities. Nasser sent Egyptian special forces to Latakia to bolster his allies, but withdrew them two days later, citing a refusal to allow inter-Arab fighting. Addressing the UAR's breakup on 5 October, Nasser accepted personal responsibility and declared that Egypt would recognize an elected Syrian government. He privately blamed interference by hostile Arab governments. According to Heikal, Nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after the dissolution of the union; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deteriorate. =Revival on regional stage= Nasser (center) receiving Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella (right) and Iraqi president Abdel Salam Aref (left) for the Arab League summit in Alexandria, September 1964. Ben Bella and Aref were close allies of Nasser. Nasser's regional position changed unexpectedly when Yemeni officers led by Nasser supporter Abdullah al-Sallal overthrew Imam Badr of North Yemen on 27 September 1962. Al-Badr and his tribal partisans began receiving increasing support from Saudi Arabia to help reinstate the kingdom, while Nasser subsequently accepted a request by Sallal to militarily aid the new government on 30 September. Consequently, Egypt became increasingly embroiled in the drawn-out civil war until it withdrew its forces in 1967. Most of Nasser's old colleagues had questioned the wisdom of continuing the war, but Amer reassured Nasser of their coming victory. Nasser later remarked in 1968 that intervention in Yemen was a \\"miscalculation\\". In July 1962, Algeria became independent of France. As a staunch political and financial supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory. Amid these developments, a pro-Nasser clique in the Saudi royal family led by Prince Talal defected to Egypt, along with the Jordanian chief of staff, in early 1963. On 8 February 1963, a military coup in Iraq led by a Ba'athist‚ÄìNasserist alliance toppled Qasim, who was subsequently shot dead. Abdel Salam Aref, a Nasserist, was chosen to be the new president. A similar alliance toppled the Syrian government on 8 March. On 14 March, the new Iraqi and Syrian governments sent Nasser delegations to push for a new Arab union. At the meeting, Nasser lambasted the Ba'athists for \\"facilitating\\" Syria's split from the UAR, and asserted that he was the \\"leader of the Arabs\\". A transitional unity agreement stipulating a federal system was signed by the parties on 17 April and the new union was set to be established in May 1965. However, the agreement fell apart weeks later when Syria's Ba'athists purged Nasser's supporters from the officers corps. A failed counter-coup by a Nasserist colonel followed, after which Nasser condemned the Ba'athists as \\"fascists\\". Nasser before Yemeni crowds on his arrival to Sana'a, April 1964. In front of Nasser and giving a salute is Yemeni President Abdullah al-Sallal In January 1964, Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel's plans to divert the Jordan River's waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war. Nasser blamed Arab divisions for what he deemed \\"the disastrous situation\\". He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis, conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel. During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco. In May, Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue by initiating the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In practice, Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen. Its head was to be Ahmad Shukeiri, Nasser's personal nominee. Nasser in 1968 After years of foreign policy coordination and developing ties, Nasser, President Sukarno of Indonesia, President Tito of Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister Nehru of India founded the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961. Its declared purpose was to solidify international non- alignment and promote world peace amid the Cold War, end colonization, and increase economic cooperation among developing countries. In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo. Nasser played a significant part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had a key role in the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.

From left to right; Interior Minister Zakaria Mohieddin, Nasser, Social Affairs Minister Hussein el-Shafei and National Union Secretary Anwar Sadat =Al-Azhar= In 1961, Nasser sought to firmly establish Egypt as the leader of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953. Nasser instructed al-Azhar to create changes in its syllabus that trickled to the lower levels of Egyptian education, consequently allowing the establishment of coeducational schools and the introduction of evolution into school curriculum. The reforms also included the merger of religious and civil courts. Moreover, Nasser forced al-Azhar to issue a fatwƒÅ admitting Shia Muslims, Alawites, and Druze into mainstream Islam; for centuries prior, al-Azhar deemed them to be \\"heretics\\". =Rivalry with Amer= Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew concerned with Amer's inability to train and modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him. In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser for the first time and secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government. According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on. =National Charter and second term= alt=Two men on a stage, with a flag hung behind them. One is reading from a paper, while the other is looking at the audience. Cameras are shooting the event, while most of the audience is looking at the stage. In October 1961, Nasser embarked on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women's rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal. Nasser also attempted to maintain oversight of the country's civil service to prevent it from inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51 percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest. During the presidential referendum in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected to a second term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the '60s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably. Six-Day War Nasser (center), King Hussein of Jordan (left) and Egyptian Army Chief of Staff Abdel Hakim Amer (right) at the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces headquarters in Cairo before signing a mutual defense pact, 30 May 1967 In mid May 1967, the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria, although Chief of Staff Mohamed Fawzi considered the warnings to be \\"baseless\\". According to Kandil, without Nasser's authorization, Amer used the Soviet warnings as a pretext to dispatch troops to Sinai on 14 May, and Nasser subsequently demanded UNEF's withdrawal. Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of Israeli-American collusion to drag Egypt into war. The message had been originally received by Amer on 2 May, but was withheld from Nasser until the Sinai deployment on 14 May. Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel, Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian-Israeli war would risk the West Bank's occupation by Israel. Nasser still felt that the US would restrain Israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the US and Soviet Union. In turn, he also reassured both powers that Egypt would only act defensively. On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser to order the Straits of Tiran blockaded, a move Nasser believed Israel would use as a casus belli. Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation, but Nasser doubted Amer's assessment of the military's readiness. According to Nasser's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although \\"Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on\\". Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike. Nasser refused the call upon determination that the air force lacked pilots and Amer's handpicked officers were incompetent. Still, Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked, Egypt's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire. Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war, under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments. On 26 May Nasser declared, \\"our basic objective will be to destroy Israel\\". On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria. On the morning of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, destroying much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai‚Äîcausing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. According to Sadat, it was only when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian garrison at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into \\"a nonstop shouting match\\". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser‚ÄìAmer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions. =Resignation and aftermath= During the first four days of the war, the general population of the Arab world believed Arab radio station fabrications of imminent Arab victory. On 9 June, Nasser appeared on television to inform Egypt's citizens of their country's defeat. He announced his resignation on television later that day, and ceded all presidential powers to his then-Vice President Zakaria Mohieddin, who had no prior information of this decision and refused to accept the post. Hundreds of thousands of sympathizers poured into the streets in mass demonstrations throughout Egypt and across the Arab world rejecting his resignation, chanting, \\"We are your soldiers, Gamal!\\" Nasser retracted his decision the next day. Egyptian demonstrators protesting Nasser's resignation, 1967 On 11 July, Nasser replaced Amer with Mohamed Fawzi as general commander, over the protestations of Amer's loyalists in the military, 600 of whom marched on army headquarters and demanded Amer's reinstatement. After Nasser sacked thirty of the loyalists in response, Amer and his allies devised a plan to topple him on 27 August. Nasser was tipped off about their activities and, after several invitations, he convinced Amer to meet him at his home on 24 August. Nasser confronted Amer about the coup plot, which he denied before being arrested by Mohieddin. Amer committed suicide on 14 September. Despite his souring relationship with Amer, Nasser spoke of losing \\"the person closest to [him]\\". Thereafter, Nasser began a process of depoliticizing the armed forces, arresting dozens of leading military and intelligence figures loyal to Amer. A video clip of Nasser's resignation speech At the 29 August Arab League summit in Khartoum, Nasser's usual commanding position had receded as the attending heads of state expected Saudi King Faisal to lead. A ceasefire in the Yemen War was declared and the summit concluded with the Khartoum Resolution. The Soviet Union soon resupplied the Egyptian military with about half of its former arsenals and broke diplomatic relations with Israel. Nasser cut relations with the US following the war, and, according to Aburish, his policy of \\"playing the superpowers against each other\\" ended. In November, Nasser accepted UN Resolution 242, which called for Israel's withdrawal from territories acquired in the war. His supporters claimed Nasser's move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with Israel, while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in Palestinian independence.

General Commander Mohamed Fawzi is directly behind Nasser, and to their left is Chief of Staff Abdel Moneim Riad. =Domestic reforms and governmental changes= Nasser appointed himself the additional roles of prime minister and supreme commander of the armed forces on 19 June 1967. Angry at the military court's perceived leniency with air force officers charged with negligence during the 1967 war, workers and students launched protests calling for major political reforms in late February 1968. Nasser responded to the demonstrations, the most significant public challenge to his rule since workers' protests in March 1954, by removing most military figures from his cabinet and appointing eight civilians in place of several high-ranking members of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). By 3 March, Nasser directed Egypt's intelligence apparatus to focus on external rather than domestic espionage, and declared the \\"fall of the mukhabarat state\\". On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a manifesto stipulating the restoration of civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest decision- making body. Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although its promises would largely go unfulfilled. Nasser appointed Sadat and Hussein el-Shafei as his vice presidents in December 1969. By then, relations with his other original military comrades, namely Khaled and Zakaria Mohieddin and former vice president Sabri, had become strained. By mid-1970, Nasser pondered replacing Sadat with Boghdadi after reconciling with the latter. =War of Attrition and regional diplomatic initiatives= Nasser brokering a ceasefire between Yasser Arafat of the PLO (left) and King Hussein of Jordan (right) at the emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 27 September 1970, one day before Nasser's death Meanwhile, in January 1968, Nasser commenced the War of Attrition to reclaim territory captured by Israel, ordering attacks against Israeli positions east of the then-blockaded Suez Canal. In March, Nasser offered Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement arms and funds after their performance against Israeli forces in the Battle of Karameh that month. He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nasser effectively ceded his leadership of the \\"Palestine issue\\" to Arafat. Israel retaliated against Egyptian shelling with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes. This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank. Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various Arab states. The war resumed in March 1969. In November, Nasser brokered an agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese military that granted Palestinian guerrillas the right to use Lebanese territory to attack Israel. In June 1970, Nasser accepted the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, which called for an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender. Following Nasser's acceptance, Israel agreed to a ceasefire and Nasser used the lull in fighting to move surface-to-air missiles towards the canal zone. Meanwhile, tensions in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering; following the Dawson's Field hijackings, a military campaign was launched to rout out PLO forces. The offensive elevated risks of a regional war and prompted Nasser to hold an emergency Arab League summit on 27 September in Cairo, where he forged a ceasefire. Death and funeral Nasser's funeral procession attended by five million mourners in Cairo, 1 October 1970 As the summit closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser suffered a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6 p.m. at age 52. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely cause of death was arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was also a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease‚Äîtwo of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969. Following the announcement of Nasser's death, Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock. Nasser's funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October was attended by at least five million mourners. The procession to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by MiG-21 jets. His flag-draped coffin was attached to a gun carriage pulled by six horses and led by a column of cavalrymen. All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal. King Hussein and Arafat cried openly, and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya fainted from emotional distress twice. A few major non-Arab dignitaries were present, including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and French Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas. alt=The front side of a mosque with only one minaret containing a clock. Almost immediately after the procession began, mourners engulfed Nasser's coffin chanting, \\"There is no God but Allah, and Nasser is God's beloved‚Ä¶ Each of us is Nasser.\\" Police unsuccessfully attempted to quell the crowds and, as a result, most of the foreign dignitaries were evacuated. The final destination was the Nasr Mosque, which was afterwards renamed Abdel Nasser Mosque, where Nasser was buried. Because of his ability to motivate nationalistic passions, \\"men, women, and children wept and wailed in the streets\\" after hearing of his death, according to Nutting. The general Arab reaction was one of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world. Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in Jerusalem, roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting, \\"Nasser will never die.\\" As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people, following his death, the headline of the Lebanese Le Jour read, \\"One hundred million human beings‚Äîthe Arabs‚Äîare orphans.\\" Sherif Hetata, a former political prisoner and later member Nasser's ASU, said that \\"Nasser's greatest achievement was his funeral. The world will never again see five million people crying together.\\" Legacy Nasser presenting prominent writer Taha Hussein (standing in front of Nasser with sunglasses) with a national honors prize for literature, 1959 Nasser made Egypt fully independent of British influence, and the country became a major power in the developing world under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. However, these advances came at the expense of civil liberties. In Nasser's Egypt, the media were tightly controlled, mail was opened, and telephones were wiretapped.Gamal Abdel Nasser at Encyclopedia Britannica He was elected in 1956, 1958 and 1965 in plebiscites in which he was the sole candidate, each time claiming unanimous or near-unanimous support. With few exceptions, the legislature did little more than approve Nasser's policies. As the legislature was made up almost entirely of government supporters, Nasser effectively held all governing power in the nation. By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort. The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform, major modernization projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam, and nationalization schemes such as that of the Suez Canal. However, the marked economic growth of the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970. Egypt experienced a \\"golden age\\" of culture during Nasser's presidency, according to historian Joel Gordon, particularly in film, television, theater, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy, poetry, and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields, producing cultural icons. During Mubarak's presidency, Nasserist political parties began to emerge in Egypt, the first being the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP). The party carried minor political influence, and splits between its members beginning in 1995 resulted in the gradual establishment of splinter parties, including Hamdeen Sabahi's 1997 founding of Al-Karama. Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election. Nasserist activists were among the founders of Kefaya, a major opposition force during Mubarak's rule. On 19 September 2012, four Nasserist parties (the ADNP, Karama, the National Conciliation Party, and the Popular Nasserist Congress Party) merged to form the United Nasserist Party. =Image= Nasser speaking to a homeless Egyptian man and offering him a job, after the man was found sleeping below the stage where Nasser was seated, 1959 Nasser was known for his accessibility and direct relationship with ordinary Egyptians. His availability to the public, despite assassination attempts against him, was unparalleled among his successors. A skilled orator, Nasser gave 1,359 speeches between 1953 and 1970, a record for any Egyptian head of state. Historian Elie Podeh wrote that a constant theme of Nasser's image was \\"his ability to represent Egyptian authenticity, in triumph or defeat\\". The national press also helped to foster his popularity and profile‚Äîmore so after the nationalization of state media. Historian Tarek Osman wrote: > The interplay in the Nasser 'phenomenon' between genuine expression of > popular feeling and state-sponsored propaganda may sometimes be hard to > disentangle. But behind it lies a vital historical fact: that Gamal Abdel > Nasser signifies the only truly Egyptian developmental project in the > country's history since the fall of the Pharaonic state.

Nasser waving to crowds in Mansoura, 1960 While Nasser was increasingly criticized by Egyptian intellectuals following the Six-Day War and his death in 1970, the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after Nasser's life. According to political scientist Mahmoud Hamad, writing in 2008, \\"nostalgia for Nasser is easily sensed in Egypt and all Arab countries today\\". General malaise in Egyptian society, particularly during the Mubarak era, augmented nostalgia for Nasser's presidency, which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose, hope, social cohesion, and vibrant culture. Until the present day, Nasser serves as an iconic figure throughout the Arab world, a symbol of Arab unity and dignity, and a towering figure in modern Middle Eastern history. He is also considered a champion of social justice in Egypt. Time writes that despite his mistakes and shortcomings, Nasser \\"imparted a sense of personal worth and national pride that [Egypt and the Arabs] had not known for 400 years. This alone may have been enough to balance his flaws and failures.\\" Historian Steven A. Cook wrote in July 2013, \\"Nasser's heyday still represents, for many, the last time that Egypt felt united under leaders whose espoused principles met the needs of ordinary Egyptians.\\" During the Arab Spring, which resulted in a revolution in Egypt, photographs of Nasser were raised in Cairo and Arab capitals during anti-government demonstrations. According to journalist Lamis Andoni, Nasser had become a \\"symbol of Arab dignity\\" during the mass demonstrations. =Criticism= Anwar Sadat (left) and Nasser in the National Assembly, 1964. Sadat succeeded Nasser as president in 1970 and significantly departed from Nasser's policies throughout his rule. Sadat declared his intention to \\"continue the path of Nasser\\" in his 7 October 1970 presidential inauguration speech, but began to depart from Nasserist policies as his domestic position improved following the 1973 October War. President Sadat's Infitah policy sought to open Egypt's economy for private investment. According to Heikal, ensuing anti-Nasser developments until the present day led to an Egypt \\"[half] at war with Abdel-Nasser, half [at war] with Anwar El-Sadat\\". Nasser's Egyptian detractors considered him a dictator who thwarted democratic progress, imprisoned thousands of dissidents, and led a repressive administration responsible for numerous human rights violations. Islamists in Egypt, particularly members of the politically persecuted Brotherhood, viewed Nasser as oppressive, tyrannical, and demonic. Liberal writer Tawfiq al-Hakim described Nasser as a \\"confused Sultan\\" who employed stirring rhetoric, but had no actual plan to achieve his stated goals. Some of Nasser's liberal and Islamist critics in Egypt, including the founding members of the New Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi, dismissed Nasser's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery. Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation. American political scientist Mark Cooper asserted that Nasser's charisma and his direct relationship with the Egyptian people \\"rendered intermediaries (organizations and individuals) unnecessary\\". He opined that Nasser's legacy was a \\"guarantee of instability\\" due to Nasser's reliance on personal power and the absence of strong political institutions under his rule. Historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan wrote that Nasser was an irrational and irresponsible leader, blaming his inclination to solitary decision-making for Egypt's losses during the Suez War, among other events. Miles Copeland, Jr., a Central Intelligence Agency officer known for his close personal relationship with Nasser, said that the barriers between Nasser and the outside world have grown so thick that all but the information that attest to his infallibility, indispensability, and immortality has been filtered out. Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser's vice president, said that Nasser gradually changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game \\"but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces\\" and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. \\"All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967\\". Nasser told an East German newspaper in 1964 that \\"no person, not even the most simple one, takes seriously the lie of the six million Jews that were murdered [in the Holocaust].\\" However he is not known to have ever again publicly called the figure of six million into question, perhaps because his advisors and East German contacts had advised him on the subject. =Regional leadership= Gaafar Nimeiry of Sudan (left), Nasser, and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya (right) at the Tripoli Airport, 1969. Nimeiry and Gaddafi were influenced by Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas and the latter sought to succeed him as \\"leader of the Arabs\\". Through his actions and speeches, and because he was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser inspired several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries‚Äîan accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens. To varying degrees, Nasser's statist system of government was continued in Egypt and emulated by virtually all Arab republics, namely Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya. Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's first president, was a staunch Nasserist. Abdullah al-Sallal drove out the king of North Yemen in the name of Nasser's pan- Arabism. Other coups influenced by Nasser included those that occurred in Iraq in July 1958 and Syria in 1963. Muammar Gaddafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969, considered Nasser his hero and sought to succeed him as \\"leader of the Arabs\\". Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan. The Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) helped spread Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas throughout the Arab world, particularly among the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese, and in South Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq. While many regional heads of state tried to emulate Nasser, Podeh opined that the \\"parochialism\\" of successive Arab leaders \\"transformed imitation [of Nasser] into parody\\". =Portrayal in film= In 1963, Egyptian director Youssef Chahine produced the film El Nasser Salah El Dine (\\"Saladin The Victorious\\"), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered a hero in the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world. He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the Netflix television series The Crown. Personal life Nasser and his family in Manshiyat al-Bakri, 1963. From left to right, his daughter Mona, his wife Tahia Kazem, daughter Hoda, son Abdel Hakim, son Khaled, son Abdel Hamid, and Nasser. In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old daughter of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom died when she was young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live for the rest of their lives. Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty. Nasser and Tahia would sometimes discuss politics at home, but for the most part, Nasser kept his career separate from his family life. He preferred to spend most of his free time with his children. Nasser and Tahia had two daughters and three sons: Hoda, Mona, Khaled, Abdel Hamid, and Abdel Hakim. Although he was a proponent of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1954 and 1965. He was known to be personally incorruptible, a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt and the Arab world. Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music. Nasser was a chain smoker. He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.

In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for \\"ethnic pluralism\\", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as New York City or Trieste) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous, aboriginal or autochthonous ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus. In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century). In reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as a state's capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely. It has been described as a \\"salad bowl\\" and as a \\"cultural mosaic\\", in contrast to a \\"melting pot\\". Prevalence The concept of multiculturalism was prevalent since ancient times. The Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures. In the political philosophy of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and Christian differences. It is often associated with \\"identity politics\\", \\"the politics of difference\\", and \\"the politics of recognition\\". It is also a matter of economic interests and political power.Multiculturalism ‚Äì Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as African Americans, LGBT, with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, indigenous peoples and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate. Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a melting pot or non-multicultural societies. The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western nation-states, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries. Multiculturalism has been official policy in several Western nations since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country, including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures. A historical example of multiculturalism was the Habsburg monarchy, which had broken up in 1918 and under whose roof many different ethnic, linguistic and religious groups lived together. One of the foundations of this centuries-old state structure was the Habsburg principle of \\"live and let live\\". Today's topical issues such as social and cultural differentiation, multilingualism, competing identity offers or multiple cultural identities have already shaped the scientific theories of many thinkers of this multi-ethnic empire.Doris Griesser \\"Denkanst√∂√üe aus der Multikulti-Monarchie\\" in: Standard, 3 July 2012; Pieter M. Judson \\"The Habsburg Empire. A New History\\" (Harvard 2016); Christopher Clark \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" (New York 2012). The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. The Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism. Canada has provided provisions to the French speaking majority of Quebec, whereby they function as an autonomous community with special rights to govern the members of their community, as well as establish French as one of the official languages. In the Western English-speaking countries, multiculturalism as an official national policy started in Canada in 1971, followed by Australia in 1973 where it is maintained today. It was quickly adopted as official policy by most member-states of the European Union. Recently, right-of-center governments in several European states ‚Äì notably the Netherlands and Denmark ‚Äì have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism.Bissoondath, Neil. 2002.

A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom, among others, due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over \\"home- grown\\" terrorism.Fact or fiction in the great UK immigration debate. workpermit.com. News. 26 April 2005. Retrieved: 21 October 2007. Several heads-of-state or heads-of-government have expressed doubts about the success of multicultural policies: The United Kingdom's ex-Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Australia's ex-prime minister John Howard, Spanish ex-prime minister Jose Maria Aznar and French ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of their multicultural policies for integrating immigrants. Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a descriptive sense. In some, communalism is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or mono-ethnic nation-building ‚Äì for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.The Economist: The changing of the guard, 3 April 2003. =Support= People of Indian origin have been able to achieve a high demographic profile in India Square, Jersey City, New Jersey, US, known as Little Bombay,Kiniry, Laura. \\"Moon Handbooks New Jersey\\", Avalon Travel Publishing, 2006. pg. 34 home to the highest concentration of Asian Indians in the Western Hemisphere and one of at least 24 enclaves characterized as a Little India which have emerged within the New York City Metropolitan Area, with the largest metropolitan Indian population outside Asia, as large-scale immigration from India continues into New York, through the support of the surrounding community. Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues. They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes. Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the \\"human rights revolution\\", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and ethnic cleansing became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the Holocaust; with the collapse of the European colonial system, as colonized nations in Africa and Asia successfully fought for their independence and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, which criticized ideals of assimilation that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic ethnic studies programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.Susanne Wessendorf, The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices, p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.Paul C. Gorski, \\"A Brief History of Multicultural Education\\", EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011. As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the liberalism that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the Age of Enlightenment. The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility. Will Kymlicka argues for \\"group differentiated rights\\", that help both religious and cultural minorities operate within the larger state as a whole, without impinging on the rights of the larger society. He bases this on his opinion that human rights fall short in protecting the rights of minorities, as the state has no stake in protecting the minorities. C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it \\"uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten. By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a postmodern era that fragments human life and thought.\\" Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism \\"is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less\\", since it is \\"the form of integration\\" that (1) best fits the ideal of egalitarianism, (2) has \\"the best chance of succeeding\\" in the \\"post-9/11, post 7/7\\" world, and (3) has remained \\"moderate [and] pragmatic\\". Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities \\"demanding special rights\\" and to see these as promoting a \\"thinly veiled racis[m]\\". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact \\"not about minorities\\" but \\"is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities\\", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., \\"the principles of justice\\" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come \\"through an open and equal dialogue between them.\\" Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as \\"differentialist racism\\", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived \\"incompatibility of life-styles and traditions\\". While there is research that suggests that ethnic diversity increases chances of war, lower public goods provision and decreases democratization, there is also research that shows that ethnic diversity in itself is not detrimental to peace, public goods provision or democracy. Rather, it was found that promoting diversity actually helps in advancing disadvantaged students. A 2018 study in the American Political Science Review cast doubts on findings that ethnoracial homogeneity led to greater public goods provision. A 2015 study in the American Journal of Sociology challenged past research showing that racial diversity adversely affected trust. =Criticism= Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable. It is argued that nation states, who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture. Sarah Song views cultures as historically shaped entities by its members, and that they lack boundaries due to globalization, thereby making them stronger than what others may assume. She goes on to argue against the notion of special rights as she feels cultures are mutually constructive, and are shaped by the dominant culture. Brian Barry advocates a difference- blind approach to culture in the political realm and he rejects group-based rights as antithetical to the universalist liberal project, which he views as based on the individual.Brian Barry, Culture and Equality (Polity Press, 2001), p. 148. Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities \\"don‚Äôt trust the local mayor, they don‚Äôt trust the local paper, they don‚Äôt trust other people and they don‚Äôt trust institutions,\\" writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that, \\"[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it‚Äôs not just that we don‚Äôt trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don‚Äôt trust people who do not look like us\\". Putnam has also stated, however, that \\"this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better.\\"Martin, Michel, \\"Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?\\" Tell Me More, NPR. Written 15 August 2007, accessed 15 September 2017. Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been \\"twisted\\" to make a case against race-conscious admissions to universities. He asserted that his \\"extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.\\" Ethnologist Frank Salter writes: > Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a > higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic > homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product > as well as the average wealth of citizens.

Dick Lamm, former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of Colorado, argued that \\"diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other‚Äîthat is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent.\\" The American classicist Victor Davis Hanson used the perceived differences in \\"rationality\\" between Moctezuma and Cort√©s to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.Hanson, Victor Davis Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power, New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205 In New Zealand (Aotearoa), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the MƒÅori, and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine MƒÅori demands for self-determination and encourage assimilation. Far-right sympathisers have been shown to increasingly take part in a multitude of online discursive efforts directed against global brands‚Äô multicultural advertisements.  Americas  =Argentina= Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity in Buenos Aires. Though not called Multiculturalism as such, the preamble of Argentina's constitution explicitly promotes immigration, and recognizes the individual's multiple citizenship from other countries. Though 97% of Argentina's population self-identify as of European descent to this day a high level of multiculturalism remains a feature of Argentina's culture, allowing foreign festivals and holidays (e.g. Saint Patrick's Day), supporting all kinds of art or cultural expression from ethnic groups, as well as their diffusion through an important multicultural presence in the media; for instance it is not uncommon to find newspapers*Buenos Aires Herald, Argentine-English language newspaper or radio programs in English, German, Italian, French or Portuguese in Argentina. = Bolivia = Bolivia is a diverse country made up of 36 different types of indigenous groups. Over 62% of Bolivia's population falls into these different indigenous groups, making it the most indigenous country in Latin America. Out of the indigenous groups the Aymara and the Quechua are the largest. The latter 30% of the population is a part of the mestizo, which are a people mixed with European and indigenous ancestry. Bolivia's political administrations have endorsed multicultural politics and in 2009 Bolivia's Constitution was inscribed with multicultural principles. The Constitution of Bolivia recognizes 36 official languages besides Spanish, each language has its own culture and indigenous group. Bolivian culture is celebrated across the country and has heavy influences from the Aymara, the Quechua, the Spanish, and other popular cultures from around Latin America. = Brazil = House with elements of people from different countries, including Russians and Germans, in Carambe√≠, south of the country, a city of Dutch majority The Americas have been known to be some of the most multicultural geographical locations, as many of the times there is a diversity of language, religion, and ethnicities present. The South American country Brazil can also acclaim multiculturalism, and has undergone many changes in the past few decades. Brazil is a controversial country when is comes to defining a multicultural country. There are two views: the Harvard Institute of Economic Research states that Brazil has an intersection of many cultures because of recent migration, while the Pew Research Center state that Brazil is culturally diverse but the majority of the country speaks Portuguese. With cities such as S√£o Paulo, who are seen to be home to many migrants from Japan, Italy, Lebanon and Portugal. There is a multicultural presence within in this city, and this is prevalent throughout Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil is a country who has made great strides to embrace migrant cultures, and with its increase of African descent people they have made changes to become more aware and welcoming. There has been an increase of awareness of anti-blackness and they are actively finding ways to combat racism in Brazil. =Canada= Sikhs celebrating the Sikh new year in Toronto, Canada Canadian society is often depicted as being \\"very progressive, diverse, and multicultural\\". Multiculturalism (a Just Society) was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government during the premiership of Pierre Elliott Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. Multiculturalism is reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. Canadian multiculturalism is looked upon with admiration outside the country, resulting in the Canadian public dismissing most critics of the concept. Multiculturalism in Canada is often looked at as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In a 2002 interview with The Globe and Mail, Karƒ´m al-Hussainƒ´, the 49th Aga Khan of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as \\"the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe\\", citing it as \\"a model for the world\\". He explained that the experience of Canadian governance‚Äîits commitment to pluralism and its support for the rich multicultural diversity of its people‚Äîis something that must be shared and would be of benefit to all societies in other parts of the world. The Economist ran a cover story in 2016 praising Canada as the most successful multicultural society in the West. The Economist argued that Canada's multiculturalism was a source of strength that united the diverse population and by attracting immigrants from around the world was also an engine of economic growth as well. Many public and private groups in Canada work to support both multiculturalism and recent immigrants to Canada. In an effort to support recent Filipino immigrants to Alberta, for example, one school board partnered with a local university and an immigration agency to support these new families in their school and community. =Mexico= Mexico City Mexico has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of Hern√°n Cort√©s to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the Aztec Empire and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous religion, politics, culture and ethnicity. The Spanish opened schools in which they taught Christianity, and the Spanish language which it eventually surpassed the indigenous dialects and languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish. In today's world \\"Mestizo\\" has become an umbrella term to those that are non-indigenous, which would include Asian Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans. Mexico City has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside Montreal, on the index). Mexico is an ethnically diverse country with a population composed of approximately 123 million in 2017. There is a wide variety of ethnic groups, the major group being Mestizos followed by Indigenous Mexicans. There are many other ethnic groups such as Arab Mexicans, Afro-Mexicans, Asian Mexicans and White Mexicans. From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching an amount of 961,121 people. Mostly coming from Guatemala and the United States. Mexico is quickly becoming a melting pot, with many immigrants coming into the country. It is considered to be a cradle of civilization, which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the mestizaje of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants. = Peru = Peru is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the INEI reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community. Tambomachay, Cuzco, Peru Peru is the home to Amerindians but after the Spanish Conquest, the Spanish brought African, and Asian people as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 45% of the population, mestizos 37%, white 15% and 3% is composed by Black, Chinese, and others. In 1821, Peru's president Jose de San Martin gave foreigners the freedom to start industries in Peru's ground, 2 years after, foreigners that lived in Peru for more than 5 years were considered naturalized citizens, which then decreased to 3 years. =United States= In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level, but ethnic diversity is common in rural, suburban and urban areas.Jeffrey Lehman, ed. Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America (3rd edition; 6 vol. 2014) Online Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century. The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's national myth. The idea of the melting pot is a metaphor that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.Zangwill, Israel. The Melting Pot, 1908. The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different than multiculturalism as it is defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration. The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the American founding fathers: > Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united > people ‚Äì a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same > language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of > government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and > this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it > was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient > for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should > never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien > sovereignties.John Jay, First American Supreme Court Chief Justice, > Federalist Paper No. 2 Staff of President Clinton's One America Initiative. The President's Initiative on Race was a critical element in President Clinton's effort to prepare the country to embrace diversity. As a philosophy, multiculturalism began as part of the pragmatism movement at the end of the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States, then as political and cultural pluralism at the turn of the twentieth. It was partly in response to a new wave of European imperialism in sub-Saharan Africa and the massive immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans to the United States and Latin America. Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, George Santayana, Horace Kallen, John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In Pluralistic Universe (1909), William James espoused the idea of a \\"plural society.\\" James saw pluralism as \\"crucial to the formation of philosophical and social humanism to help build a better, more egalitarian society. The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier ‚Äì often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.Jesse Kirkpatrick. (2011). Miami Beach: Diversity at Work. Miami Beach News. Retrieved from communitynewspapers.com Studies estimated 46 million Americans ages 14 to 24 to be the most diverse generation in American society. In 2009 and 2010, controversy erupted in Texas as the state's curriculum committee made several changes to the state's requirements, often at the expense of minorities.

McKinley Jr., 12 March 2010.  Effect of diversity on civic engagement  In a 2007 study by Robert Putnam encompassing 30,000 people across the US found that diversity had a negative effect on civic engagement. The greater the diversity, the fewer people voted, the less they volunteered for community projects and trust among neighbours was only half that of homogenous communities. Putnam says, however, that \\"in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits\\", as long as society successfully overcomes the short-term problems. Putnam adds that his \\"extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.\\"Bartizan in Venezuela = Venezuela = Venezuela is the home to a variety of ethnic groups, with an estimated population of 32 million. Their population is composed of approximately 68% Mestizo, which means of mixed race. Venezuelan culture is mainly composed by the mixture of their indigenous people, Spanish and African. There was a heavy influence of Spaniard culture due to the Spanish Conquest, which influence their religion, language, traditions. African influence can be seen on their music, with the drum usage. While Spanish is Venezuela's main language, there is more than 40 indigenous languages spoken til this day. Europe Ethno- linguistic map of Austria‚ÄìHungary, 1910. Ethno-linguistic map of the Second Polish Republic, 1937. The European Union is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an aging population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe. Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age. In the nineteenth century, the ideology of nationalism transformed the way Europeans thought about the state. Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new nation-states were founded on the principle that each nation is entitled to its own sovereignty and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally homogeneous society, although some national movements recognised regional differences. Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state. The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies ‚Äì the most important was compulsory primary education in the national language. The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of cultural assimilation and even ethnic cleansing. Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for \\"social cohesion\\", \\"integration\\", and (sometimes) \\"assimilation\\". The policies include: * Compulsory courses and/or tests on national history, on the constitution and the legal system (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named Life in the United Kingdom test) * Introduction of an official national history, such as the national canon defined for the Netherlands by the van Oostrom Commission, and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about national heroes) * Tests designed to elicit \\"unacceptable\\" values. In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a homosexual (the desired answer is that they would accept itBBC report at News.BBC.co.uk, full list of questions in German at TAZ.de). Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation. The concept of \\"Cultural exception\\" proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures. =Bulgaria= Sofia Synagogue Banya Bashi Mosque in Sofia Since its establishment in the seventh century, Bulgaria has hosted many religions, ethnic groups and nations. The capital city Sofia is the only European city that has peacefully functioning, within walking distance of 300 metres, four Places of worship of the major religions: Eastern Orthodox (St Nedelya Church), Islam (Banya Bashi Mosque), Roman Catholicism (St. Joseph Cathedral), and Orthodox Judaism (Sofia Synagogue, the third-largest synagogue in Europe). This unique arrangement has been called by historians a \\"multicultural cliche\\".Detrez, Raymond; Segaert, Barbara, 2008, Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans (Multiple Europes), P.I.E. Peter Lang s.a., , p. 55 It has also become known as \\"The Square of Religious Tolerance\\"Ban, Ki-moon, The World in the next 20 years and has initiated the construction of a 100-square-metre scale model of the site that is to become a symbol of the capital. Furthermore, unlike some other Nazi Germany allies or German-occupied countries excluding Denmark, Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. According to Dr Marinova- Christidi, the main reason for the efforts of Bulgarian people to save their Jewish population during WWII is that within the region, they \\"co-existed for centuries with other religions\\" ‚Äì giving it a unique multicultural and multiethnic history. Consequently, within the Balkan region, Bulgaria has become an example for multiculturalism in terms of variety of religions, artistic creativityThe Highs and Lows of Ethno-Cultural Diversity: Young People‚Äôs Experiences of Chalga Culture in Bulgaria, Apostolov, Apostol, Anthropology of East Europe Review, Vol 26, No 1 (2008), Cambridge University Press and ethnicity.Ruegg, Francois, 2007, Interculturalism and Discrimination in Romania: Policies, Practices, Identities and Representations, Lit Verlag, Hristova, Svetlana, 2004, Bulgarian Politics of Multiculturalism - uses and abuses, Scientific Research, University Publishing House, South-West University, Blagoevgrad Its largest ethnic minority groups, Turks and Roma, enjoy wide political representation.

On 4 January 1990, the activists of the movement registered an organisation with the legal name Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) (in Bulgarian: –î–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –∏ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏: in Turkish: Hak ve √ñzg√ºrl√ºkler Hareketi) in the Bulgarian city of Varna. At the moment of registration, it had 33 members, at present, according to the organisation's website, 68,000 members plus 24,000 in the organisation's youth wing . In 2012, Bulgarian Turks were represented at every level of government: local, with MRF having mayors in 35 municipalities, at parliamentary level with MRF having 38 deputies (14% of the votes in Parliamentary elections for 2009‚Äì13) and at executive level, where there is one Turkish minister, Vezhdi Rashidov. 21 Roma political organisations were founded between 1997-2003 in Bulgaria. =Germany= In October 2010, Angela Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam, near Berlin, that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had \\"utterly failed\\", stating: \\"The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work\\". She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society.\\"Rauf Ceylan: Muslims in Germany: Religious and Political Challenges and Perspectives in the Diaspora, In 2015, Merkel again criticized multiculturalism on the grounds that it leads to parallel societies. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Germany is the first Muslim group to have been granted \\"corporation under public law status\\", putting the community on par with the major Christian churches and Jewish communities of Germany. = Luxembourg = Luxembourg has one of the highest foreign-born populations in Europe, foreigners account for nearly half of the country's total population.Sarah Krouse, \\"Piping Hot Gromperekichelcher, Only if You Pass the Sproochentest.\\" WALL STREET JOURNAL, 19 Jan 2018, p.1 The majority of foreigners are from: Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal.\\"La progression de la population du Grand-Duch√© continue: 537 039 r√©sidants au 1er janvier 2013.\\" Statnews 16/2013, op statec.lu, 18 April 2013. (in French). In total, 170 different nationalities make up the population of Luxembourg, out of this; 86% are of European descent. The official languages of Luxembourg are German, French, and Luxembourgish all of which are supported in the Luxembourg government and education system. In 2005, Luxembourg officially promoted and implemented the objectives of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. This Convention affirms multicultural policies in Luxembourg and creates political awareness of cultural diversity. =Netherlands= S√ºleyman√¨ye Mosque in Tilburg built in 2001 Multiculturalism in the Netherlands began with major increases in immigration to the Netherlands during the mid-1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early-1980s. Different groups could themselves determine religious and cultural matters, while state authorities would handle matters of housing and work policy. In the 1990s, the public debate were generally optimistic on immigration and the prevailing view was that a multicultural policy would reduce the social economic disparities over time. This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s. Following the September 11 attacks in the United States and the murders of Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) and Theo van Gogh (in 2004) there was increased political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands. Lord Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, made a distinction between tolerance and multiculturalism, citing the Netherlands as a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society. In June 2011, the First Rutte cabinet said the Netherlands would turn away from multiculturalism: \\"Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant\\" Minister Donner said. =Romania= Since Antiquity, Romania has hosted many religious and ethnic groups, including Roma people, Hungarians, Germans, Turks, Greeks, Tatars, Slovaks, Serbs, Jews and others. Unfortunately, during the WW2 and the Communism, most of these ethnic groups choose to emigrate to other countries. However, since 1990s, Romania has expected a growing number of immigrants and refugees, most of them from the Arab World, Asia or Africa. Immigration is expected to increase in the future, as large numbers of Romanian workers leave the country and are being replaced by foreigners. = Scandinavia = The population structure of the Vuosaari district in Helsinki, Finland, is strongly based on multiculturalism.Vuosaari - Uutta Helsinki√§ (in Finnish)Vuosaari ‚Äì Uutta Helsinki√§ (in Finnish)Asukkaat ja kuvasarja kertoo, millainen on Vuosaari ‚Äì Professori: \\"Vuosaari on maahanmuuton tienraivaaja\\" (in Finnish) Multiculturalism in Scandinavia has centered on discussions about marriage, dress, religious schools, Muslim funeral rites and gender equality. Forced marriages have been widely debated in Denmark, Sweden and Norway but the countries differ in policy and responses by authorities. Despite differing approaches by the three countries with Sweden being the most permissive and Denmark the most restrictive.  Denmark  In 2001, Denmark received a liberal-conservative government which was supported by the Danish People's Party which instituted a policy less pluralistic and more geared towards assimilation. A 2018 study found that increases in local ethnic diversity in Denmark caused \\"rightward shifts in election outcomes by shifting electoral support away from traditional ‚Äúbig government‚Äù left‚Äêwing parties and towards anti‚Äêimmigrant nationalist parties.\\" For decades, Danish immigration and integration policy was built upon the assumption that with the right kind of help, immigrants and their descendants will eventually tend to the same levels of education and employments as Danes. This assumption was disproved by a 2019 report by the Danish Immigration Service and the Ministry of Education. The report found that while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school. Thereby the process of integration has to start from the beginning for each generation.  Norway  Multiculturalism was the subject of public debate in the 1990s when the children of the first generation of immigrants became adults and cultural practices such as honor culture and forced marriages became more visible. The debates during the period, were less marked by cultural sensitivity compared to 2017.  Sweden  Source: G√§vle University College Sweden has from the early 1970s experienced a greater share of non-Western immigration than the other Scandinavian countries, which consequently have placed multiculturalism on the political agenda for a longer period of time. Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the social democratic government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the Sweden Democrats, multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden. A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity. A 2014 study published by G√§vle University College showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans. The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with Christianity as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries. A 2017 study by Lund University also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration. The erosive effect on trust was more pronounced for immigration from culturally distant countries. =Serbia= Cs√°rd√°s traditional Hungarian folk dance in Doroslovo In Serbia, there are 19 officially recognised ethnic groups with a status of national minorities.Gojkovic N. System of minorities‚Äô protection in Serbia Konrad Adenauer Foundation Vojvodina is an autonomous province of Serbia, located in the northern part of the country. It has a multiethnic and multicultural identity; there are more than 26 ethnic groups in the province, which has six official languages. Largest ethnic groups in Vojvodina are Serbs (67%), Hungarians (13%), Slovaks, Croats, Romani, Romanians, Montenegrins, Bunjevci, Bosniaks, Rusyns. Radio Television of Vojvodina broadcasts program in ten local languages. The project by the Government of AP Vojvodina titled \\"Promotion of Multiculturalism and Tolerance in Vojvodina\\", whose primary goal is to foster the cultural diversity and develop the atmosphere of interethnic tolerance among the citizens of Vojvodina, has been successfully implemented since 2005. Serbia is continually working on improving its relationship and inclusion of minorities in its effort to gain full accession to the European Union. Serbia has initiated talks through Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 7 November 2007. =United Kingdom= Multicultural policies were adopted by local administrations from the 1970s and 1980s onwards. In 1997, the newly elected Labour government committed to a multiculturalist approach at a national level, but after 2001, there was something of a backlash, led by centre-left commentators such as David Goodhart and Trevor Phillips. The Government then embraced a policy of community cohesion instead. In 2011, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that \\"state multiculturalism has failed\\". Critics argue that analyses which view society as ‚Äòtoo diverse‚Äô for social democracy and cohesion have performative effects that legitimate racism towards those classed as immigrants. Asia =India= The Durga Puja celebrated in Kolkata Jama Masjid, Delhi, one of the largest mosques in India According to the 1961 Census of India, there are 1652 indigenous languages in the country. The culture of India has been shaped by its long history, unique geography and diverse demography. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture and customs differ from place to place within the country, but nevertheless possess a commonality. The culture of India is an amalgamation of these diverse sub-cultures spread all over the Indian subcontinent and traditions that are several millennia old. The previously prevalent Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed jƒÅtis or castes.\\"India ‚Äì Caste\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Religiously, Hindus form the majority, followed by Muslims. The statistics are: Hindu (79.8%), Muslim (14.2%), Christian (2.3%), Sikh (1.7%), Buddhist (0.7%), Jain (0.4%), Unaffiliated (0.23%), Bah√° º√≠s, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others (0.65%). Linguistically, the two main language families in India are Indo-Aryan (a branch of Indo-European) and Dravidian. In India's northeast, people speaking Sino-Tibetan group of languages such as Meitei (Meitei-lon) recognized by the Indian constitution and Austroasiatic languages are commonly found. India (officially) follows a three-language policy. Hindi (spoken in the form of Hindustani) is the official federal language, English has the federal status of associate/subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language (in the Hindi sprachraum, this reduces to bilingualism). Further, India does not have any national language. The Republic of India's state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups; this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno-linguistic sub- cultures, except for the Hindi sprachraum which is itself divided into many states. Thus, most states differ from one another in language, culture, cuisine, clothing, literary style, architecture, music and festivities. India has encountered religiously motivated violence, such as the Moplah Riots, the Bombay riots, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the 1990 Kashmiri Pandit genocide, the 2002 Gujarat riots, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the 2012 Assam violence, and the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. This has resulted from traditionally disadvantaged communities in public employment such as the policing of the same locality, apprehension of owners in giving properties for sale or rent and of society in accepting inter-marriages.  Cultural Minorities in India  The Indian constitution requires the various state-run institutions to provide quotas for minorities, which give these cultural minorities equal opportunities, as well as a forum through which they can actively participate in the institutions of the dominant culture. Indian polity after the 1990s has been marked by a shift from secular principles to a landscape that is dominated by pro-Hindu propaganda; the BJP has used this rhetoric by reconstructing Hinduism and bartering it under the guise of Indian nationalism. However, the rise of pro- Hindu ideology, commonly known as Hindutva, has impinged on the rights of cultural minorities. This can be seen in the large scale violence against cultural minorities, the vote-bank politics used by the Indian National Congress, and the promotion of issues faced by the larger religious communities over those faced by the backward groups in religious minorities.  Scheduled Castes(SC) and Scheduled Tribes(ST)  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are constitutionally recognized terms in India and constitute approximately 25% of the Indian population. These groups have been provided with reservations that constitutionally guarantee them representation in governmental institutions, a mandate suggested by the Mandal Commission. The Indian constitution also provides SC's and ST's with protective measures that ensure equality, which is the main issue faced by members of both communities. However, while scheduled castes have turned into important political communities that the state concerns itself about, scheduled tribes continue to be politically marginalized. =Indonesia= Pluralism, diversity and multiculturalism is a daily fact of life in Indonesia. There are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia.Kuoni ‚Äì Far East, A world of difference. p. 88. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel & JPM Publications 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry. The Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia who make up nearly 42% of the total population. The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country. There are also more than 700 living languages spoken in Indonesia and although predominantly Muslim the country also has large Christian and Hindu populations. Indonesia's national motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (\\"Unity in Diversity\\" lit. \\"many, yet one\\") enshrined in Pancasila the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country. The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach. Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of Javanization, although Minangkabau, Malay, Madurese, Bugis and Makassar people, as a result of their merantau (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while Chinese Indonesians can be found in most urban areas. Because of urbanization, major Indonesian cities such as Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Palembang, Medan and Makassar have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented. However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the fall of Suharto in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native Dayak tribes against Madurese transmigrants in Kalimantan during Sambas riots in 1999 and the Sampit conflict in 2001. There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as violence erupted in Poso between 1998 and into 2000, and violences in Maluku between 1999 and into 2002. Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people. Chinese Indonesians are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered discrimination. The Suharto Orde Baru or New Order adopted a forced assimilation policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable. Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt Indonesian-sounding names, and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during riots in 1998. As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, Abdurrahman Wahid came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President Megawati Sukarnoputri declared that the Chinese New Year (') would be marked as a national holiday from 2003. Today, Chinese Indonesians enjoy the same rights as other Indonesians. =Japan= Ainu man, circa 1930 Japanese society, with its ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuan people. In 2005, former Japanese Prime Minister and current Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso described Japan as a \\"one civilization, one language, one culture and one race\\" nation. However, there are \\"International Society\\" NPOs funded by local governments throughout Japan. According to Harvard University professor Theodore Bestor, Japan does look very homogeneous from a distant perspective, but in fact there are a number of very significant minority groups ‚Äì ethnically different minority groups ‚Äì in Japan today, such as the already mentioned Ainu and Ryukyuan people. =Kazakhstan= Kazakhstan is among the most multicultural countries in Eurasia, with sizeable populations of ethnic Kazakhs, Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Uighurs, Tatars, Germans and more. Kazakhstan is one of a few countries in post-Soviet territories that managed to avoid interethnic clashes and conflicts in the period of USSR‚Äôs final crisis and its eventual breakup. In 1995, Kazakhstan created the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan, an advisory body designed to represent the country's ethnic minorities. = Malaysia = Malaysia is a multiethnic country, with Malays making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are Malaysians of Chinese descent. Malaysians of Indian descent comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises: * Native East Malaysians, namely Bajau, Bruneian, Bidayuh, Dusun, Iban, Kadazan, Kedayan, Melanau, Orang Ulu, Sarawakian Malays, etc. * Other native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia, such as the Orang Asli and Siamese people, and * Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the Chettiars, the Peranakan and the Portuguese. The Malaysian New Economic Policy or NEP serves as a form of racial equalization.Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks, BBC News It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the 13 May racial riots of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority Chinese population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country. The Malay Peninsula has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly Malays before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then British Malaya such as Penang, Malacca and Singapore became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities ‚Äì the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of institutionalized discrimination. Preceding independence of the Federation of Malaya, a social contract was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the 1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the Bumiputra policy. These pluralist policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial status of religious freedom in Malaysia. =Singapore= Because of immigration, Singapore has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of Malays and Indians (predominantly Tamils). Other prominent smaller groups include Peranakans, Eurasians and Europeans. Besides English, Singapore recognizes three other languages‚ÄîMalay, Mandarin Chinese and Tamil. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages (\\"mother tongues\\"). Besides being a multilingual country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities. During British colonial rule, ethnic enclaves such as Geylang, Chinatown, and Little India were enforced. Presently (2010), remnants of colonial ethnic concentration still exist but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.(n.d.) In Housing Development Boards of Singapore website. Retrieved: 18 November 2010 from Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home. A similar policy exists in politics as all Group Representation Constituencies are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority. =South Korea= South Korea remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.\\"Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin \\". The Korea Herald. 2 August 2006. Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.\\"The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea\\" (1999), Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies) However, the word \\"multiculturalism\\" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Kangwon National University, published an article entitled \\"Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?\\", noting: \\"As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement.\\" He argued, however, that \\"the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea\\" lacked \\"the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society\\".Han Geon-Soo, \\"Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?\\", Korea Journal, Vol. 47 No. 4, Winter 2007, pp. 32‚Äì63 The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued: :\\"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago ‚Äì perhaps unconsciously ‚Äì when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?\\"Stephen Castles, \\"Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?\\", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute The Korea Times suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.\\"Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea\\", Lee Hyo- sik, Korea Times, 24 December 2009 In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the JoongAng Ilbo stated: \\"Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures.\\" He further opined: :\\"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea‚Äôs greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves.\\" In 2010, results from the Korean Identity Survey suggested that government programs promoting multicultralism had seen some success with over 60% of Koreans supporting the idea a multicultural society. However, the same poll in 2015 showed that support of a multicultural society had dropped to 49.7% suggesting a possible return to ethnic exclusivism. = Turkey = Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia ‚Äì thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persian descent. This cultural influence mainly stems from the Iranian culture, which spread through multiple ways but mainly during the early modern period where Iranian and Ottoman contact flourished and the influence of the Kurds, an Iranian ethnic group, on Turkish culture. However, it also entails influence from Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim influence. In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent Ottoman Empire. However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe.  Africa  =Mauritius= Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of Mauritius. This is mainly because of colonization that has been present from, the English, the French, and the Dutch. However, the Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and Indo-Mauritians, Mauritian Creoles (of African and Malagasy descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic Sino-Mauritians and Franco-Mauritians (descendants of the original French colonists). Mauritius has embraced intertwining of cultures from the origin of the country, and has coined the term fruit-salad, which is a much more appealing term in comparison to melting-pot showing that they were not forced to these cultures. = South Africa = South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa. South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages. The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa's cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised, it is still known for its diverse culture. =Cameroon= Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, Cameroon is found in central Africa consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, most people commonly label Cameroon as ‚ÄúAfrica in Miniature‚Äù. Americas  Demographics and Official Languages  Before Cameroon‚Äôs independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916-1961. Upon gaining sovereignty, a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents. Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and Pidgin known as Frananglais gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.  Indigenous Languages  Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 indigenous languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well. Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from Bantu, Sudanic, Baka, Wodaabe (or Mbororo) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as Pygmies.  Indigenous Peoples' Rights  Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from exploiting or violating them. In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in \\"local, regional, and national levels\\" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.  Oceania  =Australia= The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the Special Broadcasting Service. The Australian Government retains multiculturalism in policy and as a defining aspect of Australia today. Sydney's Chinatown The White Australia Policy was dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy, although the official policy of multiculturalism was not formally introduced until 1972. The election of John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition government in 1996 was a major watershed for Australian multiculturalism. Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism, releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s. A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services, first published in 1999, was a publication of the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public. The first edition covered Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh faiths, with participation of representatives of the various religions. The second edition, published in 2002, added Christian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander religions and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to the list of religions. Contact between people of different cultures in Australia has been characterised by tolerance and engagement, but have also occasionally resulted in conflict and rifts. Australia's diverse migrant communities have brought with them food, lifestyle and cultural practices, many of which have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture. Members of a multicultural community who are not of Anglo-Australian background or not \\"assimilated\\" are often referred to in policy discourse as culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD), introduced in 1996 to replace non-English speaking background (NESB). = New Zealand = New Zealand is a sovereign Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's White Australia Policy, and The United States Immigration Act of 1924,Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI) (2000). Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. pp. 276‚Äì278. but it would later follow suit with Australia and Canada in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s.Phillips, Jock (11 August 2015). \\"History of immigration\\". Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Retrieved 2 June 2017. This led to an increase of Asian and Pacific islander peoples on the island, and ultimately a more diverse European population. In 1985 the Law Commission Act was passed which required the New Zealand Law Commission to review laws while taking into account both the indigenous MƒÅori of New Zealand and New Zealand's multicultural character. In 2001 the New Zealand government opened an Office of Ethnic Affairs to advise its local governments on the advancement of ethnic diversity and affairs of its multicultural communities. In 1987 New Zealand officially recognized the indigenous MƒÅori language as a national language.\\"Waitangi Tribunal claim ‚Äì MƒÅori Language Week\\". Ministry for Culture and Heritage. July 2010. Retrieved 19 January 2011. The revitalization in the MƒÅori language led to its immersion in schools and television broadcast. Many landmarks on the island have both their MƒÅori and English names officially recognized. MƒÅori makes up 3.7% of the population's speaking language. A 2013 census of New Zealand's population showed that 74% of the population identifies ethnically as European, while the latter 15% majority identify as MƒÅori. The remainder identify as Asian, Arab, African, Pacific Islander and Latin American. = Papua New Guinea = Papua New Guinea is one of the most multicultural countries in the world. This Oceanian country is home to over eight million people that are divided into hundreds of different indigenous ethnic groups and cultures with over 820 different indigenous languages. A majority of the indigenous groups are Papuans who have ancestors that lived in New Guinea over ten thousand years ago. The latter majority are Austronesians whose ancestors arrived less than four thousand years ago. The island's population is also made up of many expatriate citizens from China, Australia, Indonesia, Europe and the Philippines. In 1975 the island population was found to be made up of 40,000 of these diverse expatriate citizens. Despite the large amount of culturally diverse locations on the island, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site is the only UNESCO World heritage location.

It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. Harrison Ford returned in the title role, while his father is portrayed by Sean Connery. Other cast members featured include Alison Doody, Denholm Elliott, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, and John Rhys-Davies. In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a Holy Grail scholar, who has been kidnapped by Nazis. After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. Filming locations included Spain, Italy, West Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The film was released by Paramount Pictures in North America on May 24, 1989 to mostly positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $474.3 million at the worldwide box office. It won an Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing. A sequel, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, followed in 2008. Plot In 1912, 13-year-old Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr is horseback riding with his Boy Scout troop at Arches National Park in Utah. While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden crucifix belonging to Coronado and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing circus train, leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a bullwhip and a new phobia of snakes. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a Panama Hat. Impressed with Indy's bravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indy his fedora to encourage him to not give up. In 1938, Indy battles \\"Panama Hat\\" and his henchmen on a ship off the storm-blasted coast of Portugal, and escaping overboard just before the ship explodes, he recovers the cross and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is introduced to Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father, Henry Jones, Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide. Indy receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice, Italy, and heads there with Marcus, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a First Crusade knight that contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the petroleum-saturated waters of the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, who tells Indy where Henry is being held after Indy explains that his only goal is to find his father, not the Grail. Looking through the diary, Marcus finds a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to ƒ∞skenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah. Elsa begins a sexual relationship with Indy before they depart to find Henry. Indy and Elsa head to a Nazi- controlled castle in Austria where Henry is being held. Indy finds Henry and frees him only to be quickly captured by SS Colonel Ernst Vogel. He learns that both Elsa and Donovan are actually working with the Nazis and are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Elsa kisses Indy goodbye as she departs with Donovan and Vogel. Marcus is captured in Hatay while meeting with Sallah. After their escape from the castle, Henry tells Indy that the Grail is guarded by three booby traps and his diary contains the clues needed to pass them safely. Disguised as an SS officer, Indy recovers the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin and comes face to face with Adolf Hitler, who autographs the book without recognizing it or him. Indy and Henry board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but are forced to escape in its parasite biplane once the Nazis discover them aboard. A dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters ensues; although Indy and Henry are forced to crash-land, they survive and successfully bring down their pursuers. The two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus's abduction. The Nazis have been equipped by the Sultan of Hatay and are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by Vogel while attempting to rescue Marcus from a tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, but escapes just before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death. Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to get past the first of three protective traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save his father. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps (which include fast-moving saw blades, a word puzzle, and a hidden bridge over a bottomless pit) and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail grants eternal life, while a false one will kill the drinker. Elsa intentionally selects a wrong cup for Donovan, causing him to rapidly age into dust after drinking from it. Indy drinks from a simple clay cup that proves to be the true Grail, but the knight warns that it cannot be taken out of the temple and that its guardian must stay within in order to remain immortal. Indy fills the Grail with holy water and brings it to Henry, healing him instantly. Elsa disregards the knight's warning and tries to take the Grail with her, causing the temple to collapse around them when she crosses the Great Seal set in the floor at the entrance. When the Grail falls into a chasm in the floor, Elsa plummets to her death trying to recover it, due to her being unable to let go of her obsession with it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry convinces him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple as the Grail Knight watches them leave, outside the temple Henry reveals to Indy that Elsa never really believed in the grail and they ride off into the sunset. Cast * Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones: The archaeologist adventurer and Elsa's love interest, who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \\"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?\\"  River Phoenix as a younger Indiana Jones. Phoenix had portrayed the son of Ford's character in The Mosquito Coast (1986). Ford recommended Phoenix for the part; he said that of the young actors working at the time, Phoenix looked the most like him when he was around that age. * Sean Connery as Henry Jones, Sr.: Indiana's father, a professor of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery in mind when he suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as \\"a crazy, eccentric\\" professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is \\"strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son\\". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, \\"Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond films.\\"McBride, \\"An Awfully Big Adventure\\", p. 379 ‚Äì 413 Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery‚Äîa student of history‚Äîbegan to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. \\"I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [Francis] Burton,\\" Connery commented. \\"I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father.\\" Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that \\"whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better\\". Connery signed to the film on March 25, 1988. He improvised the line, \\"She talks in her sleep\\", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later. Alex Hyde-White plays Henry in the film's prologue, though his face is never shown and his lines were dubbed by Connery. * Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody: Indiana's bumbling English colleague. Elliott returned after Spielberg sought to recapture the tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), following the actor's absence in the darker Temple of Doom (1984). * Alison Doody as Elsa Schneider: An Austrian art professor who is in league with the Nazis. She seduces the Joneses to trick them but seems to be in love with Indy. While the character of Elsa is in her 30s during the film, Doody was 21 when she auditioned and was one of the first actresses who met for the part. * John Rhys-Davies as Sallah: A friend of Indiana and a professional excavator living in Cairo. Like Elliott's, Rhys-Davies' return was an attempt to recapture the spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark. * Julian Glover as Walter Donovan: An American businessman who sends the Joneses on their quest for the Holy Grail out of a desire for immortality while secretly working with the Nazis for the same goal. Glover previously appeared as General Veers in Lucas' The Empire Strikes Back. He originally auditioned for the role of Vogel. Glover, who is English, adopted an American accent for the film, but was dissatisfied with the result. Additionally, Michael Byrne portrays Ernst Vogel, a brutal SS colonel. Byrne and Ford had previously starred in Force 10 from Navarone (1978), in which they also respectively played a German and an American. Kevork Malikyan portrays Kazim, The leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an organization that protects the Holy Grail. Malikyan had impressed Spielberg with his performance in Midnight Express (1978) and would have auditioned for the role of Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark had a traffic jam not delayed his meeting with the director. Robert Eddison appears as the Grail Knight, the guardian of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal as long as he stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing in a few films since the 1930s (including a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his return to film, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released. Michael Sheard appears as Adolf Hitler, whom Jones briefly encounters at the book-burning rally in Berlin. Although a non-speaking role, Sheard could speak German and had already portrayed Hitler three times during his career. He had also appeared as Admiral Ozzel in The Empire Strikes Back and as Oskar Schomburg in Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the same scene, Ronald Lacey, who played Toht in Raiders of the Lost Ark, cameos as Heinrich Himmler. Alexei Sayle played the sultan of Hatay. Paul Maxwell portrayed \\"the man with the Panama Hat\\" who took possession of the Cross of Coronado. Wrestler and stuntman Pat Roach, who played three roles in the previous two films, made a short cameo as the Nazi who accompanies Vogel to the Zeppelin. Roach was set to film a fight with Ford, but it was cut. In a deleted scene, Roach's agent boards the second biplane on the Zeppelin with a World War I flying ace (played by Frederick Jaeger), only for the pair to fall to their deaths after the flying ace makes an error. Production =Development= Lucas and Spielberg had intended to make a trilogy of Indiana Jones films since Lucas had first pitched Raiders of the Lost Ark to Spielberg in 1977. After the mixed critical and public reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise to Lucas, with the intent to invoke the film with the spirit and tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Throughout the film's development and pre-production, Spielberg admitted he was \\"consciously regressing\\" in making the film. Due to his commitment to the film, the director had to drop out of directing Big and Rain Man. Chris Columbus's script featured the Monkey King in Africa Lucas initially suggested making the film \\"a haunted mansion movie\\", for which Romancing the Stone writer Diane Thomas wrote a script. Spielberg rejected the idea because of the similarity to Poltergeist, which he had co-written and produced. Lucas first introduced the Holy Grail in an idea for the film's prologue, which was to be set in Scotland. He intended the Grail to have a pagan basis, with the rest of the film revolving around a separate Christian artifact in Africa. Spielberg did not care for the Grail idea, which he found too esoteric, even after Lucas suggested giving it healing powers and the ability to grant immortality. In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-page treatment titled Indiana Jones and the Monkey King, which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the Fountain of Youth in Africa.Rinzler, Bouzereau, \\"The Monkey King: July 1984 to May 1988\\", p. 184 - 203. Chris Columbus‚Äîwho had written the Spielberg-produced Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes‚Äîwas hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn-type according to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier‚Äîan old friend of Indiana‚Äîtravel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune-type), who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart. Columbus's second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash‚Äîan expatriate bar owner for whom the Nazis work‚Äîand the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is captured. Indiana subsequently battles the undead, destroys the Monkey King's rod, and marries Clare. Location scouting commenced in Africa but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned Monkey King because of its negative depiction of African natives,McBride, p.318 and because the script was too unrealistic. Spielberg acknowledged that it made him \\"... feel very old, too old to direct it.\\" Columbus' script was leaked onto the Internet in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for the fourth film because it was mistakenly dated to 1995. Dissatisfied, Spielberg suggested introducing Indiana's father, Henry Jones, Sr. Lucas was dubious, believing the Grail should be the story's focus, but Spielberg convinced him that the father‚Äìson relationship would serve as a great metaphor in Indiana's search for the artifact. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes, who had worked on Spielberg's The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, to begin a new script on January 1, 1986. Meyjes completed his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his father in Monts√©gur, where he meets a nun named Chantal. Indiana travels to Venice, takes the Orient Express to Istanbul, and continues by train to Petra, where he meets Sallah and reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to Heaven. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in Krak des Chevaliers, the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with \\"God is King\\". The prologue in both drafts has Indiana in Mexico battling for possession of Montezuma's death mask with a man who owns gorillas as pets. Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) finds the Cross of Coronado as a 13-year-old Boy Scout. Spielberg suggested making Indiana a Boy Scout as both he and Harrison Ford were former Scouts. Spielberg suggested Innerspace writer Jeffrey Boam perform the next rewrite. Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film. Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story. \\"Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended,\\" he said, \\"So I thought, let them lose the Grail, and let the father‚Äìson relationship be the main point. It's an archaeological search for Indy's own identity and coming to accept his father is more what it's about [than the quest for the Grail].\\" Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films. In Boam's first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail. Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite utilized many of Connery's comic suggestions. It included the prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas had to convince Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun, which was about a young boy. Spielberg‚Äîwho was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award‚Äîhad the idea of making Indiana a Boy Scout. The 1912 prologue as seen in the film refers to events in the lives of Indiana's creators. When Indiana cracks the bullwhip to defend himself against a lion, he accidentally lashes and scars his chin. Ford gained this scar in a car accident as a young man. Indiana taking his nickname from his pet Alaskan Malamute is a reference to the character being named after Lucas's dog. The train carriage Indiana enters is named \\"Doctor Fantasy's Magic Caboose\\", which was the name producer Frank Marshall used when performing magic tricks. Spielberg suggested the idea, Marshall came up with the false-bottomed box through which Indiana escapes, and production designer Elliott Scott suggested the trick be done in a single, uninterrupted shot. Spielberg intended the shot of Henry with his umbrella‚Äîafter he causes the bird strike on the German plane‚Äîto evoke Ryan's Daughter. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long-distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision of March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end. Between an undated \\"Amblin\\" revision and a rewrite by Tom Stoppard (under the pen name Barry Watson) dated May 8, 1988, further changes were made. Stoppard polished most of the dialogue, and created the \\"Panama Hat\\" character to link the prologue's segments featuring the young and adult Indianas. The Venetian family is cut. Kemal is renamed Kazim and now wants to protect the grail rather than find it. Chandler is renamed Donovan. The scene of Brody being captured is added. Vogel now dies in the tank, while Donovan shoots Henry and then drinks from the false grail, and Elsa falls into the chasm. The Grail trials are expanded to include the stone-stepping and leap of faith. The Double Arch in the Arches National Park in Utah, United States =Filming= Principal photography began on May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almer√≠a province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to be a short sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to the Escuela de Arte de Almer√≠a, to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-N√≠jar Natural Park was used for the road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The shoot's Spanish portion wrapped on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at ƒ∞skenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect. B√ºrresheim Castle, near Mayen, in the then-West German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, served as \\"Brunwald Castle\\" in Austria near the German border The exteriors of \\"Brunwald Castle\\" were filmed at B√ºrresheim Castle in West Germany. Filming for the castle interiors took place in the United Kingdom from June 5 to 10, 1988, at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, England. On June 16 Lawrence Hall, London, was used as the interior of Berlin Tempelhof Airport. Filming returned to Elstree the next day to capture the motorcycle escape, continuing at the studio for interior scenes until July 18. One day was spent at North Weald Airfield on June 29 to film Indiana leaving for Venice. Ford and Connery acted much of the Zeppelin table conversation without trousers on because of the overheated set. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy interrupted the shoot to make a plea to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to support the economically \\"depressed\\" British studios. July 20‚Äì22 was spent filming the temple interiors. The temple set, which took six weeks to build, was supported on 80 feet of hydraulics and ten gimbals for use during the earthquake scene. Resetting between takes took twenty minutes while the hydraulics were put to their starting positions and the cracks filled with plaster. The shot of the Grail falling to the temple floor‚Äîcausing the first crack to appear‚Äîwas attempted on the full-size set, but proved too difficult. Instead, crews built a separate floor section that incorporated a pre-scored crack sealed with plaster. It took several takes to throw the Grail from six feet onto the right part of the crack. July 25‚Äì26 was spent on night shoots at Stowe School, Stowe, Buckinghamshire, for the Nazi rally. Filming resumed two days later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The steamship fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks‚Äîeach holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000 lb.) of water‚Äîwere used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice in front of a ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark). The M√≥nsul beach in the Cabo de Gata-N√≠jar Natural Park in Almer√≠a, Spain Shooting in Venice took place on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody greeting Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists for as long as possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming. The second unit filmed part of the prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The main unit began two days later with the circus train sequence at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to 16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado was used for the Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post- production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Amarillo, Texas in early 1989. =Design= Composite photograph of the tank on location Mechanical effects supervisor George Gibbs said the film was the most difficult one of his career. He visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French World War I tank, but decided he wanted to make one. The tank was based on the Tank Mark VIII, which was long and weighed . Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a excavator and added tracks that were driven by two automatic hydraulic pumps, each connected to a Range Rover V8 engine. Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historic counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almer√≠a on a Short Belfast plane and then a low loader truck. The tank broke down twice. The distributor's rotor arm broke and a replacement had to be sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, and the lack of suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster.Rinzler, Bouzereau, \\"The Professionals: May 1988 to May 1989\\", p. 204 - 229. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures. The tank chase was filmed in the Tabernas Desert in Almer√≠a, Spain Michael Lantieri, mechanical effects supervisor for the 1912 scenes, noted the difficulty in shooting the train sequence. \\"You can't just stop a train,\\" he said, \\"If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up.\\" Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion. For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided he wanted it to move, the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri's crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin's radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew. For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 Ford Model T, a 1919 Ford Model T truck and a 1916 Saxon Model 14, fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine. Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment. Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into striking the German plane because the real gulls used in the first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds‚Äîincluding a boa constrictor‚Äîwere used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights. Al Khazneh (The Treasury) at Petra, Jordan was used for the entrance to the temple housing the Holy Grail. Costume designer Anthony Powell found it a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but did not want to hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference. The motorcycles used in the chase from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with sidecar in which Indy and Henry escape was an original Dnepr, complete with machine gun pintle on the sidecar, while the pursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and logos to make them resemble German army models. Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army training planes standing in for Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He built a device based on an internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as the water from the Grail washes it away. At least one reproduction Kubelwagen was used during filming despite the film being set two years prior to manufacture of said vehicles. =Effects= Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) built an eight-foot foam model of the Zeppelin to complement shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan was used for the shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences. Indiana discovers a bridge hidden by camouflage. Ford was filmed in front of a bluescreen for the scene, which was completed by a model of the bridge filmed against a matte painting Spielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail. For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells \\"Iehova\\" on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on \\"J\\". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the by model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance. Spielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's forehead and cheeks by Nick Dudman that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan created by Stephan Dupuis in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact. Ben Burtt designed the sound effects. He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats, and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a wind turbine for the plane crashes. Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a .357 Magnum in Skywalker Ranch's underground car park, just as Lucas drove in. A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple.(2003). The Sound of Indiana Jones (DVD). Paramount Pictures. The film was released in selected theaters in the 70 mm Full-Field Sound format, which allowed sounds to not only move from side to side, but also from the theater's front to its rear. Administration Building, on Treasure Island, in San Francisco, California, served as the \\"Berlin Airport\\" Matte paintings of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was B√ºrresheim Castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The Administration Building at San Francisco's Treasure Island was used as the exterior of Berlin Tempelhof Airport. The structure already had period-appropriate art deco architecture, as it had been constructed in 1938 for planned use as an airport terminal. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating \\"Berlin Flughafen\\". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings. Themes A son's relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg's films, including E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Hook. The film's exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and Field of Dreams. Writing for The New York Times, Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected New Age concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana nor his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their boys' own adventure. James contrasted the temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's mother does not appear in the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film's events began. Release & Reception =Marketing= The film's teaser trailer debuted in November 1988 with Scrooged and The Naked Gun. Rob MacGregor wrote the tie-in novelization that was released in June 1989; it sold enough copies to be included on the New York Times Best Seller list. MacGregor went on to write the first six Indiana Jones prequel novels during the 1990s. Following the film's release, Ford donated Indiana's fedora and jacket to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. No toys were made to promote the film; Indiana Jones \\"never happened on the toy level\\", said Larry Carlat, senior editor of the journal Children's Business. Rather, Lucasfilm promoted Indiana as a lifestyle symbol, selling tie-in fedoras, shirts, jackets and watches. Two video games based on the film were released by LucasArts in 1989: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game. A third game was produced by Taito and released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Ryder Windham wrote another novelization, released in April 2008 by Scholastic, to coincide with the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Hasbro released toys based on The Last Crusade in July 2008. =Box office= The film was released in the United States and Canada on Wednesday, May 24, 1989, in 2,327 theaters, earning a record $37,031,573 over the 4-day Memorial Day weekend. The gross was boosted by high ticket prices in some venues ($7 a ticket). Its 3-day opening weekend figure of $29,355,021 was surpassed later that year by Ghostbusters II and Batman, which grossed more in its opening 3 days than The Last Crusade in 4. Its Saturday gross of $11,181,429 was the first time a film had made over $10 million in one day. It broke the record for the best seven- day performance with a gross of $50.2 million, beating the $45.7 million grossed by Temple of Doom in 1984 on 1,687 screens. It added another record with $77 million after twelve days, and earned a $100 million in a record nineteen days. In France, the film broke a record by selling a million admissions within two and a half weeks. The film eventually grossed $197,171,806 in the United States and Canada and $277 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $474,171,806. At the time of its release, the film was the 11th highest-grossing film of all time. Despite competition from Batman, The Last Crusade became the highest-grossing film worldwide in 1989. In North America, Batman took top position. Behind Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Raiders, The Last Crusade is the third-highest grossing Indiana Jones film in the United States and Canada, though it is also behind Temple of Doom when adjusting for inflation. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 49 million tickets in North America. The film was re-released in 1992 earning $139,000. =Critical response= The film opened to mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88%, with an average rating of 7.91/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Lighter and more comedic than its predecessor, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of Raiders, while adding a dynamite double act between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.\\" Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel said that while the film \\"lacks the novelty of Raiders, and the breathless pacing of Temple of Doom, it was an entertaining capper to the trilogy.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked the film was \\"the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all\\". Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it, as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times. \\"Though it seems to have the manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, The Last Crusade is an endearing original,\\" Canby wrote, deeming the revelation Indiana had a father who was not proud of him to be a \\"comic surprise\\". Canby believed that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had \\"hilariously off-the-wall sequences\\" such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father‚Äìson relationship, a call echoed by McBride in Variety. Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the \\"style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s\\", saying that Spielberg \\"must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life magazine... the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines.\\" The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations. Sean Connery received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his performance It was panned by Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer, David Denby in New York magazine, Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic and Georgia Brown in The Village Voice. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called the film \\"soulless\\". The Washington Post reviewed the film twice; Hal Hinson's review on the day of the film's release was negative, describing it as \\"nearly all chases and dull exposition\\". Although he praised Ford and Connery, he felt the film's exploration of Indiana's character took away his mystery and that Spielberg should not have tried to mature his storytelling. Two days later, Desson Thomson published a positive review praising the film's adventure and action, as well as the father‚Äìson relationship's thematic depth. =Influence= The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing; it also received nominations for Best Original Score and Best Sound (Ben Burtt, Gary Summers, Shawn Murphy and Tony Dawe), but lost to The Little Mermaid and Glory respectively. Sean Connery received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Connery and the visual and sound effects teams were also nominated at the 43rd British Academy Film Awards. The film won the 1990 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and was nominated for Best Motion Picture Drama at the Young Artist Awards. John Williams' score won a BMI Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. alt=Two small shops offering Coca-Cola products and other soft drinks in glass-fronted refrigerated containers. In the middle is an umbrella with the Pepsi logo. Above them are signs referencing Indiana Jones and depicting him. A small group of people is walking past and in front of them on the right The prologue depicting Indiana in his youth inspired Lucas to create The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series, which featured Sean Patrick Flanery as the young adult Indiana and Corey Carrier as the 8- to 10-year-old Indiana. The 13-year-old incarnation played by Phoenix in the film was the focus of a Young Indiana Jones series of young adult novels that began in 1990; by the ninth novel, the series had become a tie-in to the television show. German author Wolfgang Hohlbein revisited the 1912 prologue in one of his novels, in which Indiana encounters the lead grave robber‚Äîwhom Hohlbein christens Jake‚Äîin 1943. The film's ending begins the 1995 comic series Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny, which moves forward to depict Indiana and his father searching for the Holy Lance in Ireland in 1945. Spielberg intended to have Connery cameo as Henry in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), but Connery turned it down as he had retired. Petra's use for the movie's climactic scenes greatly contributed to its popularity as an international tourist destination. Before the film's release, only a few thousand visitors per year made the trip; since then it has grown to almost a million annually. Shops and hotels near the site play up the connection, and it is mentioned prominently in itineraries of locations used in the film series. Jordan's tourism board mentions the connection on its website. In 2012 the satirical news site The Pan-Arabia Enquirer ran a mock story claiming that the board had officially renamed Petra \\"That Place from Indiana Jones\\" to reflect how the world more commonly refers to it.

The two compounds are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. They are also found in semen and some microalgae, together with related molecules like spermine and spermidine.

Biography of Ludwig Brieger in English. Receptors In humans, molecular modelling and docking experiments have shown that putrescine fits into the binding pocket of the human TAAR6 and TAAR8 receptors. Production Putrescine is produced on an industrial scale by hydrogenation of succinonitrile, which is produced by addition of hydrogen cyanide to acrylonitrile. Putrescine is reacted with adipic acid to yield the polyamide Nylon 46, which is marketed by DSM under the trade name Stanyl. Biotechnological production of putrescine from renewable feedstock is a promising alternative to the chemical synthesis. A metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli that produces putrescine at high titer in glucose mineral salts medium has been described. Biochemistry Biosynthesis of spermidine and spermine from putrescine. Ado = 5'-adenosyl. Spermidine synthase uses putrescine and S-adenosylmethioninamine (decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine) to produce spermidine. Spermidine in turn is combined with another S-adenosylmethioninamine and gets converted to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. Putrescine is synthesized biologically via two different pathways, both starting from arginine. * In one pathway, arginine is converted into agmatine, with a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC); then agmatine is transformed into N-carbamoylputrescine by agmatine imino hydroxylase (AIH). Finally, N-carbamoylputrescine is converted into putrescine. * In the second pathway, arginine is converted into ornithine and then ornithine is converted into putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The polyamines, of which putrescine is one of the simplest, appear to be growth factors necessary for cell division. Toxicity Putrescine is toxic in large doses. In rats it has a low acute oral toxicity of 2000 mg/kg body weight, with no-observed-adverse-effect level of 2000 ppm (180 mg/kg body weight/day). When heated to decomposition, putrescine emits toxic fumes of NOx.\\"Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB).‚Äù U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

It was initially billed an everyday story of country folk and now, a contemporary drama in a rural setting. Having aired over 19,200 episodes, it is the world's longest-running drama. Five pilot episodes were aired in 1950 and the first episode was broadcast nationally on 1 January 1951. A significant show in British popular culture, and with over five million listeners, it is Radio 4's most listened-to non-news programme, and with over one million listeners via the internet, the programme holds the record for BBC Radio online listening figures. In February 2019, a panel of 46 broadcasting industry experts, of which 42 had a professional connection to the BBC, listed The Archers as the second-greatest radio programme of all time. Partly established with the aim towards educating farmers following World War II, The Archers soon became a popular source of entertainment for the population at large, attracting nine million listeners by 1953. Synopsis The Archers is set in the fictional village of Ambridge in the fictional county of Borsetshire, in England. Borsetshire is situated between what are, in reality, the contiguous counties of Worcestershire and Warwickshire, south of Birmingham in The Midlands. Ambridge is possibly based on the village of Cutnall Green, though various other villages claim to be the inspiration for Ambridge; The Bull, Ambridge's pub, is modelled on The Old Bull in Inkberrow,Compare Ambridge's The Bull with Inkberrow's The Old Bull. whereas Hanbury's St Mary the Virgin is often used as a stand-in for Ambridge's parish church, St Stephen's.Compare Ambridge's St Stephen's with Hanbury's St Mary the Virgin. Other fictional villages include Penny Hassett, Loxley Barrett,Loxley Barrett Primary School; goodschoolsguide.co.uk Darrington, Hollerton, Edgeley, Waterley Cross and Lakey Green. The county town of Borsetshire is Borchester, and the nearest big city is the cathedral city of Felpersham. Felpersham also has a university. Anywhere further from Ambridge may be referred to humorously with comments such as 'that's on the other side of Felpersham!', but characters do occasionally venture further: several attended the Countryside Alliance march in London, there have been references to the gay scene in Manchester's Canal Street. There have been scenes set in other places in the United Kingdom and abroad, with some characters residing overseas such as in South Africa and Hungary. Since Easter Sunday 1998, there have been six episodes a week, from Sunday to Friday, broadcast at around 19:03 following the news summary. All except the Friday evening episode are repeated the following day at 14:02. The six episodes are re-run unabridged in the Sunday morning omnibus at 10:00. On Remembrance Sunday, the Omnibus edition begins at the earlier time of 09:15. This information is available in the press and on the BBC's website. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, weekly programming reduced to four episodes, omitting episodes on Sunday and Friday. The Sunday omnibus was correspondingly reduced in length. After continuing with pre-recorded episodes and repeating some classic episodes, new episodes started that had been recorded remotely, to a mixed reception\\". Characters * The Archers's family farm, Brookfield, combines arable, dairy, beef, and sheep. It is a typical example of mixed farming which has been passed down the generations from Dan, the original farmer, to his son Phil and is now co-owned by Phil and Jill's four children: David, who manages it with his wife Ruth; Shula Hebden-Lloyd, owner of the riding stables, was married to Alistair, a vet; her twin Kenton, runs the village's only pub with his wife Jolene; and the widowed Elizabeth Pargeter. Jill lives in Brookfield with her son David, his wife Ruth and their children Pip, Josh, and Ben. * The Aldridges at Home Farm. Brian, who is portrayed as a money-driven agribusinessman and his wife Jennifer. They have five children: the two Jennifer brought into their marriage: Adam, a farmer married to chef Ian Craig and Debbie a farmer based in Hungary; two born into the marriage, Kate with a family abandoned in South Africa, and Alice married to farrier Chris Carter; and schoolboy Ruairi, Brian's son by one of his affairs. The family also includes Kate's daughter Phoebe and Jennifer's sister Lilian. * The Bridge Farm Archers practise organic farming. Their operations include a farm shop, a farm caf√©, a vegetable box scheme and a dairy. Tony and Pat's children are Helen and Tom, and their three grandchildren: Johnny, who is the son of their dead son John; and Henry and Jack. * The Pargetters, a landed gentry family who have to make their stately home, Lower Loxley Hall, pay the bills as a public attraction. The family includes Nigel Pargetter's widow, Elizabeth Archer, her son Freddie and his twin sister Lily. * The Grundys, formerly struggling tenant farmers who were brought to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s as comic characters, but are now seen as doggedly battling adversity. * The Carters, Neil and Susan. Their son, Chris, is married to Alice Aldridge; their daughter, Emma, has successively married brothers Will and Edward Grundy. * The Snells; Lynda, married to the long- suffering Robert, is the butt of many jokes, although her sheer energy makes her a stalwart of village life. Ambridge * Arkwright Hall is a large Victorian mansion with a 17th-century atmosphere. The building served as a community centre for many years, containing a soundproofed room and field studies centre. Later it fell into disrepair, but was renovated when Jack Woolley leased the mansion to the Landmark Trust; architect Lewis Carmichael led the restoration of the building to its Victorian splendour. * Bridge Farm is a farm previously on Berrow Estate, but now owned by Pat and Tony Archer. The farm became wholly dedicated to organic farming in 1984, in a storyline inspired by a scriptwriter's visit to Brynllys farm in Ceredigion, the home of Rachel's Organic. In 2003, Tom Archer began producing his Bridge Farm pork sausages. In early 2013, the family decided to sell their dairy herd and buy organic milk instead and the following year, Tony Archer bought a small Aberdeen Angus herd. * Brookfield Farm is a mixed farm which was managed by Dan Archer and then by his son Phil. After Phil's retirement in 2001, his son David Archer took over. * Grange Farm was a working farm run by the Grundys until their eviction in 2000. The farmhouse, along with of land, was sold to Oliver Sterling, who then began \\"hobby farming\\". He took young Ed Grundy on as cow man and later gave him full responsibility for running the farm. * Grey Gables, once a country club, is now a luxurious hotel. The late Caroline Sterling bought it with her husband Oliver Sterling. The hotel boasts a pool, spa, health club and a golf course. Ian Craig is the executive chef. * Home Farm is a farm, by far the largest in Ambridge. In recent years, Home Farm expanded into soft fruit and deer farming. * Lower Loxley Hall is a large 300-year-old country house located just outside Ambridge. It serves primarily as a conference centre. * The Bull, the village's only pub, is perhaps the most recognisable structure in Ambridge * St. Stephen's Church, established in 1281, dates back to Norman times. The church has undergone many changes over the years, including a number of different vicars. The eight bells are rung by a group led by Neil Carter. * Ambridge still has a village shop and post office, originally thanks to Jack Woolley's philanthropy. The business is now a community shop managed by Susan and run by a team of volunteers. * Willow Farm is owned by the Tucker family. After Betty's death in 2005, the house was divided to accommodate Roy and his family. The farmland is home to Neil Carter's pigs. Topicality Unlike some soap operas, episodes of The Archers portray events taking place on the date of broadcast, allowing many topical subjects to be included. Real-life events which can be readily predicted in advance are often written into the script, such as the annual Oxford Farming Conference and the FIFA World Cup. On some occasions, scenes recorded at these events are planned and edited into episodes shortly before transmission. More challengingly for the production team, some significant but unforeseen events require scenes to be rewritten and rerecorded at short notice, such as the death of Princess Margaret (particularly poignant because she had appeared as herself on the programme), the World Trade Center attacks, and the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The events and implications of the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis required many \\"topical inserts\\" and the rewriting of several storylines. In January 2012, Oliver Sterling, owner of Grange Farm, together with his tenant, Ed Grundy, elected to vaccinate the badgers on their farm in an attempt to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis. The plotline came within weeks of the government confirming a badger cull trial. It was announced on 29 March 2020 that the programme would include reference to the COVID-19 pandemic from 4 May onwards. Actors Unlike television soaps, The Archers actors are not held on retainers and work on the series usually for a few days a month. By the nature of the storylines concentrating on particular groups of characters, in any one week out of a cast of about 60, the episodes include approximately 2030 speaking-characters. Most of the cast do acting work on other projects and can disappear for long periods if they are working on commitments such as films or television series. Tamsin Greig plays Debbie Aldridge and has appeared on many television series such as Green Wing, Love Soup, Black Books and Episodes, so Debbie manages a farm in Hungary and her visits to Ambridge are infrequent. Felicity Jones played Emma Carter from the age of 15 but after a period of studying at Wadham College, Oxford, she gave up the role to move into television and cinema. Some of the actors, when not playing their characters, earn their money through different jobs altogether: Charlotte Connor, when not playing Susan Carter (credited as Charlotte Martin), works full-time as a senior research psychologist at the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation; her office is a short walk from BBC Birmingham, and thus she is able to fit her work around recordings.David Brindle \\"Young people log on for shared headspace\\", The Guardian, 9 February 2011 Meanwhile, Graham Blockey, who plays Robert Snell, worked till recently as a full-time general practitioner in Surrey, commuting to and from BBC Birmingham at weekends and on his days off. He kept his role secret from his patients, for fear of losing their respect, until his retirement from medicine in March 2017.Matthew Weaver \\"GP reveals his 30-year secret life as Archers character Robert Snell\\", The Guardian, 31 March 2017 Other examples include Felicity Finch (Ruth Archer), who also works as a BBC journalist having travelled on a number of occasions to Afghanistan; and Ian Pepperell (Roy Tucker), who manages a pub in the New Forest.Chris Arnot, \\"The Archers at 60\\", The Guardian, 6 October 2010. History A five-episodes pilot series started on Whit Monday, 29 May 1950, and continued throughout that week. It was created by Godfrey Baseley and was broadcast to the English Midlands in the Regional Home Service, as 'a farming Dick Barton'. Recordings were sent to London, and the BBC decided to commission the series for a longer national run. In the five pilots the Archers owned Wimberton Farm, rather than Brookfield. Baseley subsequently edited The Archers for 22 years. Since 1 January 1951, five 15-minute episodes (since 1998, six 12¬Ω-minute episodes) have been transmitted each week, at first on the BBC Light ProgrammeDonovan, Paul (1991), The Radio Companion. London: Grafton; p. 8. and subsequently on the BBC Home Service (and Radio 4 from 1978). Early afternoon repeats of the previous evening's episode began on 14 December 1964. The original scriptwriters were Geoffrey Webb and Edward J. Mason, who were also working on the nightly thriller series about the special agent Dick Barton. The popularity of his adventures partly inspired The Archers, which eventually took over Barton's evening slot. At first, however, the national launch placed the serial at the 'terrible'Smethurst, William (1996), The Archers: The True Story. London: Michael O'Mara Books; p.24. time of 11.45 am, but it moved to Dick Barton's former slot of 6.45 pm from Monday, 2 April 1951. An omnibus edition of the week's episodes began on Saturday, 5 January 1952. Originally produced with collaborative input from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, The Archers was conceived as a means of disseminating information to farmers and smallholders to help increase productivity in the Postwar era of rationing and food shortages. The Archers originally centred on the lives of three farmers; Dan Archer, farming efficiently with little cash, Walter Gabriel, farming inefficiently with little cash, and George Fairbrother, a wealthy businessman farming at a loss for tax purposes (which one could do in those days).Norman Painting, Forever Ambridge (1975) The programme was hugely successful, winning the National Radio Awards' 'Most entertaining programme of the Year' award jointly with Take It from Here in 1954, and winning the award outright in 1955, in which year the audience was reported to have peaked at 20 million.The Listener, 29 August 1985. In the late 1950s, despite the growth of television and radio's consequent decline, the programme was still claiming eleven million listeners and was also being transmitted in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.Smethurst, William (1996), The Archers: The True Story. London: Michael O'Mara Books; pp. 75‚Äì76. By the mid-1970s, however, the audience for the two daily broadcasts and the weekend omnibus combined was less than 3 millionSmethurst (1996) The Archers, p. 144. and in 1976 the BBC Radio Four Review Board twice considered whether or not the programme should be axed.Hendy, David (2007), Life On Air, A history of Radio Four Oxford University Press, p. 205. The serial's woes at this time were seen to mirror the poor standing of radio drama in general, described as \\"a failure to fully shake off the conventions of non-realism which had prevailed in the 1940s and 1950s.\\"Hendy, David (2007) Life On Air, p. 204. Programme chief Jock Gallagher, responsible for The Archers, described these as the serial's \\"dog days\\".Hendy (2007), p. 204. Sweeping editorial reforms followed, included the introduction of women writers (there had been none before 1975), two of whom, Helen Leadbeater and Margaret Phelan, were credited with giving the programme a new definitive style of writing and content, although some listeners complained about their radical feminism.Glenys Roberts, London Evening Standard, London; 17 March 1983. In 1980 Julie Burchill commented that the women of Ambridge were no longer stuck with \\"the gallons of greengage jam old- guard male scriptwriters kept them occupied with for over twenty years\\"; but were 'into post-natal depression and alcoholism on the way to self- discovery'.Hendy (2007), p, 207. By the mid-1980s the Radio Four Review Board noted that scripts, directing and acting was \\"very good\\" and sometimes \\"better than ever\\".Hendy (2007), p. 208. In August 1985 The Listener said that the programme's revival was \\"sustained by some of the best acting, direction and writing on radio.\\" Tony Shryane MBE was the programme's producer from 1 January 1951 to 19 January 1979. Vanessa Whitburn was the programme's editor from 1992 till 2013. Whitburn took service leave from March to July 2012, when John Yorke, a former executive producer of EastEnders, was the acting editor. Yorke's arrival prompted charges that the programme was importing the values of EastEnders to Borsetshire, with fans and commentators complaining that characters were behaving unrealistically simply to generate conflict. This was denied by Yorke, who wrote that he agreed to take over \\"on one condition ‚Äì that it stayed exactly as it was and that I didn't have to change anything.\\" Whitburn was succeeded as editor by Sean O'Connor in September 2013. In September 2016, Huw Kennair-Jones took over as editor though O'Connor continued to oversee the Helen and Rob storyline until its conclusion. Kennair-Jones announced in October 2017 that he was to leave the BBC to work as commissioning editor for ITV. The short presence of two successive Archers editors in the job led to concerns that there might be a trend of radio drama editing being seen as \\"training ground\\" for higher-paid positions in TV. Alison Hindell, the BBC's head of Audio Drama until October 2018, took over as acting editor before and after Kennair-Jones's time in charge. She effectively swapped with Jeremy Howe when she succeeded him as the BBC's commissioning editor for drama and fiction and he started as editor of the Archers in late August 2018. Since 2007, The Archers has been available as a podcast. =Death of Grace Archer= One of the most controversial Archers episodes was broadcast on 22 September 1955, which coincided with the launch of the UK's first commercial television station. Phil and Grace Archer had been married just a few months earlier, and their blossoming relationship was the talk of the nation. However, searching for a story which would demonstrate some real tragedy among the increasingly unconvincing episode cliff-hangers, Godfrey Baseley had decided that Grace would have to die. The scripts for the week commencing 19 September 1955 were written, recorded, and broadcast on each day, with an \\"exercise in topicality\\" given as the explanation to the cast. On Thursday, listeners heard the sound effects of Grace trying to rescue Midnight, her horse, from a fire in the stable at Brookfield and the crash of a falling timber beam. Whether the timing of the episode was a deliberate attempt to overshadow the opening night of the BBC's first commercial rival has been debated ever since. It was certainly planned some months in advance, but it may well be that the actual date of the death was changed during the scriptwriting stage to coincide with the launch of Associated-Rediffusion. Deliberate or not, the episode attracted widespread media attention, being reported by newspapers around the world. This controversy has been parodied twice: in \\"The Bowmans\\", an episode of the television comedy programme Hancock, and in the play The Killing of Sister George and its 1968 film adaptation. On the 50th anniversary of ITV's launch, Ysanne Churchman, who played Grace, sent them a congratulatory card signed \\"Grace Archer\\". In 1996, William Smethurst recounted a conversation with Baseley in which he reveals his real motivation for killing off Grace Archer: Churchman was encouraging the other actors to join a trade union. =Longevity= The actor Norman Painting played Phil Archer continuously from the first trial series in 1950 until his death on 29 October 2009. His last Archers performance was recorded just two days before his death, and was broadcast on 22 November. He is cited in Guinness World Records as the longest-serving actor in a single soap opera. Under the pseudonym \\"Bruno Milna\\", Painting also wrote around 1,200 complete episodes, which culminated in the 10,000th episode. June Spencer has played Peggy Archer/Woolley from the pilot episode onwards, continuing to work until well over 100, though not for all of the period since. According to Who's Who in The Archers 2008, episode 15,360 was broadcast on 1 January 2008. Episode 15,000 was broadcast on 7 November 2006. =Sixtieth anniversary= The Archers reached its 60th anniversary on 1 January 2011 and to mark this achievement, a special half-hour episode was broadcast on Sunday, 2 January, on BBC Radio 4 from 7pm. The episode had been advertised as containing events that would \\"shake Ambridge to the core\\". This phrase even gave rise to the initialism #SATTC trending on the website Twitter during that weekend as listeners speculated about what might happen, and then reported their views as the story unfolded. The main events in the episode were Helen Archer giving birth to her son Henry and Nigel Pargetter falling to his death from the roof of Lower Loxley Hall. This unlikely event provoked interest in the frequency and causes of death in the series. In fact, although the incidence of accidental death and suicide is seven times the national average, the overall mortality rate in Ambridge is almost exactly what would be expected. The writing out of the character of Nigel caused much controversy among listeners, with a large number of complaints variously expressing dismay at the death of a popular character, concerns over the manner of the dismissal of the actor, belief that the promise to \\"shake Ambridge to the core\\" had been over-hyped, criticism of the credibility of the script and acting for the anniversary episode, and a perceived unwillingness of the editorial team to engage with these listener complaints. =COVID-19 pandemic= Whereas topical subjects have previously been added to the script, that has not been possible with the COVID-19 pandemic. From 4 May 2020, the weekly broadcast has been reduced to four episodes: Monday - Thursday. Actors were initially recorded in their homes and included references to the pandemic from some of the characters sharing their private thoughts with the listener. Themes The programme has tackled many serious, contemporary social issues: rural drug addiction; rape, including rape in marriage; inter-racial relationships; direct action against genetically modified crops and badger culling; family break-ups; and civil partnerships, and a family being threatened by a gang of farm thieves. There has been criticism from conservative commentators, such as Peter Hitchens in 1999Peter Hitchens (2000) [1999], The Abolition of Britain, pp. 262‚Äì64, Quartet (revised edition) that the series has become a vehicle for liberal and left-wing values and agendas, with characters behaving out of character to achieve those goals. However, one of the show's charms is to make much out of everyday, small concerns, such as the possible closure of the village shop, the loss and rediscovery of a pair of spectacles, competitive marmalade- making, or nonsense such as a 'spile troshing' competition, rather than the large-scale and improbable events that form the plots of many soap operas. According to some of the actors, and confirmed in the writings of Godfrey Baseley, in its early days the show was used as a conduit for educational announcements from the Ministry of Agriculture, one actor reading an announcement almost verbatim to another. Direct involvement of the government ended in 1972. The show has reacted within a day to agricultural emergencies such as outbreaks of foot and mouth disease which affect farmers nationwide when livestock movements are restricted. Cameo appearances Many famous people have made cameo appearances on the programme: * Princess Margaret and the Duke of Westminster appeared in 1984 in connection with a fashion show to commemorate the centenary of the NSPCC. * Dame Judi Dench made an appearance as the (hitherto usually silent) Pru Forrest in 1989 for the 10,000th episode. Terry Wogan was featured and Esther Rantzen was responsible for the sound effects. * Radio presenter John Peel appeared as himself in 1991. * Gardener Alan Titchmarsh judged Ambridge's entries in the National Gardens Scheme open gardens competition in May 2003. * Radio presenter Chris Moyles appeared in June 2004 as a random customer‚Äîand suspected National Pub of the Year judge‚Äîin The Bull. * Comedian Griff Rhys Jones appeared as himself in July 2004, when he was drafted into Lynda's campaign to restore the Cat and Fiddle pub. * Zandra Rhodes played herself in an episode in September 2006 in connection with a charity fashion show. * Robert Winston appeared as a fertility specialist consulted by Hayley and Roy Tucker in January and February 2007. * Mike Gatting appeared in September 2007 at the centre of a misunderstanding between Sid and Jolene Perks during the npower Village Cup final at Lord's Cricket Ground. * Crime novelist Colin Dexter made a cameo in 2010.Andrew French, \\"Morse author meets the Archers\\", Oxford Mail, 30 July 2010. * Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall appeared on 16 February 2011 in connection with the National Osteoporosis Society's 25th anniversary as well as the show's 60th anniversary. * In 2011, a recording of the show Gardeners' Question Time was followed by a special recording session in which Archers characters, notably Brian Aldridge, took part asking questions of the regular panellists while sitting with the audience. * Sir Bradley Wiggins appeared in an April 2014 episode, presenting prizes at the Ambridge Sport Relief Rough and Tumble event Challenge. * Kirstie Allsopp appeared in July 2014 to open the village fete. * In August 2014, the Pet Shop Boys were last-minute headliners at the music festival Loxfest. * Anneka Rice has appeared twice in Ambridge; in March 1993 and in March 2016. * In September 2016, in an hour-long episode concluding a highly publicised storyline in which Helen Titchener had stabbed her abusive husband Rob, some notable names guest starred as jury members, including Eileen Atkins, Catherine Tate and Nigel Havers. * Others who have made appearances include Britt Ekland, Humphrey Lyttelton (1956), Dame Edna Everage and Antony Gormley (2009). Theme tune The theme tune of The Archers is called \\"Barwick Green\\" and is a maypole dance from the suite My Native Heath, written in 1924 by the Yorkshire composer Arthur Wood. The Sunday omnibus broadcast of The Archers starts with a more rustic, accordion- arranged rendition by The Yetties. The theme for BBC Radio 4 Extra's The Archers spinoff, Ambridge Extra, is a version arranged by Bellowhead. A library music recording of Barwick Green was used for the pilot and during the early years of the national version, because a bid by Godfrey Baseley to have a special theme composed had been turned down on the grounds of cost, put at ¬£250-¬£300.Smethurst, William (1996), The Archers: The True Story. London: Michael O'Mara Books; p.20. However, once the serial had become undeniably established, a new recording of Barwick Green was authorised and performed by the BBC Midland Light Orchestra on 24 March 1954.BBC Gramophone Library This mono recording was also accompanied by four movements entitled \\"A Village Suite\\", composed by Kenneth Pakeman to complement Barwick Green. Excerpts from these movements were then used for a time as bridging music between scenes. The 1954 recordings were never made available to the public and their use was restricted even inside the BBC, partly because of an agreement with the Musicians' Union. In 1992, the theme was re-recorded in stereo, retaining the previous arrangements. The venue was Symphony Hall in Birmingham, the conductor Ron Goodwin, producer David Welsby and the sound mixer Norman McLeod. The slightly different sound mixing and more leisurely tempo reportedly led some listeners to consider the new version inferior, specifically that it lacked \\"brio\\", although the BBC publicised the fact that the orchestra contained some of the musicians who had played in the previous recording, including Harold Rich (piano) and Norman Parker (percussion). Robert Robinson once compared the tune to \\"the genteel abandon of a lifelong teetotaller who has suddenly taken to drink\\". On April Fool's Day 2004 both The Independent and The Today Programme claimed that BBC executives had commissioned composer Brian Eno to record an electronic version of \\"Barwick Green\\" as a replacement for the current theme, while comedian Billy Connolly included in his act the joke that the theme was so typically British that it should be the national anthem of the United Kingdom. In 2009, comedian Rainer Hersch conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in a performance of the theme, live from the Royal Festival Hall to a listening BBC Radio 3 audience in an attempt to confuse them. He then went on to show how similar it is to \\"Montagues and Capulets\\" ‚Äì \\"Dance of the Knights\\" ‚Äì from Romeo and Juliet by Sergei Prokofiev, claiming that this was a result of Russian spies going through the BBC's rubbish bins looking for the scripts. =Serious events= At times, a cliffhanger involving the death of a major character or a disaster was marked by the traditional closing theme being replaced by the final dramatic section of Barwick Green involving trombones, cymbals and the closing bars of the signature tune ‚Äì known as the \\"doom music\\" to some fan groups.See 'doom music' in 'Archers phrases' This tradition has been dropped more recently, with events such as the death of Nigel Pargetter being followed by the normal closing music despite the gravity of the incident. This has irritated some followers, who consider the jollity of the normal segment inappropriate in such circumstances.Seek 'doom music' in this A brief extract from The Dream of Gerontius was played following the death of Phil Archer. When John Archer died no music was played. There was a nod to The Archers in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July 2012, where the theme tune was played at the beginning of a segment celebrating British culture: the sound of a radio could be heard being tuned in as Barwick Green was played.

Series 1 and 2 had 26 episodes and series 3, 4 and 5 had 20. The reason offered for non-renewal was limited resources. Fan clubs Two organisations dedicated to the programme were established in the 1990s. Archers Addicts was the official body, run by members of the cast. The club had five thousand membersClive Aslet, et al \\"Why we love The Archers\\", Country Life, 7 May 2010. and an online shop where Archers memorabilia was sold under licence. It closed as a club on 31 December 2013 but still has a Facebook page and Twitter feed. Archers Anarchists was formed some time later, objecting to the \\"castist\\" assumptions propagated by the BBC, and claiming that the characters are real. The usenet newsgroup uk.media.radio.archersuk.media.radio.archers on Google Groups (referred to as UMRA by its users, who call themselves umrats) has been running since 1995. Its users include experts on subjects covered by the programme, such as the many aspects of farming, the running of small businesses, bell ringing; lengthy discussions ensue ‚Äì as well as light-hearted matters, and plot speculation. Various gatherings occur where umrats come together. The first were a series of about ten annual barbecues.UMRA 2000 barbecue The first was attended by Carole Boyd (Lynda Snell)]. They have included participants from Europe and the Americas. It has nicknames for many of the main Archers characters, such as S'aint for Shula. There are nicknames for most of the regular participants).UMRA nicknames and related matters Due perhaps to it being initially more accessible in academia, the discussions can be quite detailed, though UMRA considers itself to be a friendly and welcoming group, where in particular flamewars and the like are not welcome. Despite the general decline of usenetdiscussion on the decline of usenetUsenet#Decline with the advent of trendier media such as Facebook and Twitter, UMRA remains a very active newsgroup compared to many.

Parallels In 1994, the BBC World Service in Afghanistan began broadcasting Naway Kor, Naway Jwand (\\"New Home, New Life\\"), an everyday story of country folk incorporating pieces of useful information. Although the useful information was more likely to concern unexploded land mines and opium addiction than the latest modern farming techniques, the inspiration and model of Naway Kor, Naway Jwand was The Archers, and the initial workshopping with Afghan writers included an Archers scriptwriter. A 1997 study found that listeners to the soap opera were significantly less likely to be injured by a mine than non-listeners.Neil Andersson, Charles Whitaker, Aparna Swaminathan.

In Rwanda, the BBC World Service's Rwanda-Rundi service has been broadcasting the Archers-inspired soap opera Urunana (\\"Hand in Hand\\") since 1999. The Archers was the model for the Russian radio soap opera Dom 7, Podyezd 4 (\\"House 7, Entrance 4\\"), on which the former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, once made a cameo appearance.

The cast included Joan Sims, Lance Percival, Roy Kinnear, Derek Griffiths and John Fortune. John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme has parodied The Archers with its recurring \\"The Archers Accidentally\\" sketches; the sketches claim to portray The Archers the way it sounds to people who only listen to the show inadvertently. The radio series of Dead Ringers has frequently parodied characters from The Archers, including a special edition. The subtitle was parodied by Bill Tidy in his long-running cartoon of The Cloggies, \\"an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk\\", which ran in the satirical magazine Private Eye, and later in The Listener.

He began his broadcasting career with the BBC European Service (now the World Service) in 1946 and later worked as an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme. He is perhaps best known as the formal announcer on Beyond Our Ken (1958‚Äì1964), its more famous successor Round the Horne (1965‚Äì1968) and the short-lived Stop Messing About (1969‚Äì1970), where his \\"BBC accent\\" was used to comic effect. Listeners remember him for advertising Dobbiroids (a fictional product for horses) and the huge number of na√Øve sound effects he made to assist in the development of humorous and often bizarre plots. Smith's performance of \\"Nobody Loves a Fairy When She's Forty\\" is one of the best-remembered moments of Round the Horne. Many of his roles were portrayals of inanimate objects, e.g., volcanoes.

She is particularly remembered as a cast member of the radio series Beyond Our Ken and Round the Horne. Marsden also appeared in two Carry On films, Carry On Regardless (1961) and Carry On Camping (1969). Early life Marsden was born in West Derby, Liverpool, and grew up in near poverty in Somerset. Her music teacher recognised her talent at the age of six, and became her guardian. She attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts and during World War II she entertained the troops as a member of ENSA. It was at this time that she met and married her husband, Dr Jimmy Wilson Muggoch, an army doctor from Edinburgh. Career From 1958 to 1968, Marsden was among the cast of the radio series Beyond Our Ken and Round the Horne, where she played most of the female characters. Perhaps her most famous catchphrase was \\"many, many, many times\\", delivered in the dry, reedy tones of Bea Clissold, the ancient actress who was renowned for having given pleasure to many, particularly in \\"The Little Hut\\" on Shaftesbury Avenue. This long outlasted the Clissold character and was deployed to much audience appreciation on a few occasions in later series, possibly as an ad lib. Another was \\"'allo, cheeky face!\\", shouted into the microphone in the less-than-couth London tones of Buttercup Gruntfuttock. Marsden's vocal range was impressive and also included the husky Daphne Whitethigh, the strident stereotypical Aussie tones of the ultra feminist (but conflicted) Judy Coolibar, and the cut-glass received pronunciation of Dame Celia Molestrangler (in a series of loose pastiches of the stilted dialogue in 1930s and 1940s romances and melodramas - for example, The Astonished Heart became The Hasty Nose - partnered with Hugh Paddick's 'ageing juvenile Binkie Huckaback', with the denouement inevitably bringing the lovers crashing back to earth). In 1958, Marsden played the role of the Fairy Godmother, in the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella at the London Coliseum with Tommy Steele, Kenneth Williams, Yana and Jimmy Edwards. She escaped the wrath of the critical community in London when her role of Aunt Dahlia was removed from Andrew Lloyd Webber's flop musical Jeeves (1975) before opening night.Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works ‚Äì Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.85, Abrams: New York She also appeared in two Carry On films, Carry On Regardless in 1961 (playing Mata Hari) and Carry On Camping in 1969 (playing Terry Scott's wife, Harriet, with a braying laugh and jolly bossiness). Her other film roles included Ramsbottom Rides Again (1956), The Boys (1962), The Wild Affair (1964), The Leather Boys (1964), The Best House in London (1969), and Eyewitness (1970). She later played Hermione in the 1982 British film Britannia Hospital, Violet Manning in Peter Yates' 1983 film version of The Dresser, Princess Troubetskaya in the 1986 TV movie Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna, and Mrs. Barnacle in the 1987 film version of Little Dorrit. One of her theatre roles was in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw at the Royal Court Theatre, and her many television appearances included a role in Inspector Morse (1990).

It functions as an \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" switch in many cellular functions. Tyrosine kinases belong to a larger class of enzymes known as protein kinases which also attach phosphates to other amino acids such as serine and threonine. Phosphorylation of proteins by kinases is an important mechanism for communicating signals within a cell (signal transduction) and regulating cellular activity, such as cell division. Protein kinases can become mutated, stuck in the \\"on\\" position, and cause unregulated growth of the cell, which is a necessary step for the development of cancer. Therefore, kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, are often effective cancer treatments. Most tyrosine kinases have an associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group.  Reaction  Diagram of the activation process. Protein kinases are a group of enzymes that possess a catalytic subunit that transfers the gamma (terminal) phosphate from nucleoside triphosphates (often ATP) to one or more amino acid residues in a protein substrate side-chain, resulting in a conformational change affecting protein function. The enzymes fall into two broad classes, characterised with respect to substrate specificity: serine/threonine-specific, and tyrosine- specific (the subject of this article).  Function  Kinase is a large family of enzymes that are responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate donor, such as ATP, to an acceptor molecule. Tyrosine kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in turn causes a change in the function of the protein that they are contained in. Phosphorylation at tyrosine residues controls a wide range of properties in proteins such as enzyme activity, subcellular localization, and interaction between molecules. Furthermore, tyrosine kinases function in many signal transduction cascades wherein extracellular signals are transmitted through the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and often to the nucleus, where gene expression may be modified. Finally mutations can cause some tyrosine kinases to become constitutively active, a nonstop functional state that may contribute to initiation or progression of cancer. Tyrosine kinases function in a variety of processes, pathways, and actions, and are responsible for key events in the body. The receptor tyrosine kinases function in transmembrane signaling, whereas tyrosine kinases within the cell function in signal transduction to the nucleus. Tyrosine kinase activity in the nucleus involves cell-cycle control and properties of transcription factors. In this way, in fact, tyrosine kinase activity is involved in mitogenesis, or the induction of mitosis in a cell; proteins in the cytosol and proteins in the nucleus are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues during this process. Cellular growth and reproduction may rely to some degree on tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase function has been observed in the nuclear matrix, which comprises not the chromatin but rather the nuclear envelope and a ‚Äúfibrous web‚Äù that serves to physically stabilize DNA. To be specific, Lyn, a type of kinase in the Src family that was identified in the nuclear matrix, appears to control the cell cycle. Src family tyrosine kinases are closely related but demonstrate a wide variety of functionality. Roles or expressions of Src family tyrosine kinases vary significantly according to cell type, as well as during cell growth and differentiation. Lyn and Src family tyrosine kinases in general have been known to function in signal transduction pathways. There is evidence that Lyn is localized at the cell membrane; Lyn is associated both physically and functionally with a variety of receptor molecules. Fibroblasts ‚Äì a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen and is involved in wound healing ‚Äì that have been transformed by the polyomavirus possess higher tyrosine activity in the cellular matrix. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase activity has been determined to be correlated to cellular transformation. It has also been demonstrated that phosphorylation of a middle-T antigen on tyrosine is also associated with cell transformation, a change that is similar to cellular growth or reproduction. The transmission of mechanical force and regulatory signals are quite fundamental in the normal survival of a living organism. Protein tyrosine kinase plays a role in this task, too. A protein tyrosine kinase called pp125 is likely at hand in the influence of cellular focal adhesions, as indicated by an immunofluorescent localization of the said kinase. Focal adhesions are macromolecular structures that function in the transmission of mechanical force and regulatory signals. Among the scientific community, pp125 is also referred to as FAK (focal adhesion kinase), due to its aforementioned presence in cellular focal adhesions. The protein tyrosine kinase pp125 is one of the major phosphotyrosine‚Äìcontaining proteins in unaffected (untransformed) avian and rodent fibroblast cells (fibroblast cells are explained above in some detail). Fibroblasts are a cell type responsible for wound healing and cell structure in animals, among a number of other relatively minor but important jobs that take place often or occasionally. The sequence and structure of pp125, when compared to National Biomedical Research Foundation and GenBank data bases, may be quite unique, meaning that it could be a new member of the protein tyrosine kinase family. This protein tyrosine kinase is up to about 70% unique compared to some other protein tyrosine kinases, a figure that is unlike those between actual members of an established protein tyrosine kinase family. Also, the amino acid sequence that was observed indirectly signifies that it is associated with the cytoplasm, dubbing it one in a large group of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases. It was discovered when monoclonal antibodies were observed to recognize it. Monoclonal antibodies, from chicken embryo cells transformed by pp60v-src, recognize seven different phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. One of these monoclonal antibodies, named 2A7, recognizes pp125, support for the idea that pp125 is, in fact, a protein tyrosine kinase. Cellular proliferation, as explained in some detail above, may rely in some part on tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase function has been observed in the nuclear matrix. Lyn, the type of kinase that was the first to be discovered in the nuclear matrix, is part of Src family of tyrosine kinases, which can be contained in the nucleus of differentiating, calcium-provoked kertinocytes. Lyn, in the nuclear matrix, among the nuclear envelope and the ‚Äúfibrous web‚Äù that physically stabilizes DNA, was found functioning in association with the matrix. Also, it appeared to be conditional to cell cycle. The contribution of the Lyn protein to the total tyrosine kinase activity within the nuclear matrix is unknown, however; because the Lyn was extracted only partially, an accurate measurement of its activity could not be managed. Indications, as such, are that, according to Vegesna et al. (1996), Lyn polypeptides are associated with tyrosine kinase activity in the nuclear matrix. The extracted Lyn was enzymatically active, offering support for this notion. Yet another possible and probable role of protein tyrosine kinase is that in the event of circulatory failure and organ dysfunction caused by endotoxin in rats, where the effects of inhibitors tyrphostin and genistein are involved with protein tyrosine kinase. Signals in the surroundings received by receptors in the membranes of cells are transmitted into the cell cytoplasm. Transmembrane signaling due to receptor tyrosine kinases, according to Bae et al. (2009), relies heavily on interactions, for example, mediated by the SH2 protein domain; it has been determined via experimentation that the SH2 protein domain selectivity is functional in mediating cellular processes involving tyrosine kinase. Receptor tyrosine kinases may, by this method, influence growth factor receptor signaling. This is one of the more fundamental cellular communication functions metazoans.  Regulation  Major changes are sometimes induced when the tyrosine kinase enzyme is affected by other factors. One of the factors is a molecule that is bound reversibly by a protein, called a ligand. A number of receptor tyrosine kinases, though certainly not all, do not perform protein- kinase activity until they are occupied, or activated, by one of these ligands. Although more research indicates that receptors remain active within endosomes, it was once thought that endocytosis caused by ligands was the event responsible for the process in which receptors are inactivated. Activated receptor tyrosine kinase receptors are internalized (recycled back into the system) in short time and are ultimately delivered to lysosomes, where they become work-adjacent to the catabolic acid hydrolases that partake in digestion. Internalized signaling complexes are involved in different roles in different receptor tyrosine kinase systems, the specifics of which were researched. In addition, ligands participate in reversible binding, with inhibitors binding non-covalently (inhibition of different types are effected depending on whether these inhibitors bind the enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both). Multivalency, which is an attribute that bears particular interest to some people involved in related scientific research, is a phenomenon characterized by the concurrent binding of several ligands positioned on one unit to several coinciding receptors on another. In any case, the binding of the ligand to its partner is apparent owing to the effects that it can have on the functionality of many proteins. Ligand- activated receptor tyrosine kinases, as they are sometimes referred to, demonstrate a unique attribute. Once a tyrosine receptor kinase is bonded to its ligand, it is able to bind to tyrosine kinase residing in the cytosol of the cell. =Erythrocytes= An example of this trigger-system in action is the process by which the formation of erythrocytes is regulated. Mammals possess this system, which begins in the kidneys where the developmental signal is manufactured. The developmental signal, also called a cytokine, is erythropoietin in this case. (Cytokines are key regulators of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.) Erythropoietin's activity is initiated when hematopoietic cytokine receptors become activated. In erythrocyte regulation, erythropoietin is a protein containing 165 amino acids that plays a role in activating the cytoplasmic protein kinase JAK. The results of some newer research have also indicated that the aforementioned cytokine receptors function with members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. The cytokine receptors activate the JAK kinases. This then results in the phosphorylation of several signaling proteins located in the cell membrane. This subsequently affects both the stimulation of ligand-mediated receptors and intracellular signaling pathway activation. Substrates for JAK kinases mediate some gene responses and more. The process is also responsible for mediating the production of blood cells. In this case, erythropoietin binds to the corresponding plasma membrane receptor, dimerizing the receptor. The dimer is responsible for activating the kinase JAK via binding. Tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor are consequently phosphorylated by the activated protein kinase JAK. Overall, this is also how a receptor tyrosine kinase might be activated by a ligand to regulate erythrocyte formation. =Other examples= Additional instances of factor-influenced protein tyrosine kinase activity, similar to this one, exist. An adapter protein such as Grb2 will bind to phosphate-tyrosine residues under the influence of receptor protein kinases. This mechanism is an ordinary one that provokes protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, to illustrate an extra circumstance, insulin-associated factors have been determined to influence tyrosine kinase. Insulin receptor substrates are molecules that function in signaling by regulating the effects of insulin. Many receptor enzymes have closely related structure and receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and it has been determined that the foundational or prototypical receptor enzyme, is insulin. Insulin receptor substrates IRS2 and IRS3 each have unique characteristic tissue function and distribution that serves to enhance signaling capabilities in pathways that are initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Activated IRS-1 molecules enhance the signal created by insulin. The insulin receptor system, in contrast, appears to diminish the efficacy of endosomal signaling. The epidermal growth factor receptor system, as such, has been used as an intermediate example. Some signals are produced from the actual cell surface in this case but other signals seem to emanate from within the endosomes. This variety of function may be a means to create ligand-specific signals. This supports the notion that trafficking, a term for the modification of proteins subsequent to mRNA translation, may be vital to the function of receptor signaling. Image:L-tyrosine-skeletal.pngTyrosine Image:Phosphate Group.PNGPhosphate Image:ATP chemical structure.pngATP  Structure  Included in a number of the structural features that can be recognized in all protein tyrosine kinases are an ATP binding site, three residues that are thought to be associated with the function of the third phosphate group (often called the gamma-phosphate group) of an ATP molecule bound to the enzyme, and a possible catalytic site of the enzyme that is an amino acid. Also very common among protein tyrosine kinases are two peptide sequences. There are over 100 3D structures of tyrosine kinases available at the Protein Data Bank. An example is , the crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor.  Families  The tyrosine kinases are divided into two main families: * the transmembrane receptor-linked kinases * those that are cytoplasmic proteins More than 90 protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) have been found in the human genome. They are divided into two classes, receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. =Receptor= By 2004, 58 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were known, grouped into 20 subfamilies. They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth (by signaling neurotrophins), differentiation, metabolism, adhesion, motility, death. RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain, which is able to bind a specific ligand, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain, which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates. Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation. In particular, movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the substrate to the active site. This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit (\\"transduce\\") the extracellular signal to the nucleus, causing changes in gene expression. Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis, either by gene mutation, or chromosome translocation, or simply by over-expression. In every case, the result is a hyper-active kinase, that confers an aberrant, ligand-independent, non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells. =Cytoplasmic/non- receptor= In humans, there are 32 cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (). The first non-receptor tyrosine kinase identified was the v-src oncogenic protein. Most animal cells contain one or more members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. A chicken sarcoma virus was found to carry mutated versions of the normal cellular Src gene. The mutated v-src gene has lost the normal built-in inhibition of enzyme activity that is characteristic of cellular SRC (c-src) genes. SRC family members have been found to regulate many cellular processes. For example, the T-cell antigen receptor leads to intracellular signalling by activation of Lck and Fyn, two proteins that are structurally similar to Src. Clinical significance Tyrosine kinases are particularly important today because of their implications in the treatment of cancer. A mutation that causes certain tyrosine kinases to be constitutively active has been associated with several cancers. Imatinib (brand names Gleevec and Glivec) is a drug able to bind the catalytic cleft of these tyrosine kinases, inhibiting its activity. Tyrosine kinase activity is also significantly involved in other events that are sometimes considered highly unfavorable. For instance, enhanced activity of the enzyme has been implicated in the derangement of the function of certain systems, such as cell division. Also included are numerous diseases related to local inflammation such as atherosclerosis and psoriasis, or systemic inflammation such as sepsis and septic shock. A number of viruses target tyrosine kinase function during infection. The polyoma virus affects tyrosine kinase activity inside the nuclear matrix. Fibroblasts are cells involved in wound healing and cell structure formation in mammalian cells. When these cells are transformed by the polyoma virus, higher tyrosine activity is observed in the cellular matrix, which is also correlated to cellular proliferation. Another virus that targets tyrosine kinase is the Rous sarcoma virus, a retrovirus that causes sarcoma in chickens. Infected cells display obvious structure modifications and cell growth regulation that is extremely unusual. Protein tyrosine kinases that are encoded by the Rous sarcoma virus cause cellular transformation, and are termed oncoproteins. In addition, tyrosine kinase can sometimes function incorrectly in such a way that leads to non-small cell lung cancer. A common, widespread cancer, non-small cell lung cancer is the cause of death in more people than the total number in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer together. Research has shown that protein phosphorylation occurs on residues of tyrosine by both transmembrane receptor- and membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinases in normal cells. Phosphorylation plays a significant role in cellular signalling that regulates the number and variety of growth factors. This is evidenced by the observation that cells affected by the Rous sarcoma virus display obvious structural modifications and a total lack of normal cell growth regulation. Rous sarcoma virus-encoded oncoproteins are protein tyrosine kinases that are the cause of, and are required for, this cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation activity also increases or decreases in conjunction with changes in cell composition and growth regulation. In this way, a certain transformation exhibited by cells is dependent on a role that tyrosine kinase demonstrates. Protein tyrosine kinases, have a major role in the activation of lymphocytes. In addition, they are functional in mediating communication pathways in cell types such as adrenal chromaffin, platelets, and neural cells. A tyrosine kinase can become an unregulated enzyme within an organism due to influences discussed, such as mutations and more. This behavior causes havoc; essential processes become disorganized. Systems on which the organism relies malfunction, resulting often in cancers. Preventing this type of circumstance is highly desirable. Much research has already noted the significant effect that inhibitors of the radically functioning protein tyrosine kinase enzymes have on related ailments. (See Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ) = Non-small cell lung cancer = Cancer's response to an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase was assessed in a clinical trial. In this case, Gefitinib is the inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Incorrect tyrosine kinase function can lead to non-small cell lung cancer. Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor, inducing favorable outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancers. A common, widespread cancer, non-small cell lung cancer is the cause of death in more people than breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer together. This is strong motivation to perform research on tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential targets in cancer treatment. Gefitinib, functioning as an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improved symptoms related to non- small cell lung cancer and resulted in radiographic tumor regressions. This is an example of the efficacy of such an inhibitor. The process of inhibition shows how the cancer sustains. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor activate signalling pathways that promote cell survival. Non-small cell lung cancer cells become dependent on these survival signals. Gefitinib's inhibition of the survival signals may be a contributing factor to its efficacy as a drug for non-small cell cancer treatment. Gefitinib is well endured by humans, and treatment resulted in a symptom improvement rate of 43% (with 95% confidence in a 33%‚Äì53% interval) for patients that received 250 mg of Gefitinib and 35% (with 95% confidence in a 26%‚Äì45% interval) for those that received 500 mg. In the trial, epidermal growth factor receptor showed a rapid response to the inhibitor, as demonstrated by the improvement of the cancer symptoms. In each group, improvements were noted after a single week of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Gefitinib application once per day caused ‚Äúrapid‚Äù symptom improvement and tumor regressions in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In the field of medical research, this is an especially significant example of the use of an inhibitor to treat tyrosine kinase-associated cancer. Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy were the only major options available prior to the discoveries made in this trial. The side-effects of Gefitinib oral treatment once per day were considered significant. Diarrhea was reported in 57% of patients in the 250 mg group and in 75% of the 500 mg group. One patient had diarrhea more severe than Grade 2, with up to six bowel movements in only one day. Also, a death occurred possibly due to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment; however, the correlation is not exactly clear. In addition, skin toxicity was observed in 62% of patients in the 250 mg group. Nevertheless, the side-effects of Gefitinib were only ‚Äúgenerally mild, manageable, noncumulative, and reversible.‚Äù Unfortunately, ceasing to take the inhibitor may be the only reversal strategy of the unfavorable symptoms. Gefitinib still represents a reasonably safe and effective treatment compared to other cancer therapies. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor receptor plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, which is the production of a new tumor. By 2010 Two monoclonal antibodies and another small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor called Erlotinib had also been developed to treat cancer. July 12, 2013 FDA approved afatinib \\"multiple recepptor, irreversible TKI\\" for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation = Chronic myeloid leukemia = BCR-ABL is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. It is formed from a fusion gene when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The ABL gene from chromosome 9 joins to the BCR gene on chromosome 22, to form the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase activity is crucial for the transformation of BCR-ABL. Therefore, inhibiting it improves cancer symptoms. Among currently available inhibitors to treat CML are imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. = Gastrointestinal stromal tumors = Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are known to withstand cancer chemotherapy treatment and do not respond to any kind of therapy (in 2001) in advanced cases. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib) is effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors consist of a cluster of mesenchymal neoplasms that are formed from precursors to cells that make up the connective-tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of these tumors are found in the stomach, though they can also be located in the small intestine or elsewhere in the intestinal tract. The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (c-kit). Mutation of c-kit causes the constitutive activity of tyrosine kinase, which results in cancerous gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Results of c-kit mutation include unrestricted tyrosine kinase activity and cell proliferation, unregulated phosphorylation of c-kit, and disruption of some communication pathways. Therapy with imatinib can inhibit the non-normal cell signaling mechanisms in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This results in significant responses in patients and sustained disease control. By 2001 it was no longer doubted that this inhibitor can be effective and safe in humans. In similar manner, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was found to significantly reduce the physical size of tumors; they decreased roughly 65% in size in 4 months of trialing, and continued to diminish. New lesions did not appear, and a number of the liver metastases completely reduced to non-existence. The single patient in the study remained healthy following treatment. There are no effective means of treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but that STI571 represents an effective treatment in early stage cancer associated with constitutively active c-kit, by inhibiting unfavourable tyrosine kinase activity.  Inhibitors  To reduce enzyme activity, inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes. Reducing enzyme activity can disable a pathogen or correct an incorrectly function system; as such, many enzyme inhibitors are developed to be used as drugs by the general public. =GIST and Imatinib= Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal tumors that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment options have been limited. However Imatinib, as an inhibitor to the malfunctioning enzyme, can be effective. =Chronic myelogenous leukemia and nilotinib= If imatinib does not work, patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia can use nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, or another inhibitor to the malfunction enzyme that causes the leukemia. This inhibitor is a highly selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor. =Others= Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts upon vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet- derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), stem cell factor receptor, and colony- stimulating factor-1 receptor (Burstein et al. 2008) Gefitinib and erlotinib inhibit the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and can be used to treat lung and pancreatic cancer where there is often over- expression of this cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase. Kinase inhibitors can also be mediated. Paracrine signalling mediates the response to epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors. Paracrine activates epidermal growth factor receptor in endothelial cells of the tumor to do this. Dasatinib is a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is effective both as a senolytic and as therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Bombings  While attending the University of Wisconsin-Stout, Helder planned to plant pipe bombs in mailboxes across the United States to create a smiley face shape on the United States map. The bombs, which were packed with BBs and nails, were rigged to explode as the mailboxes were opened. Completed and rigged bombs were found in Nebraska, Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Iowa. In Iowa, six people, including four mail carriers, were injured when the bombs detonated. Ultimately, Helder planted 18 bombs and covered 3,200 miles.Reaves, Jessica. \\"Person of the Week: Lucas Helder.\\" Time May 9, 2002 He was eventually captured in rural Nevada before he managed to complete the full smile. At the time of his arrest, police were looking for an unknown suspect driving a black Honda Accord and newspapers reported that he was wearing a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. The bombings were heavily covered by the United States media.  Writings and theories  Helder performing with Apathy in his hometown of Pine Island, Minnesota While Helder was not at the top of his college class, his teachers described him as a reasonably good, quiet and polite student, and at first there was confusion as to what the motivation for the bombings could be. Within the year prior to his arrest, Helder had become passionate about astral projection techniques and came to believe that death of the flesh and body is not the end of existence, as evidenced by the manifesto he sent to The Badger Herald of the University of Wisconsin-Madison at the beginning of the bombing spree. The essay also includes statements such as > \\"I'm taking very drastic measure in attempt to provide this information to > you... I will die/change in the end for this, but that's ok, hahaha paradise > awaits! I'm dismissing a few individuals from reality, to change all of you > for the better\\"Lagorio, Christine. \\"News Analysis: Newspapers receipt of > shady mail a daily occurrence.\\" The Badger Herald May 10, 2002 Notes attached to the bombs went on to denounce government control over daily lives, deny that anyone who had died was really dead, and promised more of the same kind of message.  Trial  In April 2004, a federal judge found Helder incompetent to stand trial. While a judge could free Helder if doctors find he is not a threat to society, legal experts doubt this possibility due to the violent nature of his crimes. He has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. In 2013, a federal judge ordered Helder re-evaluated for competency to stand trial. Helder remains incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota.  Musical background  Prior to his bombing spree, Helder was a member of Apathy, a Rochester, Minnesota, three-piece grunge band. Although the band was successful only on a local scale, it recorded a CD named Sacks of People at the end of their first summer together, which they funded and released themselves. When the news broke that Helder was the pipe bomber, the media made significant mention of his status as a musician. Many music critics scrambled to acquire copies of Apathy's CD, some of which were auctioned on eBay for as much as $200.

Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act. Overview Under the Westminster system, an item of primary legislation is known as an Act of Parliament after enactment. Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, where upon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before passage. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given session.Senate.gov Whether a given bill will be proposed is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government. Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the separation of powers. Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to interpret legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established. The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term legislation is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term primary legislation may be used to exclude these other forms. = Public participation in legislation = All modern constitutions and fundamental laws contain and declare the concept and principle of popular sovereignty, which essentially means that the people are the ultimate source of public power or government authority. The concept of popular sovereignty holds simply that in a society organized for political action, the will of the people as a whole is the only right standard of political action. It can be regarded as an important element in the system of the checks and balances, and representative democracy. Therefore, the people are implicitly entitled even to directly participate in the process of law making. This role of linking citizens and their government and legislators is closely related to the concept of legitimacy. The exercise of democratic control over the legislative system and the policy-making process can occur even when the public has only an elementary understanding of the national legislative institution and its membership.

A transcontinental railroad or transcontinental railway is contiguous railroad trackageTrackage OnLine Def that crosses a continental land mass and has terminals at different oceans or continental borders. Such networks can be via the tracks of either a single railroad or over those owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route. Although Europe is crisscrossed by railways, the railroads within Europe are usually not considered transcontinental, with the possible exception of the historic Orient Express. Transcontinental railroads helped open up unpopulated interior regions of continents to exploration and settlement that would not otherwise have been feasible. In many cases they also formed the backbones of cross- country passenger and freight transportation networks. Many of them continue to have an important role in freight transportation and some like the Transsiberian Railroad even have passenger trains going from one end to the other. Northern America =United States of America= \\"Last Spike\\" the joining of the tracks of the CPRR and UPRR grades at Promontory Summit, Utah, on May 10, 1869, Andrew J. Russell's \\"East and West Shaking Hands at Laying of Last Rail.\\" May 10, 1869. A transcontinental railroad in the United States is any continuous rail line connecting a location on the U.S. Pacific coast with one or more of the railroads of the nation's eastern trunk line rail systems operating between the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers and the U.S. Atlantic coast. The first concrete plan for a transcontinental railroad in the United States was presented to Congress by Asa Whitney in 1845. A series of transcontinental railroads built over the last third of the 19th century created a nationwide transportation network that united the country by rail. The first of these, the \\"Pacific Railroad\\", was built by the Central Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad to link the San Francisco Bay at Alameda, California, with the nation's existing eastern railroad network at Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska, thereby creating the world's first transcontinental railroad when it opened in 1869. Its construction was made possible by the US government under Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862, 1864, and 1867. Transcontinental railroad The U.S.'s First Transcontinental Railroad was built between 1863 and 1869 to join the eastern and western halves of the United States. Begun just before the American Civil War, its construction was considered to be one of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century. Known as the \\"Pacific Railroad\\" when it opened, this served as a vital link for trade, commerce, and travel and opened up vast regions of the North American heartland for settlement. Shipping and commerce could thrive away from navigable watercourses for the first time since the beginning of the nation. Much of this route, especially on the Sierra grade west of Reno, Nevada, is currently used by Amtrak's California Zephyr, although many parts have been rerouted. p. 1-15 The transcontinental railroad provided fast, safe, and cheap travel. The fare for a one-week trip from Omaha to San Francisco on an emigrant sleeping car was about $65 for an adult. It replaced most of the far slower and more hazardous stagecoach lines and wagon trains. The number of emigrants taking the Oregon and California Trails declined dramatically. The sale of the railroad land grant lands and the transport provided for timber and crops led to the rapid settling of the \\"Great American Desert\\".Richard White, Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America (2012) The Union Pacific recruited laborers from Army veterans and Irish immigrants, while most of the engineers were ex-Army men who had learned their trade keeping the trains running during the American Civil War. The Central Pacific Railroad faced a labor shortage in the more sparsely settled West. It recruited Cantonese laborers in China, who built the line over and through the Sierra Nevada mountains and then across Nevada to their meeting in northern Utah. * One motive for the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico in 1853 was to obtain suitable terrain for a southern transcontinental railroad, as the southern portion of the Mexican Cession was too mountainous. The Southern Pacific Railroad was completed in 1881. * The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 (based on an earlier bill in 1856) authorized land grants for new lines that would \\"aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean\\".\\"An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes 12 Stat. 489, July 1, 1862 * The rails of the \\"First Transcontinental Railroad\\" were joined on May 10, 1869, with the ceremonial driving of the \\"Last Spike\\" at Promontory Summit, Utah, after track was laid over a gap between Sacramento and Omaha, Nebraska/Council Bluffs, IowaExecutive Order of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, Fixing the Point of Commencement of the Pacific Railroad at Council Bluffs, Iowa, March 7, 1864 38th Congress, 1st Session SENATE Ex.

This route connected to the eastern rail network via the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River at Kansas City completed June 30, 1869, passed through Denver, Colorado, and north to the Union Pacific Railroad at Cheyenne, Wyoming, making it theoretically possible for the first time to board a train at Jersey City, New Jersey, travel entirely by rail, and step down at the Alameda Wharf on San Francisco Bay in Oakland. This singularity existed until March 25, 1873 when the Union Pacific constructed the Missouri River Bridge in Omaha. Subsequent transcontinental routes * Almost 12 years after Promontory Summit, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) completed the second transcontinental railroad with milestones and ceremonies in 1881 and 1883:  March 8, 1881: the SP met the Rio Grande, Mexico and Pacific Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) with a \\"silver spike\\" ceremony at Deming, New Mexico, connecting Atchison, Kansas, to Los Angeles.Myrick, David, New Mexico's Railroads, A Historic Survey, University of New Mexico Press 1990.  December 15, 1881: the SP met the Texas and Pacific Railway (T&P;) at Sierra Blanca, Texas, connecting eastern Texas to Los Angeles.  January 12, 1883: the SP completed its own southern section, meeting its subsidiary Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway at the Pecos River in Texas, and linking New Orleans to Los Angeles. * In Colorado, the 3-foot gauge Denver & Rio Grande (D&RG;) extended its route from Denver via Pueblo across the Rocky Mountains to Grand Junction in 1882. In central Utah, the D&RG; acquired a number of independent narrow gauge companies, which were incorporated into the first (1881-1889) Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway (D&RGW;). Tracks were extended north through Salt Lake City, while simultaneously building south and eastward toward Grand Junction. The D&RG; and the D&RGW; were linked on March 30, 1883, the extension to Ogden (where it met the Central Pacific) was completed on May 14, 1883, and through traffic between Denver and Ogden began a few days later. The break of gauge made direct interchange of rolling stock with standard gauge railroads at both ends of this bridge line impossible for several years. The D&RG; in 1887 began rebuilding its mainline in standard gauge, including a new route and tunnel at Tennessee Pass. The first D&RGW; was reincorporated as the Rio Grande Western (RGW) in June 1889 and immediately began the conversion of track gauge. Standard gauge operations linking Ogden and Denver were completed on November 15, 1890.Beebe, Lucius and Clegg, Charles, \\"Rio Grande, Mainline of the Rockies\\", Howell-North Books 1962. * The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad completed its route connecting the AT&SF; at Albuquerque, New Mexico, via Flagstaff, Arizona, to the Southern Pacific at Needles, California, on August 9, 1883. The SP line into Los Angeles was leased by the A&P; in 1884 (and purchased in 1911); this gave the AT&SF; (the A&P;'s parent company) a direct route into Los Angeles. This route now forms the western portion of BNSF's Southern Transcon. * The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) completed the fifth independent transcontinental railroad on August 22, 1883, linking Chicago with Seattle. The Completion Ceremony was held on September 8, 1883, with former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant contributing to driving the Final Spike. * The California Southern Railroad (chartered January 10, 1882) was completed from National City on San Diego Bay via Temecula Ca√±on to Colton and San Bernardino in September, 1883, and extended through the Cajon Pass to Barstow, a junction of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in November, 1885. In September, 1885, the line of the Southern Pacific from Colton to Los Angeles, a distance of , had been leased by the California Central with equal rights and privileges thus allowing the Santa Fe's Transcontinental route to be completed by the connection with the California Southern and A&PRR.; The SP grade was used until the completion of the California Central's own line between San Bernardino and Los Angeles in June, 1887, a distance of , which was part of the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which had been acquired by purchase. In August, 1888, the California Central completed its Coast Division south from Los Angeles to a junction with the California Southern Railroad near Oceanside, a distance of , and these two divisions comprised the main line of the California Central, forming, in connection with the California Southern, a direct line between Southern California and the East by way of the Atlantic and Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroads.\\"Eleventh Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the year ending December 31, 1890\\" Sacramento: California State Office, J.D. Young, Superintendent of State Printing, 1890. p. 21 * The Great Northern Railway was built, without federal aid, by James J. Hill in 1893; it stretched from St. Paul to Seattle. * The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific reached Santa Rosa, New Mexico, from the east in late 1901, shortly before the El Paso & Northeastern arrived from the southwest. The two were connected on February 1, 1902, thus forming an additional link between the Midwest and southern California. Through passenger service was provided by the Golden State Limited (Chicago‚ÄîKansas City‚ÄîTucumcari‚ÄîEl Paso‚ÄîLos Angeles) jointly operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific (EP&NE;'s successor) from 1902 to 1968. * The San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad completed its line connecting Los Angeles through Las Vegas to Salt Lake City on May 1, 1905. Through passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles was provided by Union Pacific's Los Angeles Limited from 1905 to 1954, and the City of Los Angeles from 1936 to 1971. * The Western Pacific Railway (WP), financed by the Denver & Rio Grande on behalf of the Gould System, completed its new line from Oakland to Ogden in 1909, in direct competition with the Southern Pacific's existing route. Through passenger service (Oakland-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago) was provided by the Exposition Flyer 1939 to 1949 and its successor, the California Zephyr 1949 to 1970, both jointly operated by the WP, the D&RGW; and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. * In 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul (or Milwaukee Road) completed a privately built Pacific extension to Seattle. On completion, the line was renamed the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific. Although the Pacific Extension was privately funded, predecessor roads did benefit from the federal land grant act, so it cannot be said to have been built without federal aid. * John D. Spreckels completed his privately funded San Diego and Arizona Railway in 1919, thereby creating a direct link (via connection with the Southern Pacific lines) between San Diego, California and the Eastern United States. The railroad stretched from San Diego to Calexico, California, of which were south of the border in Mexico. * In 1993, Amtrak's Sunset Limited daily railroad train was extended eastward to Miami, Florida, later rerouted to Orlando, making it the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental passenger train route in the United States to be operated by a single company. Hurricane Katrina cut this rail route in Louisiana in 2005. The train now runs from Los Angeles to New Orleans. The Gould System George J. Gould attempted to assemble a truly transcontinental system in the 1900s. The line from San Francisco, California, to Toledo, Ohio, was completed in 1909, consisting of the Western Pacific Railway, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, Missouri Pacific Railroad, and Wabash Railroad. Beyond Toledo, the planned route would have used the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1900), Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, Little Kanawha Railroad, West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway, Western Maryland Railroad, and Philadelphia and Western Railway, but the Panic of 1907 strangled the plans before the Little Kanawha section in West Virginia could be finished. The Alphabet Route was completed in 1931, providing the portion of this line east of the Mississippi River. With the merging of the railroads, only the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway remain to carry the entire route. =Canada= Lord Strathcona driving the \\"Last Spike\\" of Canada's first transcontinental railroad, the Canadian Pacific Railway, in 1885 The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway with the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885, is an important milestone in Canadian history. Between 1881 and 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) completed a line that spanned from the port of Montreal to the Pacific coast, fulfilling a condition of British Columbia's 1871 entry into the Canadian Confederation. The City of Vancouver, incorporated in 1886, was designated the western terminus of the line. The CPR became the first transcontinental railway company in North America in 1889 after its International Railway of Maine opened, connecting CPR to the Atlantic coast. The construction of a transcontinental railway strengthened the connection of British Columbia and the Northwest Territories to Canada they had recently joined, and acted as a bulwark against potential incursions by the United States. Subsequently, two other transcontinental lines were built in Canada: the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) opened another line to the Pacific in 1912, and the combined Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR)/National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) system opened in 1917 following the completion of the Quebec Bridge, although its line to the Pacific opened in 1914. The CNoR, GTPR, and NTR were nationalized to form the Canadian National Railway, which currently is now Canada's largest transcontinental railway, with lines running all the way from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Coast. Central America (inter-oceanic lines) =Panama (South America)= Current Panama Canal Railway line The first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad \\"continental\\" land massOtis, F.N.,\\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\\" (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12) was the Panama Rail Road. Opened in 1855, this line was designated instead as an \\"inter-oceanic\\"\\"A Great Enterprise\\" The Portland (Maine) Transcript [Newspaper], February 17, 1855. railroad crossing Country at its narrowest point, the Isthmus of Panama, when that area was still part of Colombia. (Panama split off from Colombia in 1903 and became the independent Republic of Panama). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Given the tropical rain forest environment, the terrain, and diseases such as malaria and cholera, its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \\"every quarter of the globe.\\"Otis, p. 35 This railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' East and West Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the California Gold Rush. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the Panama Canal, due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal. =Guatemala = Guatemala railway (defunct) A second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between Puerto San Jos√© and Puerto Barrios in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San Jos√© in 1989. =Costa Rica= Costa Rica railway network A third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between Puntarenas and Lim√≥n in gauge. It currently (2019) sees no passenger service. South America There is activity to revive the connection between Valpara√≠so and Santiago in Chile and Mendoza, Argentina, through the Transandino project. Mendoza has an active connection to Buenos Aires. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from Arica, Chile, to La Paz, Bolivia, to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only. On December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750 km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in Santos, Brazil but the Pacific ends are in Ilo, Peru and Matarani, Peru.https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transkontinentale- bahnstrecke-brasilien-und-bolivien-gehen-jahrhundertprojekt-an-15327521.html Another longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking Lima, Peru, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is under development. Eurasia * The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the North Sea or the English Channel with the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines that included the Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway, in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as Paris‚ÄìLille railway and Paris‚ÄìLe Havre railway. * The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the Austrian Southern Railway, Vienna‚ÄìTrieste. There were before that railroad connections Hamburg‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìWroclaw‚ÄìVienna (including Berlin‚ÄìHamburg Railway, Berlin‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw railway, Upper Silesian Railway and Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the L√ºbeck‚ÄìL√ºneburg railway. * The first Eurasian transcontinental railroad was the Trans-Siberian railway (with connecting lines in Europe), completed in 1905 which connects Moscow with Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. There are two connections from this line to China. It is the world's longest rail line at long. This line connects the European railroad system with China, Mongolia and Korea. Since the former Soviet countries and Mongolia use a broader gauge, a break of gauge is necessary either at the eastern frontiers of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania or the Chinese border. In spite of this there are through services of passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing or through coaches from Berlin to Novosibirsk. Almost every major town along the Trans-Siberian railway has its own return service to Moscow. * A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with China via Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. This route imposes a break of gauge at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a train ferry in eastern Turkey across Lake Van. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the Marmaray undersea tunnel, before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in Kazakhstan. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.Railway Gazette International month=October year=2010 page=63 (with map) Asia * The Trans-Asian Railway is a project to link Singapore to Istanbul and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in Myanmar. The project has also linking corridors to China, the central Asian states, and Russia. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, , , and , though this problem may be lessened with the use of variable gauge axle systems such as the SUW 2000. * The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by Kazakhstan Temir Zholy will connect China and Europe with standard gauge . Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western Kazakhstan, south through Turkmenistan to Iran, then to Turkey and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either Belarus or Ukraine. * The Baghdad Railway connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad. Australia =East-west= *Australia's east‚Äìwest transcontinental rail corridor, consisting of lines built to three different track gauges, was completed in 1917, when the Trans-Australian Railway was opened between Port Augusta, South Australia and Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. This line, built by the federal government as a federation commitment, filled the last gap in the lines between the mainland state capitals of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Passengers and freight alike suffered from time-consuming breaks of gauge: a Perth‚ÄìBrisbane journey at that time involved two standard gauge 1435 mm (4 ft 8 in) lines, a broad gauge 1600 mm (5 ft 3 in) line, and three of 1067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge. *In the 1940s and 1960s, steps were taken to progressively reduce the huge inefficiencies caused by the numerous historically imposed breaks of gauge by linking the mainland capital cities with lines all of standard gauge. *In 1970, the route across the continent was completed to standard gauge and a new, all-through passenger train, the Indian Pacific was inaugurated. *An east‚Äìwest transcontinental line across northern Australia from the Pilbara to the east coast ‚Äì more than 1000 km (600 mi) north of the Sydney‚ÄìPerth rail corridor ‚Äì was proposed in 2006 by Project Iron Boomerang to connect iron ore mining in the Pilbara and coal mining in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, with steel manufacturing plants at both ends. =North‚Äìsouth= * The north‚Äìsouth transcontinental rail corridor opened in 2004, when a final, 2248 km (1397 mi), line between Tacoola and Darwin was completed. The length of the corridor is 2975 km (1849 mi). Following 126 years of freight and passengers alike having to be transferred between trains on tracks of different gauges, the corridor is now entirely 1435 mm (4 ft 8 in) standard gauge. It is an important line for freight. An upmarket tourist passenger train, The Ghan, makes the journey once a week in each direction, but there is no intermediate passenger traffic. * In 2006, proposals for new lines in Queensland that would carry both intrastate coal traffic and interstate freight traffic envisaged standard gauge lines penetrating the state in considerable stretches for the first time.ARHS Digest September 2006 * A standard gauge Inland Railway, under construction as of 2020, is planned to extend from Melbourne to Cairns. Africa =East-west= * There are several ways to cross Africa transcontinentally via connecting east‚Äìwest railways. One is the Benguela railway, completed in 1929. It starts in Lobito, Angola and connects through Katanga to the Zambia railways system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: Dar es Salaam in Tanzania through the TAZARA, and, through Zimbabwe, Beira and Maputo in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west‚Äìeast corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in Namibia, either Walvis Bay or Luderitz to the South African rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the Indian Ocean ( i.e. Durban, Maputo). * A 1015 km gap in the east‚Äìwest line between Kinshasa and Ilebo filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.Afdb.org * There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including TransAfricaRail. * In 2010 a proposal sought to link Dakar to Port Sudan. Thirteen countries would be on the main route; another six would be served by branches. =North- south= * A north-south transcontinental railway had been proposed by Cecil Rhodes: the Cape-Cairo railway. This system was seen as the backbone for the African possessions of the British Empire, and was not completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from Algiers or Dakar to Abidjan was abandoned after the Fashoda incident. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges. * An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways. * Libya has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to Nigeria which would connect with the proposed AfricaRail network. =African Union of Railways= * The African Union of Railways has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the Dakar-Port Sudan Railway.

Biography  Dumont was born in Cambrai, Nord, in the north of France. His father was a professor in agriculture and his grandfather was a farmer. He graduated from the INA P-G, as an engineer in agronomy. First sent to Vietnam (1929) at the end of his studies, he was disgusted by colonialism and returned to Paris to spend most of his career as a professor of agricultural sciences (1933‚Äì74). Ren√© Dumont started his career as a promoter of the use of chemical fertilizers and mechanisation. He wrote articles in La Terre Fran√ßaise (P√©tainist weekly journal), favoring agricultural corporatism. However, he was one of the first to denounce damages from the Green Revolution (\\"R√©volution Verte\\") and to fight agricultural productivism. He was an expert with the United Nations and FAO, and wrote about 30 books. He traveled widely and had a good understanding of farming issues in underdeveloped countries. He advocated: * demographic control * energy savings * international cooperation to help poor nations * soil quality preservation and remediation He considered development not to be so much a question of money, fertilizer, or seeds, but a careful balance of the three. He advocated relations between humans and their fields that relied foremost on relations between humans themselves, social relationships being the basis for proper agricultural and industrial development. Finally, he believed the basis for good social relationships between humans was good relationships between men and women, thus arguing demographic control relied on female emancipation. Ahead of his time, the most famous French agronomist, well known for his red-pullover, surprised French people by showing on TV an apple and a glass of water, telling them how precious these natural resources were, and predicting the future price of oil. Dumont was one of the first to explain the consequences of what was to be called globalization, demographic explosion, productivism, pollution, shantytowns, malnutrition, rift between northern and southern countries. He was also one of the first to use the term \\"d√©veloppement durable\\" (sustainable development). He ran for President in 1974 as the first ecologist candidate, and won 1.32% of the votes. His campaign director was Brice Lalonde. That election opened the way to political ecology. The French political ecology was founded by Dumont and is under-developed countries oriented, against war, against capitalism and for solidarity. Some consider it not sufficiently rooted in deep ecology. Dumont is considered to be the forefather of the French Green Party. In a statement, France's Green Party called Dumont \\"the man who made it possible to bring environmental policies in a direct and natural manner into the political world\\". He wrote a best-selling book, L‚ÄôAfrique noire est mal partie (1962). Dumont was a founding member of ATTAC.

The most common purpose of a ring road is to assist in reducing traffic volumes in the urban centre, such as by offering an alternate route around the city for drivers who do not need to stop in the city core. Nomenclature Third Ring Road in the area of the Moscow International Business Center. The name \\"ring road\\" is used for the majority of metropolitan circumferential routes in the European Union, such as the Berliner Ring, the Brussels Ring, the Amsterdam Ring, the Boulevard P√©riph√©rique around Paris and the Leeds Inner and Outer ring roads. Australia, Pakistan and India also use the term ring road, as in Melbourne's Western Ring Road, Lahore's Lahore Ring Road and Hyderabad's Outer Ring Road. In Canada the term is the most commonly used, with \\"orbital\\" also used, but to a much lesser extent. In Europe, some ring roads, particularly those of motorway standard which are longer in length, are often known as \\"orbital motorways\\". Examples include the London Orbital (188 km) and Rome Orbital (68 km). In the United States, many ring roads are called beltlines, beltways, or loops, such as the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C. Some ring roads, such as Washington's Capital Beltway, use \\"Inner Loop\\" and \\"Outer Loop\\" terminology for directions of travel, since cardinal (compass) directions cannot be signed uniformly around the entire loop. The term 'ring road' is occasionally ‚Äì and inaccurately ‚Äì used interchangeably with the term 'bypass'. Background The Sydney Orbital Network, New South Wales, Australia Bypasses around many large and small towns were built in many areas when many old roads were upgraded to four-lane status in the 1930s to 1950s, such as those along the Old National Road (now generally U.S. 40 or Interstate 70) in the United States, leaving the old road in place to serve the town or city, but allowing through travelers to continue on a wider, faster, and safer route. Construction of fully circumferential ring roads has generally occurred more recently, beginning in the 1960s in many areas, when the U.S. Interstate Highway System and similar-quality roads elsewhere were designed. Ring roads have now been built around numerous cities and metropolitan areas, including cities with multiple ring roads, irregularly shaped ring roads, and ring roads made up of various other long-distance roads. London has three ringroads (the London Orbital, the North and South Circular routes, and the Inner Ring Road). Other British cities have two (Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Norwich and Glasgow). Columbus, OH and San Antonio, TX, in the United States, also has two, while Houston, Texas will have three official ring roads (not including the downtown freeway loop). Some cities have far more Beijing, for example, has six ring roads, simply numbered in increasing order from the city center (though skipping #1), while Moscow has five, three innermost (Central Squares of Moscow, Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring) corresponding to the concentric lines of fortifications around the ancient city, and the two outermost (MKAD and Third Ring) built in the twentieth century, though, confusingly, the Third Ring was built last. Geographical constraints can complicate the construction of a complete ring road. For example, the Baltimore Beltway in Maryland crosses Baltimore Harbor on a high arch bridge, and much of the partially completed Stockholm Ring Road in Sweden runs through tunnels or over long bridges. Some towns or cities on seacoasts or near rugged mountains cannot have a full ring road, such as Dublin's ring road; or, in the US, Interstate 287, mostly in New Jersey (bypassing New York City), or Interstate 495 around Boston, none of which completely circles these seaport cities. In other cases, adjacency of international boundaries may prevent ring road completion. Construction of a true ring road around Detroit is effectively blocked by its location on the border with Canada; although constructing a route mostly or entirely outside city limits is technically feasible, a true ring around Detroit would necessarily pass through Canada, and so Interstate 275 and Interstate 696 together bypass but do not encircle the city. Sometimes, the presence of significant natural or historical areas limits route options, as for the long-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C., where options for a new western Potomac River crossing are limited by a nearly continuous corridor of heavily visited scenic, natural, and historical landscapes in the Potomac River Gorge and adjacent areas. When referring to a road encircling a capital city, the term \\"beltway\\" can also have a political connotation, as in the American term \\"Inside the Beltway\\", derived metonymically from the Capital Beltway encircling Washington, D.C. Examples of ring roads The Leeds Inner Ring Road in England was built in a series of tunnels to save space and avoid physically separating the city's centre from its suburbs. Sardar Patel Ring Road, Ahmedabad Most orbital motorways (or beltways) are purpose-built major highways around a town or city, typically without either signals or road or railroad crossings. In the United States, beltways are commonly parts of the Interstate Highway System. Similar roads in the United Kingdom are often called \\"orbital motorways\\". Although the terms \\"ring road\\" and \\"orbital motorway\\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \\"ring road\\" often indicates a circumferential route formed from one or more existing roads within a city or town, with the standard of road being anything from an ordinary city street up to motorway level. An excellent example of this is London's North Circular/South Circular ring road. In some cases, a circumferential route is formed by the combination of a major through highway and a similar-quality loop route that extends out from the parent road, later reconnecting with the same highway. Such loops not only function as a bypass for through traffic, but also to serve outlying suburbs. In the United States, an Interstate highway loop is usually designated by a three-digit number beginning with an even digit before the two-digit number of its parent interstate. Interstate spurs, on the other hand, generally have three-digit numbers beginning with an odd digit. =United States= I-275 passing through Sharonville (suburb of Cincinnati, OH) Circumferential highways are prominent features in or near many large cities in the United States. In many cases, such as Interstate 285 (also known as the Perimeter) in Atlanta, Georgia, circumferential highways serve as a bypass while other highways pass directly through the city center. In other cases, a primary Interstate highway passes around a city on one side, with a connecting loop Interstate bypassing the city on the other side, together forming a circumferential route, as with I-93 and I-495 in the area of Lawrence, Massachusetts. However, if a primary Interstate passes through a city and a loop bypasses it on only one side (as in the Wilmington, Delaware, area), no fully circumferential route is provided. Route numbering is challenging when a through highway and a loop bypass together form a circumferential ring road. Since neither of the highways involved is circumferential itself, either dual signage or two (or more) route numbers is needed. The history of signage on the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C., is instructive here. Interstate 95, a major through highway along the U.S. East Coast, was originally planned as a through-the-city route there, with the Beltway encircling the city as I-495. The portion of I-95 entering the city from the south was soon completed (and so signed), primarily by adapting an existing major highway, but the planned extension of I-95 through residential areas northward to the Beltway was long delayed, and eventually abandoned, leaving the eastern portion of the Beltway as the best Interstate-quality route for through traffic. This eastern portion of the Beltway was then redesignated from I-495 to I-95, leaving the I-495 designation only on the western portion, and the completed part of the planned Interstate inside the Beltway was redesignated as a spur, I-395. A few years later, the resulting confusion from different route numbers on the circumferential Beltway was resolved by restoring I-495 signage for the entire Beltway, with dual signage for I-95 for the highway's concurrent use as a through Interstate on its eastern portion. The longest complete beltway in the United States is Sam Houston Tollway, a loop in Texas that forms a complete beltway around the Metro Houston area.

A designated example is the Capital Beltway around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania using Interstate 81, Interstate 83, and Pennsylvania Route 581. =Canada= The Anthony Henday Drive ring road in Edmonton Edmonton, Alberta has two ring roads. The first is a loose conglomeration of four major arterial roads with an average distance of 6 km (4 mi) from the downtown core. Yellowhead Trail forms the northern section, Wayne Gretzky Drive/75 Street forms the eastern section, Whitemud Drive forms the southern and longest section, and 170 Street forms the western and shortest section. Whitemud Drive is the only section that is a true controlled-access highway, while Yellowhead Trail and Wayne Gretzky Drive have interchanges and intersections and are therefore both limited-access roads. 170 Street and 75 Street are merely large arterial roads with intersections only. The second and more prominent ring road is named Anthony Henday Drive; it circles the city at an average distance of from the downtown core. It is a freeway for its entire length, and was built to reduce inner-city traffic congestion, created a bypass of Yellowhead Trail, and has improved the movement of goods and services across Edmonton and the surrounding areas. It was completed in October 2016 as the first free-flowing orbital road in Canada. Stoney Trail is a ring road that circles the majority of Calgary. The southwest portion of the freeway is currently under construction. Winnipeg, Manitoba has a ring road which is called the Perimeter Highway. It is designated as Manitoba Highway 101 on the north, northwest and east sides and as Manitoba Highway 100 on the south and southwest sides. The majority of it is a four-lane divided expressway. It has a second ring road, planned since the 1950s and not yet completed, called the Suburban Beltway. It consists of several roads  Lagimodiere Blvd., Bishop Grandin Blvd., the Fort Garry Bridge, the Moray Bridge, William R Clement Parkway, Chief Peguis Trail and the Kildonan Bridge. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has a ring road named Circle Drive. It is designated as Saskatchewan Highway 16 on the east and north, and as Saskatchewan Highway 11 on the south, and simply as Circle Drive on the west. Regina, Saskatchewan has a partial ring road which is named Ring Road; however, due to the city's urban growth since the road was originally constructed, it no longer functions as a true ring road and has instead come to be used partially for local arterial traffic. A new outer ring, the Regina Bypass, is under construction. Sudbury, Ontario has a partial ring road consisting of the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses segment of Ontario Highway 17, and the Northwest Bypass segment of Ontario Highway 144. =Europe= Vienna's Ring Road with the opera house, in 1905 Most major cities in Europe are served by a ring road that either circles the inner core of their metropolitan areas or the outer borders of the city proper or both. In major transit hubs, such as the √éle-de-France region surrounding Paris and the Frankfurt area, major national highways converge just outside city limits before forming one of several routes of an urban network of roads circling the city. Unlike in United States, route numbering is not a challenge on European ring roads as routes merge to form the single designated road. However, exit and road junction access can be challenging due to the complexity of other routes branching from or into the ring road. One of the most renowned ring roads is the Vienna Ring Road (Ringstra√üe), a grand boulevard constructed in the mid-19th century and filled with representative buildings. Due to its unique architectural beauty and history, it has also been called the \\"Lord of the ring roads\\", and is declared by UNESCO as part of Vienna's World Heritage Site.

Vietnamization was intended to reduce American losses in Vietnam, and thus reduce the domestic pressure for a total withdrawal of American forces. Nixon's aim in Vietnam is to force a Korean War-type armistice, which requires that the war go on until Hanoi agreed to the American terms while at the same time forcing Nixon to deflect pressure from domestic anti-war protests. With the same aim of achieving an armistice that would allow South Vietnam to continue to exist, Nixon begins a policy of seeking better relations with the Soviet Union and China, hoping those two states would reduce, if not end their arm supplies to North Vietnam in return for better relations with Washington, and thus forcing Hanoi to accept peace on American terms. :‚Äî February Following the success of the first \\"accelerated pacification\\" and the Phoenix Program of \\"neutralizing\\" (i.e. assassinating) Viet Cong operatives, Nixon applies strong pressure for more \\"accelerated pacification\\" campaigns and the Phoenix Program killings in South Vietnam as a part of the effort at breaking the Viet Cong. For Nixon, \\"accelerated pacification\\" and the Phoenix Program killings both have the effect of weakening the Viet Cong without the use of American troops, which serves to achieve both his aims of reducing American forces and applying pressure for the Vietnamese Communists to accept peace on American terms. :‚Äî March 8 President Nasser of Egypt launches the War of Attrition against Israel. The US supports Israel while the Soviet Union supports Egypt. :‚Äî July 25 Nixon announces the Nixon Doctrine in which Nixon warns that the United States will not go to any lengths to defend its allies, especially in Asia, and henceforth American allies must do more for their own defense. The doctrine is especially aimed at South Vietnam and is intended to pressure the South Vietnamese government to do a more effective job of fighting the Communists. :‚Äî July Nixon visits Pakistan and meets with the Pakistani President General Agha Yahya Khan, tells him that he wants to use Pakistan as an intermediary for talks with China. Yahya Khan agrees to Nixon's request. :‚Äî September 9 Walter Stoessel, the American ambassador to Poland is ordered by Nixon to make contacts with Chinese diplomats in an informal way. :‚Äî October 16 Pakistani ambassador to the United States Agha Hilaly tells Kissinger that President Yahya is going to visit China early the next year, and is there any message that Kissinger would like Yahya to pass on to Mao. :‚Äî November 3 Nixon gives a TV speech claiming that there was a \\"silent majority\\" supporting his Vietnam policies, states that he needs some more time for his policies to work, denounces anti-war protestors as a threat to world peace, and asks for the support of the \\"silent majority\\" to help him \\"to end the war in a way that we could win the peace.\\" *1970 :‚Äî February 23 Hilaly tells Kissinger that after Yahya's visit to Beijing that the Chinese were interested in the American offer, but did not want to negotiate from a position of weakness. :‚Äî March Under the \\"accelerated pacification\\", more than million hectares of land have been redistributed in American-encouraged land reform in South Vietnam. :‚Äî March 7 Chiang Kai-shek who has heard reports of Sino- American talks in Warsaw writes to Nixon to protest. :‚Äî April 29 Nixon orders the Cambodian Incursion. American and South Vietnamese force invade eastern provinces of Cambodia with the aim of clearing out the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese forces based there. Sparks much protest in the United States. :‚Äî June By this point in the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt, there are regular clashes occurring between Israel and Soviet forces in Egypt, leading to fears that this might cause a world war, which in turn leads to strong pressure for a ceasefire. :‚Äî October 25 During a Pakistani-American summit, President Nixon asks President Yahya to pass on another message to Beijing about the American wish for rapprochement with China. :‚Äî October 31 Kissinger meets with Romanian President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and asks him to pass on a message to China that the US wishes for a normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China. *1971 :‚Äî January 12 Corneliu Bogdan, the Romanian ambassador to the US tells Kissinger that Ceau»ôescu has passed on the American message, and that for Mao, normalization would be possible if the US would end the \\"occupation\\" of Taiwan as Mao calls American support for Taiwan. This poses a major problem for Nixon as allow China to take Taiwan would greatly damage America's image and pose domestic problems. :‚Äî March 4 Nixon gives press conference, and warns that better Sino-American relations cannot come at the expense of Taiwan. :‚Äî March 26 Pakistan launches Operation Searchlight intended by President Agha Yahya Khan to crush the Awami League in East Pakistan, and to eliminate the intelligentsia, political class and Hindu minority of East Pakistan. As General Yahya is a key conduit in the talks between the US and China, the Nixon administration does not protest Operation Searchlight as it fears this might offend General Yahya, as part of its marked \\"tilt\\" towards Pakistan. :‚Äî April 6 The Blood telegram sent by Archer Blood, the American consul in Dhaka and 20 other diplomats protesting the Nixon administration's silence about the Pakistani government's repression in East Pakistan and what the telegram argues is a campaign of genocide by the government against the Hindu minority in East Pakistan. The Blood telegram does not affect American policy towards Pakistan, and effectively cuts the career of Blood and the other diplomats. :‚Äî April 14 Ping-pong diplomacy. The American table tennis team is allowed to visit China, causes a sensation. During a phone conversation, Kissinger says \\"It's a tragedy that it has to happen to Chiang at the end of his life but we have to be cold about it\\", to which Nixon replies \\"We have to do what's best for us\\". :‚Äî April 21 Pakistani President Yahya informs Nixon that he had spoken with Zhou Enlai, and that the Chinese wished for a senior American envoy to make a secret visit to Beijing. :‚Äî April 27 About the Chinese offer of a secret American envoy to visit Beijing, Kissinger tells Nixon that \\"If we get this thing working, we will end Vietnam this year.\\" :‚Äî July 9 Kissinger visits Islamabad, Pakistan, and from there goes on to a secret trip to Beijing to meet Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong. During the secret summit in Beijing, it is agreed that President Nixon will visit China the next year. :‚Äî December 3 Indo-Pakistani war begins. The US supports Pakistan while the Soviet Union supports India. :‚Äî December 11 Nixon orders Task Force 74 to the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India into accepting a ceasefire before the Indians defeat Pakistan. :‚Äî December 16 The war ends in Pakistan's defeat.

Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical geotropic orientation of the hymenophore needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the basidiospores are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of Lentinus tigrinus)‚Äînote‚Äîsome mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost ballistospory. Explanation of secotioid development and gasteromycetation Historically agarics and boletes (which bear their spores on a hymenium of gills or tubes respectively) were classified quite separately from the gasteroid fungi, such as puff-balls and truffles, of which the spores are formed in a large mass enclosed in an outer skin. However, in spite of this apparently very great difference in form, recent mycological research, both at microscopic and molecular level has shown that sometimes species of open mushrooms are much more closely related to particular species of gasteroid fungi than they are to each other. Fungi which do not open up to let their spores be dispersed in the air, but which show a clear morphological relation to agarics or boletes, constitute an intermediate form and are called secotioid. The word is derived from the name of the genus Secotium, which contains such species. On a microscopic scale, secotioid fungi do not expel their spores forcibly from the basidium; their spores are \\"statismospores\\". Like gasteroid fungi, secotioid species rely on animals such as rodents or insects to distribute their spores. It can at times be disadvantageous for a mushroom to open up and free its spores in the usual way. If this development is aborted, a secotioid form arises, perhaps to be followed eventually by an evolutionary progression to a fully gasteroid form. This type of progression is called gasteromycetation and seems to have happened several times independently starting from various genera of \\"normal\\" mushrooms. This means that the secotioid and also the gasteroid fungi are polyphyletic. According to the paper by Thiers, in certain climates and certain seasons, it may be an advantage to remain closed, because moisture can be conserved in that way. Cross-section of Hymenogaster tener For example, the gasteroid genus Hymenogaster has been shown to be closely related to agaric genera such as Hebeloma, which were formerly placed in family Cortinariaceae or Strophariaceae. This is found by DNA analysis and also indicated on a microscopic scale by the resemblance of the spores and basidia. According to a current classification system, Hebeloma now belongs to family Hymenogastraceae, and is considered more narrowly related to the closed Hymenogaster fungi than, for instance, to the ordinary mushrooms in genus Cortinarius. A similar case is the well-known \\"Deceiver\\" mushroom Laccaria laccata which is now classified in the Hydnangiaceae, Hydnangium being a gastroid genus. It has been found that a change in a single locus of a gene of the gilled mushroom Lentinus tigrinus causes it to have a closed fruiting body. This suggests that the emergence of a secotioid species may not require many mutations. There is a spectrum of secotioid species ranging from the open form to the closed form in the following respects: *there may be an evident stipe, or there may be only a remnant consisting of a column of non-fertile tissue, *if there is a stipe the edge of the cap may separate from it (partially opening), or may not, *there may be recognizable gills (though oriented in all directions and very convoluted), or the fertile interior may be uniform like the gleba of gasteroid fungi, and *the spore-bearing tissue may be above ground (epigeous), or underground (hypogeous), or partly buried. The adjective \\"sequestrate\\" is sometimes used as a general term to mean \\"either secotioid or gasteroid\\". Examples Cortinarius is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as C. leucocephalus, C. coneae and C. cartilagineus. Pholiota nubigena Pholiota nubigena is a secotioid species found early in the year at high altitude in the western United States. It was originally assigned to Secotium and later to a more specific secotioid genus Nivatogastrium, but in fact it is closely allied to Pholiota squarrosa and it has now been moved to genus Pholiota itself, although the latter consists primarily of agarics.{ Gastroboletus is a secotioid bolete genus where the fruiting bodies may or may not open, but in any case the tubes are not aligned vertically as in a true bolete. Agaricus deserticola Agaricus deserticola is a secotioid species of Agaricus (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus Secotium. Similarly, Agaricus inapertus was formerly known as Endoptychum depressum until molecular analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with Agaricus.

He is famous for the miraculous nature of his election, in which a dove is said to have descended on his head to mark him as the Holy Spirit's unexpected choice to become the next pope. He was succeeded by Cornelius. Most of his papacy was characterized by amicable relations with the imperial government, and Fabian could thus bring back to Rome for Christian burial the bodies of Pope Pontian and the antipope Hippolytus, both of whom had died in exile in the Sardinian mines. It was also probably during his reign that the schism between the two corresponding Roman congregations of these leaders was ended. He was highly esteemed by Cyprian;Cyprian's letter to Fabian's successor Pope Cornelius (Cyprian, Epistle 30) calls him \\"incomparable\\" and says that the glory of his martyrdom answered the purity and holiness of his life. Novatian refers to his nobilissima memoriae, and he corresponded with Origen. One authority refers to him as Flavian. The Liber Pontificalis, a fourth-century document that survives in later copies, says that he divided Rome into diaconates and appointed secretaries to collect the records of the martyrs. He is also said, probably without basis, to have baptized the emperor Philip the Arab and his son. More plausible is the report in the Liberian Catalogue that he sent out seven \\"apostles to the Gauls\\" as missionaries. He died a martyr at the beginning of the Decian persecution and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. Fabian's feast day is commemorated on 20 January, the same as Saint Sebastian,Gross, Ernie. This Day in Religion. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers. in whose church his sepulcher lies in Rome. Early life and accession According to the Liber Pontificalis, Fabian was a noble Roman by birth, and his father's name was Fabius. Nothing more is known about his background. The legend concerning the circumstances of his election is preserved by the fourth-century writer Eusebius of Caesarea (Church History, VI. 29).Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. The Penguin Dictionary of Saints. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. . After the short reign of Pope Anterus, Fabian had come to Rome from the countryside when the new papal election began. \\"Although present,\\" says Eusebius, Fabian \\"was in the mind of none.\\" While the names of several illustrious and noble churchmen were being considered over the course of thirteen days, a dove suddenly descended upon the head of Fabian. To the assembled electors, this strange sight recalled the gospel scene of the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at the time of his baptism by John the Baptist. The congregation took this as a sign that he was marked out for this dignity, and Fabian was at once proclaimed bishop by acclamation. Papacy During Fabian's reign of 14 years, there was a lull in the storm of persecution which had resulted in the exile of both Anterus' predecessor Pontian and the antipope (and later saint) Hippolytus. Fabian had enough influence at court to effect the return of the bodies of both of these martyrs from Sardinia, where they had died at hard labor in the mines. The report that he baptized the emperor Philip the Arab and his son, however, is probably a legend, although he did seem to enjoy some connections at court, since the bodies of Pontian and Hippolytus could not have been exhumed without the emperor's approval. According to the sixth-century historian Gregory of ToursGregory, Historia Francorum I ¬ß30, giving as his source the Martyrdom of Saturnin. Fabian sent out the \\"apostles to the Gauls\\" to Christianise Gaul in A.D. 245. Fabian sent seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatianus of Tours to Tours, Trophimus of Arles to Arles, Paul of Narbonne to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. He also condemned Privatus, the originator of a new heresy in Africa. Fabian with Saint Sebastian: the feast of both of these saints' is celebrated on 20 January. The Liber Pontificalis says that Fabian divided the Christian communities of Rome into seven districts, each supervised by a deacon. Eusebius (VI ¬ß43) adds that he appointed seven subdeacons to help collect the acta of the martyrs‚Äîthe reports of the court proceedings on the occasion of their trials. There is also a tradition that he instituted the four minor clerical orders: porter, lector, exorcist, and acolyte. However most scholars believe these offices evolved gradually and were formally instituted at a later date. His deeds are thus described in the Liber Pontificalis: > Hic regiones dividit diaconibus et fecit vii subdiacones, qui vii notariis > imminerent, Ut gestas martyrum integro fideliter colligerent, et multas > fabricas per cymiteria fieri praecepit. (\\"He divided the regiones into > deaconships and made seven sub-deaconships which seven secretaries oversaw, > so that they brought together the deeds of the martyrs faithfully made > whole, and he brought forth many works in the cemeteries.\\") The Liberian Catalogue of the popes also reports that Fabian initiated considerable work on the catacombs, where honored Christians were buried, and where he also caused the body of Pope Pontian to be entombed at the catacomb of Callixtus. With the advent of Emperor Decius, the Roman government's tolerant policy toward Christianity temporarily ended. Decius ordered everyone in the Empire, with the exception of Jews, to demonstrate their loyalty to Rome by offering incense to the cult images of deities which represented the Roman state. This was unacceptable to many Christians, who, while no longer holding most of the laws of the Old Testament to apply to them, took the commandment against idolatry with deadly seriousness. Fabian was thus one of the earliest victims of Decius, dying as a martyr on 20 January 250, at the beginning of the Decian persecution, probably in prison rather than by execution. Fabian was buried in the catacomb of Callixtus in Rome. The Greek inscription on his tomb has survived, and bears the words: His remains were later reinterred at San Sebastiano fuori le mura by Pope Clement XI where the Albani Chapel is dedicated in his honour. The Coptic Orthodox Church teaches that Fabianus was martyred twice in the same week.

Like a bullet, this ammunition does not contain explosives and uses kinetic energy to penetrate the target. Modern KEP munitions are typically of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) type.  History  APFSDS-T round Early cannons fired kinetic energy ammunition, initially consisting of round balls of worked stone and later of round balls of metal. From the beginning, combining high muzzle energy with projectile density and hardness have been the foremost factors in the design of such weapons. Similarly, the foremost purpose of such weapons has generally been to defeat armour or other defensive structures, whether stone castle walls, ship timbers, or modern tank armour. Kinetic energy ammunition, in its various forms, has consistently been the choice for those weapons due to the need for high muzzle energy. The development of the modern KE penetrator combines two aspects of artillery design: high muzzle velocity and concentrated force. High muzzle velocity is achieved by using a projectile with a low mass and large base area in the gun barrel. Firing a small-diameter projectile wrapped in a lightweight outer shell, called a sabot, raises the muzzle velocity. Once the shell clears the barrel, the sabot is no longer needed and falls off in pieces. This leaves the projectile traveling at high velocity with a smaller cross-sectional area and reduced aerodynamic drag during the flight to the target (see external ballistics and terminal ballistics). Germany developed modern sabots under the name \\"treibspiegel\\" (\\"thrust mirror\\") to give extra altitude to its anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War. Before this, primitive wooden sabots had been used for centuries in the form of a wooden plug attached to or breech loaded before cannonballs in the barrel, placed between the propellant charge and the projectile. The name \\"sabot\\" (pronounced in English usage)Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2007) 6th Ed. p. 2641 is the French word for clog (a wooden shoe traditionally worn in some European countries). Concentration of force into a smaller area was initially attained by replacing the single metal (usually steel) shot with a composite shot using two metals, a heavy core (based on tungsten) inside a lighter metal outer shell. These designs were known as armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) by the British, high-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) by the US, and hartkern (hard core) by the Germans. On impact, the core had a much more concentrated effect than plain metal shot of the same weight and size. However, the air resistance and other effects were the same as for the shell of identical size. High-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) were primarily used by tank destroyers in the US Army and were relatively uncommon as the tungsten core was expensive and prioritized for other applications. Between 1941 and 1943, the British combined the two techniques in the armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) round. The sabot replaced the outer metal shell of the APCR. While in the gun, the shot had a large base area to get maximum acceleration from the propelling charge but once outside, the sabot fell away to reveal a heavy shot with a small cross- sectional area. APDS rounds served as the primary kinetic energy weapon of most tanks during the early-Cold War period, though they suffered the primary drawback of inaccuracy. This was resolved with the introduction of the armour- piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round during the 1970s, which added stabilising fins to the penetrator, greatly increasing accuracy.  Design  The principle of the kinetic energy penetrator is that it uses its kinetic energy, which is a function of its mass and velocity, to force its way through armor. If the armor is defeated, the heat and spalling (particle spray) generated by the penetrator going through the armor, and the pressure wave that would develop, ideally destroys the target. The modern kinetic energy weapon maximizes the stress (kinetic energy divided by impact area) delivered to the target by: * maximizing the mass ‚Äì that is, using the densest metals practical, which is one of the reasons depleted uranium or tungsten carbide is often used ‚Äì and muzzle velocity of the projectile, as kinetic energy scales with the mass m and the square of the velocity v of the projectile (mv^2/2). * minimizing the width, since if the projectile does not tumble, it will hit the target face first; as most modern projectiles have circular cross-sectional areas, their impact area will scale with the square of the radius r (the impact area being \\\\pi r^2) Additionally, penetrator length plays a large role in determining the depth of penetration that it is capable of. Generally, a penetrator is incapable of penetrating more than its own length, as the sheer stress of impact and perforation ablates it. This has led to the current designs which resemble a long metal arrow. For monobloc penetrators consisting solely of one material, a perforation formula devised by Wili Odermatt and W. Lanz is able to calculate the penetration capability of an APFSDS round. In 1982, using some ideas from gas dynamics, an analytical investigations with experiments on penetration into targets led to conclusions about the efficiency of impactors (penetration is deeper) with unconventional three-dimensional shapes . The opposite technique to KE- penetrators uses chemical energy penetrators. There are two types of these shells in use: high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and high-explosive squash head (HESH). They have been widely used against armour in the past and still have a role but are less effective against modern composite armour, such as Chobham as used on main battle tanks today. Main battle tanks usually use KE- penetrators, while HEAT is mainly found in missile systems that are shoulder- launched or vehicle-mounted, and HESH is usually favored for fortification demolition.

He is a leading expert in splittings and accessibility of discrete groups, groups acting on graphs and trees, JSJ-decompositions, the topology of 3-manifolds and the structure of their fundamental groups. Since 1971 several mathematicians have been working on Wall's conjecture, posed by Wall in a 1971 paper,Wall, C. T. C., Pairs of relative cohomological dimension one. Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 1 (1971), no. 2, pp. 141-154 which said that all finitely generated groups are accessible. Roughly, this means that every finitely generated group can be constructed from finite and one-ended groups via a finite number of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions over finite subgroups. In view of the Stallings theorem about ends of groups, one-ended groups are precisely those finitely generated infinite groups that cannot be decomposed nontrivially as amalgamated products or HNN-extensions over finite subgroups. Dunwoody proved the Wall conjecture for finitely presented groups in 1985.Dunwoody, M. J., The accessibility of finitely presented groups.

In the plate, the parallel wave propagates slightly slower than the perpendicular one. At the far side of the plate, the parallel wave is exactly half of a wavelength delayed relative to the perpendicular wave, and the resulting combination is a mirror-image of the entry polarization state (relative to the optic axis). A waveplate or retarder is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate can be used to produce elliptical polarization as well. Waveplates are constructed out of a birefringent material (such as quartz or mica, or even plastic), for which the index of refraction is different for light linearly polarized along one or the other of two certain perpendicular crystal axes. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, whether it is a half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization. A common use of waveplates‚Äîparticularly the sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates‚Äîis in optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections. This alignment can allow discrimination between minerals which otherwise appear very similar in plane polarized and cross polarized light.  Principles of operation  A wave in a uniaxial crystal will separate in two components, one parallel and one perpendicular to the optic axis, that will accumulate phase at different rates. This can be used to manipulate the polarization state of the wave. A waveplate mounted in a rotary mount A waveplate works by shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with the orientation of the cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, the polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne < no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For ne > no the situation is reversed. Depending on the thickness of the crystal, light with polarization components along both axes will emerge in a different polarization state. The waveplate is characterized by the amount of relative phase, Œì, that it imparts on the two components, which is related to the birefringence Œîn and the thickness L of the crystal by the formula :\\\\Gamma = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi\\\\, \\\\Delta n\\\\, L}{\\\\lambda_0}, where Œª0 is the vacuum wavelength of the light. Waveplates in general as well as polarizers can be described using the Jones matrix formalism, which uses a vector to represent the polarization state of light and a matrix to represent the linear transformation of a waveplate or polarizer. Although the birefringence Œîn may vary slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible compared to the variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (Œª0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured to work for a particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one- fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate. For a single waveplate changing the wavelength of the light introduces a linear error in the phase. Tilt of the waveplate enters via a factor of 1/cos Œ∏ (where Œ∏ is the angle of tilt) into the path length and thus only quadratically into the phase. For the extraordinary polarization the tilt also changes the refractive index to the ordinary via a factor of cos Œ∏, so combined with the path length, the phase shift for the extraordinary light due to tilt is zero. A polarization-independent phase shift of zero order needs a plate with thickness of one wavelength. For calcite the refractive index changes in the first decimal place, so that a true zero order plate is ten times as thick as one wavelength. For quartz and magnesium fluoride the refractive index changes in the second decimal place and true zero order plates are common for wavelengths above 1 Œºm.  Plate types  = Half-wave plate = A wave passing through a half-wave plate. For a half-wave plate, the relationship between L, Œîn, and Œª0 is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Œì = œÄ. Now suppose a linearly polarized wave with polarization vector \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p} is incident on the crystal. Let Œ∏ denote the angle between \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} is the vector along the waveplate's fast axis. Let z denote the propagation axis of the wave. The electric field of the incident wave is :\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)} = E\\\\, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)} = E (\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} + \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s})\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s} lies along the waveplate's slow axis. The effect of the half-wave plate is to introduce a phase shift term eiŒì = eiœÄ = ‚àí1 between the f and s components of the wave, so that upon exiting the crystal the wave is now given by :E (\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} - \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s})\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)} = E [\\\\cos(-\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} + \\\\sin(-\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s}]\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)}. If \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p}' denotes the polarization vector of the wave exiting the waveplate, then this expression shows that the angle between \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p}' and \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} is ‚àíŒ∏. Evidently, the effect of the half-wave plate is to mirror the wave's polarization vector through the plane formed by the vectors \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat z}. For linearly polarized light, this is equivalent to saying that the effect of the half-wave plate is to rotate the polarization vector through an angle 2Œ∏; however, for elliptically polarized light the half-wave plate also has the effect of inverting the light's handedness. = Quarter-wave plate = Two waves differing by a quarter-phase shift for one axis. Creating circular polarization using a quarter-wave plate and a polarizing filter For a quarter-wave plate, the relationship between L, Œîn, and Œª0 is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Œì = œÄ/2. Now suppose a linearly polarized wave is incident on the crystal. This wave can be written as :(E_f \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} + E_s \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s})\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)}, where the f and s axes are the quarter-wave plate's fast and slow axes, respectively, the wave propagates along the z axis, and Ef and Es are real. The effect of the quarter-wave plate is to introduce a phase shift term eiŒì =eiœÄ/2 = i between the f and s components of the wave, so that upon exiting the crystal the wave is now given by :(E_f \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f} + i E_s \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s})\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)}. The wave is now elliptically polarized. If the axis of polarization of the incident wave is chosen so that it makes a 45¬∞ with the fast and slow axes of the waveplate, then Ef = Es ‚â° E, and the resulting wave upon exiting the waveplate is :E(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat f}+i\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat s})\\\\mathrm{e}^{i(kz-\\\\omega t)}, and the wave is circularly polarized. If the axis of polarization of the incident wave is chosen so that it makes a 0¬∞ with the fast or slow axes of the waveplate, then the polarization will not change, so remains linear. If the angle is in between 0¬∞ and 45¬∞ the resulting wave has an elliptical polarization. A circulating polarization can be visualized as the sum of two linear polarizations with a phase difference of 90¬∞. The output depends on the polarization of the input. Suppose polarization axes x and y parallel with the fast and slow axis of the waveplate: File:Quarter wave plate polarizaton.gif The polarization of the incoming photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and y axis. If the input polarization is parallel to the fast or slow axis, then there is no polarization of the other axis, so the output polarization is the same as the input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45¬∞ to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90¬∞ with the output of the fast axis. If not the amplitude but both sine values are displayed, then x and y combined will describe a circle. With other angles than 0¬∞ or 45¬∞ the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output will describe an ellipse. = Full-wave, or sensitive-tint plate = A full-wave plate introduces a phase difference of exactly one wavelength between the two polarization directions, for one wavelength of light. In optical mineralogy, it is common to use a full-wave plate designed for green light (wavelength = 540 nm). Linearly polarized white light which passes through the plate becomes elliptically polarized, except for 540 nm light which will remain linear. If a linear polarizer oriented perpendicular to the original polarization is added, this green wavelength is fully extinguished but elements of the other colors remain. This means that under these conditions the plate will appear an intense shade of red-violet, sometimes known as \\"sensitive tint\\". This gives rise to this plate's alternative names, the sensitive-tint plate or (less commonly) red-tint plate. These plates are widely used in mineralogy to aid in identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks. = Multiple-order vs. zero-order waveplates = A multiple-order waveplate is made from a single birefringent crystal that produces an integer multiple of the rated retardance (for example, a multiple-order half-wave plate may have an absolute retardance of 37Œª/2). By contrast, a zero-order waveplate produces exactly the specified retardance. This can be accomplished by combining two multiple-order wave plates such that the difference in their retardances yields the net (true) retardance of the waveplate. Zero-order waveplates are less sensitive to temperature and wavelength shifts, but are more expensive than multiple-order ones.  Use of waveplates in mineralogy and optical petrology  The sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates are widely used in the field of optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections. In practical terms, the plate is inserted between the perpendicular polarizers at an angle of 45 degrees. This allows two different procedures to be carried out to investigate the mineral under the crosshairs of the microscope. More simply, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation ‚Äì that is, whether the mineral is \\"length slow\\" or \\"length fast\\" ‚Äì based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as \\"2V\\") can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.

F.W. Sears, M.W. Zemansky, H.D. Young, . In beam splitters The original meaning of dichroic, from the Greek dikhroos, two-coloured, refers to any optical device which can split a beam of light into two beams with differing wavelengths. Such devices include mirrors and filters, usually treated with optical coatings, which are designed to reflect light over a certain range of wavelengths, and transmit light which is outside that range. An example is the dichroic prism, used in some camcorders, which uses several coatings to split light into red, green and blue components for recording on separate CCD arrays, however it is now more common to have a Bayer filter to filter individual pixels on a single CCD array. This kind of dichroic device does not usually depend on the polarization of the light. The term dichromatic is also used in this sense. With polarized light The second meaning of dichroic refers to the property of a material, in which light in different polarization states traveling through it experiences a different absorption coefficient; this is also known as diattenuation. When the polarization states in question are right and left-handed circular polarization, it is then known as circular dichroism. Since the left- and right-handed circular polarizations represent two spin angular momentum (SAM) states, in this case for a photon, this dichroism can also be thought of as Spin Angular Momentum Dichroism. In some crystals,, such as Tourmaline, the strength of the dichroic effect varies strongly with the wavelength of the light, making them appear to have different colours when viewed with light having differing polarizations. This is more generally referred to as pleochroism, and the technique can be used in mineralogy to identify minerals. In some materials, such as herapathite (iodoquinine sulfate) or Polaroid sheets, the effect is not strongly dependent on wavelength. =In liquid crystals= Dichroism, in the second meaning above, occurs in liquid crystals due to either the optical anisotropy of the molecular structure or the presence of impurities or the presence of dichroic dyes.

Under the name Frances Lengel, Trocchi churned out numerous pornographic books including the now classic Helen and Desire (1954) and a dirty version of his own book Young Adam (1954). Trocchi and his friends also published Samuel Beckett's War and Memory and Jean Genet's Thief‚Äôs journal in English for the first time.Cult Fiction a readers guide, Andrew Calcutt, Richard Shephard published 1998 page 275 Drug addiction Trocchi acquired his lifelong heroin addiction in Paris. He left Paris for the United States and spent time in Taos, New Mexico, before settling in New York City, where he worked on a stone scow on the Hudson River. This time is chronicled in the novel Cain's Book, which at the time became something of a sensation, being an honest study of heroin addiction with descriptions of sex and drug use that got it banned in Britain, where the book was the subject of an obscenity trial. In the United States, however, it received favorable reviews. Trocchi was then deep in the throes of heroin addiction; he even failed to attend his own launch party for Cain's Book. His wife Lyn prostituted herself on the streets of the Lower East Side. He injected himself on camera during a live television debate on drug abuse, despite being on bail at the time. He had been charged with supplying heroin to a minor, an offence then punishable by death. A jail term seemed certain, but with the help of friends (including Norman Mailer), Trocchi was smuggled over the Canada‚ÄìUS border where he was given refuge in Montreal by poet Irving Layton and met up with Leonard Cohen. His wife Lyn was arrested and son Marc detained, but later joined Trocchi in London. Later life In the late 1950s he lived in Venice, California, then the centre of the Southern California Beat scene. In October 1955, he became involved with the Lettrist International and then the Situationist International. His text \\"Invisible Insurrection of a Million Minds\\" was published in the Scottish journal New Saltire in 1962 and subsequently as \\"Technique du Coup du Monde\\" in Internationale Situationniste, number 8. It proposed an international \\"spontaneous university\\" as a cultural force and marked the beginning of his movement towards his sigma project, which played a formative part in the UK Underground. Trocchi appeared at the 1962 Edinburgh Writers Festival where he claimed \\"sodomy\\" as a basis for his writing. During the festival, Hugh MacDiarmid denounced him as \\"cosmopolitan scum.\\" However, while this incident is well known, it is little remarked upon that the two men subsequently engaged in correspondence, and actually became friends. Trocchi then moved to London, where he remained for the rest of his life. He began a new novel, The Long Book, which he did not finish. Much of his sporadic work of the 1960s was collected as The Sigma Portfolio. In March 1966 the Internationale Situationniste, issue number 10, announced \\"Upon the appearance in London of the first publications of the 'Project Sigma' initiated by Alexander Trocchi, it was mutually agreed that the SI could not involve itself in such a loose cultural venture... It is therefore no longer as a member of the SI that our friend Alexander Trocchi has since developed an activity of which we fully approve of several aspects.\\" He continued writing but published little. He opened a small book store near his Kensington home. He was known in Notting Hill as \\"Scots Alec\\". In the 1960s Trocchi lived at 4 Observatory Gardens, Kensington, London on the two top floors of a 19th-century terrace block comprising six storeys. He had two sons: Marc Alexander and Nicholas. The elder son, Marc died of cancer at age 19 in 1976, shortly after Alexander's American wife Lyn died of complications from hepatitis. He died of pneumonia in London on 15 April 1984. The final tragedy was the suicide of the younger son, Nicholas who, some years after his father's death, returned to the family's home in London and leapt from the top floor of the five-storey building to his death. When the terrace block was extensively refurbished into luxury apartments in the 1980s the number on Alexander Trocchi's house was removed. Resurgence Interest in Trocchi and his role in the avant-garde movements of the mid-20th century began to rise soon after his death. Edinburgh Review published a \\"Trocchi Number\\" in 1985 and their parent house published the biography, The Making of the Monster by Andrew Murray Scott, who had known Trocchi for four years in London and who went on to compile the anthology, Invisible Insurrection, in 1991, also for Polygon. These works were influential in bringing Trocchi back to public attention. Scott assisted the Estate in attempting to regain control of Trocchi's material and to license new editions in the UK and US and Far East, also collating and annotating all remaining manuscripts and documents in the Estate's possession. During the 1990s, various American and Scottish publishers (most notably Rebel Inc.) reissued his originally pseudonymous Olympia Press novels and a retrospective of his articles for Merlin and others, A Life in Pieces (1997), was issued in response to revived interest in his life and work by a younger generation. His early novel Young Adam was adapted into a film starring Ewan McGregor and Tilda Swinton in 2003 after several years of wrangling over finance. Tainted Love (2005) by Stewart Home contains a lengthy 'factional' meditation on Trocchi's post-literary career period in Notting Hill. In 2009 Oneworld Publications reissued Man at Leisure (1972), complete with the original introduction by William Burroughs, and in 2011 Oneworld Publications also re- released Cain's Book, with a foreword by Tom McCarthy.

It lies between Manhattan Island to its west and the borough of Queens, on Long Island, to its east. Running from the equivalent of East 46th to 85th Streets on Manhattan Island, it is about long, with a maximum width of , and a total area of . Together with Mill Rock, Roosevelt Island constitutes Manhattan's Census Tract 238, which has a land area of , and had a population of 9,520 as of the 2000 United States Census.According to the 2000 US Census, Mill Rock Island (Census Block 9000) is unpopulated. It had a population of 11,661 as of the 2010 United States Census. Lying below the Queensboro Bridge, the island cannot be accessed directly from the bridge itself. Vehicular traffic uses the Roosevelt Island Bridge to access the island from Astoria, Queens, though the island is not designed for vehicular traffic and has several areas designed as car-free zones. Several public transportation options to reach the island exist. The Roosevelt Island Tramway, the oldest urban commuter tramway in the U.S, connects the island to Manhattan Island's Upper East Side. The Roosevelt Island station carries the F and trains of the New York City Subway. The NYC Ferry also maintains a dock on the east side of the island. On-island transport is provided by the Red Bus service. The island was called ' by the Lenape and Varkens Eylandt ('Hog Island) by New Netherlanders, and during the colonial era and later as Blackwells Island. It was known as Welfare Island when it was used principally for hospitals, from 1921 to 1973. It was renamed Roosevelt Island (in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt) in 1973.\\"Memorial Park Honoring Franklin D. Roosevelt,\\" William J. vanden Heuvel, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Roosevelt Island is owned by the city but was leased to the New York State Urban Development Corporation for 99 years in 1969. Most of the residential buildings on Roosevelt Island are rental buildings. There is also a cooperative named Rivercross and a condominium building named Riverwalk. One rental building (Eastwood) has left New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, though current residents are still protected. It is now called Roosevelt Landings. There are attempts to privatize three other buildings, including the cooperative. The FDNY also maintains its Special Operations Command facility at 750 Main St. on the island. History = 17th and 18th centuries = In 1637, Dutch Governor Wouter van Twiller purchased the island, then known as Hog Island, from the Canarsie Indians., p. 29 After the English defeated the Dutch in 1666, Captain John Manning seized the island, which became known as Manning's Island, and twenty years later, Manning's son-in- law, Robert Blackwell, became the island's new owner and namesake. In 1796, Blackwell's great-grandson Jacob Blackwell constructed the Blackwell House, which is the island's oldest landmark, New York City's sixth oldest house, and one of the city's few remaining examples of 18th-century architecture. = 19th century = Through the 19th century, the island housed several hospitals and a prison. In 1828, the City of New York purchased the island for $32,000 (), and four years later, the city erected a penitentiary on the island; the Penitentiary Hospital was built to serve the needs of the prison inmates. By 1839, the New York City Lunatic Asylum opened, including the Octagon Tower, which still stands but as a residential building; it was renovated and reopened in April 2006. The asylum, which was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, at one point held 1,700 inmates, twice its designed capacity. Blackwells Island (now known as Roosevelt Island) from the East River, c. 1862 In 1852, a workhouse was built on the island to hold petty violators in 220 cells. The Smallpox Hospital, designed by James Renwick, Jr., opened in 1856, and two years later, the Asylum burned down and was rebuilt on the same site; Penitentiary Hospital was destroyed in the same fire. In 1861, prisoners completed construction of Renwick's City Hospital (renamed Charity Hospital in 1870), which served both prisoners and New York City's poorer population. In 1877, the hospital opened a School of Nursing, the fourth such training institution in the nation. During the impeachment process of New York State Supreme Court Justice George G. Barnard in 1872, the first charge that the New York City Bar Association brought against Barnard was that he discharged at least 39 prisoners from the Blackwell's Island penitentiary before their sentence was expired. In 1872, the Blackwell Island Light, a Gothic style lighthouse later added to the National Register of Historic Places, was built by convict labor on the island's northern tip under Renwick's supervision. Seventeen years later, in 1889, the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, opened. By 1895, inmates from the Asylum were being transferred to Ward's Island, and patients from the hospital there were transferred to Blackwell's Island. The Asylum was renamed Metropolitan Hospital. However, the last convicts were not moved off the island until 1935, when the penitentiary on Rikers Island opened. = 20th century = The 20th century was a time of change for the island. The Queensboro Bridge started construction in 1900 and opened in 1909; it passed over the island but did not provide direct vehicular access to it at the time. In 1921, Blackwell's Island was renamed Welfare Island after the City Hospital on the island. In 1930, a vehicular elevator to transport cars and passengers on Queensboro Bridge started to allow vehicular and trolley access to the island. In 1939, Goldwater Memorial Hospital, a chronic care facility, opened, with almost a thousand beds in 7 buildings on . Thirteen years later, Bird S. Coler Hospital, another chronic care facility, opened, and three years after the Coler Hospital's opening, Metropolitan Hospital moved to Manhattan, leaving the Lunatic Asylum buildings abandoned. The same year, 1955, the Welfare Island Bridge from Queens opened, allowing automobile and truck access to the island and the only non-aquatic means in and out of the island; the vehicular elevator to Queensboro Bridge then closed, but was not demolished until 1970. As late as August 1973, another passenger elevator ran from the Queens end of the bridge to the island. The 1889 Chapel of the Good Shepherd in modern surroundings More changes came in the latter half of the century. In 1968, the Delacorte Fountain, opposite the headquarters of the United Nations, opened. Mayor John V. Lindsay named a committee to make recommendations for the island's development in the same year. A year later, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) signed a 99-year lease for the island, and architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee created a plan for apartment buildings housing 20,000 residents. In 1973, Welfare Island was renamed Roosevelt Island in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and two years later, planning for his eponymous park, Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, started. Federal funding for redevelopment came from the New Community Act. In 1976, the Roosevelt Island Tramway opened, connecting the island directly with Manhattan, but it was eight years before the New York State legislature created the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC) to operate the tramway, with a nine-person board of directors appointed by the Governor, two suggested by the Mayor of New York City, and three of whom are residents of the island. The tramway was meant as a temporary solution to the then-lack of subway service to the island, which began in 1989 with the opening of the Roosevelt Island subway station, serving the . = 21st century = During the 21st century, the area became more gentrified. In 1998, the Blackwell Island Light was restored by an anonymous donor. In 2006, the restored Octagon Tower opened, serving as the central lobby of a two-wing, 500-unit apartment building. In 2010, the Roosevelt Island Tramway reopened after renovations. A year later, Southpoint Park opened south of Goldwater Memorial Hospital, near the island's southern end, Cornell Tech, a joint venture between Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology and Cornell University, was announced the same year. In 2012, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park was dedicated and opened to the public as a state park. Hillary Clinton officially launched her 2016 presidential campaign at Four Freedoms Park in 2015.Jamerson, Joshua. \\"Roosevelt Island Awakens to a Clinton Crowd\\", The New York Times, June 13, 2015. Accessed October 22, 2018. \\"Though the usual early-morning risers were already walking their dogs and stretching their legs as they strolled along the East River, this was not a typical Saturday on Roosevelt Island. At the southern end of the island, the residents found themselves bumping into hundreds of supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton waiting in line hours before she was expected to give the kickoff speech of her 2016 campaign for president here.... The campaign was handing out tickets to the event to people standing in a line near Four Freedoms Park, which celebrates the famous speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\" Construction of the new Cornell Tech campus began in January 2014 with the arrival of equipment on Roosevelt Island for the building of a fence around the construction site and for the demolition of the existing Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital's south campus; demolition began in March 2014, but city officials say they do not have plans to close the north campus of the hospital. The school began operations on the island in fall 2017. Architecture The Octagon interior, mid 20th century Though small, Roosevelt Island has a distinguished architectural history. It has several architecturally significant buildings and has been the site of numerous important unbuilt architectural competitions and proposals. The island's master plan, adopted by the New York State Urban Development Corporation in 1969, was developed by the firm of Philip Johnson and John Burgee. The plan divided the island into three residential communities, and it forbade the use of automobiles on the island; the plan intended for residents to park their cars in a large garage and use public transportation to get around. Another innovation was the plan's development of a 'mini-school system,' in which classrooms for the island's public intermediate school were distributed among all the residential buildings in a campus-like fashion (as opposed to being centralized in one large building). The first phase of Roosevelt Island's development was called \\"Northtown\\". It consists of four housing complexes: Westview, Island House, Rivercross, and Eastwood (also known as the WIRE buildings). Rivercross is a Mitchell-Lama co-op, while the rest of the buildings in Northtown are rentals. Eastwood, the largest apartment complex on the island, and Westview were designed by noted architect Josep Lluis Sert, then dean of Harvard Graduate School of Design. Eastwood, along with Peabody Terrace (in Cambridge, Massachusetts), is a prime example of Sert's high-rise multiple-dwelling residential buildings. It achieves efficiency by triple-loading corridors with duplex apartment units, such that elevators and public corridors are only needed every three floors. Island House and Rivercross were designed by Johansen & Bhavnani. The two developments were noteworthy for their use of pre-fabricated cladding systems. Subsequent phases of the island's development have been less innovative, architecturally. Northtown Phase II was developed by the Starrett Corporation and designed by the firm, Gruzen Samton, in a pseudo-historical post-modern style. It was completed in 1989, over a decade after Northtown. Southtown (also referred to as Riverwalk by the developers) is the third phase of the island's development. This phase, also designed by Gruzen Samton, was not started until 1998 and is still in the process of development. When complete, Southtown will have 2,000 units in nine buildings. Main Street on Roosevelt Island The Octagon, one of the island's six landmarks, was restored in April 2006, and the national landmark building is now a high-end apartment community. It also houses the largest array of solar panels on any building in New York City. When The Octagon opened its doors, many young, affluent tenants started to occupy the studios and one-, two-, and three-bedroom units; 100 of the units therein are set aside for middle-income residents. In 2006, ENYA (Emerging New York Architects) made the island's abandoned southern end the subject of one of its annual competitions. In addition to Louis Kahn's Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park at that tip, whose public dedication on October 17, 2012 was tangled in litigation, the island has also been the site of numerous other architectural speculations. Rem Koolhaas and the Office of Metropolitan Architecture proposed two projects for the Island in his book \\"Delirious New York\\": the Welfare Island Hotel and the Roosevelt Island Redevelopment Proposal (both in 1975‚Äì76). That proposal was Koolhaas's entry into a competition held for the development of Northtown Phase II. Other entrants included Peter Eisenman, Robert A. M. Stern, and Oswald Mathias Ungers. , six of the Southtown buildings, with a total of 1,200 units, have been completed. Residential development of Southtown has brought new retail businesses to Roosevelt Island, including a Starbucks and a Duane Reade. Roosevelt Island has long had a limited variety of restaurants; however, as a result of Southtown development, four new restaurantsNonno's Focacceria (opened January 2008), Fuji East (opened April 2008), Riverwalk Bar & Grill (operational 2009‚Äì2018), and Pier NYC (operational only in 2012)appeared on the West Promenade. Roosevelt Island buildings Transportation Although Roosevelt Island is located directly under the Queensboro Bridge, it is no longer directly accessible from the bridge itself. A trolley used to connect passengers from Queens and Manhattan to a stop in the middle of the bridge, where passengers took an elevator down to the island. The trolley operated from the bridge's opening in 1909 until April 7, 1957. Between 1930 and 1955, the only vehicular access to the island was provided by an elevator system in the Elevator Storehouse that transported cars and commuters between the bridge and the island. The elevator was closed to the public after the construction of the Roosevelt Island Bridge between the island and Astoria in Queens in 1955; the elevator was demolished in 1970, but a similar elevator ran from the Queensboro Bridge to the island as late as 1973. In 1976, the Roosevelt Island Tramway was constructed to provide access to Midtown Manhattan. The tram was closed from March to November 2010, during which time all of the components of the tramway, except for the tower bases, were replaced. New York City Subway access to the rest of Manhattan and to Long Island City in Queens via the IND 63rd Street Line began in 1989, but access to the rest of Queens did not start until 2001.See History of the 63rd Street Line and the articles for the 63rd Street Shuttle, B, F, and Q trains, for more information. Located more than below ground level, the Roosevelt Island station () is one of the deepest stations below sea level in the system. The BMT 60th Street Tunnel () and the IND 53rd Street Line () both pass under Roosevelt Island, without stopping, on their way between Manhattan and Queens. Roosevelt Island's residential community was not designed to support automobile traffic during its planning in the early 1970s. Automobile traffic has become common even though the northern and southern tips of the island remain car-free areas. Visitors can access the island by car over the Roosevelt Island Bridge but must park in the Motorgate Garage for overnight stays or in metered roadside spaces for short- term visits. MTA Bus's route, operating between the island and Queens, obviates the need for automobiles to some extent. However, RIOC operates the Red Bus, a free on-island shuttle bus service. The service uses easily visible bright red buses, and competes directly with the Q102 in connecting apartment buildings to the subway and tramway. Roosevelt Island has been served by NYC Ferry's Astoria route since August 2017. The ferry landing is on the east side of the island near the tramway station. Demographics =2000 US Census= As of the 2000 US Census, Roosevelt Island had a population of 9,520. Fifty- two percent of the population (4,995) were female, and 4,525, or 48%, were male. The population was spread out, with 5% under the age of 5, 20% under the age of 18, 67% between the ages of 18 and 65, and 15% over the age of 65.\\"Community\\" on the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation website The racial makeup of the island was 45% white (non-Hispanic), 27% black (non- Hispanic), 14% Hispanics or Latinos of any race, 11% Asian or Pacific Islander, and .3% other races. The median income was $49,976. 37% had an income under $35,000. 40% had incomes between $35,001 and $99,999, and 23% had an income over $100,000. 55% of the total households were family households, and 45% were non-family households. 17% of the residents were married couples with children, and 19% were married couples without children. 36% of the households were one-person households, and 9% were two or more non-family households. 3% were male-based households with related and unrelated children, and 16% were female-based households with related and unrelated children. =2010 US Census= As of the 2010 US Census, Roosevelt Island had a population of 11,661. The racial makeup of the island was 54.4% white, 23.4% black, 14.9% Hispanics or Latinos of any race, 20.0% Asian, 0.6% Native American or Pacific Islander, and 5.4% other races. 42.7% of the population was born outside the US. The median income was $76,250. 69.3% of households earned more than $50,000. 30.5% earned less than $50,000. =International population= Due to its proximity to the headquarters of the United Nations, Roosevelt Island is home to a large number of diplomatic sector employees. At one time these included then-United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. In addition to several Christian denominations, the island is home to two Jewish synagogues, and as of 2019, a mosque via the Islamic Society of Roosevelt Island. In September 2017, Chabad of Roosevelt Island, the island's Chabad- Lubavitch Jewish congregation, launched a Chabad Jewish student organization in concert with the launch of Israeli-affiliated Cornell Tech, seeking to provide for the spiritual needs of international students from Israel. Between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, Roosevelt Island has seen a 9% growth in the percentage of residents who identified as Asian. A large proportion of this growth has been driven by Chinese international student enrollments which skyrocketed following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, seeing local schools such as Columbia University receiving the fifth-largest enrollment of Chinese students in the United States during the 2014-2015 school year. The Chinese student and young professional population on the island has led to an increase in the number of businesses accepting payments via Mainland China mobile applications, as well as restaurants featuring regional Chinese cuisine and Chinese-language religious outreach. The Headquarters of the United Nations as seen from Roosevelt Island Government and infrastructure The neighborhood is part of Manhattan Community District 8. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation operates and maintains the island's government and infrastructure. The United States Postal Service operates the Roosevelt Island Station at 694 Main Street. Garbage on Roosevelt Island is collected by an automated vacuum collection (AVAC) system using a system of pneumatic tubes that collects of trash each day; this is one of the world's largest AVAC systems.Chaban, Matt A.V. \\"Garbage Collection, Without the Noise or the Smell\\", The New York Times, August 3, 2015. Accessed July 28, 2017. \\"While vehicles still found their way onto the island, garbage trucks were largely banished, thanks to the pneumatic tube system, one of the largest in the world. It sucks up roughly 10 tons of trash from the island's 12,000 residents each day.... After they drop garbage down chutes in their buildings, it collects at the bottom until a trapdoor is activated, releasing the waste into 22-inch-wide red steel tubes that run underground.\\" Roosevelt Island does not currently have its own fire station. Engine Company 261, in Long Island City, was near the Roosevelt Island Bridge and served the island until Mayor Michael Bloomberg closed it, and five other stations, on May 26, 2003. In 2019 Mayor Bill de Blasio's office told reporters that the Island had \\"additional resources in place in the event they are needed for an emergency.\\"  Recreation  There are four recreational fields on Roosevelt Island: * Capobianco Field, located south of the Roosevelt Island Bridge ramp; measures * Firefighters Field, located next to the ferry terminal north of Queensboro Bridge; measures * Octagon Field, located across from the New York City Department of Sanitation building at the north end of the island. As of 2019 it is currently closed for renovations.https://rioc.ny.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=101 * Pony Field, located east of the Octagon; measures In addition, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park is located at the extreme south end of Roosevelt Island. Four Freedoms Park, a New York State Park, opened on October 24, 2012. The park is named after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, which he made to the United States Congress in 1941. Directly to the north is Southpoint Park, a green space containing the landmark Strecker Lab and Smallpox Hospital buildings. At the northern tip of Roosevelt Island is another park, Lighthouse Park, named after the Blackwell Island Light. The entire island is circled by a publicly accessible waterfront promenade. Education Roosevelt Island, as with all parts of New York City, is served by the New York City Department of Education. Residents are zoned to PS/IS 217 Roosevelt Island School, which opened in 1992, combining schools at various locations on the island. Some of the locations that formerly housed the fragments of PS/IS 217 now house The Child School and Legacy High School, which serve K‚Äì12 special needs children with learning and emotional disabilities. On December 19, 2011, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Cornell Tech, a Cornell University-Technion-Israel Institute of Technology graduate school of applied sciences, would be built on the island. The $2 billion facility includes 2 million square feet of space on an 11 acre city- owned site, which was previously used for a hospital. Classes began off-site in September 2012 at the Google New York offices, and the first classes on the Roosevelt Island campus began on September 13, 2017. The first phase of the campus includes main academic building, a graduate housing tower, and an innovation hub/tech incubator. Construction of a conference center and a hotel began in 2018.P√©rez-Pe√±a, Richard \\"Cornell Bid Formally Chosen for Science School in City\\" The New York Times (December 19, 2011)Brooks, Stan \\"Mayor Bloomberg: New York City Ready To Declare War On Silicon Valley\\" \\"CBS New York\\" (December 19, 2011) United for Libraries Literary Landmark dedicated by the Empire State Center for the Book Library The New York Public Library operates the Roosevelt Island branch at 524 Main Street. The library began in a community room, then moved to its own building in 1979. In 1998, the library became a branch of the NYPL system. On April 12, 2016, the Empire State Center for the Book dedicated a United for Libraries Literary Landmark plaque marking Roosevelt Island's literary connections.  Organizations  The Roosevelt Island Garden Club has existed since 1979. Each gardener is assigned a plot and can choose to grow what they wish. The club is made up mostly of Island Residents that rent plots to grow all kinds of different plants. The membership is $65 a year and the wait list is extremely long.

According to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, these animals are thought to have existed in North and/or South America. To non- adherents, these animals are creatures of the Book of Mormon. The exact intended identity of these animals is not known. Joseph Smith, the one who translated the Book of Mormon, is not known to have elaborated on the subject of these animals. However, the animals have been a subject for discussion and speculation by Mormon thinkers and apologists. Reference in the Book of Mormon The curelom and cumom are mentioned only once in the Book of Mormon. The reference occurs in the Book of Ether, which is purported to be a history of a nation of early Americans called the Jaredites who are said to have left the Tower of Babel and traveled by barge to the Western Hemisphere. There, according to the book, they made use of a number of animals, though whether they brought them over on their barges is unclear. The narrative reads as follows: :And also all manner of cattle, ... and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man. And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms. () Apologetic interpretation According to Latter-day Saint belief, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from an ancient language. In this line of thinking, the words curelom and cumom were transliterated instead of translated, meaning that while the ancient word is roughly transmitted, the actual animal intended is ambiguous. The context may imply beasts of burden. Some members of the LDS church have speculated about what the terms refer to, including: *Mastodons, mammoths, or gomphotheres. Early Latter-day Saint apostle Orson Pratt might have identified cureloms as mammoths, though the context is unclear as to whether he is talking about Cureloms and Mammoths or Cureloms as Mammoths. If he means cureloms and mammoths separately, then he is not specifically saying that mammoths existed on the American continent at that time, seeing as all the animals are meant as hypothetical examples of what the Jaredites might have brought in their barges. ::\\"Now to prepare them against these contingencies, and that they might, have fresh air for the benefit of the elephants, cureloms or mammoths and many other animals, that perhaps were in them, as well as the human beings they contained, the Lord told them how to construct them in order to receive air, that when they were on the top of the water, whichever side up their vessels happened to be, it mattered not; they were so constructed that they could ride safely, though bottom upwards and they could open their air holes that happened to be uppermost\\" (Orson Pratt, JoD 12:340).. *An as yet undiscovered, probably extinct species. *Some other North/South American animal species with which Smith was unfamiliar with including possible beasts of burden such as the llama, tapir, guanaco, or other possibly useful creatures like the alpaca, vicu√±a, jaguar, or monkey. Critical view of the mammoth theory Mainstream paleontologists believe that mastodons and mammoths became extinct by 4000 BCE. This suggests that a beast of burden in the Book of Mormon time period most likely would not have been a mammoth, although many Latter-day Saints still persist in displaying Cureloms as mammoths in literature and media. Recent studies have found that a small population of mammoths existed until approximately 1650 BCE. These survivors were an isolated arctic population discovered on the remote Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean. This is the time period wherein Jaredites would have lived, but the geography and climate are far from matching the lands proposed by Book of Mormon scholars and apologists. Cureloms and Cumoms in Latter-Day Saint literature The curelom and cumom have appeared in Mormon literature. For example, Chris Heimerdinger, a popular LDS novelist, chose to make cureloms mammoths in his time-traveling adventure Tennis Shoes and the Feathered Serpent. Similarly, Thom Duncan published an independent novel where an Indiana Jones-type character escapes from a curelom, described as a mammoth. In another book, titled 'Book of Mormon ABCs', on the third page it says, \\"C\\" is for Curelom, and it has a picture of a mammoth. In his novel The Memory of Earth, Orson Scott Card lists various pack animals: \\"horses, donkeys, mules and kurelomi\\". That particular spelling and similar alternative spellings of cureloms can be found in some non-English translations of the Book of Mormon, e.g. Slovenian. Notes References *. *.

Introduced as \\"the antidote to panel games\\", it consists of two teams of two comedians \\"given silly things to do\\" by a chairman. The show was launched in April 1972 as a parody of radio and TV panel games, and has been broadcast since on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service, with repeats aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra and, in the 1980s and 1990s, on BBC Radio 2. The 50th series was broadcast in November and December 2007. After a period of split chairmanship in the first series, Humphrey Lyttelton (\\"Humph\\") served in this role from the programme's inception until his death in 2008. In April 2008, following the hospitalisation and subsequent death of Lyttelton, recording of the 51st series was postponed. The show recommenced on 15 June 2009 with Lyttelton being replaced by three hosts: Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon. Dee went on to host all episodes of the 52nd series later that year, and continues in that role. The chairman's script is written by Iain Pattinson, who has worked on the show since 1992. History (L-R) Ross Noble, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Humphrey Lyttelton, producer Jon Naismith, Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer during a 2005 recording. Naismith is sitting in the chair reserved for \\"Samantha\\". I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue developed from the long-running radio sketch show I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, the writers of which were John Cleese, Jo Kendall, David Hatch, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor and especially Graeme Garden who suggested the idea of an unscripted show which, it was decided, would take the form of a parody panel game. A panel game with no competition was not itself a new idea: the BBC had a history of successful quiz shows designed to allow witty celebrities to entertain where winning was not important. Examples include Ignorance Is Bliss, Just a Minute, My Word! and My Music on the radio and Call My Bluff on television. The pilot episode (at that time titled I'm Sorry, They're At It Again) opened with Graeme Garden and Jo Kendall singing the words of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" to the tune of \\"Ol' Man River\\" followed by Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor performing the lyrics of \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" to the melody of \\"These Foolish Things\\". Dave Lee, who was bandleader on I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, was at the piano and a number of rounds were introduced by a short phrase of music. Other rounds included \\"Dialogue Read in a Specific Accent\\" and \\"Songs Sung as Animals\\". In 1974 Bill Oddie was replaced by Willie Rushton, with Barry Cryer as Graeme Garden's teammate, and Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman, and the personnel remained constant from this point until Rushton's death in 1996, although occasional guest panellists appeared in the 1980s and early 1990s (see below). Since then the fourth seat on the panel has featured a variety of guest comedians. The show has over two million listeners on Radio 4 and its recording sessions typically fill 1500-seat theatres within a week of being advertised. At least one recording for the spring 2006 series filled all its seats within three hours of the free tickets being made available, and the London recording of the autumn series in that year sold out in ten minutes. Although there are twelve Clue shows broadcast per year these are the result of just six recording sessions, with two programmes being recorded back-to- back. The show was recently voted the second funniest radio programme ever, after The Goon Show. It has a large following among professional comedians such as Armando Iannucci, who turned down opportunities to work on it as he preferred to remain a listener. Rob Brydon (centre) chairs the Newcastle recording of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Also pictured are Tim Brooke-Taylor (low left) and Colin Sell (top left). The chair next to Brydon with the microphone is 'used' by \\"Samantha\\" The official, authorised history of the show and ISIRTA, The Clue Bible by Jem Roberts, was published by Preface Publishing in October 2009. Participants Humphrey Lyttelton and producer Jon Naismith during a 2005 recording of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue at the Edinburgh Fringe. =Chairman= Humphrey Lyttelton, primarily known as a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of the role played by improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity. On 18 April 2008 the producer of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, Jon Naismith, announced that, owing to hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm, Humphrey Lyttelton would be unable to record the scheduled shows and that they would have to be postponed. The final show of the 2008 Best of tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton's death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in The Guardian, Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there's \\"got to be an agonising reappraisal\\" and that Lyttelton was the \\"very hub of the show\\". Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it \\"would need somebody of stature to be parachuted in\\". Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying \\"Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn't do it.\\" In the Clue mailout for September 2008 Naismith stated: \\"Despite the rumours, we've made no decisions about possible replacements for Humph, and are unlikely to make any decisions this year at least. Certainly I don't envisage us selecting anyone on a permanent basis for several series.\\" It was announced that the show would continue recording beginning in 2009. The first new shows would be hosted by rotating guest presenters (similarly to the format of Have I Got News for You) before a permanent replacement host was decided. In the Clue mailout for February 2009 Naismith announced that Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon would host two shows each, to be recorded in April, May and June 2009 respectively. The programme returned on 15 June 2009, chaired by Fry with the usual panellists and special guest Victoria Wood. Every series since then has been chaired by Dee. =Panellists= The regular panellists for much of the show's history were: *Graeme Garden was a member of the I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again team from which the programme grew and has been a panellist since the first episode. Lyttelton described him as very dry, biding his time before stepping in with a perfect punchline. Garden last appeared in January 2016 and was absent for the whole of series 65, 66 and 67. On 12 October 2017 Garden announced that he would be rejoining the team. *Barry Cryer hosted six episodes in the show's first series before moving to a permanent seat on the panel. He was credited by then-chairman Lyttelton as being the show's \\"bricks and mortar\\", providing quick-fire one-liners in any situation. There is a running joke in the programme that he is a dirty old man with a drink problem. *Tim Brooke-Taylor was also part of the I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again team and had also been with the show since the start until his death in 2020. He was very popular with the crowd and adopted a vulnerable persona. Garden and Brooke-Taylor had previously worked together on television in The Goodies and Brooke-Taylor in particular would occasionally drop references to that show into some of the games, eliciting cheers from the audience. *Willie Rushton was one of the regular panel members from 1974 until his death in 1996. The other panellists have fond memories of his off-the-wall sense of humour and quick-fire puns. Since Rushton's death his seat has been turned into a permanent guest spot frequently filled by the late Jeremy Hardy when on non- broadcast tours. Guests have also appeared when one of the regulars was unavailable. =Producers= The show has had a number of producers over the years: *David Hatch (produced only the pilot episode in 1972) *John Cassels (1972‚Äì74) *Simon Brett (1975‚Äì77) *Geoffrey Perkins (1978‚Äì81) *Paul Mayhew- Archer (1982‚Äì86) *Paul Spencer (1987‚Äì89) *Jon Magnusson (1990‚Äì91) *Jon Naismith (1991‚Äìpresent) =Musical accompaniment= Early episodes featured Dave Lee, who provided piano accompaniment on I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He is often the butt of jokes about his musical ability to which he is unable to respond as he has no microphone. For example: \\"When music experts hear Colin's compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway.\\" Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have \\"won the coin toss\\" as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this \\"has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell.\\" In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition \\"I'm the Urban Spaceman\\" during a round of \\"Pick Up Song\\". The theme music is called \\"The Schickel Shamble\\", by Ron Goodwin, and is from the film Monte Carlo or Bust. It was chosen by David Hatch. =Guests= Guests have included: * Pam Ayres (2018) * Bill Bailey (2002) * Max Boyce (1998) * Jo Brand (2009, 2014, 2017, 2019‚Äì20) * Rory Bremner (2016, 2018, 2020) * Marcus Brigstocke (2011, 2019‚Äì20) * Rob Brydon (2006‚Äì07, 2009, 2011‚Äì13, 2015, 2018) * Susan Calman (2014‚Äì18) * John Cleese (regular panel member during the first series, 1972) * Denise Coffey (1979, 1981, 1983, 1991, 1997) * Jack Dee (2004‚Äì05, 2007) * Omid Djalili (2014‚Äì15) * Pippa Evans (2016, 2019‚Äì20) * Kenny Everett (1985) * John Finnemore (2013‚Äì14, 2017‚Äì18) * Stephen Fry (1986‚Äì87, 1989, 1997, 1999‚Äì2000, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2019) * Kerry Godliman (2018) * Andy Hamilton (1999, 2001‚Äì02, 2004‚Äì07, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020) * Mike Harding (1984, 1986) * Jeremy Hardy (1995, 1998‚Äì2007, 2009‚Äì12, 2015‚Äì18) * Tony Hawks (1995, 1997, 1999‚Äì2006, 2012‚Äì20) * Harry Hill (2003, 2005, 2014, 2019‚Äì20) * John Junkin (1975, 1979, 1986) * Phill Jupitus (1999, 2001, 2009‚Äì10) * Miles Jupp (2013, 2015‚Äì17, 2019) * Jo Kendall (regular panel member during the first series, 1972) * Jonathan Lynn (1978) * Fred MacAulay (1998‚Äì99, 2016) * Paul Merton (1991‚Äì92, 1994, 1997‚Äì98) * David Mitchell (2009‚Äì11, 2013) * Neil Mullarkey (2000) * Ross Noble (2003, 2005, 2011‚Äì12) * Bill Oddie (regular panel member during the first two series, 1972‚Äì73) * Richard Osman (2016, 2018‚Äì19) * Rachel Parris (2019‚Äì20) * Caroline Quentin (2018) * Jan Ravens (2017) * Linda Smith (2001, 2004) * Bill Tidy (1985, 1989, replacement for Tim Brooke-Taylor for one series in 1991) * Sandi Toksvig (1997‚Äì2003, 2005, 2010, 2015‚Äì16, 2019‚Äì20) * Victoria Wood (2009, 2012‚Äì13) Raymond Baxter was occasionally drafted to commentate on sessions of Mornington Crescent and also presented the one-off special Everyman's Guide to Mornington Crescent. Both Judi Dench and Alan Titchmarsh took part in \\"Celebrity What's My Line?\\". Judi Dench and Michael Gambon performed the Mornington Crescent drama The Bromley by Bow Stratagem. Alan Titchmarsh also played every questioner (that is, famous gardeners) on a 2012 show which featured Victoria Wood. A 2013 episode featured a round of Useless Celebrities, a parody of Pointless Celebrities, and featured Richard Osman as the co-presenter (this was broadcast three years before Osman appeared on the panel). A 2017 episode featured a spoof of The Chase which featured Anne Hegerty, one of the Chasers from the show.This is mostly from memory. A list of shows can be seen here: http://www.isihac.co.uk/broadcasts/past.html On one occasion Humph announced that they had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, \\"Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you a few things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game.\\"ISIHAC, 1979-12-24, BBC Radio 4 This story became a favourite of Lyttelton's, who claimed in interviews that the \\"distinguished actor\\" had never actually been named on the show.That Reminds Me, 2007-01-31, BBC7 =Scorers= Since 18 May 1985 (in the same episode as Kenny Everett made his debut) the show has included a fictional and completely silent scorer \\"whose job is eased by the fact no points are actually awarded\\", usually \\"the lovely Samantha\\" who sits on Humph's left hand. There is a seat with a microphone next to the Chairman which is \\"used\\" by Samantha. During the introductory music Humphrey Lyttelton would stand up and \\"help\\" Samantha into her seat. In practice the seat and microphone were only used by the producer to welcome the audience, to introduce the participants and to give any other information to the audience such as the expected date of broadcasting, and to supervise re-recordings of fluffs made in the programme. Lyttelton would describe Samantha's social activities, usually in an apology received from the unseen character who had been detained, often with a \\"gentleman friend\\". His comments included sexual innuendo and double entendres, like \\"Samantha likes nothing better than a little potter in the woodshed in the morning\\", though many were far more daring and explicit. During early episodes of Samantha's appearance on the show, it was not completely clear that she was a fictional character, garnering complaints about the sexist and humiliating treatment she received. Producer Jon Naismith recalled \\"when we [Naismith and Iain Pattinson] took over the show we used to get quite a few letters accusing us of sexist references to Samantha\\"Roberts, Jem. The Clue Bible: The Fully Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue from Footlights to Mornington Crescent. Preface: London, 2009. (the character was named after the page 3 topless model Samantha Fox). Samantha's inabilities as score-keeper often form the basis for humour; in a programme from 1997, Humph said: \\"It's just occurred to me that Samantha hasn't given us the score... since 1981.\\" Samantha has sometimes been replaced by a Swedish stand-in, Sven, or occasionally another substitute, Monica. When Margaret Thatcher left office in 1990 Lyttelton introduced a scorer named Margaret. In an episode in November 1991 both Samantha and Sven were present but occupied with each other and unable to award points. The programme's scoring is completely nonexistent. Most of the show is scripted, but in rounds such as \\"Sound charades\\", where one team of panellists have to guess the charade of the other team, the answer may be obvious (usually a pun) but the opposing team are now actually not told the answer. In recording, it has taken them many minutes to come up with the correct answer, most of which has to be edited out before broadcast. In rounds in which the panel must not see what the audience sees, there is the \\"advanced laser display-board\\" (actually a sign with the answer written on, held by Jon Naismith), sometimes described in more elaborate terms and \\"so generously funded by our hosts\\" but these of course do not exist: they are conveyed to \\"listeners at home\\" by the \\"mystery voice\\", alluding to the 1960s radio programme Twenty Questions. =Correspondence= A regular feature on the programme, preceding the game Mornington Crescent, is a fictional letters section which begins with the chairman's comments (\\"I notice from the sheer weight of this week's postbag, we've received a little over no letters\\" and \\"I see from the number of letters raining down on us this week that the Scrabble factory has exploded again\\"). The invariably single letter each week is from \\"A Mrs Trellis of North Wales\\", one of the many prompts for a cheer from the audience, whose incoherent letters usually mistake the chairman for another Radio 4 presenter or media personality. \\"Dear Libby\\" (she writes), \\"why oh why ... very nearly spells YOYO\\", or \\"Dear Mr Titchmarsh, never let them tell you that size isn't important. My aunt told me that, but then all my new wallpaper fell off.\\" Format =Introduction= The chairman introduces the show with remarks such as: and continues by providing a little background material, usually derogatory, about the show's location: Then the teams' introduction: The teams are often mocked at their introduction: =Games= Many games are played on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, some frequently and dozens less often. A few have been played only once, either because the joke works only once or because they were not particularly successful. Popular games include \\"One Song to the Tune of Another\\", \\"Mornington Crescent\\", \\"Sound Charades\\", \\"Late Arrivals\\", \\"Double Feature\\", \\"Cheddar Gorge\\" and \\"Uxbridge English Dictionary\\". \\"One Song to the Tune of Another\\" is always introduced using a complex analogy, despite its self-explanatory title, often ending with a joke at the expense of Colin Sell. The panellists play as individuals or as two teams. \\"Celebrity What's My Line?\\" completely destroyed the intent of the original ‚Äî for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by exclamations from the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. \\"Is that your own hair?\\" or \\"Do you kill people for money?\\"), who pretended not to know who they were. Musical games often involve incongruities such as singing \\"One Song to the Tune of Another\\" or playing a song using only a swanee whistle and a kazoo. In \\"Just a Minim\\" ‚Äì a parody of Radio 4's Just a Minute ‚Äì panellists must sing a specified song avoiding repetition, deviation, or hesitation: the chosen songs often have extremely repetitive lyrics. Humour is derived from wordplay such as puns or mockery of styles of speech. For example, in a round based on suggesting television programmes from biblical times: *They Think It's All Jehovah *I Love Lucifer *The Exodus Files In \\"Uxbridge English Dictionary\\" the panellists contribute humorous redefinitions of words; \\"Puny: the Roman Catholic equivalent of tennis elbow\\". More puns are found in the \\"Arrivals at the Ball\\" section, of the form \\"Mr and Mrs X and their son (or daughter)....\\" the child's name forming a pun, preferably laboured and feeble. This grew out of the \\"drama\\" section of later shows in the I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again series, for example, at the Criminals' Ball, \\"Mr and Mrs Knee, and their Swedish son, Lars Knee\\". According to Tim Brooke-Taylor twenty per cent of the show is ad-libbed. According to Willie Rushton, it is more like fifty per cent, but he didn't think that a bad thing.Views From The Boundary, Brian Johnston =Time, destiny, fate and eternity= The show draws to a close with the chairman imparting some final words of wisdom intended to evoke time, destiny, fate and eternity, undercut with silliness. For example: \\"...And so, as the hunter of time blasts the moose of eternity, and the dairy counter worker of fate sighs and grabs her mop...\\" Lyttelton's final sign-off on the show, shortly before his death in April 2008, was: Humour Most of the humour is detached from the real world. Steve Punt cites it as one of his favourite radio shows because \\"there's no points being made or targets being attacked.\\" Contemporary references occasionally made by participants are usually asides. The show does occasionally comment on the outside world, though from an innocent perspective. The game \\"Complete George Bush Quotes\\" was once played, in which the teams had to supply endings for phrases that George Bush had begun (see Bushism), the teams complaining that they couldn't be any funnier than the original; similar rounds with guessing or completing quotes of other well-known public figures and personalities have also been played. Self-deprecation forms a big part of the show's humour. It frequently pokes fun at itself and its supposed low quality. For example, Lyttelton was heard to exclaim at the end of a round: *\\"Nietzsche said that life was a choice between suffering and boredom. He never said anything about having to put up with both at the same time.\\" *\\"I'm often prone to bouts of misplaced optimism. This round's going to be a hum-dinger!\\" *\\"All good things must come to an end, so let's carry on.\\" *An introduction to \\"Sound Charades\\", a round based on Give Us a Clue, went: \\"In the TV version the teams were not allowed to speak, making the games both silent and hilarious. Our version differs in just two ways.\\" The regular panellists are represented by the chairman to be unfunny, struggling comedians who have been doing the same act for many years. Further to this, supposed personalities of the panellists by the chairman, fictitious but drawn from their public personas, is also a recurring theme, with Barry Cryer often represented as a tight-fisted alcoholic who can't wait to get to the pub (but who never buys a round of drinks), whilst Tim Brooke- Taylor was often represented as willing to take any small performance job in his quiet career, and always campaigning for a repeat of The Goodies (something which Brooke-Taylor himself played upon in many rounds). The late Humphrey Lyttelton often delivered mock comments of how boring and low quality the show was and, particularly in his later years on the show, often preferring to doze off than listen to the rounds. Pianist Colin Sell, meanwhile, is often the butt of many jokes regarding his supposedly terrible musical skills (despite in reality being an accomplished musician). According to Willie Rushton, \\"The show gets quite filthy at times, but the audience love it.\\" After over forty years on the air one of the most important aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience. The mere mention of Lionel Blair will often bring roars of laughter in anticipation of an outrageous double-entendre based on his supposed homosexuality (he is not gay); Similarly, particular mention of points scorer Samantha, or her occasional replacement Sven (neither of which actually exists) will typically bring anticipatory laughter in wait of a sexual double- entendre. In the \\"Film Club\\" round any reference by Graeme Garden to Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is sure to cause a similar response. The game \\"Wobbling Bunnies\\" was introduced several times by Humph, often with eager anticipation by the panel and audience, but time pressures always meant the game was never actually played. Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer frequently play the characters of two Scots, Hamish and Dougal, whose skits usually begin with the phrase \\"You'll have had your tea?\\", as a stereotypical Scots miser when receiving a guest never offers any food or drink. The characters were developed into their own Radio 4 show, Hamish and Dougal. Another long-running gag involves one of the panellists putting forward a challenge of \\"hesitation\\" when another panellist leaves a long pause in the middle of speaking, a reference to Radio 4's other long-running panel show Just a Minute. (Likewise, occasionally on Just a Minute, a panellist will make a challenge of \\"Mornington Crescent\\".) Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton frequently poked fun at Just a Minute and its chairman Nicholas Parsons, something which Lyttelton's successor Jack Dee has continued with and expanded upon, mimicking Parsons by constantly emphasising the long experience of some panellists, and the fact that the programme can be heard all over the world.

Some early episodes of the series, including the first, were wiped in the late 1970s. Following the BBC's Treasure Hunt appeal for missing material in 2002, several shows were recovered from off-air recordings made by listeners. Ultimately, a complete archive (barring the opening music in places) was assembled, though the quality was somewhat poor for early episodes.

While the broadcast shows are recorded on location, this was the first ISIHAC touring stage show in the show's 35-year history. It was a best of show, featuring favourite rounds from the past 35 years, and the guest panellist was Jeremy Hardy. The shows were not recorded for broadcast on Radio 4, although it was suggested that they may be recorded for release as part of the BBC Radio Collection.

Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative. Distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations, where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions than classical solutions, or appropriate classical solutions may not exist. Distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are distributions, such as the Dirac delta function. A function f is normally thought of as acting on the points in its domain by \\"sending\\" a point in its domain to the point f(x). Distribution theory reinterprets functions as linear functionals acting on test functions. Test functions are usually infinitely differentiable real (or complex) valued functions with compact support. Many \\"standard functions\\" (meaning for example a function that is typically encountered in a Calculus course), say for instance a continuous map f:\\\\R\\\\to\\\\R, can be canonically reinterpreted as acting on test functions (instead of their usual interpretation as acting on points of their domain) via the action of \\"integration against a test function\\"; explicitly, this means that f \\"acts on\\" a test function by \\"sending\\" to the number \\\\textstyle \\\\int_{\\\\R} fg \\\\, dx. This new action of f is thus a real-valued map D_f whose domain is the space of test functions; this map turns out to have two additional propertiesD_f turns out to also be linear and continuous when the space of test functions is given a certain topology called the canonical LF topology. that make it into what is known as a distribution on \\\\R. Distributions that arise from \\"standard functions\\" in this way are the prototypical examples of a distributions. But there are many distributions that do not arise in this way and these distributions are the \\"generalized functions.\\" Examples include the Dirac delta function or some distributions that arise via integration of test functions against measures. However, by using various methods it is nevertheless still possible to reduce any distribution down to a simpler family of related distributions that do arise via such actions of integration. In applications to physics and engineering, the space of test functions usually consists of smooth functions with compact support that are defined on some given non-empty open subset U\\\\subset\\\\R^n. This space of test functions is denoted by C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) or \\\\mathcal{D}(U) and a distribution on is by definition a linear functional on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) that is continuous when C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) given a topology called the canonical LF topology. The space of (all) distributions on , which is usually denoted by \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) (note the prime), is thus the continuous dual space of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) and it is these distributions that are the main focus of this article. There are other possible choices for the space of test functions, which lead to other different spaces of distributions. If U=\\\\R^n then the use of Schwartz functionsThe Schwartz space consists of smooth rapidly decreasing test functions, where \\"rapidly decreasing\\" means that the function decreases faster than any polynomial increases as points in its domain move away from the origin. as test functions gives rise to a certain subspace of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) whose elements are called tempered distributions. These are important because they allow the Fourier transform to be extended from \\"standard functions\\" to tempered distributions. The set of tempered distributions forms a vector subspace of space of distributions \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and is thus one example of space of distributions; there are many other spaces of distributions. There also exist other major classes of test functions that are not subsets of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), such as spaces of analytic test functions, which produce very different classes of distributions. The theory of such distributions has a different character from the previous one because there are no analytic functions with non-empty compact support.Except for the trivial (i.e. identically ) map, which of course is always analytic. Use of analytic test functions lead to Sato's theory of hyperfunctions.  History  The practical use of distributions can be traced back to the use of Green functions in the 1830s to solve ordinary differential equations, but was not formalized until much later. According to , generalized functions originated in the work of on second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations, and the ideas were developed in somewhat extended form by Laurent Schwartz in the late 1940s. According to his autobiography, Schwartz introduced the term \\"distribution\\" by analogy with a distribution of electrical charge, possibly including not only point charges but also dipoles and so on. comments that although the ideas in the transformative book by were not entirely new, it was Schwartz's broad attack and conviction that distributions would be useful almost everywhere in analysis that made the difference. Notation Before proceeding we introduce some notation to simplify the expressions and statements below: *\\\\N=\\\\\\\\{0,1,2, \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}. *Let f be a function and use \\\\operatorname{Dom}(f) to denote its domain. The support of f, denoted by \\\\operatorname{supp}(f), is the closure of the set \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Dom}(f) : f(x) eq 0 \\\\\\\\} in \\\\operatorname{Dom}(f). *Throughout this article n is a fixed positive integer and U is a fixed non-empty open subset of \\\\R^n. * For two functions f,g:U\\\\to\\\\C set: ::\\\\langle f, g\\\\rangle := \\\\int_U f(x) g(x) \\\\,dx. *A multi-index of size n is simply an element in \\\\N^n (given that n is fixed we generally omit specifying the size of multi-indices). The length of a multi-index \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n) \\\\in \\\\N^n is defined as \\\\alpha_1+\\\\cdots+\\\\alpha_n and denoted by \\\\alpha. Multi-indices are particularly useful when dealing with functions of several variables, in particular we introduce the following notations for a given multi-index \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n) \\\\in \\\\N^n: ::\\\\begin{align} x^\\\\alpha &= x_1^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\cdots x_n^{\\\\alpha_n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial x_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\cdots \\\\partial x_n^{\\\\alpha_n}} \\\\end{align} :We also introduce a partial order of all multi-indices by \\\\beta \\\\ge \\\\alpha if and only if \\\\beta_i \\\\ge \\\\alpha_i for all 1 \\\\le i\\\\le n. When \\\\beta \\\\ge \\\\alpha we define their multi-index binomial coefficient as: ::\\\\binom{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} := \\\\binom{\\\\beta_1}{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\cdots \\\\binom{\\\\beta_n}{\\\\alpha_n}.  Definitions of test functions and distributions  In this section, we will formally define real-valued distributions on . With minor modifications, one can also define complex-valued distributions, and one can replace \\\\R^n with any (paracompact) smooth manifold. Note that for all j,k\\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} and any compact subsets and of , we have: :\\\\begin{align} C^k(K) &\\\\subset C^k_c(U) \\\\subset C^k(U) \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^k(K) &\\\\subset C^k(L) && \\\\text{if } K \\\\subset L \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^k(K) &\\\\subset C^j(K) && \\\\text{if } j \\\\leqslant k \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_c^k(U) &\\\\subset C^j_c(U) && \\\\text{if } j \\\\leqslant k \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^k(U) &\\\\subset C^j(U) && \\\\text{if } j \\\\leqslant k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Distributions on are defined to be the continuous linear functionals on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) when this vector space is endowed with a particular topology called the canonical LF-topology. So to define the space of distributions we must first define the canonical LF-topology, which in turn requires that several other topological vector spaces (TVSs) be defined first. We will first define a topology on C^{\\\\infty}(U), then assign every C^{\\\\infty}(K) the subspace topology induced on it by C^{\\\\infty}(U), and finally we define the canonical LF-topology on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U). We use the canonical LF-topology to define a topology on the space of distributions, which permits us to consider things such as convergence of distributions. ;Choice of compact sets Throughout, will be any collection of compact subsets of such that (1) U = \\\\cup_{K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}} K, and (2) for any compact there exists some such that . The most common choices for are: * The set of all compact subsets of , or * A set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\overline{U_1}, \\\\overline{U_2}, \\\\ldots \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where U = \\\\cup_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} U_i, and for all , \\\\overline{U_i} \\\\subset U_{i+1} and is a relatively compact non-empty open subset of (i.e. \\"relatively compact\\" means that the closure of , in either or \\\\R^n, is compact). We make into a directed set by defining if and only if . Note that although the definitions of the subsequently defined topologies explicitly reference , in reality they do not depend on the choice of ; that is, if and are any two such collections of compact subsets of , then the topologies defined on C^k(U) and C_c^k(U) by using in place of are the same as those defined by using in place of . = Topology on Ck(U) = We now introduce the seminorms that will define the topology on C^k(U). Different authors sometimes use different families of seminorms so we list the most common families below. However, the resulting topology is the same no matter which family is used. \\\\left\\\\partial^p f(x_0) \\\\right\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] t_{i,K}(f) &:= \\\\sup_{x_0 \\\\in K} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{p\\\\leq i} \\\\left\\\\partial^p f(x_0) \\\\right\\\\right) \\\\end{align} while for we define all the functions above to be the constant map. }} Each of the functions above are non-negative -valuedThe image of the compact set under a continuous -valued map (e.g. x \\\\mapsto \\\\left\\\\partial^p f(x) \\\\rightfor ) is itself a compact, and thus bounded, subset of . If then this implies that each of the functions defined above is -valued (i.e. none of the supremums above are ever equal to ). seminorms on C^k(U). Each of the following families of seminorms generates the same locally convex topology on C^k(U): :\\\\begin{alignat}{4} (1) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; &\\\\\\\\{q_{i,K} &&: \\\\;K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}, \\\\;\\\\;&&i; \\\\in \\\\N, \\\\;&&0 \\\\le i \\\\le k \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (2) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; &\\\\\\\\{r_{i,K} &&: \\\\;K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}, \\\\;\\\\;&&i; \\\\in \\\\N, \\\\;&&0 \\\\le i \\\\le k \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (3) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; &\\\\\\\\{t_{i,K} &&: \\\\;K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}, \\\\;\\\\;&&i; \\\\in \\\\N, \\\\;&&0 \\\\le i \\\\le k \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (4) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; &\\\\\\\\{s_{p,K} &&: \\\\;K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}, \\\\;\\\\;&&p; \\\\in \\\\N^n, \\\\;&&p\\\\le k \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{alignat} With this topology, C^k(U) becomes a locally convex (non- normable) Fr√©chet space and all of the seminorms defined above are continuous on this space. All of the seminorms defined above are continuous functions on C^k(U). Under this topology, a net (f_i)_{i\\\\in I} in C^k(U) converges to f \\\\in C^k(U) if and only if for every multi-index with and every , the net (\\\\partial^p f_i)_{i \\\\in I} converges to \\\\partial^p f uniformly on . For any k\\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, any bounded subset of C^{k+1}(U) is a relatively compact subset of C^k(U). In particular, a subset of C^{\\\\infty}(U) is bounded if and only if it is bounded in C^i(U) for all i\\\\in\\\\N. The space C^k(U) is a Montel space if and only if . The topology on C^{\\\\infty}(U) is the superior limit of the subspace topologies induced on C^{\\\\infty}(U) by the TVSs C^i(U) as ranges over the non-negative integers. A subset of C^{\\\\infty}(U) is open in this topology if and only if there exists i\\\\in\\\\N such that is open when C^{\\\\infty}(U) is endowed with the subspace topology induced by C^i(U). = Topology on Ck(K) = As before, fix k\\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}. Recall that ifK is any compact subset of U then: C^k(K) \\\\subset C^k(U). For any compact subset , C^k(K) is a closed subspace of the Fr√©chet space C^k(U) and is thus also a Fr√©chet space. For all compact with , denote the natural inclusion by \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{L} : C^k(K) \\\\to C^k(L) where note that this map is a linear embedding of TVSs whose range is closed in its codomain (said differently, the topology on C^k(K) is identical to the subspace topology it inherits from C^k(L), and C^k(K) is a closed subspace of C^k(L)). The interior of C^{\\\\infty}(K) relative to C^{\\\\infty}(U) is empty. For k finite C^k(K) is a Banach space with a topology that can be defined by the norm :r_{K}(f):=\\\\sup_{pAnd when , C^k(K) is even a Hilbert space. The space C^{\\\\infty}(K) is a distinguished Schwartz Montel space so if C^{\\\\infty}(K) eq\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} then it is not normable and thus not a Banach space (although like all other C^k(K), it is a Fr√©chet space).  Trivial extensions and independence of Ck(K)'s topology from  The definition of C^k(K) depends on so we will let C^k(K;U) denote the topological space C^k(K), which by definition is a topological subspace of C^k(U). Suppose is an open subset of \\\\R^n containing U. Given f\\\\in C_c^k(U) we define its trivial extension to , F \\\\in C^k(V), as follows: :\\\\begin{cases} F:V\\\\to\\\\R \\\\\\\\\\\\ F(x) = \\\\begin{cases} f(x) & x \\\\in U \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{cases} Let I: C_c^k(U)\\\\to C^k(V) denote the map that sends a function in C_c^k(U) to its trivial extension on . This map is a linear injection and for every compact subset , we clearly have I(C^k(K; U)) = C^k(K; V), where C^k(K;V) is the topological subspace of C^k(V) consisting of maps with support contained in (since , K is a compact subset of V as well). It follows that I(C_c^k(U))\\\\subset C_c^k(V). If is restricted to C^k(K;U) then the following induced map is a homeomorphism (and thus a TVS-isomorphism): :C^k(K;U) \\\\to C^k(K;V) and thus the next two maps (which like the previous map are defined by f\\\\mapsto I(f)) are topological embeddings: :C^k(K;U) \\\\to C^k(V), :C^k(K;U)\\\\to C_c^k(V). (the topology on C_c^k(V) is the canonical LF topology, which is defined later). Using C_c^k(U) i f\\\\mapsto I(f)\\\\in C_c^k(V) we identify C_c^k(U) with its image in C_c^k(V) \\\\subset C^k(V). Since C^k(K;U)\\\\subset C_c^k(U), through this identification C^k(K;U) can also be considered as a subset of C^k(V). Importantly, the subspace topology C^k(K;U) inherits from C^k(U) (when it is viewed as a subset of C^k(U)) is identical to the subspace topology that it inherits from C^k(V) (when C^k(K;U) is viewed instead as a subset of C^k(V) via the identification). Thus the topology on C^k(K;U) is independent of the open subset of \\\\R^n that contains . This justifies our practice of using C^k(K) instead of C^k(K;U). = Topology on the spaces of test functions and distributions = Recall that C_c^k(U) denote all those functions in C^k(U) that have compact support in , where note that C_c^k(U) is the union of all C^k(K) as ranges over . Moreover, for every , C_c^k(U) is a dense subset of C^k(U). The spacial case when gives us the space of test functions.  Canonical LF topology  We now define the canonical LF topology as a direct limit. It is also possible to define this topology in terms of its neighborhoods of the origin, which is described afterwards. For any two sets and , we declare that if and only if , which in particular makes the collection of compact subsets of into a directed set (we say that such a collection is directed by subset inclusion). For all compact with , there are natural inclusions :\\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{L} : C^k(K) \\\\to C^k(L)\\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{U} : C^k(K) \\\\to C_c^k(U). Recall from above that the map \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{L} : C^k(K) \\\\to C^k(L) is a topological embedding. The collection of maps :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{L} \\\\;:\\\\; K, L \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} \\\\;\\\\text{ and }\\\\; K \\\\subset L \\\\right \\\\\\\\} forms a direct system in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces that is directed by (under subset inclusion). This system's direct limit (in the category of locally convex TVSs) is the pair (C_c^k(U), \\\\operatorname{In}_{\\\\bullet}^{U}) where \\\\operatorname{In}_{\\\\bullet}^{U} := \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{U}\\\\right)_{K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}} are the natural inclusions and where C_c^k(U) is now endowed with the (unique) strongest locally convex topology making all of the inclusion maps \\\\operatorname{In}_{\\\\bullet}^{U} = \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{U}\\\\right)_{K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}} continuous. ;Neighborhoods of the origin If is a convex subset of C_c^k(U), then is a neighborhood of the origin in the canonical LF topology if and only if it satisfies the following condition: Note that any convex set satisfying this condition is necessarily absorbing in C_c^k(U). Since the topology of any topological vector space is translation-invariant, any TVS-topology is completely determined by the set of neighborhood of the origin. This means that one could actually define the canonical LF topology by declaring that a convex balanced subset is a neighborhood of the origin if and only if it satisfies condition . ;Topology defined via differential operators A linear differential operator in with smooth coefficients is a sum :P := \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\N^{n}} c_{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} where c_{\\\\alpha} \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U) and all but finitely many of c_{\\\\alpha} are identically . The integer \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha : c_{\\\\alpha} eq 0\\\\\\\\} is called the order of the differential operator P. If P is a linear differential operator of order then it induces a canonical linear map C^k(U) \\\\to C^0(U) defined by \\\\phi \\\\mapsto P\\\\phi, where we shall reuse notation and also denote this map by P. For any , the canonical LF topology on C_c^k(U) is the weakest locally convex TVS topology making all linear differential operators in of order into continuous maps from C_c^k(U) into C_c^0(U). = Basic properties = ;Canonical LF topology's independence from One benefit of defining the canonical LF topology as the direct limit of a direct system is that we may immediately use the universal property of direct limits. Another benefit is that we can use well-known results from category theory to deduce that the canonical LF topology is actually independent of the particular choice of the directed collection of compact sets. And by considering different collections (in particular, those mentioned at the beginning of this article), we may deduce different properties of this topology. In particular, we may deduce that the canonical LF topology makes C_c^k(U) into a Hausdorff locally convex strict LF-space (and also a strict LB-space if ), which of course is the reason why this topology is called \\"the canonical LF topology\\" (see this footnote for more details).If we take to be the set of all compact subsets of then we can use the universal property of direct limits to conclude that the inclusion \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{U} : C^k(K) \\\\to C_c^k(U) is a continuous and even that they are topological embedding for every compact subset . If however, we take to be the set of closures of some countable increasing sequence of relatively compact open subsets of having all of the properties mentioned earlier in this in this article then we immediately deduce that C_c^k(U) is a Hausdorff locally convex strict LF-space (and even a strict LB-space when ). All of these facts can also be proved directly without using direct systems (although with more work). ;Universal property From the universal property of direct limits, we know that if u : C_c^k(U) \\\\to Y is a linear map into a locally convex space (not necessarily Hausdorff), then is continuous if and only if is bounded if and only if for every , the restriction of to C^k(K) is continuous (or bounded). ;Dependence of the canonical LF topology on Suppose is an open subset of \\\\R^n containing U. Let I: C_c^k(U)\\\\to C_c^k(V) denote the map that sends a function in C_c^k(U) to its trivial extension on (which was defined above). This map is a continuous linear map. If (and only if) then I(C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)) is not a dense subset of C_c^{\\\\infty}(V) and I: C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\to C_c^{\\\\infty}(V) is not a topological embedding. Consequently, if then the transpose of I: C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\to C_c^{\\\\infty}(V) is neither one-to-one nor onto. ;Bounded subsets A subset of C_c^k(U) is bounded in C_c^k(U) if and only if there exists some such that B \\\\subset C^k(K) and is a bounded subset of C^k(K). Moreover, if is compact and S \\\\subset C^k(K) then is bounded in C^k(K) if and only if it is bounded in C^k(U). For any , any bounded subset of C_c^{k+1}(U) (resp. C^{k+1}(U)) is a relatively compact subset of C_c^k(U) (resp. C^k(U)), where . ;Non- metrizability For all compact , the interior of C^k(K) in C_c^k(U) is empty so that C_c^k(U) is of the first category in itself. It follows from Baire's theorem that C_c^k(U) is not metrizable and thus also not normable (see this footnoteFor any TVS (metrizable or otherwise), the notion of completeness depends entirely on a certain so-called \\"canonical uniformity\\" that is defined using only the subtraction operation (see the article Complete topological vector space for more details). In this way, the notion of a complete TVS does not require the existence of any metric. However, if the TVS is metrizable and if is any translation-invariant metric on that defines its topology, then is complete as a TVS (i.e. it is a complete uniform space under its canonical uniformity) if and only if the is a complete metric space. So if a TVS happens to have a topology that can be defined by such a metric then may be used to deduce the completeness of but the existence of such a metric is not necessary for defining completeness and it is even possible to deduce that a metrizable TVS is complete without ever even considering a metric (e.g. since the Cartesian product of any collection of complete TVSs is again a complete TVS, we can immediately deduce that the TVS \\\\R^\\\\N, which happens to be metrizable, is a complete TVS; note that there was no need to consider any metric on \\\\R^\\\\N). for an explanation of how the non-metrizable space C_c^k(U) can be complete even thought it doesn't admit a metric). The fact that C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is a nuclear Montel space makes up for the non-metrizability of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) (see this footnote for a more detailed explanation).One reason for giving C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) the canonical LF topology is because it is with this topology that C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) and its continuous dual space both become nuclear spaces, which have many nice properties and which may be viewed as a generalization of finite-dimensional spaces (for comparison, normed spaces are another generalization of finite-dimensional spaces that have many \\"nice\\" properties). In more detail, there are two classes of topological vector spaces (TVSs) that are particularly similar to finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces: the Banach spaces (especially Hilbert spaces) and the nuclear Montel spaces. Montel spaces are a class of TVSs in which every closed and bounded subset is compact (this generalizes the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem), which is a property that no infinite-dimensional Banach space can have; that is, no infinite-dimensional TVS can be both a Banach space and a Montel space. Also, no infinite-dimensional TVS can be both a Banach space and a nuclear space. All finite dimensional Euclidean spaces are nuclear Montel Hilbert spaces but once one enters infinite-dimensional space then these two classes separate. Nuclear spaces in particular have many of the \\"nice\\" properties of finite-dimensional TVSs (e.g. the Schwartz kernel theorem) that infinite- dimensional Banach spaces lack (for more details, see the properties, sufficient conditions, and characterizations given in the article Nuclear space). It is in this sense that nuclear spaces are an \\"alternative generalization\\" of finite-dimensional spaces. Also, as a general rule, in practice most \\"naturally occurring\\" TVSs are usually either Banach spaces or nuclear space. Typically, most TVSs that are associated with smoothness (i.e. infinite differentiability, such as C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) and C^{\\\\infty}(U)) end up being nuclear TVSs while TVSs associated with finite continuous differentiability (such as C^k(K) with compact and ) often end up being non- nuclear spaces, such as Banach spaces. ;Relationships between spaces Using the universal property of direct limits and the fact that the natural inclusions \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{L} : C^k(K) \\\\to C^k(L) are all topological embedding, one may show that all of the maps \\\\operatorname{In}_{K}^{U} : C^k(K) \\\\to C_c^k(U) are also topological embeddings. Said differently, the topology on C^k(K) is identical to the subspace topology that it inherits from C_c^k(U), where recall that C^k(K)'s topology was defined to be the subspace topology induced on it by C^k(U). In particular, both C_c^k(U) and C^k(U) induces the same subspace topology on C^k(K). However, this does not imply that the canonical LF topology on C_c^k(U) is equal to the subspace topology induced on C_c^k(U) by C^k(U); these two topologies on C_c^k(U) are in fact never equal to each other since the canonical LF topology is never metrizable while the subspace topology induced on it by C^k(U) is metrizable (since recall that C^k(U) is metrizable). The canonical LF topology on C_c^k(U) is actually strictly finer than the subspace topology that it inherits from C^k(U) (thus the natural inclusion C_c^k(U)\\\\to C^k(U) is continuous but not a topological embedding). Indeed, the canonical LF topology is so fine that if C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\to X denotes some linear map that is a \\"natural inclusion\\" (such as C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\to C^k(U), or C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\to L^p(U), or other maps discussed below) then this map will typically be continuous, which as is shown below, is ultimately the reason why locally integrable functions, Radon measures, etc. all induce distributions (via the transpose of such a \\"natural inclusion\\"). Said differently, the reason why there are so many different ways of defining distributions from other spaces ultimately stems from how very fine the canonical LF topology is. Moreover, since distributions are just continuous linear functionals on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), the fine nature of the canonical LF topology means that more linear functionals on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) end up being continuous (\\"more\\" means as compared to a coarser topology that we could have placed on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) such as for instance, the subspace topology induced by some C^k(U), which although it would have made C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) metrizable, it would have also resulted in fewer linear functionals on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) being continuous and thus there would have been fewer distributions; moreover, this particular coarser topology also has the disadvantage of not making C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) into a complete TVS). ;Other properties * The differentiation map C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is a surjective continuous linear operator. * The bilinear multiplication map C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^m) \\\\times C_c^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C_c^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^{m+n}) given by (f,g)\\\\mapsto fg is not continuous; it is however, hypocontinuous.  Distributions  As discussed earlier, continuous linear functionals on a C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) are known as distributions on . Thus the set of all distributions on is the continuous dual space of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), which when endowed with the strong dual topology is denoted by \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). We have the canonical duality pairing between a distribution on and a test function f \\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), which is denoted using angle brackets by :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\times C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to \\\\R \\\\\\\\\\\\ (T, f) \\\\mapsto \\\\langle T, f \\\\rangle := T(f) \\\\end{cases} One interprets this notation as the distribution acting on the test function f to give a scalar, or symmetrically as the test function f acting on the distribution . ;Characterizations of distributions Proposition. If is a linear functional on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) then the following are equivalent: 1. is a distribution; 2. (definition) is continuous; 3. is continuous at the origin; 4. is uniformly continuous; 5. is a bounded operator; 6. is sequentially continuous; i.e. for every sequence \\\\\\\\{f_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^\\\\infty in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) that converges to f\\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), \\\\lim olimits_{k\\\\to \\\\infty} T(f_i) = T(f);Even though the topology of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is not metrizable, a linear functional on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is continuous if and only if it is sequentially continuous. 7. is sequentially continuous at the origin; i.e. for every sequence \\\\\\\\{f_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^\\\\infty in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) that converges to 0\\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), \\\\lim olimits_{k\\\\to \\\\infty} T(f_i) = 0; 8. The kernel of is a closed subspace of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U); 9. The graph of is a closed; 10. For every compact subset K\\\\subset U there exist constants C>0 and N\\\\in\\\\N such that for all f\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(K), :T(f)\\\\le C \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\partial^{p} f(x): x\\\\in U, \\\\alpha\\\\leq N \\\\\\\\}; 11. For every compact subset K\\\\subset U there exist constants C_K>0 and N_K\\\\in\\\\N such that for all f\\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) with support contained in K,See for example . : T(f)\\\\le C_K \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\partial^\\\\alpha f(x): x\\\\in K, \\\\alpha\\\\leq N_K \\\\\\\\}; 12. For any compact subset K\\\\subset U and any sequence \\\\\\\\{f_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^\\\\infty in C^{\\\\infty}(K), if \\\\\\\\{\\\\partial^{p} f_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges uniformly to zero for all multi-indices , then T(f_i) \\\\to 0; 13. Any of the three statements immediately above (i.e. statements 10, 11, and 12) but with the additional requirement that compact set belongs to . Since the canonical LF topology is locally convex there are many collections of (necessarily continuous) seminorms on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) that define the canonical LF topology of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U). Proposition. If is a linear functional on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) then the following are equivalent: 1. T is continuous; 2. There exists a continuous seminorm on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) such that T\\\\le g; 3. There exists a constant , a collection of continuous seminorms, \\\\mathcal{P}, that defines the canonical LF topology of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), and a finite subset \\\\\\\\{g_1, \\\\ldots, g_m\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{P} such that T\\\\le C(g_1 + \\\\cdots g_m);If \\\\mathcal{P} is also directed under the usual function comparison then we can take the finite collection to consist of a single element.  Topology on the space of distributions  The topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets is also called the strong dual topology.In functional analysis, the strong dual topology is often the \\"standard\\" or \\"default\\" topology placed on the continuous dual space X', where if is a normed space then this strong dual topology is the same as the usual norm- induced topology on X'. This topology is chosen because it is with this topology that \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) becomes a nuclear Montel space and it is with this topology that the kernels theorem of Schwartz holds.See for example . No matter what dual topology is placed on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U),Technically, the topology must be coarser than the strong dual topology and also simultaneously be finer that the weak* topology. a sequence of distributions converges in this topology if and only if it converges pointwise (although this need not be true of a net). No matter which topology is chosen, \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) will be a non-metrizable, locally convex topological vector space. The space \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is separable and has the strong Pytkeev propertyGabriyelyan, S.S. Kakol J., and¬∑Leiderman, A. \\"The strong Pitkeev property for topological groups and topological vector spaces\\" but it is neither a k-space nor a sequential space, which in particular implies that it is not metrizable and also that its topology can not be defined using only sequences.  Topological properties  ;Topological vector space categories The canonical LF topology makes C_c^k(U) into a complete distinguished strict LF- space (and a strict LB-space if and only if ), which implies that C_c^k(U) is a meager subset of itself. Furthermore, C_c^k(U), as well as its strong dual space, is a complete Hausdorff locally convex barrelled bornological Mackey space. The strong dual of C_c^k(U) is a Fr√©chet space if and only if so in particular, the strong dual of C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), which is the space \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) of distributions on , is not metrizable (note that the weak-* topology on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) also isn't metrizable and moreover, it further lacks almost all of the nice properties that the strong dual topology gives \\\\mathcal{D}'(U)). The three spaces C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), C^{\\\\infty}(U), and the Schwartz space \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n), as well as the strong duals of each of these three spaces, are complete nuclear Montel bornological spaces, which implies that all six of these locally convex spaces are also paracompact reflexive barrelled Mackey spaces. The spaces C^{\\\\infty}(U) and \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) are both distinguished Fr√©chet spaces. Moreover, both C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) and \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) are Schwartz TVSs.  Convergent sequences  ;Convergent sequences and their insufficiency to describe topologies The strong dual spaces of C^{\\\\infty}(U) and \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) are sequential spaces but not Fr√©chet-Urysohn spaces. Moreover, neither the space of test functions C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) nor its strong dual \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is a sequential space (not even an Ascoli space),Gabriyelyan, Saak \\"Topological properties of Strict LF-spaces and strong duals of Montel Strict LF-spaces\\" (2017)T. Shirai, Sur les Topologies des Espaces de L. Schwartz, Proc. Japan Acad. 35 (1959), 31-36. which in particular implies that their topologies can not be defined entirely in terms of convergent sequences. A sequence (f_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} in C_c^k(U) converges in C_c^k(U) if and only if there exists some such that C^k(K) contains this sequence and this sequence converges in C^k(K); equivalently, it converges if and only if the following two conditions hold:According to 1. There is a compact set containing the supports of all f_i. 2. For each multi-index , the sequence of partial derivatives \\\\partial^\\\\alpha f_{i} tends uniformly to \\\\partial^\\\\alpha f. Neither the space C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) nor its strong dual \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is a sequential space, and consequently, their topologies can not be defined entirely in terms of convergent sequences. For this reason, the above characterization of when a sequence converges is not enough to define the canonical LF topology on C_c^{\\\\infty}(U). The same can be said of the strong dual topology on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). ;What sequences do characterize Nevertheless, sequences do characterize many important properties, as we now discuss. It is known that in the dual space of any Montel space, a sequence converges in the strong dual topology if and only if it converges in the weak* topology, which in particular, is the reason why a sequence of distributions converges (in the strong dual topology) if and only if it converges pointwise (this leads many authors to use pointwise convergence to actually define the convergence of a sequence of distributions; this is fine for sequences but it does not extend to the convergence of nets of distributions since a net may converge pointwise but fail to convergence in the strong dual topology). Sequences characterize continuity of linear maps valued in locally convex space. Suppose is a locally convex bornological space (such as any of the six TVSs mentioned earlier). Then a linear map into a locally convex space that maps null sequencesA null sequence is a sequence that converges to the origin. in to bounded subsets of Recall that a linear map is bounded if and only if it maps null sequences to bounded sequences. is necessarily continuous. So in particular, if a linear map into a locally convex space is sequentially continuous at the origin then it is continuous. However, this does not necessarily extend to non-linear maps and/or to maps valued in topological spaces that are not locally convex TVSs. For every k\\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is sequentially dense in C_c^k(U). Furthermore, \\\\\\\\{ D_{\\\\phi} : \\\\phi\\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U)\\\\\\\\} is a sequentially dense subset of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) (with its strong dual topology) and also a sequentially dense subset of the strong dual space of C^{\\\\infty}(U). ;Sequences of distributions A sequence of distributions (T_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges with respect to the weak-* topology on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) to a distribution if and only if :\\\\langle T_{i}, f \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\langle T, f \\\\rangle for every test function f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(U). For example, if f_m:\\\\R\\\\to\\\\R is the function :f_m(x) = \\\\begin{cases} m & \\\\text{if } x \\\\in [0,\\\\frac{1}{m}] \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} and is the distribution corresponding to f_m, then :\\\\langle T_m, f \\\\rangle = m \\\\int_0^{\\\\frac{1}{m}} f(x)\\\\, dx \\\\to f(0) = \\\\langle \\\\delta, f \\\\rangle as , so in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R). Thus, for large , the function f_m can be regarded as an approximation of the Dirac delta distribution. ;Other properties * The strong dual space of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is TVS isomorphic to C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) via the canonical TVS-isomorphism C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to (\\\\mathcal{D}'(U))'_{b} defined by sending f \\\\in C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) to value at f (i.e. to the linear functional on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) defined by sending d \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) to d(f)); * On any bounded subset of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), the weak and strong subspace topologies coincide; the same is true for C_c^{\\\\infty}(U); * Every weakly convergent sequence in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is strongly convergent (although this does not extend to nets).  Localization of distributions  There is no way to define the value of a distribution in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) at a particular point of . However, as is the case with functions, distributions on restrict to give distributions on open subsets of . Furthermore, distributions are locally determined in the sense that a distribution on all of can be assembled from a distribution on an open cover of satisfying some compatibility conditions on the overlaps. Such a structure is known as a sheaf. = Restrictions to an open subset = Let and be open subsets of \\\\R^n with . Let E_{VU}: \\\\mathcal{D}(V) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) be the operator which extends by zero a given smooth function compactly supported in to a smooth function compactly supported in the larger set . The transpose of E_{VU} is called the restriction mapping and is denoted by \\\\rho_{VU} := {}^{t}E_{VU} : \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(V). The map E_{VU} : \\\\mathcal{D}(V) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is a continuous injection where if then it is not a topological embedding and its range is not dense in \\\\mathcal{D}(U), which implies that this map's transpose is neither injective nor surjective and that the topology that E_{VU} transfers from \\\\mathcal{D}(V) onto its image is strictly finer than the subspace topology that \\\\mathcal{D}(U) induces on this same set. A distribution S\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}'(V) is said to be extendible to if it belongs to the range of the transpose of E_{VU} and it is called extendible if it is extendable to \\\\R^n. For any distribution T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}'(U), the restriction is a distribution in \\\\mathcal{D}'(V) defined by: :\\\\forall \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(V): \\\\qquad \\\\langle \\\\rho_{VU} T, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle T, E_{VU} \\\\phi \\\\rangle. Unless , the restriction to is neither injective nor surjective. Lack of surjectivity follows since distributions can blow up towards the boundary of . For instance, if and , then the distribution :T(x) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} n \\\\, \\\\delta\\\\left(x-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right) is in \\\\mathcal{D}'(V) but admits no extension to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). = Gluing and distributions that vanish in a set = Let be an open subset of . T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is said to vanishes in if for all f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) such that \\\\operatorname{supp}(f) \\\\subset V we have Tf = 0. vanishes in if and only if the restriction of to is equal to 0, or equivalently, if and only if lies in the kernel of the restriction map . :Corollary. Let (U_i)_{i \\\\in I} be a collection of open subsets of \\\\R^n and let T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\cup_{i \\\\in I} U_i). if and only if for each i \\\\in I, the restriction of to U_i is equal to 0. :Corollary. The union of all open subsets of in which a distribution vanishes is an open subset of in which vanishes. = Support of a distribution = This last corollary implies that for every distribution on , there exists a unique largest subset of such that vanishes in (and doesn't vanish in any open subset of that is not contained in ); the complement in of this unique largest open subset is called the support of . Thus :\\\\operatorname{supp}(T) = U \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup \\\\\\\\{V \\\\mid \\\\rho_{VU}T = 0\\\\\\\\}. If f is a locally integrable function on and if D_f is its associated distribution, then the support of D_f is the smallest closed subset of in the complement of which f is almost everywhere equal to 0. If f is continuous, then the support of D_f is equal to the closure of the set of points in at which f doesn't vanish. The support of the distribution associated with the Dirac measure at a point x_0 is the set \\\\\\\\{ x_0 \\\\\\\\}. If the support of a test function f does not intersect the support of a distribution then . A distribution is 0 if and only if its support is empty. If f\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U) is identically 1 on some open set containing the support of a distribution then . If the support of a distribution is compact then it has finite order and furthermore, there is a constant C and a non-negative integer N such that: :\\\\forall \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U): \\\\qquad T \\\\phi\\\\leq C\\\\\\\\phi\\\\_{N} := C \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi(x) \\\\right: x \\\\in U, \\\\alpha\\\\leq N \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. If has compact support then it has a unique extension to a continuous linear functional \\\\widehat{T} on C^{\\\\infty}(U); this functional can be defined by \\\\widehat{T} (f) := T(\\\\psi f), where \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is any function that is identically 1 on an open set containing the support of . If S, T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and \\\\lambda eq 0 then \\\\operatorname{supp}(S + T) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp}(S) \\\\cup \\\\operatorname{supp}(T) and \\\\operatorname{supp}(\\\\lambda T) = \\\\operatorname{supp}(T). Thus, distributions with support in a given subset A \\\\subset U form a vector subspace of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U); such a subspace is weakly closed in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) if and only if A is closed in . Furthermore, if P is a differential operator in , then for all distributions on and all f\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U) we have \\\\operatorname{supp} (P(x, \\\\partial)T) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp}(T) and \\\\operatorname{supp}(fT) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp}(f) \\\\cap \\\\operatorname{supp}(T). = Distributions with compact support = ;Support in a point set and Dirac measures For any x \\\\in U, let \\\\delta_x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) denote the distribution induced by the Dirac measure at x. For any x_0 \\\\in U and distribution T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), the support of is contained in \\\\\\\\{ x_0 \\\\\\\\} if and only if is a finite linear combination of derivatives of the Dirac measure at x_0. If in addition the order of is \\\\leq k then there exist constants \\\\alpha_p such that: :T = \\\\sum_{p\\\\leq k} \\\\alpha_p \\\\partial^{p} \\\\delta_{x_0}. Said differently, if has support at a single point \\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}, then is in fact a finite linear combination of distributional derivatives of the function at . That is, there exists an integer and complex constants such that : T = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha\\\\le m} a_\\\\alpha \\\\partial^\\\\alpha(\\\\tau_P\\\\delta) where \\\\tau_P is the translation operator. ;Distribution with compact support ;Distributions of finite order with support in an open subset = Global structure of distributions = The formal definition of distributions exhibits them as a subspace of a very large space, namely the topological dual of \\\\mathcal{D}(U) (or the Schwartz space \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary. ;Distributions as sheafs  Decomposition of distributions as sums of derivatives of continuous functions  By combining the above results, one may express any distribution on as the sum of a series of distributions with compact support, where each of these distributions can in turn be written as a finite sum of distributional derivatives of continuous functions on . In other words for arbitrary T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) we can write: :T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{p \\\\in P_i} \\\\partial^{p} f_{ip}, where P_1, P_2, \\\\ldots are finite sets of multi- indices and the functions f_{ip} are continuous. Note that the infinite sum above is well-defined as a distribution. The value of for a given f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) can be computed using the finitely many that intersect the support of f.  Operations on distributions  Many operations which are defined on smooth functions with compact support can also be defined for distributions. In general, if A:\\\\mathcal{D}(U)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{D}(U) is a linear map which is continuous with respect to the weak topology, then it is possible to extend to a map A : \\\\mathcal{D}'(U)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) by passing to the limit.This approach works for non-linear mappings as well, provided they are assumed to be uniformly continuous. = Preliminaries: Transpose of a linear operator = Operations on distributions and spaces of distributions are often defined by means of the transpose of a linear operator because it provides a unified approach that the many definitions in the theory of distributions and because of its many well-known topological properties.; . In general the transpose of a continuous linear map A: X \\\\to Y is the linear map {}^{t}A : Y' \\\\to X' defined by {}^{t}A(y') := y' \\\\circ u, or equivalently, it is the unique map satisfying \\\\langle y', A(x)\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle {}^{t}A (y'), x \\\\right\\\\rangle for all x \\\\in X and all y' \\\\in Y'. Since is continuous, the transpose {}^{t}A : Y' \\\\to X' is also continuous when both duals are endowed with their respective strong dual topologies; it is also continuous when both duals are endowed with their respective weak* topologies (see the articles polar topology and dual system for more details). In the context of distributions, the characterization of the transpose can be refined slightly. Let A : \\\\mathcal{D}(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) be a continuous linear map. Then by definition, the transpose of is the unique linear operator A^t : \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) that satisfies: :\\\\langle {}^{t}A(T), \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle T, A(\\\\phi) \\\\rangle for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) and all T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). However, since the image of \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is dense in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), it is sufficient that the above equality hold for all distributions of the form T= D_{\\\\psi} where \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). Explicitly, this means that the above condition holds if and only if the condition below holds: :\\\\langle {}^{t}A(D_{\\\\psi}), \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle D_{\\\\psi}, A(\\\\phi) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi, A(\\\\phi) \\\\rangle = \\\\int_U \\\\psi (A\\\\phi) \\\\,dx for all \\\\phi, \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). = Differential operators =  Differentiation of distributions  Let A:\\\\mathcal{D}(U)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is the partial derivative operator \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_k}. In order to extend A we compute its transpose: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\langle {}^{t}A(D_{\\\\psi}), \\\\phi \\\\rangle &= \\\\int_U \\\\psi (A\\\\phi) \\\\,dx && \\\\text{See above} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_U \\\\psi \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= -\\\\int_U \\\\phi \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x_k}\\\\, dx && \\\\text{Integration by parts} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= -\\\\left \\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x_k}, \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= -\\\\langle A \\\\psi, \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} Therefore {}^{t}A=-A. Therefore the partial derivative of T with respect to the coordinate x_k is defined by the formula :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x_k}, \\\\phi \\\\right\\\\rangle = - \\\\left\\\\langle T, \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_{k}} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\qquad \\\\text{for all } \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). With this definition, every distribution is infinitely differentiable, and the derivative in the direction x_k is a linear operator on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). More generally, if \\\\alpha is an arbitrary multi-index, then the partial derivative \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}T of the distribution T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is defined by :\\\\langle \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}T, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = (-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\langle T, \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\qquad \\\\text{for all } \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). Differentiation of distributions is a continuous operator on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U); this is an important and desirable property that is not shared by most other notions of differentiation. If is a distribution in then :\\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{T - \\\\tau_x T}{x} = T'\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R), where T' is the derivative of and is translation by ; thus the derivative of may be viewed as a limit of quotients.  Differential operators acting on smooth functions  A linear differential operator in with smooth coefficients acts on the space of smooth functions on U. Given \\\\textstyle P := \\\\sum olimits_{\\\\alpha} c_{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} we would like to define a continuous linear map, D_P that extends the action of P on C^{\\\\infty}(U) to distributions on U. In other words we would like to define D_P such that the following diagram commutes: :\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) & \\\\stackrel{D_P}{\\\\longrightarrow} & \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\uparrow & & \\\\uparrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^{\\\\infty}(U) & \\\\stackrel{P}{\\\\longrightarrow} & C^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\end{matrix} Where the vertical maps are given by assigning f \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U) its canonical distribution D_f\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), which is defined by: D_f(\\\\phi) = \\\\langle f, \\\\phi \\\\rangle for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). With this notation the diagram commuting is equivalent to: :\\\\forall f \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U): \\\\qquad D_{P(f)} = D_PD_f. In order to find D_P we consider the transpose {}^{t}P: \\\\mathcal{D}'(U)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) of the continuous induced map P:\\\\mathcal{D}(U)\\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) defined by \\\\phi \\\\mapsto P(\\\\phi). As discussed above we may calculate the transpose using: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\forall \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(U):\\\\quad \\\\left \\\\langle {}^{t}P(D_{f}), \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\int_U f(x) P(\\\\phi)(x) \\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_U f(x) \\\\left [\\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha c_{\\\\alpha}(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi)(x) \\\\right ] \\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha \\\\int_U f(x) c_{\\\\alpha}(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi)(x) \\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha (-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}(c_{\\\\alpha}f))(x) \\\\,d x \\\\end{align} For the last line we used integration by parts combined with the fact that \\\\phi and therefore all the functions f (x)c_{\\\\alpha} (x) \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi(x) have compact support.For example let U = \\\\R and take P to be the ordinary derivative for functions of one real variable and assume the support of \\\\phi to be contained in the finite interval (a,b), then since \\\\operatorname{supp}(\\\\phi)\\\\subset (a,b) :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{\\\\R}\\\\phi'(x)f(x)\\\\,dx &= \\\\int_a^b \\\\phi'(x)f(x) \\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\phi(x)f(x)\\\\big\\\\vert_{a}^{b} - \\\\int_{a}^{b} f'(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\,d x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\phi(b)f(b) - \\\\phi(a)f(a) - \\\\int_{a}^{b} f'(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\,d x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{a}^{b} f'(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\,d x \\\\end{align} where the last equality is because \\\\phi(a) = \\\\phi(b) = 0. Continuing the calculation above we have \\\\forall \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(U): :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left \\\\langle {}^{t}P(D_{f}), \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle &=\\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha (-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}(c_{\\\\alpha}f))(x) \\\\,dx && \\\\text{As shown above} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha (-1)^{\\\\alpha} (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}(c_{\\\\alpha}f))(x)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left[\\\\sum_{\\\\gamma \\\\le \\\\alpha} \\\\binom{\\\\alpha}{\\\\gamma} (\\\\partial^{\\\\gamma}c_{\\\\alpha})(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha-\\\\gamma}f)(x) \\\\right] \\\\,dx && \\\\text{Leibniz rule}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\left [\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\sum_{\\\\gamma \\\\le \\\\alpha} (-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\binom{\\\\alpha}{\\\\gamma} (\\\\partial^{\\\\gamma}c_{\\\\alpha})(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha-\\\\gamma}f)(x)\\\\right ] \\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\left [ \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left [ \\\\sum_{\\\\beta \\\\geq \\\\alpha} (-1)^{\\\\beta} \\\\binom{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} \\\\left(\\\\partial^{\\\\beta-\\\\alpha}c_{\\\\beta}\\\\right)(x) \\\\right ] (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}f)(x)\\\\right ] \\\\,dx && \\\\text{Grouping terms by derivatives of } f \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\left [\\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha b_{\\\\alpha}(x) (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}f)(x) \\\\right ] \\\\, dx && b_{\\\\alpha}:=\\\\sum_{\\\\beta \\\\geq \\\\alpha} (-1)^{\\\\beta} \\\\binom{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial^{\\\\beta-\\\\alpha}c_{\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\left (\\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha b_{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\right ) (f), \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} We now define the formal transpose of P, which we'll denote by P_* to avoid confusion with the transpose map, to be the following differential operator on : :P_* := \\\\sum olimits_\\\\alpha b_{\\\\alpha} \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} The computations above have shown that: :Lemma. Let P be a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients in U. Then for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) we have ::\\\\left \\\\langle {}^{t}P(D_{f}), \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle D_{P_*(f)}, \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle, :which is equivalent to: ::{}^{t}P(D_{f}) = D_{P_*(f)}. The Lemma combined with the fact that the formal transpose of the formal transpose is the original differential operator, i.e. P_{}= P, enables us to arrive at the correct definition: the formal transpose induces the (continuous) canonical linear operator P_* : C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) defined by \\\\phi \\\\mapsto P_*(\\\\phi). We claim that the transpose of this map, {}^{t}P_* : \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), can be taken as D_P. To see this we compute how it acts on a distribution of the form D_f with f \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U): :\\\\begin{align} \\\\forall \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(U):\\\\quad \\\\left \\\\langle {}^{t}P_*(D_f),\\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\left \\\\langle D_{P_{}(f)}, \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle && \\\\text{Using Lemma above with } P_* \\\\text{ in place of } P\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left \\\\langle D_{P(f)}, \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle && P_{}= P \\\\end{align} We call the continuous linear operator D_P:={}^{t}P_* : \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) the differential operator on distributions extending . Its action on an arbitrary distribution S is defined via: :\\\\forall \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(U):\\\\quad D_{P}(S)(\\\\phi) = S(P_*(\\\\phi)). If (T_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) then for every multi-index \\\\alpha, (\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}T_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U).  Multiplication of distributions by smooth functions  A differential operator of order 0 is just multiplication by a smooth function. And conversely, if f is a smooth function then P := f(x) is a differential operator of order 0, whose formal transpose is itself (i.e. P_* = P). The induced differential operator D_{P}: \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) maps a distribution to a distribution denoted by fT := D_{P}(T). We have thus defined the multiplication of a distribution by a smooth function. We now give an alternative presentation of multiplication by a smooth function. If m: U \\\\to \\\\R is a smooth function and is a distribution on , then the product mT is defined by :\\\\langle mT, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle T, m\\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\qquad \\\\text{for all } \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U). This definition coincides with the transpose definition since if M:\\\\mathcal{D}(U)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{D}(U) is the operator of multiplication by the function (i.e., (M\\\\phi)(x)=m(x)\\\\phi(x)), then :\\\\int_U (M \\\\phi)(x) \\\\psi(x)\\\\,dx = \\\\int_U m(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\psi(x)\\\\,d x = \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) m(x) \\\\psi(x) \\\\,d x = \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) (M \\\\psi)(x)\\\\,d x, so that {}^tM=M. Under multiplication by smooth functions, \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is a module over the ring C^\\\\infty(U). With this definition of multiplication by a smooth function, the ordinary product rule of calculus remains valid. However, a number of unusual identities also arise. For example, if is the Dirac delta distribution on , then , and if is the derivative of the delta distribution, then :m\\\\delta' = m(0) \\\\delta' - m' \\\\delta = m(0) \\\\delta' - m'(0) \\\\delta. The bilinear multiplication map C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) given by (f,T)\\\\mapsto fT is not continuous; it is however, hypocontinuous. Example. For any distribution , the product of with the function that is identically on is equal to . Example. Suppose (f_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} is a sequence of test functions on that converges to the constant function 1 \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U). For any distribution on , the sequence (f_i T)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). If (T_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and (f_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to f\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(U) then (f_i T_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} converges to fT \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). = Problem of multiplying distributions = It is easy to define the product of a distribution with a smooth function, or more generally the product of two distributions whose singular supports are disjoint. With more effort it is possible to define a well-behaved product of several distributions provided their wave front sets at each point are compatible. A limitation of the theory of distributions (and hyperfunctions) is that there is no associative product of two distributions extending the product of a distribution by a smooth function, as has been proved by Laurent Schwartz in the 1950s. For example, if p.v. is the distribution obtained by the Cauchy principal value :\\\\forall \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R): \\\\qquad \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{p.v.}\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)(\\\\phi) = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_{x\\\\ge\\\\varepsilon} \\\\frac{\\\\phi(x)}{x}\\\\, dx. If is the Dirac delta distribution then :(\\\\delta \\\\times x) \\\\times \\\\operatorname{p.v.} \\\\frac{1}{x} = 0 but :\\\\delta \\\\times \\\\left(x \\\\times \\\\operatorname{p.v.} \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = \\\\delta so the product of a distribution by a smooth function (which is always well defined) cannot be extended to an associative product on the space of distributions. Thus, nonlinear problems cannot be posed in general and thus not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. In more than two spacetime dimensions the problem is related to the regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. This does not solve the problem in other situations. Many other interesting theories are non linear, like for example the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations of fluid dynamics. Several not entirely satisfactory theories of algebras of generalized functions have been developed, among which Colombeau's (simplified) algebra is maybe the most popular in use today. Inspired by Lyons' rough path theory, Martin Hairer proposed a consistent way of multiplying distributions with certain structure (regularity structures), available in many examples from stochastic analysis, notably stochastic partial differential equations. See also Gubinelli‚ÄìImkeller‚ÄìPerkowski (2015) for a related development based on Bony's paraproduct from Fourier analysis. = Composition with a smooth function = Let be a distribution on U. Let be an open set in \\\\R^n, and . If is a submersion, it is possible to define :T \\\\circ F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(V). This is the composition of the distribution with , and is also called the pullback of along , sometimes written :F^\\\\sharp : T \\\\mapsto F^\\\\sharp T = T \\\\circ F. The pullback is often denoted F*, although this notation should not be confused with the use of '*' to denote the adjoint of a linear mapping. The condition that be a submersion is equivalent to the requirement that the Jacobian derivative of is a surjective linear map for every . A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for extending to distributions is that be an open mapping.See for example . The inverse function theorem ensures that a submersion satisfies this condition. If is a submersion, then is defined on distributions by finding the transpose map. Uniqueness of this extension is guaranteed since is a continuous linear operator on \\\\mathcal{D}(U). Existence, however, requires using the change of variables formula, the inverse function theorem (locally) and a partition of unity argument.See . In the special case when is a diffeomorphism from an open subset of \\\\R^n onto an open subset of \\\\R^n change of variables under the integral gives :\\\\int_V \\\\phi\\\\circ F(x) \\\\psi(x)\\\\,dx = \\\\int_U \\\\phi(x) \\\\psi \\\\left (F^{-1}(x) \\\\right ) \\\\left \\\\det dF^{-1}(x) \\\\right \\\\,dx. In this particular case, then, is defined by the transpose formula: :\\\\left \\\\langle F^\\\\sharp T, \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle T, \\\\left \\\\det d(F^{-1}) \\\\right \\\\phi\\\\circ F^{-1} \\\\right \\\\rangle. = Convolution = Under some circumstances, it is possible to define the convolution of a function with a distribution, or even the convolution of two distributions. Recall that if f and are functions on \\\\R^n then we denote by f\\\\ast g the convolution of f and , defined at x\\\\in\\\\R^n to be the integral :(f \\\\ast g)(x) := \\\\int_{\\\\R^{n}} f(x-y) g(y) \\\\,dy = \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} f(y)g(x-y) \\\\,dy provided that the integral exists. If 1 \\\\leq p, q, r \\\\leq \\\\infty are such that 1/r = (1/p) + (1/q) - 1 then for any functions f\\\\in L^p(\\\\R^n) and g\\\\in L^q(\\\\R^n) we have f \\\\ast g \\\\in L^r(\\\\R^n) and \\\\f \\\\ast g\\\\_{L^{r}} \\\\leq \\\\f\\\\_{L^{p}} \\\\g\\\\_{L^{q}}. If f and are continuous functions on \\\\R^n, at least one of which has compact support, then \\\\operatorname{supp}(f \\\\ast g) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp} (f) + \\\\operatorname{supp} (g) and if A\\\\subset\\\\R^n then the value of f\\\\ast g on do not depend on the values of f outside of the Minkowski sum A -\\\\operatorname{supp} (g) = \\\\\\\\{ a - s : a \\\\in A, s \\\\in \\\\operatorname{supp}(g)\\\\\\\\}. Importantly, if g\\\\in L^1(\\\\R^n) has compact support then for any 0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq \\\\infty, the convolution map f \\\\mapsto f \\\\ast g is continuous when considered as the map C^k(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C^k(\\\\R^n) or as the map C_c^k(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C_c^k(\\\\R^n). ;Translation and symmetry Given a\\\\in\\\\R^n, the translation operator sends f : \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\C to \\\\tau_a f : \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\C, defined by \\\\tau_a f(y) = f(y-a). This can be extended by the transpose to distributions in the following way: given a distribution , the translation of by is the distribution \\\\tau_a T : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\C defined by \\\\tau_a T(\\\\phi) := \\\\left\\\\langle T, \\\\tau_{-a} \\\\phi \\\\right\\\\rangle.See for example . Given f : \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\C, define the function \\\\tilde{f} : \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\C by \\\\tilde{f}(x) := f(-x). Given a distribution , let \\\\tilde{T} : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\C be the distribution defined by \\\\tilde{T}(\\\\phi) := T \\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}\\\\right). The operator T \\\\mapsto \\\\tilde{T} is called the symmetry with respect to the origin.  Convolution of a test function with a distribution  Convolution with f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) defines a linear map: :\\\\begin{cases} C_f : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_f(g) := f \\\\ast g \\\\end{cases} which is continuous with respect to the canonical LF space topology on \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n). Convolution of f with a distribution T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) can be defined by taking the transpose of Cf relative to the duality pairing of \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) with the space \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) of distributions. If f,g,\\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n), then by Fubini's theorem :\\\\langle C_fg, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\int_{\\\\R^n}\\\\phi(x)\\\\int_{\\\\R^n}f(x-y) g(y) \\\\,dy \\\\,dx = \\\\left \\\\langle g,C_{\\\\tilde{f}}\\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle. Extending by continuity, the convolution of f with a distribution is defined by :\\\\langle f \\\\ast T, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle T, \\\\tilde{f} \\\\ast \\\\phi \\\\right \\\\rangle, for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n). An alternative way to define the convolution of a test function f and a distribution is to use the translation operator . The convolution of the compactly supported function f and the distribution is then the function defined for each x\\\\in\\\\R^n by :(f \\\\ast T)(x) = \\\\left \\\\langle T, \\\\tau_x \\\\tilde{f} \\\\right \\\\rangle. It can be shown that the convolution of a smooth, compactly supported function and a distribution is a smooth function. If the distribution has compact support then if f is a polynomial (resp. an exponential function, an analytic function, the restriction of an entire analytic function on \\\\C^n to \\\\R^n, the restriction of an entire function of exponential type in \\\\C^n to \\\\R^n) then the same is true of T \\\\ast f. If the distribution has compact support as well, then f\\\\ast T is a compactly supported function, and the Titchmarsh convolution theorem implies that :\\\\operatorname{ch}(\\\\operatorname{supp}(f \\\\ast T)) = \\\\operatorname{ch}(\\\\operatorname{supp}(f)) + \\\\operatorname{ch} (\\\\operatorname{supp}(T)) where ch denotes the convex hull and supp denotes the support.  Convolution of a smooth function with a distribution  Let f\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) and T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) and assume that at least one of f and has compact support. The convolution of f and , denoted by f \\\\ast T or by T \\\\ast f, is the smooth function: :\\\\begin{cases}f \\\\ast T: \\\\R^n \\\\to \\\\C \\\\\\\\\\\\ (f \\\\ast T)(x) := \\\\left\\\\langle T, \\\\tau_{x}\\\\tilde{f} \\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\end{cases} Satisfying: :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\operatorname{supp}(f \\\\ast T) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp}(f)+ \\\\operatorname{supp}(T) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &\\\\forall p\\\\in \\\\N^n: \\\\quad \\\\begin{cases} \\\\partial^{p} \\\\left\\\\langle T, \\\\tau_x \\\\tilde{f} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle T, \\\\partial^{p} \\\\tau_{x} \\\\tilde{f} \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\partial^{p} (T \\\\ast f) = (\\\\partial^{p} T) \\\\ast f = T \\\\ast (\\\\partial^{p} f)\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} If is a distribution then the map f \\\\mapsto T \\\\ast f is continuous as a map \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) where if in addition has compact support then it is also continuous as the map C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) and continuous as the map \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n). If L : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n) is a continuous linear map such that L \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\phi = \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha}L \\\\phi for all \\\\alpha and all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) then there exists a distribution T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) such that L \\\\phi = T \\\\circ \\\\phi for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n). Example. Let H be the Heaviside function on . For any \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R), :(H \\\\ast \\\\phi)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{x} \\\\phi(t) \\\\, dt. Let \\\\delta be the Dirac measure at 0 and \\\\delta' its derivative as a distribution. Then \\\\delta' \\\\ast H = \\\\delta and 1 \\\\ast \\\\delta' = 0. Importantly, the associative law fails to hold: :1 = 1 \\\\ast \\\\delta = 1 \\\\ast (\\\\delta' \\\\ast H ) eq (1 \\\\ast \\\\delta') \\\\ast H = 0 \\\\ast H = 0.  Convolution of distributions  It is also possible to define the convolution of two distributions and on \\\\R^n, provided one of them has compact support. Informally, in order to define where has compact support, the idea is to extend the definition of the convolution to a linear operation on distributions so that the associativity formula :S \\\\ast (T \\\\ast \\\\phi) = (S \\\\ast T) \\\\ast \\\\phi continues to hold for all test functions \\\\phi. proves the uniqueness of such an extension. It is also possible to provide a more explicit characterization of the convolution of distributions. Suppose that and are distributions and that has compact support. Then the linear maps :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{S} : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f \\\\mapsto f \\\\ast \\\\tilde{S}\\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{cases} \\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{T} : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n)\\\\\\\\\\\\ f \\\\mapsto f \\\\ast \\\\tilde{T}\\\\end{cases} are continuous. The transposes of these maps, :{}^{t}\\\\left(\\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{S}\\\\right) : \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) \\\\qquad {}^{t}\\\\left(\\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{T}\\\\right) : \\\\mathcal{E}'(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) are consequently continuous and one may show that :{}^{t}\\\\left(\\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{S}\\\\right)(T) = {}^{t}\\\\left(\\\\bullet \\\\ast \\\\tilde{T}\\\\right)(S). This common value is called the convolution of and and it is a distribution that is denoted by S \\\\ast T or T \\\\ast S. It satisfies \\\\operatorname{supp} (S \\\\ast T) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{supp}(S) + \\\\operatorname{supp}(T). If and are two distributions, at least one of which has compact support, then for any a\\\\in\\\\R^n, \\\\tau_a(S \\\\ast T) = \\\\left(\\\\tau_a S\\\\right) \\\\ast T = S \\\\ast \\\\left(\\\\tau_a T\\\\right). If is a distribution in \\\\R^n and if \\\\delta is a Dirac measure then T \\\\ast \\\\delta = T. Suppose that it is that has compact support. For \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) consider the function :\\\\psi(x) = \\\\langle T, \\\\tau_{-x} \\\\phi \\\\rangle. It can be readily shown that this defines a smooth function of , which moreover has compact support. The convolution of and is defined by :\\\\langle S \\\\ast T, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle S, \\\\psi \\\\rangle. This generalizes the classical notion of convolution of functions and is compatible with differentiation in the following sense: for every multi-index , :\\\\partial^\\\\alpha(S \\\\ast T) = (\\\\partial^\\\\alpha S) \\\\ast T = S \\\\ast (\\\\partial^\\\\alpha T). The convolution of a finite number of distributions, all of which (except possibly one) have compact support, is associative. This definition of convolution remains valid under less restrictive assumptions about and .See for instance and . The convolution of distributions with compact support induces a continuous bilinear map \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\times \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}' defined by (S,T) \\\\mapsto S * T, where \\\\mathcal{E}' denotes the space of distributions with compact support. However, the convolution map as a function \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\times \\\\mathcal{D}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}' is not continuous although it is separately continuous. The convolution maps \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{D}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}' and \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{D}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) given by (f, T) \\\\mapsto f * T both fail to be continuous. Each of these non-continuous maps is, however, separately continuous and hypocontinuous.  Convolution versus multiplication  In general, regularity is required for multiplication products and locality is required for convolution products. It is expressed in the following extension of the Convolution Theorem which guarantees the existence of both convolution and multiplication products. Let F(\\\\alpha) = f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}'_C be a rapidly decreasing tempered distribution or, equivalently, F(f) = \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_M be an ordinary (slowly growing, smooth) function within the space of tempered distributions and let F be the normalized (unitary, ordinary frequency) Fourier transform then, according to , :F(f * g) = F(f) \\\\cdot F(g) :F(\\\\alpha \\\\cdot g) = F(\\\\alpha) * F(g) hold within the space of tempered distributions. In particular, these equations become the Poisson Summation Formula if g \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{\\\\text{–®}} is the Dirac Comb. The space of all rapidly decreasing tempered distributions is also called the space of convolution operators \\\\mathcal{O}'_C and the space of all ordinary functions within the space of tempered distributions is also called the space of multiplication operators \\\\mathcal{O}_M. More generally, F(\\\\mathcal{O}'_C) = \\\\mathcal{O}_M and F(\\\\mathcal{O}_M) = \\\\mathcal{O}'_C. A particular case is the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem which states that F(\\\\mathcal{E}') = \\\\operatorname{PW} and F(\\\\operatorname{PW} ) = \\\\mathcal{E}'. This is because \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{O}'_C and \\\\operatorname{PW} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{O}_M. In other words, compactly supported tempered distributions \\\\mathcal{E}' belong to the space of convolution operators \\\\mathcal{O}'_C and Paley-Wiener functions \\\\operatorname{PW}, better known as bandlimited functions, belong to the space of multiplication operators \\\\mathcal{O}_M. For example, let g \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{\\\\text{–®}} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}' be the Dirac comb and f \\\\equiv \\\\delta \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}' be the Dirac delta then \\\\alpha \\\\equiv 1 \\\\in \\\\operatorname{PW} is the function that is constantly one and both equations yield the Dirac comb identity. Another example is to let g be the Dirac comb and f \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{rect} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}' be the rectangular function then \\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{sinc} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{PW} is the sinc function and both equations yield the Classical Sampling Theorem for suitable \\\\operatorname{rect} functions. More generally, if g is the Dirac comb and f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{O}'_C \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{O}_M is a smooth window function (Schwartz function), e.g. the Gaussian, then \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} is another smooth window function (Schwartz function). They are known as mollifiers, especially in partial differential equations theory, or as regularizers in physics because they allow turning generalized functions into regular functions. = Tensor product of distributions = Let U\\\\subset \\\\R^m and V\\\\subset\\\\R^n be open sets. Assume all vector spaces to be over the field \\\\mathbb{F}, where \\\\mathbb{F}=\\\\R or \\\\C. For f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U \\\\times V) we define the following family of functions: :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\begin{cases} f_{x} : V \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F} \\\\\\\\\\\\y \\\\mapsto f(x,y) \\\\end{cases} \\\\right x \\\\in U\\\\right \\\\\\\\}, \\\\qquad \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\begin{cases} f^{y} : U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\mapsto f(x,y)\\\\end{cases}\\\\right y \\\\in V\\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Given S \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(V) we define the following functions: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\langle S, f^{\\\\bullet}\\\\rangle : V \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F} \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\mapsto \\\\langle S, f^{y} \\\\rangle \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\begin{cases} \\\\langle T, f_{\\\\bullet}\\\\rangle : U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\mapsto \\\\langle T, f_{x} \\\\rangle \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Note that \\\\langle T, f_{\\\\bullet}\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U) and \\\\langle S, f^{\\\\bullet}\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(V). Now we define the following continuous linear maps associated to S and T: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) i S &\\\\longrightarrow \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal{D}(U \\\\times V) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(V) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f \\\\mapsto \\\\langle S, f^{\\\\bullet} \\\\rangle\\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\mathcal{D}'(V) i T &\\\\longrightarrow \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal{D}(U \\\\times V) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}(U) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f \\\\mapsto \\\\langle T, f_{\\\\bullet} \\\\rangle\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Moreover if either S (resp. T) has compact support then it also induces a continuous linear map of C^{\\\\infty}(U \\\\times V) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(V) (resp. C^{\\\\infty}(U \\\\times V) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(U)). Definition. The tensor product of S \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(V), denoted by S \\\\otimes T or T \\\\otimes S, is a distribution in U \\\\times V and is defined by: :(S \\\\otimes T)(f) := \\\\langle S, \\\\langle T, f_{\\\\bullet} \\\\rangle \\\\rangle = \\\\langle T, \\\\langle S, f^{\\\\bullet}\\\\rangle \\\\rangle.  Schwartz kernel theorem  The tensor product defines a bilinear map :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\mathcal{D}'(U) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{D}'(V) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U \\\\times V)\\\\\\\\\\\\ (S,T) \\\\mapsto S \\\\otimes T\\\\end{cases} the span of the range of this map is a dense subspace of its codomain. Furthermore, \\\\operatorname{supp} (S \\\\otimes T) = \\\\operatorname{supp}(S) \\\\times \\\\operatorname{supp}(T). Moreover (S,T) \\\\mapsto S \\\\otimes T induces continuous bilinear maps: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{E}'(U) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{E}'(V) &\\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}'(U \\\\times V) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^m) \\\\times \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n) &\\\\to \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^{m + n}) \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathcal{E}' denotes the space of distributions with compact support and \\\\mathcal{S} is the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions. This result doesn't hold for Hilbert spaces such as L^2 and its dual space. Why does such a result hold for the space of distributions and test functions but not for other \\"nice\\" spaces like the Hilbert space L^2? This question led Alexander Grothendieck to discover nuclear spaces, nuclear maps, and the injective tensor product. He ultimately showed that it is precisely because \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is a nuclear space that the Schwartz kernel theorem holds.  Spaces of distributions  For all and all , all of the following canonical injections are continuous and have a range that is dense in their codomain: :\\\\begin{matrix} C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) & \\\\to & C_c^k(U) & \\\\to & C_c^0(U) & \\\\to & L_c^{\\\\infty}(U) & \\\\to & L_c^p(U) & \\\\to & L_c^1(U)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow & &\\\\downarrow && \\\\downarrow && && && \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^{\\\\infty}(U) & \\\\to & C^k(U) & \\\\to & C^0(U) && && && \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} where the topologies on L_c^{q}(U) (1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq \\\\infty) are defined as direct limits of the spaces L_c^q(K) in a manner analogous to how the topologies on C_c^k(U) were defined (so in particular, they are not the usual norm topologies). The range of each of the maps above (and of any composition of the maps above) is dense in the codomain. Indeed, C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is even sequentially dense in every C_c^k(U). All of the canonical injections C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to L^p(U) (1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq \\\\infty) are continuous and the range of this injection is dense in the codomain if and only if p eq \\\\infty (here L^p(U) has its usual norm topology). Suppose that X is one of the spaces C_c^k(U) (k\\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}) or L^p_c(U) (1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq \\\\infty) or L^p(U) (1 \\\\leq p < \\\\infty). Since the canonical injection \\\\operatorname{In}_X : C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to X is a continuous injection whose image is dense in the codomain, the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}_X : X'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) = (C_c^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b is a continuous injection. This transpose thus allows us to identify X' with a certain vector subspace of the space of distributions. This transpose map is not necessarily a TVS-embedding so that topology that this map transfers to the image \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\left({}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}_X\\\\right) is finer than the subspace topology that this space inherits from \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). A linear subspace of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) carrying a locally convex topology that is finer than the subspace topology induced by \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) = (C_c^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b is called a space of distributions. Almost all of the spaces of distributions mentioned in this article arise in this way (e.g. tempered distribution, restrictions, distributions of order \\\\leq some integer, distributions induced by a positive Radon measure, distributions induced by an L^p-function, etc.) and any representation theorem about the dual space of may, through the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}_X : X'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), be transferred directly to elements of the space \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\left({}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}_X\\\\right). = Radon measures = The natural inclusion \\\\operatorname{In} : C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to C_c^0(U) is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In} : (C_c^0(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) = (C_c^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b is also a continuous injection. Note that the continuous dual space (C_c^0(U))'_b can be identified as the space of Radon measures, where there is a one-to-one correspondence between the continuous linear functionals T \\\\in (C_c^0(U))'_b and integral with respect to a Radon measure; that is, * if T \\\\in (C_c^0(U))'_b then there exists a Radon measure \\\\mu on such that for all f \\\\in C_c^0(U), T(f) = \\\\textstyle \\\\int_{U} f \\\\, d\\\\mu, and * if \\\\mu is a Radon measure on then the linear functional on C_c^0(U) defined by C_c^0(U) i f \\\\mapsto \\\\textstyle \\\\int_{U} f \\\\, d\\\\mu is continuous. Through the injection {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In} : (C_c^0(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), every Radon measure becomes a distribution on . If f is a locally integrable function on then the distribution \\\\phi \\\\mapsto \\\\textstyle \\\\int_U f(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\, dx is a Radon measure; so Radon measures form a large and important space of distributions. The following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of Radon measures, which shows that every Radon measure can be written as a sum of derivatives of locally L^{\\\\infty} functions in : :Theorem. Suppose T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) is a Radon measure, is a neighborhood of the support of , and I = \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in \\\\N^n : p\\\\leq k\\\\\\\\}. There exists is a family of locally L^{\\\\infty} functions in such that ::T = \\\\sum_{p\\\\leq k} \\\\partial^p \\\\mu_p :and for very p \\\\in I, \\\\operatorname{supp} \\\\mu_p \\\\subset V. ;Positive Radon measures A linear function on a space of functions is called positive if whenever a function f that belongs to the domain of is non- negative (i.e. f is real-valued and f \\\\geq 0) then T( f ) \\\\geq 0. One may show that every positive linear functional on C_c^0(U) is necessarily continuous (i.e. necessarily a Radon measure).Note that Lebesgue measure is an example of a positive Radon measure.  Locally integrable functions as distributions  One particularly important class of Radon measures are those that are induced locally integrable functions. The function f:U\\\\to\\\\R is called locally integrable if it is Lebesgue integrable over every compact subset of .For more information on such class of functions, see the entry on locally integrable functions. This is a large class of functions which includes all continuous functions and all Lp functions. The topology on \\\\mathcal{D}(U) is defined in such a fashion that any locally integrable function f yields a continuous linear functional on \\\\mathcal{D}(U) ‚Äì that is, an element of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) ‚Äì denoted here by , whose value on the test function \\\\phi is given by the Lebesgue integral: :\\\\langle T_f, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\int_U f \\\\phi\\\\,dx. Conventionally, one abuses notation by identifying with f, provided no confusion can arise, and thus the pairing between and \\\\phi is often written :\\\\langle f, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle T_f, \\\\phi \\\\rangle. If f and are two locally integrable functions, then the associated distributions and are equal to the same element of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) if and only if f and are equal almost everywhere (see, for instance, ). In a similar manner, every Radon measure Œº on defines an element of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) whose value on the test function \\\\phi is \\\\textstyle\\\\int\\\\phi \\\\,d\\\\mu. As above, it is conventional to abuse notation and write the pairing between a Radon measure and a test function \\\\phi as \\\\langle \\\\mu, \\\\phi \\\\rangle. Conversely, as shown in a theorem by Schwartz (similar to the Riesz representation theorem), every distribution which is non-negative on non-negative functions is of this form for some (positive) Radon measure. ;Test functions as distributions The test functions are themselves locally integrable, and so define distributions. The space of test functions C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is sequentially dense in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) with respect to the strong topology on \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). This means that for any T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U), there is a sequence of test functions, (\\\\phi_i)_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}, that converges to T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}'(U) (in it's strong dual topology) when considered as a sequence of distributions. Or equivalently, :\\\\forall \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}(U): \\\\qquad \\\\langle \\\\phi_i, \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\langle T, \\\\psi \\\\rangle. Furthermore, C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) is also sequentially dense in the strong dual space of C^{\\\\infty}(U). = Distributions with compact support = The natural inclusion \\\\operatorname{In}: C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to C^{\\\\infty}(U) is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (C^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) = (C_c^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b is also a continuous injection. Thus the image of the transpose, denoted by \\\\mathcal{E}'(U), forms a space of distributions when it is endowed with the strong dual topology of (C^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b (transferred to it via the transpose map {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (C^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}'(U), so the topology of \\\\mathcal{E}'(U) is finer than the subspace topology that this set inherits from \\\\mathcal{D}'(U)). The elements of \\\\mathcal{E}'(U) = (C^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b can be identified as the space of distributions with compact support. Explicitly, if is a distribution on then the following are equivalent, * T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}'(U); * the support of is compact; * the restriction of T to C_c^{\\\\infty}(U), when that space is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from C^{\\\\infty}(U) (a coarser topology than the canonical LF topology), is continuous; * there is a compact subset of such that for every test function \\\\phi whose support is completely outside of , we have T(\\\\phi)=0. Compactly supported distributions define continuous linear functionals on the space C^{\\\\infty}(U); recall that the topology on C^{\\\\infty}(U) is defined such that a sequence of test functions \\\\phi_k converges to 0 if and only if all derivatives of \\\\phi_k converge uniformly to 0 on every compact subset of . Conversely, it can be shown that every continuous linear functional on this space defines a distribution of compact support. Thus compactly supported distributions can be identified with those distributions that can be extended from C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) to C^{\\\\infty}(U). = Distributions of finite order = Let k \\\\in\\\\N. The natural inclusion \\\\operatorname{In}: C_c^{\\\\infty}(U) \\\\to C_c^k(U) is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (C_c^k(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) = (C_c^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b is also a continuous injection. Thus, the image of {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}, denoted by \\\\mathcal{D}'^{k}(U), forms a space of distributions when it is endowed with the strong dual topology of (C_c^k(U))'_b (transferred to it via the transpose map {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (C^{\\\\infty}(U))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'^{k}(U), so \\\\mathcal{D}'^{m}(U)'s topology is finer than the subspace topology that this set inherits from \\\\mathcal{D}'(U)). The elements of \\\\mathcal{D}'^{k}(U) are the distributions of order ‚â§ k. Note that the distributions of order ‚â§ 0, which are also called distributions of order 0, are exactly the distributions that are Radon measures (described above). For 0 eq k \\\\in \\\\N, a distribution of order is a distribution of order that is not a distribution of order . A distribution is said to be of finite order if there is some integer such that it is a distribution of order , and the set of distributions of finite order is denoted by \\\\mathcal{D}'^{F}(U). Note that if then \\\\mathcal{D}'^{k}(U) \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{D}'^{l}(U) so that \\\\mathcal{D}'^{F}(U) is a vector subspace of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) and furthermore, if and only if \\\\mathcal{D}'^{F}(U) = \\\\mathcal{D}'(U). ;Structure of distributions of finite order Every distribution with compact support in is a distribution of finite order. Indeed, every distribution in is locally a distribution of finite order, in the following sense: If is an open and relatively compact subset of and if \\\\rho_{VU} is the restriction mapping from to , then the image of \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) under \\\\rho_{VU} is contained in \\\\mathcal{D}'^{F}(V). The following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of finite order, which shows that every distribution of finite order can be written as a sum of derivatives of Radon measures: :Theorem. Suppose T\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(U) has finite order and I =\\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in \\\\N^n : p\\\\leq k\\\\\\\\}. Given any open subset of containing the support of , there is a family of Radon measures in , (\\\\mu_p)_{p \\\\in I}, such that for very p \\\\in I, \\\\operatorname{supp}(\\\\mu_p) \\\\subset V and ::T = \\\\sum_{p\\\\leq k} \\\\partial^p \\\\mu_p. Example. (Distributions of infinite order) Let and for every test function f, let :S f := \\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty} (\\\\partial^{m} f)\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\right). Then is a distribution of infinite order on . Moreover, can not be extended to a distribution on ; that is, there exists no distribution on such that the restriction of to is equal to . = Tempered distributions and Fourier transform = Below we define tempered distributions which form a subspace of \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n), the space of distributions on \\\\R^n. This is a proper subspace: while every tempered distribution is a distribution and an element of \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n), the converse is not true. Tempered distributions are useful if one studies the Fourier transform since all tempered distributions have a Fourier transform, which is not true for an arbitrary distributions in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n). ;Schwartz space The Schwartz space, \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n), is the space of all smooth functions that are rapidly decreasing at infinity along with all partial derivatives. Thus \\\\phi:\\\\R^n\\\\to\\\\R is in the Schwartz space provided that any derivative of \\\\phi, multiplied with any power of , converges to 0 as . These functions form a complete TVS with a suitably defined family of seminorms. More precisely, for any multi-indices Œ± and Œ≤ define: :p_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta} (\\\\phi) = \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\R^n} \\\\left x^\\\\alpha \\\\partial^\\\\beta \\\\phi(x) \\\\right . Then \\\\phi is in the Schwartz space if all the values satisfy: :p_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta} (\\\\phi) < \\\\infty. The family of seminorms defines a locally convex topology on the Schwartz space. For n = 1, the seminorms are, in fact, norms on the Schwartz space. One can also use the following family of seminorms to define the topology: :f_{m,k} = \\\\sup_{p\\\\le m} \\\\left(\\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\R^n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(1+x)^k \\\\left(\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} f)(x) \\\\right\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right), \\\\qquad k,m \\\\in \\\\N. Otherwise, one can define a norm on \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) via :\\\\\\\\phi \\\\_{k} = \\\\max_{\\\\alpha+ \\\\beta\\\\leq k} \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\R^n} \\\\leftx^\\\\alpha \\\\partial^\\\\beta \\\\phi(x)\\\\right, \\\\qquad k \\\\ge 1. The Schwartz space is a Fr√©chet space (i.e. a complete metrizable locally convex space). Because the Fourier transform changes \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} into multiplication by x^{\\\\alpha} and vice versa, this symmetry implies that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function. A sequence \\\\\\\\{f_i\\\\\\\\} in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) converges to 0 in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) if and only if the functions (1 + x)^k (\\\\partial^p f_i)(x) converge to 0 uniformly in the whole of \\\\R^n, which implies that such a sequence must converge to zero in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\R^n). \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) is dense in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n). The subset of all analytic Schwartz functions is dense in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) as well. The Schwartz space is nuclear and the tensor product of two maps induces a canonical surjective TVS-isomorphisms :\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^m) \\\\ \\\\widehat{\\\\otimes}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^{m + n}), where \\\\widehat{\\\\otimes} represents the completion of the injective tensor product (which in this case is the identical to the completion of the projective tensor product). ;Tempered distributions The natural inclusion \\\\operatorname{In}: \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n) is also a continuous injection. Thus, the image of the transpose map, denoted by \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n), forms a space of distributions when it is endowed with the strong dual topology of (\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n))'_b (transferred to it via the transpose map {}^{t}\\\\operatorname{In}: (\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n))'_b \\\\to \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n), so the topology of \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n) is finer than the subspace topology that this set inherits from \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n)). The space \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n) is called the space of tempered distributions is it is the continuous dual of the Schwartz space. Equivalently, a distribution is a tempered distribution if and only if :\\\\left (\\\\forall \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\N^n: \\\\lim_{m\\\\to \\\\infty} p_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta} (\\\\phi_m) = 0 \\\\right ) \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\lim_{m\\\\to \\\\infty} T(\\\\phi_m)=0. The derivative of a tempered distribution is again a tempered distribution. Tempered distributions generalize the bounded (or slow-growing) locally integrable functions; all distributions with compact support and all square-integrable functions are tempered distributions. More generally, all functions that are products of polynomials with elements of L^p(\\\\R^n) for are tempered distributions. The tempered distributions can also be characterized as slowly growing, meaning that each derivative of grows at most as fast as some polynomial. This characterization is dual to the rapidly falling behaviour of the derivatives of a function in the Schwartz space, where each derivative of \\\\phi decays faster than every inverse power of . An example of a rapidly falling function is x^n\\\\exp (-\\\\lambda x^\\\\beta) for any positive , , . ;Fourier transform To study the Fourier transform, it is best to consider complex-valued test functions and complex-linear distributions. The ordinary continuous Fourier transform F : \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) is a TVS-automorphism of the Schwartz space, and we will define the Fourier transform to be its transpose {}^{t}F : \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n), which (abusing notation) will again be denoted by . So the Fourier transform of the tempered distribution is defined by for every Schwartz function . is thus again a tempered distribution. The Fourier transform is a TVS isomorphism from the space of tempered distributions onto itself. This operation is compatible with differentiation in the sense that :F \\\\dfrac{dT}{dx} = ixFT and also with convolution: if is a tempered distribution and is a slowly increasing smooth function on \\\\R^n, is again a tempered distribution and :F(\\\\psi T) = F \\\\psi * FT is the convolution of and . In particular, the Fourier transform of the constant function equal to 1 is the distribution. ;Expressing tempered distributions as sums of derivatives If T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\R^n) is a tempered distribution, then there exists a constant , and positive integers and such that for all Schwartz functions \\\\phi\\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\R^n) :\\\\langle T, \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\le C\\\\sum olimits_{\\\\alpha\\\\le N, \\\\beta\\\\le M}\\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\R^n} \\\\left x^\\\\alpha \\\\partial^\\\\beta \\\\phi(x) \\\\right =C\\\\sum olimits_{\\\\alpha\\\\le N, \\\\beta\\\\le M} p_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta}(\\\\phi). This estimate along with some techniques from functional analysis can be used to show that there is a continuous slowly increasing function and a multi-index such that :T = \\\\partial^\\\\alpha F. Restriction of distributions to compact sets If T \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}'(\\\\R^n), then for any compact set K\\\\subset\\\\R^n, there exists a continuous function compactly supported in \\\\R^n (possibly on a larger set than itself) and a multi-index such that T = \\\\partial^\\\\alpha F on C_c^{\\\\infty}(K).  Using holomorphic functions as test functions  The success of the theory led to investigation of the idea of hyperfunction, in which spaces of holomorphic functions are used as test functions. A refined theory has been developed, in particular Mikio Sato's algebraic analysis, using sheaf theory and several complex variables. This extends the range of symbolic methods that can be made into rigorous mathematics, for example Feynman integrals.

The game consists of each panellist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The aim is to be the first to announce \\"Mornington Crescent\\", a station on the Northern line. Interspersed with the turns is humorous discussion amongst the panellists and host regarding the rules and legality of each move, as well as the strategy the panellists are using.  Origins  Mornington Crescent first appeared in the opening episode of the sixth series of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, broadcast on 22 August 1978. Although five episodes transmitted in 1974‚Äì1975 are still lost, Mornington Crescent seems to have made no appearance before 1978. It was played in every surviving episode of the sixth series. The origins of the game are not clear. One claim is that it was invented by Geoffrey Perkins,The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts, Pan Publishing. who stated in an interview that Mornington Crescent was created as a non- game.Loose Ends, BBC Radio 4, Saturday 22 March 2008 Barry Cryer, a panellist on the programme since 1972, has said that Geoffrey Perkins did not invent the game, and that it had been around since the sixties.Radio 4 Today programme interview. According to Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton, the game was invented to vex a series producer who was unpopular with the panellists. One day, the team members were drinking, when they heard him coming. \\"Quick,\\" said one, \\"let's invent a game with rules he'll never understand.\\" A similar game called \\"Finchley Central\\" was described in the Spring 1969 issue of the mathematical magazine Manifold, edited by Ian Stewart and John Jaworski at the University of Warwick. Douglas Hofstadter referred to the article in his book Metamagical Themas. The game is referred to as an \\"English game\\" in an article on \\"non- games\\" as follows: > Two players alternate naming the stations of the London Underground. The > first to say \\"Finchley Central\\" wins. It is clear that the \\"best\\" time to > say \\"Finchley Central\\" is exactly before your opponent does. Failing that, > it is good that he should be considering it. You could, of course, say > \\"Finchley Central\\" on your second turn. In that case, your opponent puffs on > his cigarette and says, \\"Well,...\\" Shame on you. Gameplay on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Panellists taking part at a BBC Radio recording of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Mornington Crescent gameplay involves announcing random place names in London, usually a station on the Underground system, for humorous effect The objective of Mornington Crescent is to give the appearance of a game of skill and strategy, with complex and long-winded rules and strategies, to parody games in which similarly circuitous systems have evolved. The rules are fictional, and its appeal to audiences lies in the ability of players to create an entertaining illusion of competitive gameplay. Humorous variations to the rules have been introduced to games. Humphrey Lyttelton would describe special rules to apply to that session, such as \\"Trumpington's Variations\\" or \\"Tudor Court Rules\\", so that almost every episode featuring Mornington Crescent introduced a variant. In one of them, first introduced in North Yorkshire, a player whose movement is blocked is considered to be \\"in Nidd\\" and is forced to remain in place for the next three moves. This tends to block the other players, putting them into Nidd as well and causing a roadblock. In one episode, every player ended up in Nidd and the rule had to be suspended so that the round could continue. Over time, the destinations named by the panellists expanded beyond the Underground, in accordance with various regional expansions of the game. ISIHAC is recorded around the United Kingdom, and the game is occasionally modified accordingly. There have been versions in Slough and Leeds, as well as one in Scotland, played during the Edinburgh Fringe arts festival and a 2016 recording in Glasgow (where the name was changed to \\"Morningside Crescent\\")I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, BBC Radio Collection #2, Volume 6. and another variation played at recordings in Wales (called \\"Morgantown Crescent\\"). In one episode, recorded in Luton, panellists named locations as far afield as the Place de l'√âtoile in Paris, Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg, and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. However, a move to Luton High Street was ruled invalid for being too remote. In other episodes, an attempt was supposedly made to expand the territory to Manhattan (via Heathrow and JFK) but there was some disagreement as to whether or not the New York City Subway system was suited to the game. References have been made in various episodes of ISIHAC to international versions of the game, including \\"Mornington Croissant\\", supposedly based on the Paris M√©tro, and \\"Mornington Peninsula\\", the Australian variant. At least one full game of Mornington Croissant was played on air. A regular feature that introduces Mornington Crescent is a letters section which begins with the chairman's comments (\\"I notice from the sheer weight of this week's postbag, we've received a little over no letters\\" and \\"I see from the number of letters raining down on us this week that the Scrabble factory has exploded again\\"). The selected letter each week is invariably from \\"A Mrs. Trellis of North Wales\\", whose incoherent letters usually mistake the chairman for another Radio 4 presenter or media personality. \\"Dear Libby,\\" (she writes), \\"why oh why ... very nearly spells YOYO\\", or \\"Dear Mr. Titchmarsh, never let them tell you that size isn't important. My aunt told me that, but then all my new wallpaper fell off.\\"  Further popularity  A blue plaque commemorating Willie Rushton in Mornington Crescent station Finchley Central and Mornington Crescent have been played as a play-by-mail pastime, and in the 1980s were played by post in a number of play-by-mail magazines. One format involved a series of elimination rounds, with everyone except the winner of the current round going forward onto the next. A \\"type-in\\" computer version of the game for the BBC Microcomputer was included in the April 1985 edition of The Micro User. Mornington Crescent can now be played online, in the spirit of the radio series. Games are played by fans on Usenet, in diverse web forums, and on the London Underground itself. A Facebook application has also been produced. When Mornington Crescent Underground station was reopened in 1998 after six years of closure for lift repairs, London Transport invited the Clue team to perform an opening ceremony. A memorial plaque to the late Willie Rushton, one of the show's longest-serving panelists, was installed at the station in 2002.  Spin-offs and publications  At Christmas 1984, Radio 4 broadcast a special programme, Everyman's Guide to Mornington Crescent, a \\"two-part documentary\\" on the history of the game and its rules, presented by Raymond Baxter. At the end of part one (concentrating on the history), it was announced that part two (about the rules) had been postponed due to \\"scheduling difficulties\\". Another documentary was broadcast on Christmas Eve 2005. It was named In Search of Mornington Crescent, and narrated by Andrew Marr. This has since also been released on a BBC Audiobook CD. Two books of rules and history have been published, The Little Book of Mornington Crescent (2001; ), by Graeme Garden, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Barry Cryer and Humphrey Lyttelton, and Stovold's Mornington Crescent Almanac (2001; ), by Graeme Garden. A board game (of sorts) variant has been developed by web developer Kevan Davis and its rules are available on his website.  Cultural references  * The Steep Approach to Garbadale, by Iain Banks, mentions Mornington Crescent as a game created by the fictional company Wopuld Ltd., described as being \\"based on the map of the London underground with a complicated double-level board\\". * It was featured in an XKCD comic on April Fools' Day (1 April) 2018. * A song by Belle and Sebastian entitled \\"Mornington Crescent\\" appears on their 2006 release The Life Pursuit. * Mornington Crescent is the title of a 1995 album by the band My Life Story.

He was elected as a Democrat as president of the City Council in 1945, and reelected in 1949. When Mayor William O'Dwyer resigned in 1950, he became acting mayor. He lost the Democratic primary for the nomination for a full term but was subsequently elected mayor on a new ticket, the \\"Experience Party\\". He lost the Democratic primary when he ran for reelection in 1953, and became a judge in 1954.Kenneth T. Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City (2010) p 644 Early life Born Vincenzo ImpellitteriBirth record of Vincenzo Impellitteri in Isnello, Sicily, and moved with his family to the United States as an infant in 1901. They settled in Ansonia, Connecticut, where Impellitteri spent most of his youth. He enlisted in the United States Navy for World War I and served as a radioman with the rank of petty officer third class on board the destroyer USS Stockton, which was based in Queenstown, Ireland and performed convoy escort and antisubmarine duty. He left the Navy after the war and became a U.S. citizen in 1922. Impellitteri attended Fordham Law School, where he received his law degree in 1924. He married Elizabeth (Betty) Agnes McLaughlin in 1926. He served as a state Assistant District Attorney from 1929 to 1938 before becoming a clerk to two Supreme Court Justices, first Peter Schmuck, and later Joseph A. Gavagan. He was reportedly a close associate of gangster Tommy Lucchese, who helped Impellitteri's rise in politics. On the other hand, a report in the New York World-Telegram indicated that Impelliteri opposed organized crime and corruption, and had failed to rise through the city Democratic Party's ranks because he had \\"the injudicious good taste to snub Frank Costello\\", the gambler and racketeer who was said to control the Tammany Hall organization behind the scenes. In 1945, Mayor William O'Dwyer picked Impellitteri to run for President of the City Council on the Tammany Hall slate. In 1945 he ran on the Democratic and American Labor Party lines, but when he was up for reelection in 1949 he ran on the Democratic Party line alone. Mayor of New York City On August 31, 1950, O'Dwyer, pursued by both federal and state investigators, was suddenly appointed by President Harry S. Truman as ambassador to Mexico, where he would be beyond the reach of officials who wanted his public testimony in several matters on which he preferred not to speak. Under the City Charter of the day, when O'Dwyer resigned, City Council President Impellitteri became acting mayor. The Tammany bosses did not think he was mayor material, and they refused to nominate him as the Democratic candidate for the special election in November 1950, which instead went to highly regarded New York State Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora, who was also given the Liberal line. Impellitteri ignored the machine and ran as an independent under the banner of the new \\"Experience Party\\". He also popularized the phrase \\"unbought and unbossed\\" during his 1950 campaign. Impellitteri was the first mayor since the consolidation of greater New York in 1898 who was elected without a major party's ballot line, and his election was a populist uprising against the political system. * Vincent Impellitteri (Experience Party) 1,161,175 votes * Ferdinand Pecora (Democratic/Liberal) 935,351 * Edward Corsi (Republican) 382,372 * Paul L. Ross (American Labor) 147,578 Impellitteri's inauguration, held on November 14, 1950, absent either a band or a platform, was both swift and simple. Outside City Hall, he pledged to \\"do my level best to justify the confidence you have reposed in me.\\" Shortly after Impellitteri's succession, the Kings County District Attorney arrested bookie Harry Gross and launched a corruption investigation that ultimately caused nearly 500 police officers of all ranks to resign, retire, or be fired. Impellitteri opposed the corruption, vigorously supporting the Brooklyn District Attorney, Miles McDonald, and firing anyone in his administration who had been associated with former Mayor William O'Dwyer. Impellitteri is credited with trying to rein in the budget, raising the bus and subway fare to fifteen cents, establishing parking meters on city streets for enhanced revenue and increasing the sales tax. He aspired to be a new light in city politics, but his administration met with some resistance from the established order. At the time Robert Moses wielded significant influence; according to Robert Caro (in his Moses biography The Power Broker), Moses provided Impellitteri regular advice and guidance behind the scenes, and Impellitteri deferred to Moses. The mayor's 1950 visit to his birthplace in Sicily was documented by the Italian author Carlo Levi. (Translation by Angus Davidson of Le Parole Sono Pietre: Tre Giornate in Sicilia, 1955.) Impellitteri ran for a full term in 1953 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by then Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner, Jr..

A flamboyant politician, he was a liberal Democrat and part of the powerful Tammany Hall machine. He was forced to resign during a corruption scandal. Early life and political career Walker was the son of Irish-born William H. Walker (1842‚Äì1916), a carpenter and lumberyard owner who was very active in local politics as a Democratic assemblyman and alderman from Greenwich Village, belying certain accounts of Walker's childhood that stated he grew up in poverty. Walker was not the best of students and dropped out of college before eventually graduating from New York Law School in 1904. Walker's father wanted him to become a lawyer and politician. Walker at first decided that he would rather write songs and be involved in the music industry but he eventually entered politics in 1909 and subsequently passed the bar exam in 1912.Connolly, James. \\"Walker, James J.\\", American National Biography, Oxford University Press, February 1, 2000. Walker was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 5th D.) in 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1915 to 1925, sitting in the 138th, 139th, 140th, 141st (all four 13th D.), 142nd, 143rd, 144th, 145th, 146th, 147th and 148th New York State Legislatures (all seven 12th D.); and was Minority Leader from 1920 to 1922; Temporary President of the State Senate from 1923 to 1924; and Minority Leader again in 1925. In the Senate he strongly opposed Prohibition. Running for mayor, 1925 After his years in the Senate, Walker set his sights on the 1925 election for Mayor of New York. Beginning with the 1925 Democratic primary for mayor, Walker knew that to ultimately win the mayoral election he had to defeat the mayor, John Francis Hylan. Walker's reputation as a flamboyant man-about-town made him a hero to many working-class voters; he was often seen at legitimate theaters and illegitimate speakeasies. Walker was a clothes horse: his valet packed 43 suits for his trip to Europe in August 1927.David Wallace, Capital of the World: A Portrait of New Your City in the Roaring Twenties (2011) p. 11 On the other hand, his reputation for tolerating corruption made him suspect to middle-class and moralistic voters. Governor Alfred E. Smith was his mentor. Smith was a staunch supporter since Walker backed many social and cultural issues that were considered politically important such as social welfare legislation, legalization of boxing, repeal of blue laws against Sunday baseball games, condemning the Ku Klux Klan and especially their mutual opposition to Prohibition. Smith knew the secret to how Walker won the election, and overcoming his tarnished reputation was for Smith to guide Walker's every move. Smith used his base in the strong political machine of Tammany Hall to secure this victory. Finally, Walker himself had to be willing to change some of his more unscrupulous ways or at least provide a cover for his indiscretions. As with many of the things in Walker's life, he chose the latter. Instead of ending his visits to the speakeasies and his friendships with chorus girls, he took those activities behind the closed doors of a penthouse funded by Tammany Hall.Young, Greg. \\"Mayor Jimmy Walker: a finer class of corruption\\". The Bowery Boys: New York City History. Retrieved May 27, 2009. Walker defeated Hylan in the Democratic primary, and, after defeating Republican mayoral candidate Frank D. Waterman in the general election, he became mayor of New York. Mayor, 1926‚Äì1932 In his initial years as mayor, Walker saw the city prosper and many public works projects gain traction. In his first year, Walker created the Department of Sanitation, unified New York's public hospitals, improved many parks and playgrounds, and guided the Board of Transportation to enter into contract for the construction of an expanded subway system (the Independent Subway System or IND). Under Walker's administration, new highways and a dock for superliners were also built. He even managed to maintain the five-cent subway fare despite a threatened strike by the workers. Walker's term was also known for the proliferation of speakeasies during Prohibition. It is a noted aspect of his career as mayor and as a member of the State Senate that Walker was strongly opposed to Prohibition. As mayor, Walker led his administration in challenging the Eighteenth Amendment by replacing the police commissioner with an inexperienced former state banking commissioner. The new police commissioner immediately dissolved the Special Service Squad. Since Walker did not feel that drinking was a crime, he discouraged the police from enforcing Prohibition law or taking an active role unless it was to curb excessive violations or would prove to be newsworthy.Michael Lerner, Dry Manhattan (2008). pp. 160‚Äì70 His affairs with \\"chorus girls\\" were widely known, and he left his wife, Janet, for showgirl Betty Compton. The first U.S. arrival in New York City of best known Anastasia Romanov impostor, Anna Anderson, in 1928 and the eventual public denial of her by the exiled Romanovs and return to Germany in 1931 also occurred during Walker's mayoralty. Walker was re-elected by an overwhelming margin in 1929, defeating Socialist Norman Thomas. Walker's fortunes turned downward with the economy after the stock-market crash of 1929. Patrick Joseph Hayes, the Cardinal Archbishop of New York, denounced him, implying that the immorality of the mayor, both personal and political in tolerating \\"girlie magazines\\" and casinos was a cause of the economic downturn. It was one of the causes that led to Tammany Hall's pulling its support for Walker.Jackson, Kenneth T., Keller, Lisa; Flood, Nancy, eds. The Encyclopedia of New York City 2nd ed. Yale University Press, 2010. Scandal and resignation Increasing social unrest led to investigations into corruption within his administration, and he was eventually forced to testify before the investigative committee of Judge Samuel Seabury, the Seabury Commission (also known as the Hofstadter Committee). Walker caused his own downfall by accepting large sums of money from businessmen looking for municipal contracts. One surprise witness in the Seabury investigation was Vivian Gordon. She informed the investigators that women were falsely arrested and accused of prostitution by the New York City Police Department. Police officers were given more money in their paychecks. After her testimony, Gordon was suspiciously found strangled in a park in the Bronx. That demonstrated to New Yorkers that corruption could lead to terrible consequences and that Walker might ultimately, in some way, be responsible for her death.Golway, Terry. \\"The Making of F.D.R., 1932: A Rollicking New York Tale\\", The New York Observer, October 1, 2000. Retrieved November 3, 2013. With New York City appearing as a symbol of corruption under Mayor Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt knew he had to do something about Walker and his administration. Knowing that the state constitution could allow an elected mayor to be removed from office, Roosevelt felt compelled to do so but risked losing Tammany Hall's support for the Democratic nomination. On the other hand, if Roosevelt did nothing or let Walker off, the national newspapers would consider him weak. Facing pressure from Roosevelt, Walker eluded questions about his personal bank accounts, stating instead that the amounts he received were \\"beneficences\\" and not bribes. He delayed any personal appearances until after Roosevelt's nomination was secured. It was then that the embattled mayor could fight no longer. Months from his national election, Roosevelt decided that he must remove Walker from office. Walker agreed and resigned on September 1, 1932. He went on a grand tour of Europe with Compton, his Ziegfeld girl. He announced on November 12, 1932, while aboard the SS Conte Grande, that he had \\"no desire or intention of ever holding public office again.\\"United Press, \\"Walker Quits Political Life\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 13 November 1932, Volume 39, page 2. Walker stayed in Europe until the danger of criminal prosecution appeared remote. There, he married Compton. The grave of Jimmy Walker in Gate of Heaven Cemetery Later life and legacy After his return to the United States, Walker acted as head of Majestic Records, which included such popular performing artists as Louis Prima and Bud Freeman. He died at the age of 65 of a brain hemorrhage. He was interred in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. When Walker was a member of the New York State Senate, he sponsored the \\"Walker Law\\" to legalize boxing in New York. He was honored a number of times over the years by the boxing community. Walker is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and was given the Edward J. Neil Trophy in 1945 for his service to the sport. He also spent many summers in Atlantic Beach, NY, sometimes during his term as mayor, and after, as he was friends with the founder, William Austin In popular culture A romanticized version of Walker's tenure as mayor was presented in the 1957 film Beau James, starring Bob Hope. This was a somewhat accurate depiction of Walker, who during his time as mayor had become a symbol of the jazz age romanticism. The film was based on a biography of Walker, also titled Beau James, written by Gene Fowler. A song by Dean Martin, similarly titled \\"Beau James\\", presented a highly idealized and romantic interpretation of his tenure as mayor. A book was also the basis of Jimmy, a stage musical about Walker that had a brief Broadway run from October 1969 to January 1970. The show starred Frank Gorshin as Walker and Anita Gillette as Betty Compton. There is also a song about Walker in the stage musical Fiorello!, \\"Gentleman Jimmy\\".Fiorello!: Production Songs on the Internet Broadway Database Footage of Walker is used in the 1983 Woody Allen film Zelig, with Walker being one of the guests during Zelig's visit to William Randolph Hearst's mansion in San Simeon, California. The 1935 novel It Can't Happen Here, by Sinclair Lewis, lists the exiles in Paris as \\"Jimmy Walker, and a few ex-presidents from South America and Cuba\\".It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis. p. 349. Walker was referenced in \\"Last Call\\", the December 6, 2010, episode of the ABC television series Castle.

Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft, woof, or filling. (Weft is an old English word meaning \\"that which is woven\\"; compare leave and left.) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth. Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back strap loom, or other techniques without looms. The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave. The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves: plain weave, satin weave, or twill weave. Woven cloth can be plain (in one colour or a simple pattern), or can be woven in decorative or artistic design. Process and terminology In general, weaving involves using a loom to interlace two sets of threads at right angles to each other: the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft (older woof) that crosses it. One warp thread is called an end and one weft thread is called a pick. The warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other, typically in a loom. There are many types of looms. Weaving can be summarized as a repetition of these three actions, also called the primary motions of the loom. * Shedding: where the warp threads (ends) are separated by raising or lowering heald frames (heddles) to form a clear space where the pick can pass * Picking: where the weft or pick is propelled across the loom by hand, an air-jet, a rapier or a shuttle * Beating-up or battening: where the weft is pushed up against the fell of the cloth by the reed The warp is divided into two overlapping groups, or lines (most often adjacent threads belonging to the opposite group) that run in two planes, one above another, so the shuttle can be passed between them in a straight motion. Then, the upper group is lowered by the loom mechanism, and the lower group is raised (shedding), allowing to pass the shuttle in the opposite direction, also in a straight motion. Repeating these actions form a fabric mesh but without beating-up, the final distance between the adjacent wefts would be irregular and far too large. The secondary motions of the loom are the: * Let off motion: where the warp is let off the warp beam at a regulated speed to make the filling even and of the required design * Take up motion: takes up the woven fabric in a regulated manner so that the density of filling is maintained The tertiary motions of the loom are the stop motions: to stop the loom in the event of a thread break. The two main stop motions are the * Warp stop motion * Weft stop motion The principal parts of a loom are the frame, the warp-beam or weavers beam, the cloth-roll (apron bar), the heddles, and their mounting, the reed. The warp-beam is a wooden or metal cylinder on the back of the loom on which the warp is delivered. The threads of the warp extend in parallel order from the warp-beam to the front of the loom where they are attached to the cloth-roll. Each thread or group of threads of the warp passes through an opening (eye) in a heddle. The warp threads are separated by the heddles into two or more groups, each controlled and automatically drawn up and down by the motion of the heddles. In the case of small patterns the movement of the heddles is controlled by \\"cams\\" which move up the heddles by means of a frame called a harness; in larger patterns the heddles are controlled by a dobby mechanism, where the healds are raised according to pegs inserted into a revolving drum. Where a complex design is required, the healds are raised by harness cords attached to a Jacquard machine. Every time the harness (the heddles) moves up or down, an opening (shed) is made between the threads of warp, through which the pick is inserted. Traditionally the weft thread is inserted by a shuttle.. On a conventional loom, the weft thread is carried on a pirn, in a shuttle that passes through the shed. A handloom weaver could propel the shuttle by throwing it from side to side with the aid of a picking stick. The \\"picking\\" on a power loom is done by rapidly hitting the shuttle from each side using an overpick or underpick mechanism controlled by cams 80‚Äì250 times a minute. When a pirn is depleted, it is ejected from the shuttle and replaced with the next pirn held in a battery attached to the loom. Multiple shuttle boxes allow more than one shuttle to be used. Each can carry a different colour which allows banding across the loom. Weaving pattern cards used by Skye Weavers, Isle of Skye, Scotland The rapier-type weaving machines do not have shuttles, they propel the weft by means of small grippers or rapiers that pick up the filling thread and carry it halfway across the loom where another rapier picks it up and pulls it the rest of the way. Some carry the filling yarns across the loom at rates in excess of 2,000 metres per minute. Manufacturers such as Picanol have reduced the mechanical adjustments to a minimum, and control all the functions through a computer with a graphical user interface. Other types use compressed air to insert the pick. They are all fast, versatile and quiet. The warp is sized in a starch mixture for smoother running. The loom warped (loomed or dressed) by passing the sized warp threads through two or more heddles attached to harnesses. The power weavers loom is warped by separate workers. Most looms used for industrial purposes have a machine that ties new warps threads to the waste of previously used warps threads, while still on the loom, then an operator rolls the old and new threads back on the warp beam. The harnesses are controlled by cams, dobbies or a Jacquard head. A 3/1 twill weave, as used in denim The raising and lowering sequence of warp threads in various sequences gives rise to many possible weave structures: * Plain weave: plain, and hopsacks, poplin, taffeta, poult-de-soie, pibiones and grosgrain * Twill weave: these are described by weft float followed by warp float, arranged to give diagonal pattern; examples are 2/1 twill, 3/3 twill, or 1/2 twill. These are softer fabrics than plain weaves. * Satin weave: satins and sateens * Complex computer-generated interlacings, such as Jacquard fabric * Pile fabrics: fabrics with a surface of cut threads (a pile), such as velvets and velveteens Both warp and weft can be visible in the final product. By spacing the warp more closely, it can completely cover the weft that binds it, giving a warp faced textile such as repp weave.. Conversely, if the warp is spread out, the weft can slide down and completely cover the warp, giving a weft faced textile, such as a tapestry or a Kilim rug. There are a variety of loom styles for hand weaving and tapestry. History Weaving in ancient Egypt There are some indications that weaving was already known in the Paleolithic Era, as early as 27,000 years ago. An indistinct textile impression has been found at the Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice site. According to the find, the weavers of the Upper Palaeolithic were manufacturing a variety of cordage types, produced plaited basketry and sophisticated twined and plain woven cloth. The artifacts include imprints in clay and burned remnants of cloth. The oldest known textiles found in the Americas are remnants of six finely woven textiles and cordage found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru. The weavings, made from plant fibres, are dated between 10100 and 9080 BCE.Stacey, Kevin (13 April 2011). \\"Carbon dating identifies South America's oldest textiles\\".

Retrieved 6 October 2016. =Middle East and Africa= Dogon culture of Mali The earliest known Neolithic textile production in the Old World is supported by a 2013 find of a piece of cloth woven from hemp, in burial F. 7121 at the √áatalh√∂y√ºk site suggested to be from around 7000 B.C. Further finds come from the Neolithic civilisation preserved in the pile dwellings in Switzerland. Another extant fragment from the Neolithic was found in Fayum, at a site dated to about 5000 BCE. This fragment is woven at about 12 threads by 9 threads per centimetre in a plain weave. Flax was the predominant fibre in Egypt at this time (3600 BCE) and had continued popularity in the Nile Valley, though wool became the primary fibre used in other cultures around 2000 BCE. Weaving was known in all the great civilisations, but no clear line of causality has been established. Early looms required two people to create the shed and one person to pass through the filling. Early looms wove a fixed length of cloth, but later ones allowed warp to be wound out as the fell progressed. The weavers were often children or slaves. Weaving became simpler when the warp was sized. Around the 4th century BC, the cultivation of cotton and the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Mero√´ reached a high level. Export of textiles was one of the main sources of wealth for Kush. Aksumite King Ezana boasted in his inscription that he destroyed large cotton plantations in Mero√´ during his conquest of the region. =The Americas= An indigenous woman of the Maya Tzutujil culture weaves using a back-strap loom.

Silk that was intricately woven and dyed, showing a well developed craft, has been found in a Chinese tomb dating back to 2700 BCE. Silk weaving in China was an intricate process that was very involved. Men and women, usually from the same family, had their own roles in the weaving process. The actual work of weaving was done by both men and women. Women were often weavers since it was a way they could contribute to the household income while staying at home. Women would usually weave simpler designs within the household while men would be in charge of the weaving of more intricate and complex pieces of clothing. The process of sericulture and weaving emphasized the idea that men and women should work together instead of women being subordinate to men. Weaving became an integral part of Chinese women's social identity. Several rituals and myths were associated with the promotion of silk weaving, especially as a symbol of female power. Weaving contributed to the balance between men and women's economic contributions and had many economic benefits. There were many paths into the occupation of weaver. Women usually married into the occupation, belonged to a family of weavers and or lived in a location that had ample weather conditions that allowed for the process of silk weaving. Weavers usually belonged to the peasant class. Silk weaving became a specialized job requiring specific technology and equipment that was completed domestically within households. Although most of the silk weaving was done within the confines of the home and family, there were some specialized workshops that hired skilled silk weavers as well. These workshops took care of the weaving process, although the raising of the silkworms and reeling of the silk remained work for peasant families. The silk that was woven in workshops rather than homes were of higher quality, since the workshop could afford to hire the best weavers. These weavers were usually men who operated more complicated looms, such as the wooden draw-loom. This created a competitive market of silk weavers. The quality and ease of the weaving process depended on the silk that was produced by the silk worms. The easiest silk to work with came from breeds of silk worms that spun their cocoons so that it could be unwound in one long strand. The reeling, or unwinding of silk worm cocoons is started by placing the cocoons in boiling water in order to break apart the silk filaments as well as kill the silk worm pupae. Women would then find the end of the strands of silk by sticking their hand into the boiling water. Usually this task was done by girls aged eight to twelve, while the more complex jobs were given to older women. They would then create a silk thread, which could vary in thickness and strength from the unwound cocoons. After the reeling of the silk, the silk would be dyed before the weaving process began. There were many different looms and tools for weaving. For high quality and intricate designs, a wooden draw-loom or pattern loom was used. This loom would require two or three weavers and was usually operated by men. There were also other smaller looms, such as the waist loom, that could be operated by a single woman and were usually used domestically. Sericulture and silk weaving spread to Korea by 200 BCE, to Khotan by 50 CE, and to Japan by about 300 CE. The pit-treadle loom may have originated in India though most authorities establish the invention in China. Pedals were added to operate heddles. By the Middle Ages such devices also appeared in Persia, Sudan, Egypt and possibly the Arabian Peninsula, where \\"the operator sat with his feet in a pit below a fairly low- slung loom\\". In 700 CE, horizontal looms and vertical looms could be found in many parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. In Africa, the rich dressed in cotton while the poorer wore wool. By the 12th century it had come to Europe either from the Byzantium or Moorish Spain where the mechanism was raised higher above the ground on a more substantial frame. =Southeast Asia= T'nalak cloth by T'boli dream weavers. Like most indigenous pre-colonial Filipino textiles, they were typically made from abac√° fibers. In the Philippines, numerous pre-colonial weaving traditions exist among different ethnic groups. They used various plant fibers, mainly abac√° or banana, but also including tree cotton, buri palm (locally known as buntal) and other palms, various grasses (like amumuting and tikog), and barkcloth. The oldest evidence of weaving traditions are Neolithic stone tools used for preparing barkcloth found in archeological sites in Sagung Cave of southern Palawan and Arku Cave of Pe√±ablanca, Cagayan. The latter has been dated to around 1255-605 BCE. =Medieval Europe= Weaver, N√ºrnberg, c. 1425 The predominant fibre was wool, followed by linen and nettlecloth for the lower classes. Cotton was introduced to Sicily and Spain in the 9th century. When Sicily was captured by the Normans, they took the technology to Northern Italy and then the rest of Europe. Silk fabric production was reintroduced towards the end of this period and the more sophisticated silk weaving techniques were applied to the other staples.. The weaver worked at home and marketed his cloth at fairs. Warp- weighted looms were commonplace in Europe before the introduction of horizontal looms in the 10th and 11th centuries. Weaving became an urban craft and to regulate their trade, craftsmen applied to establish a guild. These initially were merchant guilds, but developed into separate trade guilds for each skill. The cloth merchant who was a member of a city's weavers guild was allowed to sell cloth; he acted as a middleman between the tradesmen weavers and the purchaser. The trade guilds controlled quality and the training needed before an artisan could call himself a weaver. By the 13th century, an organisational change took place, and a system of putting out was introduced. The cloth merchant purchased the wool and provided it to the weaver, who sold his produce back to the merchant. The merchant controlled the rates of pay and economically dominated the cloth industry. The merchants' prosperity is reflected in the wool towns of eastern England; Norwich, Bury St Edmunds and Lavenham being good examples. Wool was a political issue. The supply of thread has always limited the output of a weaver. About that time, the spindle method of spinning was replaced by the great wheel and soon after the treadle-driven spinning wheel. The loom remained the same but with the increased volume of thread it could be operated continuously. The 14th century saw considerable flux in population. The 13th century had been a period of relative peace; Europe became overpopulated. Poor weather led to a series of poor harvests and starvation. There was great loss of life in the Hundred Years War. Then in 1346, Europe was struck with the Black Death and the population was reduced by up to a half. Arable land was labour-intensive and sufficient workers no longer could be found. Land prices dropped, and land was sold and put to sheep pasture. Traders from Florence and Bruges bought the wool, then sheep-owning landlords started to weave wool outside the jurisdiction of the city and trade guilds. The weavers started by working in their own homes then production was moved into purpose-built buildings. The working hours and the amount of work were regulated. The putting-out system had been replaced by a factory system. The migration of the Huguenot Weavers, Calvinists fleeing from religious persecution in mainland Europe, to Britain around the time of 1685 challenged the English weavers of cotton, woollen and worsted cloth, who subsequently learned the Huguenots' superior techniques. =Industrial Revolution= By 1892, most cotton weaving was done in similar weaving sheds, powered by steam. Before the Industrial Revolution, weaving was a manual craft and wool was the principal staple. In the great wool districts a form of factory system had been introduced but in the uplands weavers worked from home on a putting-out system. The wooden looms of that time might be broad or narrow; broad looms were those too wide for the weaver to pass the shuttle through the shed, so that the weaver needed an expensive assistant (often an apprentice). This ceased to be necessary after John Kay invented the flying shuttle in 1733. The shuttle and the picking stick sped up the process of weaving. There was thus a shortage of thread or a surplus of weaving capacity. The opening of the Bridgewater Canal in June 1761 allowed cotton to be brought into Manchester, an area rich in fast flowing streams that could be used to power machinery. Spinning was the first to be mechanised (spinning jenny, spinning mule), and this led to limitless thread for the weaver. Edmund Cartwright first proposed building a weaving machine that would function similar to recently developed cotton-spinning mills in 1784, drawing scorn from critics who said the weaving process was too nuanced to automate. He built a factory at Doncaster and obtained a series of patents between 1785 and 1792. In 1788, his brother Major John Cartwight built Revolution Mill at Retford (named for the centenary of the Glorious Revolution). In 1791, he licensed his loom to the Grimshaw brothers of Manchester, but their Knott Mill burnt down the following year (possibly a case of arson). Edmund Cartwight was granted a reward of ¬£10,000 by Parliament for his efforts in 1809.English, W. (1969). The Textile Industry. pp. 89‚Äì97.Chaloner, William Henry (1963). People and Industries. pp. 45‚Äì54. However, success in power-weaving also required improvements by others, including H. Horrocks of Stockport. Only during the two decades after about 1805, did power-weaving take hold. At that time there were 250,000 hand weavers in the UK. Textile manufacture was one of the leading sectors in the British Industrial Revolution, but weaving was a comparatively late sector to be mechanised. The loom became semi-automatic in 1842 with Kenworthy and Bulloughs Lancashire Loom. The various innovations took weaving from a home- based artisan activity (labour-intensive and man-powered) to steam driven factories process. A large metal manufacturing industry grew to produce the looms, firms such as Howard & Bullough of Accrington, and Tweedales and Smalley and Platt Brothers. Most power weaving took place in weaving sheds, in small towns circling Greater Manchester away from the cotton spinning area. The earlier combination mills where spinning and weaving took place in adjacent buildings became rarer. Wool and worsted weaving took place in West Yorkshire and particular Bradford, here there were large factories such as Lister's or Drummond's, where all the processes took place. Both men and women with weaving skills emigrated, and took the knowledge to their new homes in New England, to places like Pawtucket and Lowell. Woven 'grey cloth' was then sent to the finishers where it was bleached, dyed and printed. Natural dyes were originally used, with synthetic dyes coming in the second half of the 19th century. The need for these chemicals was an important factor in the development of the chemical industry. The invention in France of the Jacquard loom in about 1803, enabled complicated patterned cloths to be woven, by using punched cards to determine which threads of coloured yarn should appear on the upper side of the cloth. The jacquard allowed individual control of each warp thread, row by row without repeating, so very complex patterns were suddenly feasible. Samples exist showing calligraphy, and woven copies of engravings. Jacquards could be attached to handlooms or powerlooms. A distinction can be made between the role and lifestyle and status of a handloom weaver, and that of the power loom weaver and craft weaver. The perceived threat of the power loom led to disquiet and industrial unrest. Well known protests movements such as the Luddites and the Chartists had handloom weavers amongst their leaders. In the early 19th-century power weaving became viable. Richard Guest in 1823 made a comparison of the productivity of power and handloom weavers: > A very good Hand Weaver, a man twenty-five or thirty years of age, will > weave two pieces of nine-eighths shirting per week, each twenty-four yards > long, and containing one hundred and five shoots of weft in an inch, the > reed of the cloth being a forty-four, Bolton count, and the warp and weft > forty hanks to the pound, A Steam Loom Weaver, fifteen years of age, will in > the same time weave seven similar pieces. He then speculates about the wider economics of using power loom weavers: > ...it may very safely be said, that the work is done in a Steam Factory > containing two hundred Looms, would, if done by hand Weavers, find > employment and support for a population of more than two thousand persons. =Hand loom weavers= Handloom weaving was done by both genders but men outnumbered women partially due to the strength needed to batten. They worked from home sometimes in a well-lit attic room. The women of the house would spin the thread they needed, and attend to finishing. Later women took to weaving, they obtained their thread from the spinning mill, and working as outworkers on a piecework contract. Over time competition from the power looms drove down the piece rate and they existed in increasing poverty. =Power loom weavers= Power loom workers were usually girls and young women. They had the security of fixed hours, and except in times of hardship, such as in the cotton famine, regular income. They were paid a wage and a piece work bonus. Even when working in a combined mill, weavers stuck together and enjoyed a tight-knit community. The women usually minded the four machines and kept the looms oiled and clean. They were assisted by 'little tenters', children on a fixed wage who ran errands and did small tasks. They learnt the job of the weaver by watching. Often they would be half timers, carrying a green card which teacher and overlookers would sign to say they had turned up at the mill in the morning and the afternoon at the school. At fourteen or so they come full-time into the mill, and started by sharing looms with an experienced worker where it was important to learn quickly as they would both be on piece work. Serious problems with the loom were left to the tackler to sort out. He would inevitably be a man, as were usually the overlookers. The mill had its health and safety issues, there was a reason why the women tied their hair back with scarves. Inhaling cotton dust caused lung problems, and the noise was causing total hearing loss. Weavers would mee-maw as normal conversation was impossible. Weavers used to 'kiss the shuttle', that is, suck thread through the eye of the shuttle. This left a foul taste in the mouth due to the oil, which was also carcinogenic. =Craft weavers= Pedal powered loom used by Skye Weavers, Isle of Skye, Scotland Arts and Crafts was an international design philosophy that originated in England and flourished between 1860 and 1910 (especially the second half of that period), continuing its influence until the 1930s. Instigated by the artist and writer William Morris (1834‚Äì1896) during the 1860s and inspired by the writings of John Ruskin (1819‚Äì1900), it had its earliest and most complete development in the British Isles but spread to Europe and North America. It was largely a reaction against mechanisation and the philosophy advocated of traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration. Handweaving was highly regarded and taken up as a decorative art. =Bauhaus weaving workshop= In the 1920s the weaving workshop of the Bauhaus design school in Germany aimed to raise weaving, previously seen as a craft, to a fine art, and also to investigate the industrial requirements of modern weaving and fabrics.Smith, T'ai (2014). Bauhaus weaving theory: From feminine craft to mode of design. Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press. Under the direction of Gunta St√∂lzl, the workshop experimented with unorthodox materials, including cellophane, fibreglass, and metal.Winton, A.G. (2007). \\"The Bauhaus, 1919‚Äì1933\\". Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 11 December 2016. From expressionist tapestries to the development of soundproofing and light-reflective fabric, the workshop's innovative approach instigated a modernist theory of weaving. Former Bauhaus student and teacher Anni Albers published the seminal 20th-century text On Weaving in 1965.Albers, Anni (1965). On Weaving. Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press. Other notables from the Bauhaus weaving workshop include Otti Berger, Margaretha Reichardt, and Benita Koch-Otte. Other cultures =Weaving in the American Colonies (1500‚Äì1800)= Colonial America relied heavily on Great Britain for manufactured goods of all kinds. British policy was to encourage the production of raw materials in colonies and discourage manufacturing. The Wool Act 1699 restricted the export of colonial wool. As a result, many people wove cloth from locally produced fibres. The colonists also used wool, cotton and flax (linen) for weaving, though hemp could be made into serviceable canvas and heavy cloth. They could get one cotton crop each year; until the invention of the cotton gin it was a labour- intensive process to separate the seeds from the fibres. A plain weave was preferred as the added skill and time required to make more complex weaves kept them from common use. Sometimes designs were woven into the fabric but most were added after weaving using wood block prints or embroidery. =American Southwest= Weaving a traditional Navajo rug Textile weaving, using cotton dyed with pigments, was a dominant craft among pre-contact tribes of the American southwest, including various Pueblo peoples, the Zuni, and the Ute tribes. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. With the introduction of Navajo-Churro sheep, the resulting woolen products have become very well known. By the 18th century the Navajo had begun to import yarn with their favorite color, Bayeta red. Using an upright loom, the Navajos wove blankets worn as garments and then rugs after the 1880s for trade. Navajo traded for commercial wool, such as Germantown, imported from Pennsylvania. Under the influence of European-American settlers at trading posts, Navajos created new and distinct styles, including \\"Two Gray Hills\\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns), \\"Teec Nos Pos\\" (colorful, with very extensive patterns), \\"Ganado\\" (founded by Don Lorenzo Hubbell), red dominated patterns with black and white, \\"Crystal\\" (founded by J. B. Moore), Oriental and Persian styles (almost always with natural dyes), \\"Wide Ruins,\\" \\"Chinlee,\\" banded geometric patterns, \\"Klagetoh,\\" diamond type patterns, \\"Red Mesa\\" and bold diamond patterns. Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony, or h√≥zh√≥. =Amazon cultures= Among the indigenous people of the Amazon basin densely woven palm-bast mosquito netting, or tents, were utilized by the Panoans, Tupinamb√°, Western Tucano, Yameo, Z√°paroans, and perhaps by the indigenous peoples of the central Huallaga River basin (Steward 1963:520). Aguaje palm-bast (Mauritia flexuosa, Mauritia minor, or swamp palm) and the frond spears of the Chambira palm (Astrocaryum chambira, A.munbaca, A.tucuma, also known as Cumare or Tucum) have been used for centuries by the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon to make cordage, net-bags hammocks, and to weave fabric. Among the Urarina, the production of woven palm-fiber goods is imbued with varying degrees of an aesthetic attitude, which draws its authentication from referencing the Urarina's primordial past. Urarina mythology attests to the centrality of weaving and its role in engendering Urarina society. The post- diluvial creation myth accords women's weaving knowledge a pivotal role in Urarina social reproduction. Dean, Bartholomew (2009). Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. Even though palm-fiber cloth is regularly removed from circulation through mortuary rites, Urarina palm-fiber wealth is neither completely inalienable, nor fungible since it is a fundamental medium for the expression of labor and exchange. The circulation of palm-fiber wealth stabilizes a host of social relationships, ranging from marriage and fictive kinship (compadrazco, spiritual compeership) to perpetuating relationships with the deceased.

Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, or ropemaking. Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, , p. 203 Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework. Etymology The word yarn comes from Middle English, from the Old English gearn, akin to Old High German's garn, \\"yarn\\", Italian's chordƒì, \\"string\\", and Sanskrit's hira, \\"band\\". Materials Yarn can be made from a number of natural or synthetic fibers. Many types of yarn are made differently though. There are two main types of yarn: spun and filament. =Fibers= Cotton being slubbed The most common plant fiber is cotton, which is typically spun into fine yarn for mechanical weaving or knitting into cloth. Cotton and polyester are the most commonly spun fibers in the world. Cotton is grown throughout the world. After harvesting it is ginned and prepared for yarn spinning. Polyester is extruded from polymers derived from natural gas and oil. Synthetic fibers are generally extruded in continuous strands of gel-state materials. These strands are drawn (stretched), annealed (hardened), and cured to obtain properties desirable for later processing. Synthetic fibers come in three basic forms: staple, tow, and filament. Staple is cut fibers, generally sold in lengths up to 120mm. Tow is a continuous \\"rope\\" of fibers consisting of many filaments loosely joined side-to-side. Filament is a continuous strand consisting of anything from 1 filament to many. Synthetic fiber is most often measured in a weight per linear measurement basis, along with cut length. Denier and Dtex are the most common weight to length measures. Cut-length only applies to staple fiber. Filament extrusion is sometimes referred to as \\"spinning\\" but most people equate spinning with spun yarn production. The most commonly spun animal fiber is wool harvested from sheep. For hand knitting and hobby knitting, wool and acrylic yarns are frequently used. Other animal fibers used include alpaca, angora, mohair, llama, cashmere, and silk. More rarely, yarn may be spun from camel, yak, possum, musk ox, vicu√±a, cat, dog, wolf, rabbit, or bison hair, and even chinchilla as well as turkey or ostrich feathers. Natural fibers such as these have the advantage of being slightly elastic and very breathable, while trapping a great deal of air, making for some of the warmest fabrics in existence. Other natural fibers that can be used for yarn include linen and cotton. These tend to be much less elastic, and retain less warmth than the animal-hair yarns, though they can be stronger in some cases. The finished product will also look rather different from the woolen yarns. Other plant fibers which can be spun include bamboo, hemp, maize, nettle, and soy fiber. T-shirt yarn is a yarn made directly from t-shirts, and the fiber composition is determined by the material the t-shirt is made from. =Comparison of material properties= A fully restored Derby Doubler, winding a sliver lap ready for finisher carding at Quarry Bank Mill in the UK. In general, natural fibers tend to require more careful handling than synthetics because they can shrink, felt, stain, shed, fade, stretch, wrinkle, or be eaten by moths more readily, unless special treatments such as mercerization or superwashing are performed to strengthen, fix color, or otherwise enhance the fiber's own properties. Some types of protein yarns (i.e., hair, silk, feathers) may feel irritating to some people, causing sensations of contact dermatitis, hives, wheezing reactions. These reactions are likely a sensitivity to thicker and coarser fiber diameter or fiber ends.https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet- earth/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-wool In fact, contrary to popular belief, wool allergies are practically unknown. According to a study reviewing the evidence of wool as an allergen conducted by Acta Dermato-Venereologica contemporary superfine or ultrafine Merino wool with their reduced fibre diameters do not provoke itch, are well tolerated and in fact benefit eczema management. Further studies suggest that known allergens applied during textile processing are minimally present in wool garments today given current industry practices and are unlikely to lead to allergic reactions.Woolmark Researchers: https://www.woolmark.com/about-wool/wellness/debunking-the-myth- that-wool-is-an-allergen/ When natural hair-type fibers are burned, they tend to singe and have a smell of burnt hair; this is because many, as human hair, are protein-derived. Cotton and viscose (rayon) yarns burn as a wick. Synthetic yarns generally tend to melt though some synthetics are inherently flame-retardant. Noting how an unidentified fiber strand burns and smells can assist in determining if it is natural or synthetic, and what the fiber content is. Both synthetic and natural yarns can pill. Pilling is a function of fiber content, spinning method, twist, contiguous staple length, and fabric construction. Single ply yarns or using fibers like merino wool are known to pill more due to the fact that in the former, the single ply is not tight enough to securely retain all the fibers under abrasion, and the merino wool's short staple length allows the ends of the fibers to pop out of the twist more easily. Yarns combining synthetic and natural fibers inherit the properties of each parent, according to the proportional composition. Synthetics are added to lower cost, increase durability, add unusual color or visual effects, provide machine washability and stain resistance, reduce heat retention or lighten garment weight. Structure Spinning Jenny, spinning machine which was significant in the beginning of the Industrial Revolution S- and Z-twist yarn Spun yarn is made by twisting staple fibres together to make a cohesive thread, or \\"single.\\"Kadolph, Textiles, p. 197 Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic,Barber, Elizabeth Wayland, Women's Work:The First 20,000 Years, W. W. Norton, 1994, p. 44 and yarn spinning was one of the first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere. Yarn is selected for different textiles based on the characteristics of the yarn fibres, such as warmth (wool), light weight (cotton or rayon), durability (nylon is added to sock yarn, for example), or softness (cashmere, alpaca). Yarn is composed of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) in the opposite direction to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s‚Äëtwist (the threads appear to go \\"up\\" to the left) or z‚Äëtwist (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric. The mechanical integrity of yarn is derived from frictional contacts between its composing fibers. The science behind this was first studied by Galileo. Filament yarn consists of filament fibres (very long continuous fibres) either twisted together or only grouped together. Thicker monofilaments are typically used for industrial purposes rather than fabric production or decoration. Silk is a natural filament, and synthetic filament yarns are used to produce silk-like effects. Texturized yarns are made by a process of air texturizing filament yarns (sometimes referred to as taslanizing), which combines multiple filament yarns into a yarn with some of the characteristics of spun yarns. Slub Effect means a yarn with thick and thin sections alternating regularly or irregularly. Colour Yarn comes in many colors Yarn may be used undyed, or may be coloured with natural or artificial dyes. Most yarns have a single uniform hue, but there is also a wide selection of variegated yarns: * Heathered or tweed: yarn with flecks of different coloured fibre * Ombre: variegated yarn with light and dark shades of a single hue * Multicolored: variegated yarn with two or more distinct hues (a \\"parrot colourway\\" might have green, yellow and red) * Self-striping: yarn dyed with lengths of colour that will automatically create stripes in a knitted or crocheted object * Marled: yarn made from strands of different- coloured yarn twisted together, sometimes in closely related hues gauge appears on the label: 5 to 7 stitches per inch using size 4.5 to 5.1 mm needles. The bottom skein is sock weight, specifically for knitting socks. Recommended gauge: 8 to 10 stitches per inch, using size 3.6 to 4.2 mm needles. Wool yarn rolls in various colors Spool of all purpose sewing thread, closeup shows texture of 2‚Äëply, Z‚Äëtwist, mercerized cotton with polyester core. Yarn drying after being dyed in the early American tradition, at Conner Prairie living history museum. Yarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces or grams. Common sizes include 25 g, 50 g, and 100 g skeins. Some companies also primarily measure in ounces with common sizes being three-ounce, four-ounce, six-ounce, and eight-ounce skeins. Textile measurements are taken at a standard temperature and humidity, because fibers can absorb moisture from the air. The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein can vary due to the inherent heaviness of the fibre and the thickness of the strand; for instance, a 50 g skein of lace weight mohair may contain several hundred metres, while a 50 g skein of bulky wool may contain only 60 metres. There are several thicknesses of craft yarn, also referred to as weight. This is not to be confused with the measurement and/or weight listed above. The Craft Yarn Council of America is making an effort to promote a standardized industry system for measuring this, numbering the weights from 1 (finest) to 6 (heaviest). Some of the names for the various weights of yarn from finest to thickest are called lace, fingering, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran (or heavy worsted), bulky, and super-bulky. This naming convention is more descriptive than precise; fibre artists disagree about where on the continuum each lies, and the precise relationships between the sizes. Another measurement of yarn weight, often used by weavers, is wraps per inch (WPI). The yarn is wrapped snugly around a ruler and the number of wraps that fit in an inch are counted. Labels on yarn for handicrafts often include information on gauge, known in the UK as tension, which is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of knitting needle or crochet hook. The proposed standardization uses a four-by-four inch/ten-by-ten cm knitted or crocheted square, with the resultant number of stitches across and rows high made by the suggested tools on the label to determine the gauge. In Europe, textile engineers often use the unit tex, which is the weight in grams of a kilometre of yarn, or decitex, which is a finer measurement corresponding to the weight in grams of 10 km of yarn. Many other units have been used over time by different industries. Fabric under digital USB microscope Below are the images taken by a digital USB microscope.

The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia. William H. \\"Bill\\" Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961. In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada. Between the 1940s and 1980s there was one variety of Mountain Dew, which was citrus-flavored and caffeinated in most markets. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988, followed by Mountain Dew Red, which was introduced and discontinued in 1988. In 2001, a cherry flavor called Code Red debuted. This product line extension trend has continued, with expansion into specialty, limited time production, region-specific, and retailer-specific (Taco Bell, 7-Eleven and KFC) variations of Mountain Dew. Production was extended to the UK in 1996, but was phased out in 1998. A similarly named but different-tasting product, with a recipe more similar to the original American product has been sold in the UK under the name \\"Mountain Dew Energy\\" since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011. The product was renamed in 2014 to simply 'Mountain Dew'. As of 2017, Mountain Dew represented a 6.6% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the US. Its competition includes The Coca-Cola Company's Mello Yello and Surge, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's Sun Drop; Mountain Dew accounts for 80% of citrus soft drinks sold within the US. Origin Tennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed Mountain Dew as a mixer in the 1940s. Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s, and the Hartmans had difficulty in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor, preferably whiskey, so the two developed their own. Originally a 19th-century slang term for whiskey, especially Highland Scotch whiskey, the Mountain Dew name was trademarked for the soft drink in 1948. Charles Gordon, who had partnered with William Swartz to bottle and promote Dr. Enuf, was introduced to Mountain Dew when he met the Hartman brothers on a train and they offered him a sample. Gordon and the Hartman brothers subsequently made a deal to bottle Mountain Dew by the Tri- Cities Beverage Corporation in Johnson City, Tennessee. The Hartman brothers also asked Coca-Cola for input on their soda. The Coca-Cola Company refused their offer. The Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia bought the rights to Mountain Dew, revising the flavor and launching it in 1961. In 1964, Pepsico purchased the Tip Corporation and thus acquired the rights to Mountain Dew. In 1999, the Virginia legislature recognized Bill Jones and the Town of Marion for their role in the history of Mountain Dew. Packaging 1950s Mountain Dew advertisement sign in Tonto, Arizona, showing the cartoon character \\"Willy the Hillbilly\\". \\"Mountain Dew\\" was originally Southern and/or Scots/Irish slang for moonshine (i.e., homemade whiskey). Using it as the name for the soda was originally suggested by Carl E. Retzke at an Owens-Illinois Inc. meeting in Toledo, Ohio, and was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s. Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a cartoon-stylized hillbilly. The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto, and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage. =Logo= Two sides of an early Mountain Dew bottle using the \\"Hillbilly\\" design. These returnable bottles could be found in stores and vending machines until the late 1980s. Throwback when it was introduced in 2009 and was later used on special glass bottles of the drink. The fourth Mountain Dew logo used from 1999 to 2005. PepsiCo (then The Pepsi- Cola Company) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964, and shortly thereafter in 1969 the logo was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a \\"younger, outdoorsy\\" generation. This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s, 1980s. In 1996, PepsiCo began using a strategy it was already using with its flagship cola Pepsi, changing Mountain Dew's logo every few years. New logos were introduced in 1996, 1998 and 2005. In October 2008, the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to \\"Mtn Dew\\" within the U.S. market, as a result of PepsiCo announcing that it would rebrand its core carbonated soft-drink products by early 2009. However, the variant flavors continued to use the previous design until May 2011, when it was announced that the \\"Code Red\\", \\"LiveWire\\", \\"Voltage\\", and \\"Baja Blast\\" flavor variants would be given redesigned packaging, including new logos to correspond with the \\"Mtn Dew\\" style. The returning flavors \\"Pitch Black\\", \\"Supernova\\", \\"Typhoon\\", and \\"Game Fuel\\" were given redesigned packaging and logos for their 2011 re-release. =Sidekick bottles= In summer 2010, a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some US shelves. Designed by 4sight, a design and innovation firm, these bottles featured a sleeker design, smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. The bottles were dubbed \\"Sidekick bottles\\" and were tested in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana markets. By 2014, sidekick bottles had become the predominant Mountain Dew bottle design in most of the United States. Ingredients In its primary market of the United States, the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as: \\"carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup (in much of the U.S.), concentrated orange juice, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, erythorbic acid, gum arabic, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and yellow 5.\\" The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in Canada, the sweetener listed is \\"glucose-fructose\\" (another name for high- fructose corn syrup), and until 2012, it was caffeine-free by default. Formerly, the composition included brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan. As of 2020, this ingredient has been removed. In response to negative publicity around high-fructose corn syrup, PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited-run production of Mountain Dew Throwback, a variation consisting of sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup. Mountain Dew Throwback subsequently was re-released for brief periods (generally 8‚Äì12 weeks at a time), including a second wave from December 2009 to February 2010 and a third wave in the summer and fall of 2010. A fourth 8-week production run began in March 2011, before it became a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line-up. A can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg of caffeine (equivalent to ).\\"Caffeine Content Of Popular Drinks\\" . Department of Mathematics, College of Science, The University of Utah. Retrieved 5 March 2013. =Tartrazine= An urban legend about Mountain Dew ingredients is that dye Yellow #5 (tartrazine) lowers sperm count. Tartrazine has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends, nor has any other component of the drink. Promotions =Amp Energy= Amp Energy is an energy drink distributed by PepsiCo under the Mountain Dew brand. Launched in 2001, Amp was originally known as \\"Mountain Dew AMP.\\" From 2007 to 2008, several additional flavors of Amp were introduced. In 2012, AMP's labeling and ingredients changed, as did the flavor and appeal, according to fans. The Mountain Dew branding was also removed from cans during this change. =Taco Bell's Mountain Dew Baja Blast= Leading up to 2004, Pepsico conducted extensive research to develop a beverage with a taste and color to complement Taco Bell food products. The resulting product was named Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a light blue-green colored, tropical-lime- flavored variety of the soft drink. Taco Bell was given a ten-year exclusive rights period during which Baja Blast would not be available in any store or other food outlet, not even to Taco Bell's fellow Yum! Brands restaurants. In spring 2014, Mountain Dew began distributing its Baja Blast flavor in standard 12 ounce cans, 20 ounce bottles and 24 ounce cans for sale at supermarkets and retail businesses in the US. The new retail product bore the Taco Bell logo. Taco Bell's chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, said the exclusive drinks have helped increase the company's beverage sales, even as soda sales have declined in the broader market. He noted that people are more likely to buy drinks when they're available exclusively at the chain. Due to the drink's success, many other new beverages were introduced at Taco Bell including a new Taco Bell exclusive, Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, a non-alcoholic sangrita flavored Mountain Dew. =DEWmocracy 1= Dewmocracy 1: People's Dew (2008) flavor finalists: Revolution, Voltage, and SupernovaBeginning in 2007, Mountain Dew began a promotion entitled \\"DEWmocracy\\",officially stylized as DEWmocracy which involved the public electing new flavors, colors, names, packaging graphics and advertisements for upcoming Mountain Dew products. The campaign has been the subject of recognition within the advertising industry, cited as one of the earliest and longest-running examples of a consumer product brand employing crowdsourcing to make decisions which are traditionally made internally by employees. In its initial phase, Dewmocracy participation and voting was conducted via an online game. Television advertisements at the time featured actor Forest Whitaker asking people to decide the next new flavor of Mountain Dew. Online voters selected from three choices: Supernova (a strawberry-melon flavor), Revolution (a berry flavor), and Voltage (a raspberry-citrus flavor). Each included ginseng. The event ended on 17 August 2008, with Voltage announced as the winning flavor. It was officially released on 29 December 2008. According to Beverage Digest, sales of Dewmocracy flavors totaled 25 million cases in 2008. =DEWmocracy 2= Dewmocracy 2: Collective Intelligence (2010) flavor finalists: White Out, Distortion, and TyphoonMountain Dew announced a continuation of the Dewmocracy campaign ‚Äì referred to as \\"Dewmocracy 2\\" ‚Äì which launched in July 2009. A marked difference between Dewmocracy 2 and its predecessor was the wider range of online voting methods, expanding beyond the Dewmocracy website to include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the \\"Dew Labs Community\\" ‚Äì a private, online forum for the \\"most passionate Dew fans.\\" In July 2009, Dew Labs sampling trucks distributed product samples of seven potential flavor variations. At the same time, 50 \\"Dew fanatics\\" were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv, and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors. From the initial seven flavors, taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at retail stores. The three new candidate flavors were Distortion (a key lime flavor), Typhoon (a tropical punch flavor), and White Out (a smooth-citrus flavor). The three new candidate flavors were released on 19 April 2010 and voting lasted until 14 June. The following day, White Out was announced as the winner. Mountain Dew White Out was released for sale on 4 October 2010. A limited production White Out Slurpee (Mtn Dew White Out Freeze) was made available at 7-Eleven beginning in January 2011. In July 2011, Mountain Dew Typhoon was re-released briefly in 2-liter form. =Game Fuel= In 2007, after using the term \\"Game Fuel\\" to market their sodas to the video-gaming subculture, Mountain Dew introduced a new flavor variant (citrus cherry) with the Game Fuel name. Coinciding with the release of the Xbox 360 game Halo 3, Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image-based, showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series' main character Master Chief prominently. This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks, and was discontinued afterwards. Two years later, the website for the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft stated that two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be sold in June 2009 and would promote the game. Shortly afterwards, the bottle art was released, and showed that the two flavors would promote different player races in the game. One of the two was exactly the same citrus cherry flavor from the original Halo 3 promotion, with updated packaging. The second flavor was a new wild fruit drink similar to the previously released Pepsi Blue. Both drinks were given World of Warcraft-based packaging, and sported the newly updated \\"MTN Dew\\" logo. Like their precursor, these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued. On 24 August 2011, Mountain Dew announced another return of the Game Fuel promotion on their Facebook page. The original citrus- cherry would once again return, along with a new tropical companion flavor. The announcement gave a planned release date of October 2011 and stated that the packaging would feature codes granting players double experience points in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011, a month before the planned release date. Later that same month, it was announced through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid-October, though it would vary by market. These flavors began appearing from the first week of October, and were also discontinued after 12 weeks of being on shelves. Game Fuel returned in October 2012 to promote Halo 4, in the original citrus-cherry flavor. In August 2013, Mountain Dew announced that Game Fuel would be returning to stores in the fall of 2013, with a new blueberry version titled \\"Electrifying Berry\\". In October 2013, boxes of original citrus-cherry Game Fuel appeared on store shelves with packaging promoting Xbox One and the games Dead Rising 3 and Forza Motorsport 5 and with cans featuring Dead Rising 3 graphics. The new Electrifying Berry flavor of Game Fuel simultaneously appeared with packaging promoting Kinect Sports Rivals and the game Ryse: Son of Rome, graphics from which appear on the cans as well. In May 2014, the original citrus-cherry Game Fuel began reappearing on shelves, but this time, the soda does not seem to be promoting any video game. In October 2014, Game Fuel returned with a new lemonade flavor for the promotion of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Unlike past two-variant Game Fuel releases, both drinks sport the same artwork (unlike 2009's Horde Red and Alliance Blue or 2011's citrus cherry and tropical), albeit differing colors to match their respective flavors. After the promotion ended, Citrus Cherry reverted to promotionless packaging while lemonade flavor was permanently removed from shelves. In October 2015, Game Fuel returned a new companion flavor, Berry Lime, for the promotion of Call of Duty: Black Ops III. After the promotion, Citrus Cherry once again reverted to promotionless packaging, while the Berry Lime flavor remained available as a slurpee. Images leaked in May 2016 led to speculation that Game Fuel would once again see a new release later in 2016, with a new mango-flavored variant alongside the original citrus-cherry, promoting the game Titanfall 2. Mountain Dew announced the return of Game Fuel and the new flavor, Mango Heat, in September. Then, in October, Game Fuel was released with the Titanfall 2 promotion, with a lower calorie version of the original citrus-cherry variant returning alongside the new Mango Heat. In 2017, Game Fuel returned with two previously discontinued flavors: Arctic Burst (originally released as a slurpee flavor in 2006 to promote Superman Returns) and Tropical Smash (originally Flavor #736, one of the four prototype flavors for \\"DEWmocracy II\\" that lost to Mountain Dew White Out and did not make the final round). As was the case with the 2013 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Arctic Burst promoted Middle-earth: Shadow of War while Tropical Smash promoted Forza 7). For the first time, Citrus Cherry was not fully part of the promotion, instead promotionless Citrus Cherry was sold with the same white caps with codes under them as the other flavors in the promotion. In January 2019, PepsiCo introduced a new line of Game Fuel called Game Fuel Amp. The can features a re-sealable lid. Game Fuel Amp has 90 mg of caffeine and also includes theanine and vitamins A and B. =Green Label= A limited edition bottle featuring Green Label art Green Label is an online magazine, a partnership between Mountain Dew and Complex Media producing sponsored content covering action sports, music, art and style, housed at Green-Label.com. The site replaces several websites and a YouTube channel that have been overseen by PepsiCo since 2007. The initiative originated in 2013 and will continue through the year. Green Label Art Mountain Dew's Green Label promotion originated in 2007, when a line of limited edition aluminum bottles was put into production, featuring artwork from a range of tattoo artists and other artists. This initial series marked the first use of the term Green Label Art to describe the use of artistic works on Mountain Dew packaging. In June 2010, a contest entitled \\"Green Label Art: Shop Series\\" was announced, involving 35 independent skateboard store owners who partnered with local artists to design and submit future can artwork designs. Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of the contest in October of the same year, with Street Science Skate Shop ‚Äì a store in Tracy, California ‚Äì named the winner of a cash prize. This winning can design was scheduled to appear on Mountain Dew cans at some point in 2011. Green Label Sound In 2008, a Mountain Dew- sponsored music label was launched under the name Green Label Sound. In December 2010, a Mountain Dew Code Red television advertisement was produced, incorporating the hip-hop artist Jay Electronica performing his song The Announcement. The advertisement concludes with the tagline \\"Hip Hop is different on the mountain\\". The label released its first full-length album release, When Fish Ride Bicycles by the hip hop group The Cool Kids, on 12 June 2011. Dew Tour/Green Label experience 2007 Dew Tour BMX in Salt Lake City, Utah Sponsorship of action sports athletes has been a part of Mountain Dew marketing since the late 1990s, with present sponsorship including Eli Reed (skateboarder), Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder), and Danny Davis (snowboarder). Mountain Dew also sponsors its own namesake festival, \\"The Dew Tour\\", which is an action sports tour made up of events held in five U.S. cities over several months. The first Dew Tour was held in the summer of 2005 with events in skateboarding, BMX and Freestyle Motocross. In 2008 it expanded to add a \\"Winter Dew Tour\\", comprising snowboarding and snow skiing competitions. It is \\"the most watched and attended action sports event in the world,\\" according to Transworld Snowboarding magazine. In coordination with its Dew Tour sponsorship, a sponsored television show entitled Mountain Dew's Green Label Experience premiered on Fuel TV in July 2010, for the primary purpose of broadcasting interviews with action sports athletes from each of the stops on the Dew Tour. Green Label Gaming Under the term Green Label Gaming ‚Äì coined in 2007 ‚Äì Mountain Dew has broadened its sponsorship of independent video game designers and players. The brand is often the subject of media attention for its popularity among video game enthusiasts, as several flavors of Mountain Dew have been produced in partnership with video games. In December 2008, Mountain Dew produced a 30-minute television special which documented independent gamers in Japan and the U.S., which aired on the Spike TV network. In 2009, Mountain Dew sponsored two prominent gaming events: the Independent Games Festival and the Game Developers Conference. Green Label Gaming has since come under controversy over a sponsored Game Jam-themed reality show by Matti Leshem. =Doritos Quest= In 2008, Doritos debuted a mystery flavor known as \\"Quest\\", featuring a campaign of online puzzles and prizes to identify the Quest flavor. The flavor was later identified as Mountain Dew. =FanDEWmonium= In October 2010, Mountain Dew started the \\"FanDEWmonium\\" promotion, a competition in which new flavors would compete to become permanent similar to the two DEWmocracy campaigns, but with eight diet flavors instead of three regular ones. Five of the participating flavors were diet versions of previous DEWmocracy flavors: Diet Super Nova, Diet Voltage, Diet Crave (originally Flavor #722), Diet Distortion, Diet Typhoon, and Diet White Out. Another flavor, Diet Ultra Violet, was returning from its own limited release in 2009. The remaining competitor was a brand-new Diet flavor created specifically for the promotion - Flare (berry-citrus-flavored). Each of the eight flavors was available for tasting at specific tour locations, and special cans were also mailed to some Dew Labs members. Also similar to the DEWmocracy campaign, those who taste-tested the Diet flavors were asked to go online and vote for which flavors they thought should be permanently sold in stores. After the first round of voting was completed, two flavor finalists were chosen to receive a limited release to store shelves for a final round of voting. Diet Voltage and Diet Super Nova were sold in stores for an eight-week period beginning in March 2011. After votes were cast, it was announced that Diet Super Nova had won, with 55% of all votes, and it returned in January 2012. Afterwards, it was removed from shelves permanently after a 12-week release due to poor sales. =Back by Popular DEWmand= On 7 January 2011, Mountain Dew posted on their Facebook that Pitch Black would return to the shelves in May 2011, also stating that this may be the start of many re- releases of old favorites. The company promoted Pitch Black's return heavily with giveaways and contests. About a month before the planned release date, a photo was posted on a Mountain Dew worker's Pongr, which showed Pitch Black and 2008's Supernova. Two weeks before the release, Dew Labs announced the return of 2010's Typhoon in 2-Liter bottles exclusively at Walmart Supercenters. The three flavors were re-released to stores on 2 May. At the same time of the DEWmand Promotion, Mountain Dew launched the Throwback Shack, a website where participators could enter to win exclusive Dew merchandise, including a \\"secret stash\\" of Mountain Dew Revolution, a losing competitor from 2008's DEWmocracy. The promotional advertisements were then taken down from the Mountain Dew website. Mountain Dew later stated via tweet that there would not be any more flavors returning 'by Popular DEWmand' for now, as it was only intended to be a summer program. =The Dark Knight Rises partnership= After much speculation over a leaked Instagram photo of a potential new flavor, it was officially announced that Mountain Dew was teaming up with Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' film The Dark Knight Rises and released a limited-edition flavor on 18 June 2012. A website ‚Äî DEWGothamCity.com ‚Äî was launched, on which fans were able to enter codes to access exclusive content and details on the movie before its 20 July release date. Some Mountain Dew products temporarily featured packaging to promote the movie, including thermochromic 16 oz. cans that change color when cooled. The limited-edition flavor, Dark Berry, was mixed berry-flavored, and was available for 8 weeks. The Dark Knight Rises promotion inspired a permanent 24 oz. version of Mountain Dew. =Dub the Dew= In August 2012, Villa Enterprises held a promotion known as Dub the Dew, where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of Mountain Dew. The promotion was infamously hijacked by users, particularly those originating from the imageboard 4chan, who submitted and upvoted entries such as \\"Hitler Did Nothing Wrong\\", \\"Diabeetus\\", \\"Fapple\\", \\"Bill Cosby Sweat\\", \\"Jimmie Rustle's Jumpin' Juice\\", and numerous variations of \\"Gushing Granny\\". Although the promotion was not directly connected to Mountain Dew, a representative from the company did offer to \\"help clean up\\" the site. Adweek compared the incident to another recent campaign hijacked under similar circumstances, where musician Pitbull was sent to perform in Kodiak, Alaska, in a Walmart promotion. =Puppy Monkey Baby= On 7 February 2016 for Super Bowl 50, Mountain Dew aired a spot featuring a CGI character dubbed \\"The puppy monkey baby\\" (also styled PuppyMonkeyBaby). The promotion has garnered a wide amount of media coverage, both positive and negative. According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the Super Bowl commercials of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing. The ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless; a Pug puppy (the head), a monkey (the body and tail), and a dancing baby (the hips and legs). The puppy monkey baby dances with three men who are presumably watching the Super Bowl, offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine). The media response to the advertisement has been mixed to negative. Melissa Cronin of Gawker described it as a \\"horror-hallucination of brand awareness\\", while noting the beverage itself contains brominated vegetable oil, a chemical that is banned in several countries. Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn & Wolfe, called it \\"weird\\". =DEWcision 2016= On 18 April 2016, Mountain Dew announced the return of two popular favorites, Baja Blast and Pitch Black. Fans could vote on which flavor stays permanently on store shelves via the Mountain Dew website. Voting ended on 9 July, and, after many delays, Pitch Black was announced the winner on 18 July 2016. Pitch Black continues to be produced and became part of the brand's lineup starting in September. In popular culture The computer worm Code Red was so named because the person who discovered the worm was drinking this version of Mountain Dew at the time. The tune \\"Good Old Mountain Dew\\" has been recorded and covered by artists like The Stanley Brothers, Grandpa Jones and Willie Nelson. In its original bluegrass context, \\"Mountain Dew\\" refers to moonshine. After PepsiCo bought the soft drink Mountain Dew in 1964, they commissioned a set of advertisements featuring a \\"Good Old Mountain Dew\\"-based jingle and the drink's hillbilly mascot. The last song of the 2003 album It's Pronounced Five Two by Christian rapper KJ-52 titled \\"Gimme Dat\\" is a narrative about the singer attending MDA (Mountain Dew Anonymous) and telling about how he is addicted to the soft drink. In the musical Be More Chill, green Mountain Dew activates the SQUIP, a tiny super computer in a pill that tells the user what to do, in order to help them achieve their goals. Mountain Dew Red shuts them off. In the musical it is said that this is the reason for Mountain Dew Red being discontinued.

Although most of these were, indeed, railway towns, founded after surveying and planning by the powerful railway companies during construction of the CPR, Canada's first transcontinental line or the Canadian National Railroad. But this initial start generally only provided one or two streets with a few lots set out. From this, the cities grew organically. *Batawa, Ontario *Bramalea, Ontario now a part of Brampton *Broughton, Nova Scotia failed *Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador *Deep River, Ontario *Don Mills, Ontario now a part of Toronto *Erin Mills a planned community of Mississauga, Ontario *Fermont, Quebec *Gagnon, Quebec *Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland *Grande Cache, Alberta, *Guelph, Ontario *Kapuskasing, Ontario *Kitimat, British Columbia *Mount Royal, Quebec *New Westminster, British Columbia designed by Richard Moody of the Royal Engineers to be the capital of the Colony of British Columbia *Oromocto, New Brunswick *Pinawa, Manitoba *Thompson, Manitoba *Townsend, Ontario failed *Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia *Vaughan, Ontario =Chile= *El Salvador mining city =China, People's Republic= *The forbidden City: Built to house the emperors during Ming dynasty *Tekes County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture =Czech Republic= *Hav√≠≈ôov *Zl√≠n *Most (Most District) *New Town, Prague *Prague Castle, founded at 870  D ‚Äì F  =Denmark= *Esbjerg replacing the Slesvig harbour towns lost by Denmark in the 1864 Second Schleswig War *Fredericia fortress town *Herning cultivation of Central Jutland moorland *Nordhavn District of Copenhagen *√òrestad District of Copenhagen =Djibouti= *Al Noor City twin city to one of the same name in Yemen =Egypt= Modern *6th of October - Giza Governarate. *10th of Ramadan (city) - Sharqia Governarate. *May 15 (city) - Cairo Governarate. *Ain Sokhna - Suez Governarate. *Badr - Cairo Governarate. *Borg El Arab - Alexandria Governarate. *El Shorouk - Cairo Governarate. *Ismailia - Ismailia Governarate. *Madinaty - Cairo governarate. *New Administrative Capital of Egypt - Cairo governarate. *New Akhmim - Sohag Governarate. *New Aswan - Aswan Governarate. *New Asyut - Asyut Governarate. *New Beni Suef - Beni Suef Governarate. *New Borg El Arab - Alexandria Governarate. *New Cairo - Cairo Governarate. *New Damietta - Damietta Governarate. *New Fayum - Fayum Governarate. *New Nubariya - Beheira Governarate. *New Qena - Qena Governarate. *New Salhia - Sharqia Governarate. *New Tiba - Luxor Governarate. *Obour (city) - Qalubyia Governarate. *Port Fuad - Port said Governarate. *Port Tewfik - Suez Governarate *Ras El Bar-Damietta Governarate. *Ras Sedr - South Sinai Governarate. *Sharm El Sheikh - South Sinai Governarate. *Sheikh Zayed - Giza Governarate.

These are the cultural model, the social model, and the medical (or infirmity) model. The model through which the deaf person is viewed can impact how they are treated as well as their own self perception. In the cultural model, the Deaf belong to a culture in which they are neither infirm nor disabled, but rather have their own fully grammatical and natural language. In the medical model, deafness is viewed undesirable, and it is to the advantage of the individual as well as society as a whole to \\"cure\\" this condition. The social model seeks to explain difficulties experienced by deaf individuals that are due to their environment.  Cultural Model  Within the cultural model of deafness, Deaf people see themselves as a linguistic and cultural minority community rather than a ‚Äúdisability group‚Äù. Advocates of Deaf culture use a capital ‚ÄúD‚Äù to distinguish cultural Deafness from deafness as a pathology. Deaf culture is distinct in that the inability to hear is not seen as a \\"loss\\" or something that negatively impacts an individuals quality of life. It is an asset of and for the Deaf community to be deaf in behavior, values, knowledge and fluency in sign language. The experience of the Deaf being a language minority is comparable to other minorities' native languages being important to group identification and the preservation of their culture. Deaf clubs (such as NAD- The National Association of the Deaf) and Deaf schools have played large roles in the preservation of sign language and Deaf culture. Residential schools for deaf children serve as a vital link in the transmission of the rich culture and language, seeing as they are ideal environments for children to acquire and master sign language and pass on Deaf cultural values. Like all educational settings, these environments are key to providing deaf children valuable life lessons and skills that will help them prosper in any environment they may find themselves in. Rather than embrace the view that deafness is a \\"personal tragedy\\", the Deaf community contrasts the medical model of deafness by seeing all aspects of the deaf experience as positive. The birth of a deaf child is seen as a cause for celebration. Deaf people point to the perspective on child rearing they share with hearing people. For example, hearing parents may feel that they relate to their hearing child because of their experience and intimate understanding of the hearing state of being. It follows that a Deaf parent will have easier experiences raising a deaf child since Deaf parents have an intimate understanding of the deaf state of being. Evidence of Deaf parental success is revealed in scholastic achievement. Deaf children who have Deaf parents that communicate in sign language from birth, generally perform better in their academics than other deaf children with hearing parents. This includes children who adapted using speech and lipreading, prosthetic devices such as the cochlear implants, hearing aid technology, and artificial language systems such as Signing Exact English and Cued Speech. Deaf children acquiring sign languages from birth also reach language milestones at similar rates to their hearing counterparts, unlike deaf children born to hearing parents acquiring speech. Members of the Deaf community define deafness as a matter of culturally determined behaviors rather than an audiological factor. Thus, those within the Deaf community tend to be, but are not limited to, deaf people, especially congenitally deaf people whose primary language is the sign language of their nation or community, as well as their hearing or deaf children (hearing children of Deaf adults are typically called CODAs: Child of Deaf adult), families, friends and other members of their social networks. This cultural model of deafness represents the natural evolution of the social networks of a minority language group. From the conceptual framework of the cultural model come implicit questions, such as: How is deafness influenced by the physical and social environment in which it is embedded; What are the interdependent values, mores, art forms, traditions, organizations, and language that characterize this culture?  Social Model  The social model of deafness stems from the social model of disability. The concept of social disability was created by people who are disabled themselves, their families, friends, and associated social and political networks. Professionals in the human services fields and the social sciences greatly contributed to the social model. This model describes a person‚Äôs disability on the basis of two factors: # the physical or mental traits that cause this disability # their environment, as it is influenced by the perception of others. Through this lens individuals who are deaf are considered disabled due to their inability to hear, which hearing counterparts in their surroundings have historically viewed as a disadvantage. People with disabilities affirm that the design of the environment often disables them. In more accessible environments where those that are deaf have access to language that is not only spoken they are disabled less, or not at all. Areas where hearing and deaf individuals interact, called contact zones, often leave deaf individuals at a disadvantage because of the environment being tailored to suit the needs of the hearing counterpart. The history of Martha's Vineyard, when looking specifically at Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, supports this notion. At one point in time, the deaf population on the island was so great that it was commonplace for hearing residents to know and use both signed and spoken language to communicate with their neighbors. In this environmental design, it was not \\"bad\\" or \\"disabling\\" if one was not able to hear in order to communicate. With certain disabilities, medical intervention can improve subsequent health issues. This is true to parts of the deaf population, as in some cases hearing can be gained with the assistance of medical technologies. The social model acknowledges the hard truth that medical intervention does not address societal issues that prevail - regardless of its extent or success. In addition to changing environments from disabling to enabling atmospheres, advocates of the social model support the complete integration of disabled people into society. They encourage maximum integration with peers who are not disabled by their environment, especially, but not exclusively, in the school setting. Ultimately, the goal of proponents of the social model is to ensure all people are fully able to enjoy \\"all human rights and fundamental freedoms\\". The social model of disability's ideology of \\"all-inclusive\\" school environments is not adhered to in the cultural model. Residential schools separate deaf and hard of hearing children from their hearing counterparts. The existence of these schools demonstrate an example of respecting and embracing the totality of the deaf experience rather than dismissing it. While the social model's promotion of inclusion at every level is a great principle, it may not always be the best environment in practice. In the case of deafness, there is a lot a child can miss in a mainstreamed schooling environment. In a poorly constructed mainstreamed environment, fostering relationships with classmates may be difficult and auditory important material shared verbally by teachers may be missed. As a result, the child may fall behind both academically and socially. In residential school settings, these challenges may not be experienced to the same degree, and would allow for deaf children's social and academic lives to instead flourish.  Medical Model  The medical model of deafness originates from medical, social welfare and majority cultural notions of the absence of the ability to hear as being an illness or a physical disability. It stems from a more comprehensive and far- reaching medical model of disability. Under the perspective that deafness is an impairment, the inability to hear interferes with a person‚Äôs ability to respond to environmental cues, to communicate, and to enjoy aspects of mainstream culture such as music. People who experience hearing loss after acquiring a mastery of spoken language as well as those who are hard-of- hearing commonly identify with this model. Within the medical model deafness is conceptualized from a \\"personal tragedy\\" stance, indicating that it should be avoided, eradicated, or normalized by all possible means. Often, the attitudes of professionals own assumptions of deafness as tragedy promote responses of loss; thus, hearing parents may experience diagnosis of their child‚Äôs deafness as a tragedy with reactions of grief. Similarly, common reactions such as stress and anger are not necessarily understandable psychological responses to deafness, but may result from situations in which parents have not encountered in others an adequate response to their needs and questions. While medical ethics and law dictate that it is up to the patient (or the patient's legal representative) to decide the treatments he or she wishes, the press and professional literature are increasingly normalizing the discussion regarding using cochlear implants, oral education, and mainstream placement; all being popular choices under the medical model of deafness. The medical model suggests that, overall, the effects of deafness may be lessened through the use of technology such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, assistive listening devices, and lip reading. Similarly, doctors and scientists who engage in research are doing so simply because there is demand for information and for techniques which can restore hearing. The view that deafness is a \\"disability\\" also has economic consequences in political environments concerned with social welfare. It is the basis on which the governments in many developed countries provide financial support for the cost of cochlear implants and other therapies. Under the medical model of deafness Implicit questions may naturally arise, such as: \\"By what criteria and by whom is the impairment construed as an infirmity; how did the infirmity arise; what are the risks and benefits of the available treatment, if any; what can be done to minimize the disabling effects of the infirmity?\\"  See also  * Deaf culture * Gallaudet University ‚Äì school for advanced education of the deaf and hard-of-hearing * Hard-of-hearing * Medical model of disability * Social model of disability  References   Further reading        External links  * Educating Children Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing: Inclusion.

It is cultivated as an ornamental plant flowering in summer, with showy cup-shaped flowers in brilliant shades of red, orange and yellow (occasionally pink). It is also used as food or a garnish. It became the official state flower of California in 1903. Description It is a perennial or annual plant growing to tall with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage. The leaves are alternately divided into round, lobed segments. The flowers are solitary on long stems, silky-textured, with four petals, each petal long and broad; flower color ranges through yellow, orange and red (with some pinks). Flowering occurs from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, fall). The petals close at night (or in cold, windy weather) and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. The fruit is a slender, dehiscent capsule long, which splits in two to release numerous small black or dark brown seeds. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. =Habitat= Its native habitat includes California and extends to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora and northwest Baja California. The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve is located in northern Los Angeles County. At the peak of the blooming season, orange flowers seem to cover all 1,745 acres (706 ha) of the reserve. Other prominent locations of California poppy meadows include Bear Valley (Colusa County) and Point Buchon (San Luis Obispo County). =Taxonomy= E. californica subsp. mexicana, Mexican gold poppy, Maricopa County, Arizona Eschscholzia californica was the first named species of the genus Eschscholzia, named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue‚Äôs scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific circa 1810 aboard the Russian ship Rurik.Maritime poppies, E. californica subsp. californica var. maritima (E. L. Greene) Jeps., Cambria, California California poppy is highly variable, with over 90 synonyms. Some botanists accept two subspecies ‚Äî one with four varieties (e.g., Leger and Rice, 2003) ‚Äî though others do not recognize them as distinct (e.g., Jepson 1993): *E. californica subsp. californica, native to California, Baja California, and Oregon, widely planted as an ornamental, and an invasive elsewhere (see below). E. californica subsp. californica var. californica, which is found along the coast from the San Francisco Peninsula north. They are perennial and somewhat prostrate, with yellow flowers. E. californica subsp. californica var. maritima (E. L. Greene) Jeps., which is found along the coast from Monterey south to San Miguel Island. They are perennial, long-lived, glaucous, short in stature, and have extremely prostrate growth and yellow flowers. E. californica subsp. californica var. crocea (Benth.) Jeps., which grows in non-arid inland regions. They are perennial, taller, and have orange flowers. E. California subsp. californica var. peninsularis (E. L. Greene) Munz, which is an annual or facultative annual growing in arid inland environments. *E. californica subsp. mexicana (E. L. Greene) C. Clark, the Mexican Gold Poppy, which is found in the Sonoran Desert. Some authorities refer to it as E. Mexicana. Eschscholzia mexicana at Arizona State University Pollen production A UK study of meadow flowers that focused on commercial mixes, but which also tested various common plants such as ragwort and dandelion, ranked the California poppy highly in pollen production, although it did not produce a significant amount of nectar. On a per-flower basis it ranked second, with a rate of 8.3¬±1.1Œºl. The corn poppy, Papaver rhoeas, topped the list for per-flower pollen production with its rate of 13.3 ¬± 2.8Œºl. When measuring the entire capitulum the top two species were the ox-eye daisy, Leucanthemum vulgare, with 15.9 ¬± 2Œºl, and Cosmos bipinnatus, which had a rate nearly equivalent to that of the corn poppy. As poppies are not wind-pollinated, their pollen poses no allergy risk via inhalation. Uses California poppy leaves are used as food or garnish, while the seeds are used in cooking. Cultivation E. californica is drought-tolerant, self-seeding, and easy to cultivate. It is best grown as an annual in full sun and sandy, well-drained soil or loam. Horticulturalists have produced numerous cultivars with a range of colors and blossom and stem forms. These typically do not breed true on reseeding. Seeds are often sold as mixtures. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *'Apricot Chiffon' (yellow flushed with pink and orange) *'Dali' (red) *'Rose Chiffon' (pink and white) =Invasive potential= Because of its beauty and ease of growing, the California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. It is recognized as a potentially invasive species within the United States, although no indications of ill effects have been reported for this plant where it has been introduced outside of California. The golden poppy has been displaced in large areas of its original habitat, such as Southern California, by more invasive exotic species, such as mustard or annual grasses. Chilean population In Chile, it was introduced from multiple sources between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century. It appears to have been both intentionally imported as an ornamental garden plant and accidentally introduced along with alfalfa seed grown in California. Since Chile and California have similar climatic regions and have experienced much agricultural exchange, it is perhaps not surprising that it was introduced to Chile. Once there, its perennial forms spread primarily in human-disturbed environments (Leger and Rice, 2003). The introduced Chilean populations of California poppy appear to be larger and more fecund in their introduced range than in their native range (Leger and Rice, 2003). Introduced populations have been noted to be larger and more reproductively successful than native ones (Elton, 1958), and there has been much speculation as to why. An increase in resource availability, decreased competition, and release from enemy pressure have all been proposed as explanations. One hypothesis is that the plant's resources devoted in the native range to a defense strategy can, in the absence of enemies, be devoted to increased growth and reproduction (the EICA Hypothesis, Blossey & N√∂tzold, 1995). However, this is not the case with introduced populations of E. californica in Chile: the Chilean populations were actually more resistant to Californian caterpillars than native populations (Leger and Forister, 2005). State flower of California A Welcome to California road sign, featuring golden poppies California Scenic Route marker showing the state flower During the 1890s Sarah Plummer Lemmon advocated for the adoption of the golden poppy as the state flower of California, eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed by Governor George Pardee in 1903.\\"Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (1836‚Äì1923)\\", Find-a-Grave.Michael Redmon, \\"Who is responsible for setting up Santa Barbara‚Äôs first library?\\", Santa Barbara Independent, April 10, 2008.

They are the \\"most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Their basis was an old agrarian cult,Martin P. Nilsson, Vol I, p. 470 and there is some evidence that they were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenean period.Dietrich (1975) The origins of Greek Religion. Bristol Phoenix Press pp. 166, 167Walter Burkert. (1985)Greek Religion. Harvard University Press. p. 285 The mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases: the descent (loss), the search, and the ascent, with the main theme being the ascent (Œ¨ŒΩŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ) of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. It was a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome.Ouvaroff, M. (alternatively given as Sergei Semenovich Uvarov, or Sergey Uvarov, 1786‚Äì1855) (Translated from the French by J. D. Price) Essay on the Mysteries of Eleusis, London : Rodwell and Martin, 1817 (Reprint: United States: Kessinger Publishing, 2004). Ouvaroff does write that fixing the earliest foundation date to the Eleusinian Mysteries is fraught with problems. Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of Near East and in Minoan Crete. The rites, ceremonies, and beliefs were kept secret and consistently preserved from antiquity. For the initiated, the rebirth of Persephone symbolized the eternity of life which flows from generation to generation, and they believed that they would have a reward in the afterlife.Tripolitis, Antonia. Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, November 2001. pp. 16‚Äì21. There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries. Since the Mysteries involved visions and conjuring of an afterlife, some scholars believe that the power and longevity of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a consistent set of rites, ceremonies and experiences that spanned two millennia, came from psychedelic drugs.Wasson, R. Gordon, Ruck, Carl, Hofmann, A., The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries. Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1978. The name of the town, Eleus√≠s, seems to be Pre-Greek and it is probably a counterpart with Elysium and the goddess Eileithyia.Elysion: The island of the happy dead (Hesiod: Works and days 166ff.).Eileithyia.

Willets, p. 222. Her name ' ( Elysia) in Laconia and Messene, probably relates her with the month Eleusinios and Eleusis,F.Schachermeyer (1967) Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta W.Kohlhammer Stuttgart, p. 141 but this is debated.\\"In Laconia there is a temple of Demeter Eleusinia. The name was used very early, and cannot be an influence of the goddess of Eleusis\\": Nilsson, Vol I, pp.313-314 The ancient Greek word \\"mystery\\" () means \\"mystery or secret rite\\" and is related with the verb mue≈ç (), which means initiation into the mysteries, and the noun mustƒìs (), which means one initiated. The word mustik√≥s () means \\"connected with the mysteries\\", or \\"private, secret\\" (as in Modern Greek). Demeter and Persephone Triptolemus receiving wheat sheaves from Demeter and blessings from Persephone, 5th-century BC relief, National Archaeological Museum of Athens The Mysteries are related to a myth concerning Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility as recounted in one of the Homeric Hymns (c. 650 BC). According to the hymn, Demeter's daughter Persephone (also referred to as Kore, \\"maiden\\") was assigned the task of painting all the flowers of the earth. Before completion, she was seized by Hades, the god of the underworld, who took her to his underworld kingdom. Distraught, Demeter searched high and low for her daughter. Because of her distress, and in an effort to coerce Zeus to allow the return of her daughter, she caused a terrible drought in which the people suffered and starved, depriving the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result, Zeus relented and allowed Persephone to return to her mother.Foley, Helene P., The Homeric \\"Hymn ro Demeter\\". Princeton University Press 1994. Also Vaughn, Steck. Demeter and Persephone. Steck Vaughn Publishing, June 1994 According to the myth, during her search Demeter traveled long distances and had many minor adventures along the way. In one she taught the secrets of agriculture to Triptolemus.Smith, William. A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography Vol. II. Kessinger Publishing, LLC 2006. Finally, by consulting Zeus, Demeter reunited with her daughter and the earth returned to its former verdure and prosperity: the first spring. Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother for the rest of the year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again. In the central foundation document of the mystery, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter line 415, Persephone is said to stay in Hades during winter and return in the spring of the year: \\"This was the day [of Persephone's return], at the very beginning of bountiful springtime.\\"The Homeric Hymns translated by Jules Cashford, Penguin Books, 2003, p. 24. This fits with the Mediterranean change of seasons. As every Mediterranean farmer knows, nature from November to February is, basically, dormant. Persephone's rebirth is symbolic of the rebirth of all plant life and the symbol of eternity of life that flows from the generations that spring from each other.Similar ideas appear in many ancient agricultural societies: in the cult of Adonis in Phoenicia, the cult of Osiris in Egypt and the cult of Ariadne in Minoan Crete. Also in China: \\"There in the buried seed, the end of life is connected with a new beginning\\": The I Ching or book of changes, transl. Richard Wilhelm p.45 However, a scholar has proposed a different versionSmith, 2006., according to which the four months during which Persephone is with Hades correspond to the dry Greek summer, a period during which plants are threatened with drought.Greene, William C. \\"The Return of Persephone\\". Classical Philology. University of Chicago Press 1946. pp. 105-106 This version, though, does not correspond with the Mediterranean abundance of fruit during the summer and the fact that there is no growth during winter. Mysteries Demeter, enthroned and extending her hand in a benediction toward the kneeling Metaneira, who offers the triune wheat that is a recurring symbol of the mysteries (Varrese Painter, red-figure hydria, c. 340 BC, from Apulia) The Eleusinian Mysteries are believed to be of considerable antiquity. Some findings in the temple Eleusinion in Attica suggest that their basis was an old agrarian cult.Nilsson, Vol I, p.470 Some practices of the mysteries seem to have been influenced by the religious practices of the Mycenaean period and thus predating the Greek Dark Ages. Excavations showed that a private building existed under the Telesterion in the Mycenean period, and it seems that originally the cult of Demeter was private. In the Homeric Hymn is mentioned the palace of the king Keleos.Nilsson, Vol I, pp. 474,475 One line of thought by modern scholars has been that the Mysteries were intended \\"to elevate man above the human sphere into the divine and to assure his redemption by making him a god and so conferring immortality upon him\\".Nilsson, Martin P. Greek Popular Religion \\"The Religion of Eleusis\\" New York: Columbia University Press, 1947. pages 42‚Äì64 Comparative study shows parallels between these Greek rituals and similar systemssome of them olderin the Near East. Such cults include the mysteries of Isis and Osiris in Egypt, the Adoniac of Syrian cults, the Persian mysteries, and the Phrygian Cabeirian mysteries.Newton, Joseph Fort.The Builders p.24 Some scholars argued that the Eleusinian cult was a continuation of a Minoan cult,Kerenyi (1976), Dionysos. Archetypal image of indestructible life p.79 and that Demeter was a poppy goddess who brought the poppy from Crete to Eleusis.Kerenyi, 1976 p.23\\" Persephone is probably the unnamable mistress of the labyrinth (Mycenean (Linear B) inscription : da-pu- ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja) \\" : Karl Kerenyi.Dionysos.Archetypal image of indestructible life.p 89,90. Some useful information from the Mycenean period can be taken from the study of the cult of Despoina, (the precursor goddess of Persephone), and the cult of Eileithyia who was the goddess of childbirth. The megaron of Despoina at Lycosura is quite similar with the Telesterion of Eleusis,Burkert: Greek religion p.285 and Demeter is united with the god Poseidon, bearing a daughter, the unnamable Despoina (the mistress).Pausanias, 8.37.9 In the cave of Amnisos at Crete, the goddess Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child, and she is connected with Enesidaon (The Earth Shaker),Mycenean (Linear B) inscription :E-ne-si-da-o-ne who is the chthonic aspect of Poseidon.Dietrich The origins of Greek Religion pp. 220, 221 At Eleusis inscriptions refer to \\"the Goddesses\\" accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemos (probably son of Ge and Oceanus),Pseudo Apollodorus Biblioteca IV.2 and \\"the God and the Goddess\\" (Persephone and Plouton) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld.Kevin Klinton (1993), Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches, Routledge, p. 11 The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases: the \\"descent\\", the \\"search\\", and the \\"ascent\\" (Greek \\"anodos\\") with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation. The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter.Nilsson, Greek popular religion p.51 At the beginning of the feast, the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out, the one towards the west, and the other towards the east. The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme \\"rain and conceive\\". In a ritual, a child was initiated from the hearth (the divine fire). The name pais (child) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions,Burkert(1985) p.285 It was the ritual of the \\"divine child\\" who originally was Ploutos. In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos.Wunderlich 1972 The secret of Creta p. 134 The goddess of nature survived in the mysteries where the following words were uttered: \\"Mighty Potnia bore a great son\\". Potnia (Linear B po-ti- ni-ja : lady or mistress), is a Mycenaean title applied to goddesses. and probably the translation of a similar title of Pre-Greek origin.Chadwick: The Mycenean world P.92 The high point of the celebration was \\"an ear of grain cut in silence\\", which represented the force of the new life. The idea of immortality didn't exist in the mysteries at the beginning, but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld. Death remained a reality, but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed. A depiction from the old palace of Phaistos is very close to the image of the \\"anodos\\" of Persephone. An armless and legless deity grows out of the ground, and her head turns to a large flower.Burkert (1985)Greek Religion. Harvard University Press. p.42 According to Mylonas, the lesser mysteries were held \\"as a rule once a year in the early spring in the month of flowers, the Anthesterion,\\" while \\"the Greater Mysteries were held once a year and every fourth year they were celebrated with special splendor in what was known as the penteteris.Mylonas, George E. \\"Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries\\". Princeton University Press 1961, p. 239, 243. Kerenyi concurs with this assessment: \\"The Lesser Mysteries were held at Agrai in the month of Anthesterion, our February... The initiates were not even admitted to the epopteia [Greater Mysteries] in the same year, but only in September of the following year.\\"Kerenyi, Carl. Eleusis ‚Äì Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter. Bollingen Foundation 1967, p. 48. This cycle continued for about two millennia. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, King Celeus is said to have been one of the first people to learn the secret rites and mysteries of her cult. He was also one of her original priests, along with Diocles, Eumolpos, Polyxeinus and Triptolemus, Celeus' son, who had supposedly learned agriculture from Demeter.Apollodorus, 1.5.2. Under Peisistratos of Athens, the Eleusinian Mysteries became pan-Hellenic, and pilgrims flocked from Greece and beyond to participate. Around 300 BC, the state took over control of the Mysteries; they were controlled by two families, the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. This led to a vast increase in the number of initiates. The only requirements for membership were freedom from \\"blood guilt\\" , meaning never having committed murder, and not being a \\"barbarian\\" (being unable to speak Greek). Men, women and even slaves were allowed initiation.Smith, William. A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, London, 1875. =Participants= To participate in these mysteries one had to swear a vow of secrecy. Four categories of people participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries: #Priests, priestesses, and hierophants. #Initiates, undergoing the ceremony for the first time. #Others who had already participated at least once. They were eligible for the fourth category. #Those who had attained √©popteia (Greek: ·ºêœÄŒøœÄœÑŒµŒØŒ±) (English: \\"contemplation\\"), who had learned the secrets of the greatest mysteries of Demeter. =Priesthood= The priesthood officiating at the Eleusinian Mysteries and in the sanctuary was divided in to several offices with different tasks, composed of mostly women with men serving minor roles. Six categories of priests officiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries: # Hierophantes, high priestess, an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families. # High Priestess of Demeter, an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families. # Dadouchos, men serving as torch bearers. # Dadouchousa Prietess, an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families. # Hierophantides, two married priestesses: one serving Demeter and the other Persephone. # Panageis ('the holy') or melissae ('bees'), a group of priestesses who lived a life secluded from men. The office of Hierophant, High Priestess and Dadouchousa Priestess were all inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families, and the Hierophant and the High Priestess were of equal rank.Pomeroy, Sarah B, Goddesses, whores, wives, and slaves: women in classical antiquity, Schocken Books, New York, 1995 It was the task of the High Priestess to impersonate the roles of the goddesses Demeter and Persefone in the enactement during the Mysteries. =Secrets= The outline below is only a capsule summary; much of the concrete information about the Eleusinian Mysteries was never written down. For example, only initiates knew what the kiste, a sacred chest, and the calathus, a lidded basket, contained. Hippolytus of Rome, one of the Church Fathers writing in the early 3rd century AD, discloses in Refutation of All Heresies that \\"the Athenians, while initiating people into the Eleusinian rites, likewise display to those who are being admitted to the highest grade at these mysteries, the mighty, and marvellous, and most perfect secret suitable for one initiated into the highest mystic truths: an ear of grain in silence reaped.\\"Hippolytus, Refutation of all Heresies, in ANF, vol. 5; 5, 3 =Lesser Mysteries= There were two Eleusinian Mysteries, the Greater and the Lesser. According to Thomas Taylor, \\"the dramatic shows of the Lesser Mysteries occultly signified the miseries of the soul while in subjection to the body, so those of the Greater obscurely intimated, by mystic and splendid visions, the felicity of the soul both here and hereafter, when purified from the defilements of a material nature and constantly elevated to the realities of intellectual [spiritual] vision.\\" According to Plato, \\"the ultimate design of the Mysteries ‚Ä¶ was to lead us back to the principles from which we descended, ‚Ä¶ a perfect enjoyment of intellectual [spiritual] good.\\"Taylor, p.49. The Lesser Mysteries took place in the month of Anthesteria ‚Äì the eight month of the Attic calendar, falling in mid winter around February or March ‚Äì under the direction of Athens' archon basileus. In order to qualify for initiation, participants would sacrifice a piglet to Demeter and Persephone, and then ritually purify themselves in the river Illisos. Upon completion of the Lesser Mysteries, participants were deemed mystai (\\"initiates\\") worthy of witnessing the Greater Mysteries. =Greater Mysteries= The Greater Mysteries took place in Boedromion ‚Äì the third month of the Attic calendar, falling in late summer around September or October ‚Äì and lasted ten days. The first act (on the 14th of Boedromion) was the bringing of the sacred objects from Eleusis to the Eleusinion, a temple at the base of the Acropolis of Athens. On the 15th of Boedromion, a day called the Gathering (Agyrmos), the priests (hierophantes, those who show the sacred ones) declared the start of the rites (prorrhesis), and carried out the sacrifice (hiere√≠a de√∫ro, hither the victims). The seawards initiates (halade mystai) started out in Athens on 16th Boedromion with the celebrants washing themselves in the sea at Phaleron. On the 17th, the participants began the Epidauria, a festival for Asklepios named after his main sanctuary at Epidauros. This \\"festival within a festival\\" celebrated the healer's arrival at Athens with his daughter Hygieia, and consisted of a procession leading to the Eleusinion, during which the mystai apparently stayed at home, a great sacrifice, and an all-night feast (pannykh√≠s).Clinton, Kevin. \\"The Epidauria and the Arrival of Asclepius in Athens\\", in Ancient Greek Cult Practice from the Epigraphical Evidence, edited by R. H√§gg. Stockholm, 1994. The procession to Eleusis began at Kerameikos (the Athenian cemetery) on the 18th, and from there the people walked to Eleusis, along the Sacred Way (·ºπŒµœÅ·Ω∞ ·ΩâŒ¥œåœÇ, Hier√° Hod√≥s), swinging branches called bacchoi. At a certain spot along the way, they shouted obscenities in commemoration of Iambe (or Baubo), an old woman who, by cracking dirty jokes, had made Demeter smile as she mourned the loss of her daughter. The procession also shouted \\"√çakch', O √çakche!\\", possibly an epithet for Dionysus, or a separate deity Iacchus, son of Persephone or Demeter.Iacchus (Iakchos) has been considered the divine name of the mystic Bacchus at Athens and Eleusis, derived from the boisterous festive song named for him, called Iacchus, and sung during the procession  or the personification of the ritual cry \\"√çakhe\\". See Smith, Iacchus; Aristophanes, Frogs 316 ff, 5th or 4th century BC; Plutarch, Life of Alcibiades 34. 3; Herodotus, Histories, 8. 65. 4; Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri, ii. 16; Virgil, Georgics, i. 166; and Plutarch, Themistocles, 15. Upon reaching Eleusis, there was an all-night vigil (pannychis) according to MylonasMylonas, G. E., 1961 Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries, p.258 and Kerenyi.Kerenyi, C. Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter, p. 62 perhaps commemorating Demeter's search for Persephone. At some point, initiates had a special drink (kykeon), of barley and pennyroyal, which has led to speculation about its chemicals perhaps having psychotropic effects from the Ergot fungi. Discovery of fragments of Ergot (fungi containing LSD like psychedelic alkaloids) in a temple dedicated to the two Eleusinian Goddesses excavated at the Mas Castellar site (Girona, Spain) provided legitimacy for this theory. Ergot fragments were found inside a vase and within the dental calculus 25-year-old man, providing evidence of Ergot being consumed (Juan-Stresserras, 2002). This finding seems to support the hypothesis of ergot as an ingredient of the Eleusinian kykeon.  Inside the Telesterion  On the 19th of Boedromion, initiates entered a great hall called Telesterion; in the center stood the Palace (Anaktoron), which only the hierophants could enter, where sacred objects were stored. Before mystai could enter the Telesterion, they would recite, \\"I have fasted, I have drunk the kykeon, I have taken from the kiste (box) and after working it have put it back in the calathus (open basket).According to Clement of Alexandria's Exhortation to the Greeks. See Meyer 1999, 18. It is widely supposed that the rites inside the Telesterion comprised three elements: # dromena (things done), a dramatic reenactment of the Demeter/Persephone myth # deiknumena (things shown), displayed sacred objects, in which the hierophant played an essential role # legomena (things said), commentaries that accompanied the deiknumena.See (e.g.) Brisson/Teihnayi 2004, 60 Combined, these three elements were known as the aporrheta (\\"unrepeatables\\"); the penalty for divulging them was death. Athenagoras of Athens, Cicero, and other ancient writers cite that it was for this crime (among others) that Diagoras was condemned to death in Athens; the tragic playwright Aeschylus was allegedly tried for revealing secrets of the Mysteries in some of his plays, but was acquitted.Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1111a8-10. The ban on divulging the core ritual of the Mysteries was thus absolute, which is probably why we know almost nothing about what transpired there. Climax As to the climax of the Mysteries, there are two modern theories. Some hold that the priests were the ones to reveal the visions of the holy night, consisting of a fire that represented the possibility of life after death, and various sacred objects. Others hold this explanation to be insufficient to account for the power and longevity of the Mysteries, and that the experiences must have been internal and mediated by a powerful psychoactive ingredient contained in the kykeon drink (see Entheogenic theories below). Following this section of the Mysteries was an all-night feast (Pannychis) accompanied by dancing and merriment. The dances took place in the Rharian Field, rumored to be the first spot where grain grew. A bull sacrifice also took place late that night or early the next morning. That day (22nd Boedromion), the initiates honored the dead by pouring libations from special vessels. On the 23rd of Boedromion, the Mysteries ended and everyone returned home.Boardman, Griffin, and Murray. The Oxford History of the Classical World. Oxford University Press 1986. Demise In 170 AD, the Temple of Demeter was sacked by the Sarmatians but was rebuilt by Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius was then allowed to become the only lay person ever to enter the anaktoron. As Christianity gained in popularity in the 4th and 5th centuries, Eleusis's prestige began to fade. The last pagan emperor of Rome, Julian, reigned from 361 to 363 after about fifty years of Christian rule. Julian attempted to restore the Eleusinian Mysteries and was the last emperor to be initiated into them. The Roman emperor Theodosius I closed the sanctuaries by decree during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire about 30 years later, in 392 AD. The last remnants of the Mysteries were wiped out in 396 AD, when Arian Christians under Alaric, King of the Goths, destroyed and desecrated the old sacred sites.Rassias, Vlasis. Demolish Them. (in Greek) Athens 2000. The closing of the Eleusinian Mysteries in the 4th century is reported by Eunapius, a historian and biographer of the Greek philosophers. Eunapius had been initiated by the last legitimate Hierophant, who had been commissioned by the emperor Julian to restore the Mysteries, which had by then fallen into decay. According to Eunapius, the very last Hierophant was a usurper, \\"the man from Thespiae who held the rank of Father in the mysteries of Mithras\\". According to historian Hans Kloft, despite the destruction of the Eleusinian Mysteries, elements of the cult survived in the Greek countryside. There, Demeter's rites and religious duties were partially transferred by peasants and shepherds onto Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, who gradually became the local patron of agriculture and \\"heir\\" to the pagan mother goddess. In art, literature, and culture Henryk Siemiradzki. Phryne in Eleusus (1889). There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries. The Eleusinian Relief, from the late 5th century BC, displayed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens is a representative example. Triptolemus is depicted receiving seeds from Demeter and teaching mankind how to work the fields to grow crops, with Persephone holding her hand over his head to protect him. Vases and other works of relief sculpture, from the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries BC, depict Triptolemus holding an ear of corn, sitting on a winged throne or chariot, surrounded by Persephone and Demeter with pine torches. The monumental Protoattic amphora from the middle of the 7th century BC, with the depiction of Medusa's beheading by Perseus and the blinding of Polyphemos by Odysseus and his companions on its neck, is kept in the Archaeological Museum of Eleusis which is located inside the archaeological site of Eleusis. The Ninnion Tablet, found in the same museum, depicts Demeter, followed by Persephone and Iacchus, and then the procession of initiates. Then, Demeter is sitting on the kiste inside the Telesterion, with Persephone holding a torch and introducing the initiates. The initiates each hold a bacchoi. The second row of initiates were led by Iakchos, a priest who held torches for the ceremonies. He is standing near the omphalos while an unknown female (probably a priestess of Demeter) sat nearby on the kiste, holding a scepter and a vessel filled with kykeon. Pannychis is also represented. In Shakespeare's The Tempest, the masque that Prospero conjures to celebrate the troth-pledging of Miranda and Ferdinand echoes the Eleusinian Mysteries, although it uses the Roman names for the deities involved ‚Äì Ceres, Iris, Dis and others ‚Äì instead of the Greek. It is interesting that a play which is so steeped in esoteric imagery from alchemy and hermeticism should draw on the Mysteries for its central masque sequence. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) borrowed terms and interpretations from the late 19th and early-20th century classical scholarship in German and French as a source of metaphors for his reframing of psychoanalytic treatment into a spiritualistic ritual of initiation and rebirth. The Eleusinian mysteries, particularly the qualities of the Kore, figured prominently in his writings. Dimitris Lyacos in the second book of the Poena Damni trilogy With the People from the Bridge, a contemporary, avant-garde play focusing on the return of the dead and the myth of the revenant combines elements from the Eleusinian mysteries as well as early Christian tradition in order to convey a view of collective salvation. The text uses the pomegranate symbol in order to hint at the residence of the dead in the underworld and their periodical return to the world of the living.Julie Kovacs, The nightmare continues in With the People from the Bridge. Exercise Bowler, Issue 21, 2015. http://exercisebowler.com/issue21.htm Octavio Vazquez's symphonic poem \\"Eleusis\\" draws on the Eleusinian Mysteries and on other Western esoteric traditions. Commissioned by the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores and the RTVE Symphony Orchestra, it was premiered in 2015 by the RTVE Orchestra and conductor Adrian Leaper at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid. Entheogenic theories Numerous scholars have proposed that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the kykeon's functioning as an entheogen, or psychedelic agent. The use of potions or philtres for magical or religious purposes was relatively common in Greece and the ancient world.Collins, Derek. Magic in the Ancient Greek World. Wiley, 2008 The initiates, sensitized by their fast and prepared by preceding ceremonies (see set and setting), may have been propelled by the effects of a powerful psychoactive potion into revelatory mind states with profound spiritual and intellectual ramifications.Wasson, et al.. In opposition to this idea, other pointedly skeptical scholars note the lack of any solid evidence and stress the collective rather than individual character of initiation into the Mysteries.Burkert, op.cit. Ch.4 Indirect evidence in support of the entheogenic theory is that in 415 BC Athenian aristocrat Alcibiades was condemned partly because he took part in an \\"Eleusinian mystery\\" in a private house.Robin Waterfield,Why Socrates Died, Faber & Faber, 2009, p. 92. Many psychoactive agents have been proposed as the significant element of kykeon, though without consensus or conclusive evidence. These include the ergot, a fungal parasite of the barley or rye grain, which contains the alkaloids ergotamine, a precursor to LSD, and ergonovine. However, modern attempts to prepare a kykeon using ergot- parasitized barley have yielded inconclusive results, though Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin describe both ergonovine and LSA to be known to produce LSD- like effects.Shulgin & Shulgin. Tihkal. Transform Press, 1997. Discovery of fragments of Ergot (fungi containing LSD-like psychedelic alkaloids) in a temple dedicated to the two Eleusinian Goddesses excavated at the Mas Castellar site (Girona, Spain) provided legitimacy for this theory. Ergot fragments were found inside a vase and within the dental calculus 25-year-old man, providing evidence of Ergot being consumed. This finding seems to support the hypothesis of ergot as an ingredient of the Eleusinian kykeon title=Juan- Stresserras, J. (2002). . Psychoactive mushrooms are another candidate. Terence McKenna speculated that the mysteries were focused around a variety of Psilocybe. Other entheogenic fungi, such as Amanita muscaria, have also been suggested.McKenna. A recent hypothesis suggests that the ancient Egyptians cultivated Psilocybe cubensis on barley and associated it with the deity Osiris. Another candidate for the psychoactive drug is an opioid derived from the poppy. The cult of the goddess Demeter may have brought the poppy from Crete to Eleusis; it is certain that opium was produced in Crete.Karl Kerenyi.Dionysos.Archetypal image of indestructible life.p 24 Another theory is that the psychoactive agent in kykeon is DMT, which occurs in many wild plants of the Mediterranean, including Phalaris and/or Acacia.Metzner, Ralph. \\"The Reunification of the Sacred and the natural\\". Eleusis Volume VIII, 1997. pp. 3‚Äì13 To be active orally (like in ayahuasca) it must be combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala), which grows throughout the Mediterranean. Alternatively, J. Nigro Sansonese (1994), using the mythography supplied by Mylonas, hypothesizes that the Mysteries of Eleusis were a series of practical initiations into trance involving proprioception of the human nervous system induced by breath control (similar to samyama in yoga).Sansonese, J. Nigro. The Body of Myth. Rochester, 1994, pp. 195‚Äì215. Sansonese speculates that the kist√©, a box holding sacred objects opened by the hierophant, is actually an esoteric reference to the initiate's skull, within which is seen a sacred light and are heard sacred sounds, but only after instruction in trance practice. Similarly, the seed-filled chambers of a pomegranate, a fruit associated with the founding of the cult, esoterically describe proprioception of the initiate's heart during trance. Modern continuation Since 1985, Aquarian Tabernacle Church has performed a modern continuation of the Eleusinian Mysteries, as the Spring Mysteries Festival. These mysteries, held every year in honour of Demeter and Persephone, explore universal concepts and truths from the perspective of the seeker of hidden knowledge. It occurs on the weekend of Easter every year. The first year back in the modern age was 1985.
