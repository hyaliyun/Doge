She was the first woman appointed to the permanent teaching staff at Canterbury College, now the University of Canterbury. Education Herriott was born in Canterbury in 1882. Her parents were David and Elizabeth Susannah Herriott. Herriott attended Christchurch East School and Christchurch Girls' High School, where she was head prefect in 1899. She won a scholarship to attend Canterbury College, and studied botany and chemistry there from 1900 to 1905. She graduated with a B.A. in 1904 and a M.A. in 1905. . Her Master's research was on the leaf anatomy of Subantarctic Islands species, and involved the study of plants brought back from an expedition in 1903 by Leonard Cockayne. Career On graduation Herriott took up teaching positions, initially at Rangi Ruru Girls' School and later at Kaikoura District High School. In 1916 she was appointed to an assistant lecturer position in the Department of Biology at Canterbury College. She was promoted to the position of lecturer in 1928, and held this position until her retirement in 1934. Herriott was particularly interested in the unusual anatomical adaptations that plants made to better survive in harsh environments. Her published work included papers on fresh water crustacean, biographies of early botanists Joseph and John Armstrong, and the morphology of the seaweed Durvillaea (which was presented to the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury in 1921. Her most significant piece of work is considered to be her study of the development of the flora in the area of west Christchurch occupied by Hagley Park (which she also presented at the First New Zealand Science Congress in 1919). In this study she compared records of the plant life in the area in 1864 with later observations. She particularly noted the impact of land development such as the draining of a swamp in 1897 to create Lake Victoria, the introduction of non-native plants through ceremonial plantings by visiting dignitaries and the erection and destruction of buildings for the International Exhibition of 1906. Cass Field Station, 1920 From 1921 to 1927 Professor Charles Chilton, the chair of the biology department, held the position of Rector of Canterbury College, and Herriott served as his clerical assistant. Herriott was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury for many years; in 1919 she was elected to its council, and in the 1920s she served as its Honorary Librarian. Herriott was a member of the Worcester Street Brethren assembly and held Evangelical Union prayer meetings in her college office. Death On 13 March 1936, Herriott died at her home at St Andrews Square in the Christchurch suburb of Strowan.

The contamination was discovered in 1980 and resulted in the closing of 20 water supply wells and intensive cleanup efforts in the following years. More than 25 percent of the San Bernardino municipal water supply has been affected by the water contamination since its discovery. The source of the contamination is attributed to a World War II Army landfill and depot, used from 1942 to 1947.  History  The Superfund site was the location of the U.S. Army's Camp Ono from 1942 to 1947, used for housing Italian Prisoners of War and was later converted to a truck and munitions cleaning site. Several of the solvents used in the cleaning process were later discovered to be toxic. The Newmark Groundwater Contamination Site resides on part of a groundwater aquifer that supplies water to the cities of San Bernardino, Colton, Loma Linda, Fontana, Rialto, and Riverside. Many of the wells responsible for supplying water to these areas lay down gradient from the two contamination plumes that resulted from the pollution. In 1980, two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) were discovered at the Newmark well fields. Exposure to PCE and TCE is associated with adverse health effects such as Central Nervous System depression, neurological, lung, kidney, and heart effects, and increased cancer risk. The federal standards for TCE and PCE require that all drinking water must be below 5 parts per billion and levels discovered during the contamination were in the hundreds of parts per billion.  Clean-up  In 1993, the EPA took actions to pump and treat millions of gallons of contaminated water to control the spread of pollution plumes into other parts of the aquifer. The water was treated using conventional carbon adsorption and is projected to take several more decades.  Legal actions  In 1996, the city of San Bernardino sued the federal government for the Army's involvement in the contamination of the groundwater. After an eight-year legal battle, the Army settled for $69 million to be used for continued groundwater treatment and cleanup. The city is required to use these funds to maintain the EPA's groundwater treatment facilities and to expand the city's water treatment plants.

History The government of North Rhine-Westphalia decided in 1988 to carry out the IBA Emscher Park to achieve a paradigm shift from the ‚Äúrust belt‚Äù towards a green, modern and wealthy metropolitan area. In the past the regions who had carried out an Internationale Bauausstellung (Darmstadt 1901, Leipzig 1913, Stuttgart 1927, Berlin 1957 and 1984) mainly aimed at architectural improvements and highlights, whereas the IBA Emscher Park aimed a holistic approach by restructuring a former industrial region, the Ruhr, with outstanding urbanistic, architectural, cultural, ecological and economic incentives.Dimensionen der √∂kologischen Erneuerung, Ministry for Environment and Agriculture North Rhine-Westphalia, brochure 1993 In the 1980s, the Ruhr region faced growing unemployment rates as a result of the shutdown of most mines and many steel works, environmental problems especially regarding brownfields and waste land and the river Emscher system. The IBA programme therefore was covering 7 general principles to overcome the structural difficulties:Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park - Werkstatt f√ºr die Zukunft alter Industriegebiete, Ministry for Spatial Planning, Housing and Transport North Rhine Westphalia, Memorandum 1989 * Reconstruction of landscape ‚Äì the Emscher Landscape Park * Ecological restoration of the river Emscher system * Rhein-Herne Canal ‚Äì an adventure space * Industrial cultural heritage as national treasure * Working in the park * New forms of houses and housing * New options for social, cultural and sports activities. The 7 general principles details The intention of the IBA Emscher Park was to develop in parallel structural changes covering the whole area and to initiate lighthouse projects that work as local stimulation and attract attention. The region was suffering from its image as rust belt for more than a hundred years and even though a lot of green spaces and landscape existed this was not highlighted before and made the region ‚Äì a misgiving of the government ‚Äì not attractive for investments or long-term improvements. The time stretch of 10 years (1989-1999) was chosen to create changes that do not only present single solutions on buildings but to enable public partners to activate complex interdisciplinary planning processes that work in the long run. Moreover, the processes partly were organized in a way that projects like the restoration of the Emscher system were scheduled to last up to the year 2025.Die Emscher - Der √∂kologische Umbau eines Entw√§sserungssystems, symposium Nov. 19/20 1990 in Bottrop hosted by the Emschergenossenschaft and the Ministry for Environment and Agriculture North Rhine-Westphalia, brochure published 1990 under ‚ÄúEmscher Park Tagungsberichte 3‚Äù The initiators of the IBA were aiming at changes to become deeply rooted in regional planning culture. =Reconstruction of landscape ‚Äì the Emscher Landscape Park= The Emscher Landscape Park was identified to be the 800 km¬≤ of ‚Äúopen space‚Äù in the region ‚Äì agricultural land, forests, brownfields with plant carpet, vegetation at railway embankments, slag heaps, and other more or less green structures. The classical meaning of a park was not visible here, so the aim was to connect fragmented green structures, develop new ones and make the open spaces accessible for public. For example, within the Emscher Landscape Park a huge number of previous railway lines were located that lost their meaning and function with the decline of the mines. With support of the IBA and public funding these railway dams were converted to work as regional bike path network. The Kommunalverband Ruhrgebiet (today Regionalverband Ruhrgebiet, RVRWebpage of the regional planning authority Regionalverband Ruhrgebiet) took over the responsibility for the development and coordination of the Emscher Landscape Park and worked in cooperation with the municipalities in 7 ‚Äúsub- parks‚Äù (green belts A to G), with Emschergenossenschaft and Lippeverband and other public players like the owner of slag heaps RAG AG on the quality and quantity of green connections. From 1991 on the government of North Rhine- Westphalia supported the Emscher Landscape Park projects with the ‚Äú√ñkologieprogramm Emscher-Lippe‚Äù, a funding instrument fed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Federal State funds, co-financing measures with 80% to 90%. Within 20 years (1991 ‚Äì 2010) around 680 Mio. ‚Ç¨ funding have been invested in more than 400 Emscher Landscape Park projects, mainly by municipalities and RVR.Webpage of the responsible authority for funding Bezirksregierung M√ºnster, data published in 2013 The Regionalverband Ruhrgebiet is still responsible and caring for the Emscher Landschaftspark.RVR webpage Emscher Landscape Park =Ecological restoration of the river Emscher system= The river Emscher with its approximately 80 km and some hundred kilometres of tributaries was since the 19th century a symbol for the rust belt and ecological problems as the network was working like an open waste water collection and discharge system. The construction of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sewers was in most areas impossible due to mining-induced subsidence. With the decline of the mines the Emschergenossenschaft started in the 1980s first tests for restoration and with the beginning of the IBA processes the Emschergenossenschaft set up a programme for pilot projects. Besides the very technical measures (construction of new decentralised waste water treatment plants, construction of about 350 km of new sewers) it was necessary to start as well with the renaturation of open water courses to show the ecological potential and urban development chances such projects can bring. One of the first IBA projects was the 9 km Dorneburger M√ºhlenbach/H√ºller Bach in Bochum, jointly developed by the Emschergenossenschaft and the municipality of Bochum in cooperation with neighbouring cities and many private land owners. Regarding the above-mentioned effects for investments and structural changes in the long run the restoration was for example leading to the construction of a new quarter at the banks.Municipal Info on new city quarter at Dornerburger M√ºhlenbach In the frame of the IBA the Emschergenossenschaft started to change the waste water fee system. It was the first catchment area in Germany that had a split of the fees, charging both for domestic waste water and paved areas with the consequence that disconnection and infiltration of rain water from roofs etc. was economically interesting for everybody.Webpage Emschergenossenschaft on stormwater disconnection =Rhein-Herne Canal ‚Äì an adventure space= The 46 km Rhein-Herne Canal had been developed from 1906 to 1914 to support the trade of coal and steel in the growing Ruhr region. With the decline of the mines it lost a little its meaning and many ancient harbours had not been used for commercial purposes any more. The IBA idea was to use the former industrial harbours for new uses and initiate waterfront architecture, combined with leisure and ecological qualities. The legal frame was partly complicated as the artificial shipping canals are legally handled like a ‚Äúmotorway for ships‚Äù and not like rivers, so permissions and uses are very regulated.Webpage of the competent authority for waterway management Nevertheless, many improved leisure uses, bike paths and a couple of new buildings were established, for example at Stadthafen RecklinghausenBeach and Pub at city harbour Recklinghausen or the new city quarter at harbour Bismarck in GelsenkirchenCity quarter Bismarck Harbour Further changes will appear when the canal and its locks are widened until 2025 to be adapted to modern push boats. =Industrial cultural heritage as national treasure= Industrial cultural heritage was a challenging IBA topic as it dealt with many deserted mine buildings and technical equipment that was no longer needed and used. Therefore, on the one hand (public) funding to restore these buildings and on the other hand a follow-up application was needed to manage the cultural heritage successfully. The IBA initiators aimed at creating identification and a unique atmosphere by restoring and presenting the relicts of the 150 years industry history. The idea behind was that all other metropolitan regions have special features that form images and identification ‚Äì internally for the inhabitants as well as for tourists and visitors. Besides many smaller buildings that are often used for businesses or administrations now some of the large sites managed to fulfil the expectations. Industrial relicts like Gasometer Oberhausen, Jahrhunderthalle BochumWebpage of the Hall of the Century or Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord are today very popular sites with millions of visitors. =Working in the park= Increasing unemployment rates especially regarding the former primary sector, influx of the population into the city districts after German reunification and the structural changes in general after the pull-out of the industrial sector asked for new solutions on working places. The idea of ‚Äúworking in the park‚Äù meant that former mine or steel sites should be redeveloped to attractive, green and modern working places in combination with cultural heritage if possible. The development of these sites was often asking for environmental remediation and innovative ideas on how to deal with surface water (that should not infiltrate through polluted soil). Projects like in Bochum ‚Äú√ñkologischer Gewerbepark Zeche Holland‚ÄùStory and Pictures of Zeche Holland with outstanding stormwater management systems or the business park on the former coal mine ErinIndustrial Heritage and Working in the Park on Erin in Castrop-Rauxel with the polluted soil being encapsulated in pyramids show some of the innovative approaches. =New forms of houses and housing= The search for ‚Äúnew‚Äù forms of houses and living together was partly a kind of ‚Äúback to the roots‚Äù as the historical settlements like mine owners and steel companies had created for their workers were becoming very popular again. Beautiful settlements were restored and partly new houses were adapted that followed the rules of former architects and spatial planners. The garden city ideal can be seen today in settlements like in Herne,Municipality of Herne, presentation of the settlement ‚ÄúTeutoburgia‚Äù or in Bottrop at Gartenstadt Welheim.Webpage presentation of Gartenstadt Welheim The Gelsenkirchen project ‚ÄúSiedlung K√ºppersbusch‚Äù tried to realize the historical garden city approach in a completely new developed settlement on a previous industrial site.Webpage with facts & data about K√ºppersbusch =New options for social, cultural and sports activities= The idea behind this cross-cut topic was to offer new kinds of employment or chances to spend leisure time due to the ongoing reduction of working lifetime. Garden plots or aspects of ‚Äúurban gardening‚Äù were discussed additionally to the Emscher Landscape Park offers and the cultural events that came up in combination with the orchestration of cultural heritage. Participants The management of the IBA Emscher Park was carried out by a public body (Planungsgesellschaft IBA Emscher Park GmbH) that coordinated the municipal participants and other public and private bodies. The involved cities were Dortmund, Kamen, Bergkamen, Waltrop, L√ºnen, Castrop-Rauxel, Recklinghausen, Herten, Herne, Bochum, Essen, M√ºlheim, Gelsenkirchen, Gladbeck, Bottrop, Oberhausen and Duisburg. Supporting partners were Emschergenossenschaft and Lippeverband, Kommunalverband Ruhrgebiet, Deutsche Bahn, RAG AG and many other local partners. Within the cities more than 100 large projects were carried out.List of local IBA projects References Category:Ruhr Category:History of North Rhine-Westphalia ","title":"Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park"},{"id":"49360077","text":"Petr Weigl, 2011 Petr Weigl (16 March 1939 ‚Äì 14 July 2018)Zem≈ôel re≈æis√©r Petr Weigl, tv≈Ørce Rad√∫ze a Mahuleny ƒçi Rusalky was a Czech director and playwright.Cenu Vladislava Vanƒçury p≈ôevzal Petr Weigl, 26. 1. 2008, T√Ωden.cz  Biography  In 1961 he graduated from the Prague Film School and the Academy of Performing Arts Television.

He was considered a well-known public figure after his return from service in the Australian Infantry Force in Gallipoli and was a leader in the founding of the Queensland RSL movement, later becoming its president. After his military service, Mighell directed many companies and later served Australia as the Deputy High Commissioner for Australia in London. Early and military life Sir Norman Rupert Mighell was born on 12 June 1894 at Mackay, Queensland, second son of Alfred William Mighell, an accountant from England, and his Queensland-born wife Mary Anne, n√©e O'Donohue. Growing up, Norman was educated at St Joseph's College (now Gregory Terrace), Brisbane. Norman worked as an articled clerk at Gordonvale and studied law. He was mobilised in the Militia in August 1914 and served briefly with the garrison on Thursday Island before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 3 November. Five ft 11 ins (180 cm) tall and weighing 10 st. 6 lb. (66 kg), he had grey eyes and light brown hair. As a sergeant in the 15th Battalion, he was among the first Australian troops to land at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, sustaining severe wounds which plagued him for the rest of his life. He was admitted to hospital in England in June, repatriated in November, and discharged from the A.I.F. on 14 June 1916.  Post-war service  After serving as an ANZAC officer, Norman was admitted as a solicitor on 30 April 1918. He practised law at Innisfail (until 1925) and then in Brisbane. Norman married Marjorie Draper on 23 June 1920 in a private ceremony. The wedding dinner took place at the Strand Hotel. Sir Norman was the Country and Progressive National Party candidate for the seat of Herbert in the 1926 Queensland state election. He did not win the seat, but according to the Cairns Post he was well received at many functions ahead of the election. Mighell was also a foundation member (1928) of the Brisbane Legacy Club and president (1928‚Äì29) of the Queensland branch of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia. On 16 July 1929 he was admitted to the Bar. That year he became chairman of No.1 War Pensions Assessment Appeal Tribunal. In 1935 Mighell was appointed chairman of the Repatriation Commission, Melbourne. Fearing that ex-servicemen and women might lose more than they gained, he resisted moves in the late 1930s to reform repatriation legislation, particularly the proposal to subject war pensioners to a means test. In addition, he opposed the Menzies government's decision (1940) to remove the pension entitlement of an ex-serviceman's de facto wife when his lawful wife received or claimed the benefit. Mighell also took a special interest in the education of the children of deceased or disabled veterans. During World War II he warned the government against permitting people with disabilities to enlist in the armed forces because they might later qualify for pensions. Appointed Commonwealth coal commissioner in August 1941 (head of the Coal Commission, 1942‚Äì44), Mighell held responsibility for the production and distribution of coal until 1946. He endeavoured to increase yields and to handle the many industrial problems which plagued the industry. In 1943 he chaired the committee whose recommendations on the resettlement of armed services personnel formed the basis for the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. As Australia's deputy high commissioner in London in 1946-49, he returned to Melbourne in 1950. Mighell had been appointed C.M.G. in 1939. In 1951 he was knighted. He chaired the British Memorial Fund and the Melbourne branch of the Overseas League. In the 1950s Mighell was chairman of Sulphide Corporation Pty Ltd, Standard Telephones & Cables Pty Ltd, Consolidated Zinc Pty Ltd and the Melbourne board of Atlas Assurance Co. Ltd. As chairman of Territory Enterprises Pty Ltd, he played an important part in developing, on behalf of the Commonwealth government, the uranium deposits at Rum Jungle, Northern Territory. Sir Norman was a director of Zinc Corporation Ltd, New Broken Hill Consolidated Ltd and Anglo-Australian Corporation Pty Ltd. Survived by his wife and son, he died on 13 April 1955 in the Mercy Hospital, East Melbourne, from injuries received in a motorcar accident and was buried in Melbourne general cemetery.

This embroidery with its rich designs has made a notable contribution to the Indian embroidery traditions. The embroidery, practiced normally by women is generally done on fabrics of cotton, in the form of a net using cotton or silk threads. In certain patterns, it is also crafted over silk and satin. The types of stitches adopted are ‚Äúsquare chain, double buttonhole, pattern darning, running stitch, satin and straight stitches‚Äù. The signature effect of the colorful embroidery sparkles when small mirrors called abhla are sewn over the geometrically shaped designs. Depending on the tribal sub groups of Rabari, Garasia Jat, and Mutava involved with this craft work many hand embroidered ethnic styles have evolved. These six styles: Suf, khaarek, paako, Rabari, Garasia Jat, and Mutava. This embroidery product of Kutch has been registered for protection under the List of Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. In March 2013, it was listed as \\"Kutch Embroidery\\" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class 24 Textile and Textile Goods, and its logo registered in November 2015 vide application number 509 for the dated 8 January 2012. Location The product is made in several villages in the Kutch district, which lie within the geographical coordinates of and . These villages are Abdasa, Anjar, Bhachau, Bhuj, Lakhpat, Mandvi, Mundra, Nakhatrana, and Rapar. History History of the Kutch Embroidery is traced to the 16th and 17th centuries when people migrated from the countries such as Afghanistan, Greece, Germany, Iran and Iraq to Gujarat. It is also said that cobblers known as Mochis were trained in this art form by the Muslim sufi saints of Sindh. The art form became a vocation for women of Kutch not only to meet their own clothing requirements but also to make a living, in view of severe dry and very hot conditions of Kutch. It became a generational art with the skills taught from mother to daughter. They embroidered clothes for festive occasions and to decorate deities and to create a source of income. Production procedure An embroidered product Embroidered products are of 16 types known by specific names as: Ahir is type done by peasants of Ahir community with designs of animals and birds done with chain stitch with hooked needles, herringbone stitch and fixed with small mirrors known as 'abhla', practiced by women during the lean season Aari type of embroidery is done by cobblers with intricate chain stitch patterned on designs of the Mughals. Gotauvn or Gotany which includes Chekan, Chopad, Katri and Mukko types, is done by Muslim pastoral people of 11 villages, using several intricate patterns of stitches, expensive silk fabrics, metallic threads and mirrors. Jat-Garasia and Jat- Fakirani are done by the two Jat communities, is a cross stitch product with intensive use of mirrors of small size adopting \\"satin stitch with radiating circles of a couched stitch\\". Kambira and Khudi-Tebha generally adopted in quilts is embroidered by the Harijan people of the Banni grasslands on the border with the Great Rann. Kharek practiced by the Sodha, Rajput and Megwar people is usually in the shape of a set of bars created by adopting \\"black double running stitch and satin stitch\\". Neran meaning \\"eye brows\\" is a unique style which adopts buttonhole stitch in the shape of a curve. Pakko done by the Sodha, Rajput and Megwar people, which is akin to the Ahir style with dominance of geometric designs with an embossed appearance and is embroidered with close knitting with buttonhole stitches. Rabari made by Rabaris of the Giri region, with prominent patterns adopted from mythology are made in several shapes embroidered with \\"square chain interlaced with buttonhole\\" stitches fixed with mirrors, it is unlike another any other embroidery of Kutch. Khadi material in maroon colour is used as the fabric to make door hangings, canopies, wall decorations, etc. It is also said that Rabaris of Kutch reportedly migrated from Sindh in the 14th century and brought their traditional style with them and developed a regional style which was a composite style unlike other types then in vogue in Kutch. The mochi embroidery style with \\"chin stitch and parrot circle\\" patterns influenced their styles. Soof meaning \\"neat and clean\\" is made in geometric designs dominated by a \\"chevron design\\" known as 'leher' or 'waves' which gives the product a unique pattern which is an innovation. A hanging type of embroidery design 6,000 women are engaged in this work. Many societies and some private corporations are involved in their production. The materials used for the embroidery consist of fabrics made of threads of cotton, silk woolen and mashru (an Arabic name). The types of threads used are of floss silk and other varieties. Tracing paper and its associated product are used for drawing the designs. Other essential embroidering tools and material are needle, mirrors, and sequins. Embroidery is done with the fabric fixed on an adjustable embroidery frame to adjust the tension of the cloth or by holding the fabric in hand. The designs created on the cloth to embroider relate to the themes of daily lifestyles, animals and birds (like elephant, camel, parrot, peacock, etc.), flora, religious places such as temples, and figurines of women in dancing postures. The procedure adopted for stitching with needles is by inserting them into the fabric and bringing it up in one motion and then pulling the thread. A thimble is used with the help of the middle finger to speed up the process. Some of the major stitches used are identified by specific names such as \\"Mochi Bharat, Shisha or Abhala mirror work, Heer Bharat, Soof, Kharek and Paako\\". Mirrors or glass pieces in different shapes are stitched to the fabric to make it shine; it is a specialty in the rituals and folklore culture of the pastoral community of Rabaris of Kutch. The best quality embroidery is known as \\"aari\\" which was done earlier for the royal family and well to do families.

Education Ingram grew up in Melbourne, attending De La Salle College in Malvern having been awarded a Victorian Government Junior Scholarship. He won a Senior Government Scholarship to the University of Melbourne from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and political science. He undertook postgraduate studies at the Australian National University in Canberra in international relations. Diplomatic career James Ingram was Executive Director of the World Food Programme, a major operational program of the United Nations system, from 1982‚Äì1992. He held the personal rank of UN Under Secretary General. He is the only Australian to have headed such a UN organisation.See 'James Ingram and the World Food Programme', p. 209, in Chad Mitcham. 2012. 'Australia and development cooperation at the United Nations: Towards Poverty Reduction', in James Cotton and David Lee (Eds.) Australia and the United Nations', Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia Before that appointment, Ingram was the chief executive officer of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB), the second of several names applied over the years to the organisation managing Australia's international development assistance programs. Ingram's career with the Department of External Affairs began in 1946 with his selection as a diplomatic cadet on the basis of competitive public written and oral examinations. He was the youngest appointed under the cadetship scheme. His first diplomatic appointment was to Tel Aviv (1950‚Äì53) following his marriage. Subsequent postings were to Washington DC (1956‚Äì59); Brussels (1959-60), where he was Charge d‚Äôaffaires responsible for opening Australia's Mission to the then European Economic Community and Embassy to Belgium; Jakarta (1962‚Äì64); and the Australian Mission to the United Nations New York (1964‚Äì66). On return to Canberra, Ingram was Assistant Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs responsible for East and South Asia, the Americas, the South Pacific, and Asia and Pacific Council (ASPAC) affairs. Ingram was appointed Ambassador to the Philippines in 1970 and in 1973 Australian High Commissioner in Canada and concurrently non-resident High Commissioner in the newly independent Caribbean nations of Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana and the Bahamas, and Australian representative on the newly established, now defunct, International Bauxite Association. Ingram's service in developing countries and at the United Nations, where he had been the Australian representative on the Executive Boards of UNICEF, UNDP and UNCTAD, had convinced him that Australia's development cooperation program and overseas trade policy were critical components of Australia's foreign policy, which were not always sufficiently recognised as such by responsible ministers and top officials. He was therefore pleased to be appointed in 1975 to the newly created Australian Development Assistance Agency (ADAA) and in 1977 as head of ADAB. In seeking to improve the quality of Australia's bilateral aid and increase its support for selected multilateral aid organisations Ingram worked closely with Sir John Crawford. Their efforts ultimately led, inter alia, to the creation of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), as well as more effective utilisation of the educational and research resources of Australian universities.

United Nations career Ingram served two five year terms as Executive Director, i.e. chief executive, of the UN World Food Programme from 1982‚Äì92.

It was established as a principality dependent on the Principality of Smolensk and was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The capital of the principality was Toropets. In terms of modern administrative division of Russia, the area of the principality is split between Tver (western part), Pskov and Novgorod (southern parts) Oblasts. Toropets was first mentioned in chronicles in 1074, when it belonged to the Principality of Smolensk and was the second important town of the principality. Before 1167, Toropets was given to Mstislav the Brave, and thus the Principality of Toropets was established, which was formally subordinate to the Principality of Smolensk. All the subsequent Princes of Toropets mentioned in sources were descendants of Mstislav. In the end of the 13th century, the principality, though not particularly significant, became a buffer state between the Principality of Smolensk, the Novgorod Republic, and the duchy of Lithuania. In the beginning of the 13th century, Lithuanians repeatedly attempted to annex the principality, and in 1225/26 even Davyd, the prince of Toropets, was killed in battle. It is not exactly known when in the 13th century they finally won, but Toropets mentioned as independent in 1231, and again in 1239, when Alexander Nevsky had his wedding in Toropets, and in 1248. In 1253, Toropets already belonged to the duchy of Lithuania and was used as a base for attacks on adjacent lands. After the 1250s, Toropets was not mentioned in the chronicles, though the geography of Lithuanian attacks shows that in 1285 it still belonged to Lithuania. Chronicles mention that Toropets was finally annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1355, though Valentin Yanin argues it happened in the 1250s. Princes For most of the princes of Toropets, we do not know the extent of their rule; they are typically mentioned in connection to one or several isolated events. For the same reason, we do not know whether the list is complete, and some princes were never mentioned by chronicles. * 1167 Mstislav the Brave * 1208, 1209 Mstislav the Bold * 1211 Vladimir Mstislavich * 1212-1225/6 Davyd Mstislavich, died in a battle with Lithuania References Category:Medieval Russia Category:Former Slavic countries Category:Former principalities Category:Tver Oblast ","title":"Principality of Toropets"},{"id":"49360464","text":"Adava is a small village in Gajapati District, Odisha, India.The total population of the village is 3470 among which the total male population is 1782 and total female population is 1688.

Monferrato, who had been Galeazzo Sforza's tutor, noted in his letter that in addition to singing, Anna could also devise entertainments and was an honourable person.Shepherd, Tim (2015) \\"Noblewomen and Music in Italy, c. 1430‚Äì1520: Looking Past Isabella\\", pp. 31‚Äì32 in Lisa Colton and Catherine Haworth (eds.) Gender, Age and Musical Creativity. Ashgate Publishing. Anna arrived in Milan in the Spring of 1468 with a sizable retinue that also included at least one tenorista (a musician who accompanied the singer on the lute or violin). They remained there for several months and were lodged in the house of Donato Cagnola, one of the permanent singers at Galeazzo Sforza's court. During that time Cagnola wrote a letter to Sforza complaining at having to host Anna's \\"brigade\\" at his own expense. On her departure from Milan, the Duke paid Anna 100 ducats, a large sum at the time, and provided an expensive set of new clothes for her tenorista.Lubkin, Gregory (Summer 2002). \\"Review: Music and Patronage in the Sforza Court, by Paul A. Merkley and Lora L. M. Merkley\\". Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 55, No. 2, pp. 346-353. Retrieved via JSTOR 8 February 2016 . The next existing record of her is in 1471 when she was listed as a singer employed at the court of Ferdinand I of Naples and referred to as \\"Madamma Anna\\". The following year a letter to Galeazzo Sforza from the Milanese ambassador to Naples described Anna dancing with Ferdinand's daughter Leonora in the palace gardens. Anna was mentioned on the payrolls of the Neapolitan court again in 1476, twice more in the 1480s, and finally in 1499 when she was paid 150 ducats for her services. Also listed on the 1499 payroll was a certain \\"Galderi de Madamma Anna\\", whom Allan Atlas speculates was most probably her son. However, Bonnie Blackburn has noted that there are no other surviving records which mention Galderi and he may have simply been Anna's tenorista.Atlas, Allan W. (2008). at the Aragonese Court of Naples, pp. 104‚Äì106. Cambridge University Press. Blackburn and other musicologists have also found possible references to Anna prior to 1468. Blackburn has speculated that she may have been the young English woman who entertained the 11-year-old Galeazzo Sforza in Venice in 1455. A letter by one of Galeazzo's tutors to his father stated that amongst the group of \\"very notable singers\\" at a banquet in the boy's honour was \\"an English damsel who sang so sweetly and suavely that it seemed not a human voice, but divine.\\" Lewis Lockwood notes (as does Blackburn) a payment record at the court of Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara in 1465 for \\"Anna, cantarina Anglica\\" (\\"Anna, English singer\\"). On this basis, James Haar and John N√°das have proposed that Anna Inglese may have been a relative (wife or sister) of another English musician at the Ferrara court, Robertus de Anglia (Robert of England), also known as Roberto Inglese. Robertus was at the Ferrara court from 1454 until 1467 and then went to Bologna as magister cantus at the San Petronio Basilica. He remained in Bologna until 1474 when he apparently returned to England.

He designed at least 50 golf courses and made alterations on over 100 more. Roseman had two starts in golf majors ‚Äì the 1919 and the 1920 PGA Championship. In 1922 he became the first president of the Illinois PGA. Roseman died in 1944 in Glenview, Illinois. Early life Roseman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 15, 1888. He grew up in the East Falls section of the city and began his career in golf as a caddie at the Philadelphia Country Club. He turned pro at the young age of just 15. Golf career One of his first jobs was at The Country Club as an assistant under Jack Hagen and he also worked at a course in Lake Placid, New York. In 1906 he moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he was engaged as the professional and keeper of the greens at the Des Moines Golf and Country Club where he remained until 1916. He was a natural tinkerer and inventor. One of his first innovative ideas was a hitch for horses that allowed them to pull three gang mowers as a unit. His design was patented in the U.S., England, and France. Later he adapted a Ford Model T to serve as a tractor to pull the mowers. =Golf course architecture= He worked at a number of other locations, being engaged in Racine, Wisconsin, where he designed the Racine Country Club course. In 1917 he settled in Glenview, Illinois, near Chicago, where he designed courses and served as the first professional and course superintendent at the Westmoreland Country Club in Wilmette, Illinois. He left Westmoreland in 1928 to handle his golf course design business. In total, he is credited with the design of more than 50 golf courses and made alterations on at least 100 courses. He worked with Jack Burke, Sr. in the design of golf clubs and also collaborated with Burke in the operation of an indoor golf school in Des Moines around 1918. =Mower manufacturing= Roseman was one of the early pioneers in the use of comprehensive underground watering systems for golf courses. He sold this idea and the irrigation pipes along with his tractor mowers. In 1922, Roseman became the first president of the Illinois PGA. In the mid-1920s Roseman curtailed his career as golf professional to concentrate on manufacturing golf course equipment. He opened the Roseman Tractor Mowing Company in Evanston, Illinois, in 1928. Many of Roseman's roller-type mowers are still operational and being used at courses around the country. =1919 PGA Championship= In the 1919 PGA Championship, held from September 16‚Äì20 at the Engineers Country Club in Roslyn Harbor, New York, Roseman qualified in a sectional tournament for the match play portion of the tournament. In a first round match, he lost to James Douglas Edgar by default. In spite of the loss, Roseman still won $50 in prize money. =1920 PGA Championship= In the 1920 PGA Championship, contested from August 17‚Äì21 at the Flossmoor Country Club outside Flossmoor, Illinois, a suburb south of Chicago, Roseman met Louis Tellier in a first round match. He was not playing his best golf and was soundly defeated in the match by the score of 10 and 9. Roseman took home $50 in prize money. Family Roseman and his wife had three sons ‚Äì Joe, Jr., Warren, and Lewis ‚Äì and one daughter, Mrs. James Hoffman. Death and legacy Roseman died on February 29, 1944 at his home in Glenview, Illinois. He is remembered as an inventor of golf course mowing equipment in the early 20th century and as an important golf course architect. He is known as the \\"father of the modern mower\\".

It did not go into production. Design In 1930 the Direction G√©n√©rale Technique issued a programme for an aircraft to operate in the French Colonies. It was to have three Lorraine 9N Algol engines, an all-metal structure and to be capable of reconnaissance, observation, policing and bombing as well as medical evacuations or general transport. The Dewoitine D.430 was one of nine prototypes built for this programme. It was an all-metal aircraft constructed and skinned largely from duralumin. Its five-part high wing was straight-tapered to elliptical tips and had an aspect ratio of over 9, high for the time. It had a single spar at one third chord which tapered uniformly in depth outwards along the span and was reinforced with duralumin trellising. The leading edge formed a subsidiary box spar, and the trailing edge had dural tube ribs and formed a false spar for high-aspect-ratio ailerons, which occupied about half the span. The D.430's outer nine-cylinder Algol radial engines had long-chord NACA cowlings, and were mounted on bearings enclosed in long, streamlined nacelles; these were supported under the wings by four steel struts to the leading edge box spar and to the main spar. The central engine, under a similar cowling, was in the nose of the fuselage. The three-part fuselage was flat-sided and tapered only slightly towards the tail, proving a large interior which could be adapted to a variety of tasks. The pilots sat side by side in an enclosed cockpit ahead of the leading edge, equipped with dual control. Behind, the cabin was long, wide and high. It could accommodate observation, reconnaissance or bombing equipment or hold two wounded on couches or four passengers. At the rear of the cabin there was a position for a dorsal machine gun on a flexible mounting. Access was through a port-side door under the wing; three square windows on each side lit the cabin. The D.430's tail was conventional, with a blunted triangular fin and a deep, round-edged unbalanced rudder. Its tapered tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, braced by two struts on each side to the lower fuselage, and carried narrow, full-span elevators. It had a fixed undercarriage with its main wheels on V-struts hinged from the lower fuselage and on vertical shock absorbing oleo struts to the engine mountings. The wheels were under large fairings; under the tail the D.430 had a long, leaf spring tail-skid. Operational history The D.430 was first flown on 2 October 1932 and by mid-December it was being officially tested at Villacoublay. The Colonial tri-motor contract was awarded to the Bloch MB.120, so no more D.430s were built. The prototype was initially registered as F-AKFN in the F-AK.. section reserved for French military prototypes but in September 1933 it was re-registered onto the commercial list, owned by the state, as F-AMRU. It remained in use for several years; in 1934 it showed the flag in Belgium and took the Minister of Aviation to the French aerobatic contest in Algeria. A change of type to D.432 was recorded when its Algol engines were replaced with Hispano-Suiza 9Ts, (licence-built Clerget 9C diesel radial engines), in 1937. It was destroyed in a non-fatal crash on 2 June 1938 when both the wing engines failed together. Variants ;D.430: As described. One only, F-AKFN then F-AMRU. ;D.432: D.430 F-AMRU re-engined with Hispano-Suiza 9T radials in 1937.

He was Clerk of the Council from 18 October 1838 through to 1840. Parkhurst Prison After his time in South Australia, Hall was governor of Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight. In his time as Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Hall proposed sending boys who were convicted in Britain to colonies as Parkhurst apprentices, whereupon they would receive a pardon on arrival in a colony, but be expected to serve out an apprenticeship before being eligible to return to Britain. This proposal was rejected by the Colony of South Australia, but accepted in Swan River Colony and forced on the Colony of New Zealand. Hall was an early advocate of using juvenile prison to rehabilitate young offenders to society rather than teaching them to be better criminals in their adult life. He sought to teach them a trade or other skills to avoid a life of crime. Personal life Hall married Julia, eldest daughter of Col George Gawler on 21 September 1847 at St. John's, Derby.

Plot This classic adultery story tells of an artist, Prasanta (Barua) presented in the stereotypically romantic image: dedicated to his vocation, paying no heed to his scandalous reputation (he paints nude models) and with a cavalier attitude to his conservative father-in-law's (Choudhury) demands for a good social behaviour. He is married to the rich Chitra (Kanan Devi). The couple are in love but neither partner is prepared to compromise their ideals. The marriage falls apart. Prasanta concedes his wife's demand for a divorce and goes to the jungles of Assam, where for many years his closest associates are a wild elephant and Jharna (Menaka), the wife of an innkeeper named Pahari (P. Mullick). He also makes a sworn enemy of a local trader (Nawab/A. Mullick). Chitra marries the millionaire Bipul (Mukherjee) and they go an elephant hunt. They kill Prasanta's pet elephant. Since Chitra believes Prasanta to be dead he avoids meeting her, but is forced to rescue her from the villainous trader.. Prasanta succeeds but dies at Chitra's feet. The film interprets his death as Chitra's final achievement of the freedom she had craved. Barua contrasts the regressive story presented as static and unresolved, both as narrative and as performance, with a hyperactive environment that overwhelms the trivial nature of the lead couple's desires.

Another decision that became especially controversial was the inclusion of two naturalized South Africans as opening batsmen ‚Äì Michael Lumb and wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter ‚Äì in addition to star batsman Kevin Pietersen, born in South Africa but with an English mother. The team also included Eoin Morgan ‚Äì who, on a previous tour of the West Indies, had been in the Irish team that had upset Pakistan and Bangladesh during the 2007 World Cup and also eventually captained England‚Äôs 2019 World Cup triumph on home soil. Two other Ashes-winning bowlers were also included in fast bowler Stuart Broad and off-spinner Graeme Swann. They began the tournament in disappointing fashion with a defeat to hosts West Indies by 8 wickets on the D/L method. In the next match against Ireland, England batted first and scored 120/8 in their 20 overs. Rain reduced Ireland's innings to 3.3 overs, causing the match to be abandoned. This meant England qualified for the Super 8's with a higher net run rate. In the Super 8s, they found their form and won each of their matches, defeating Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa to top Group E. In the semifinal against Sri Lanka, Pietersen's unbeaten 42 from 26 following a 2‚Äì21 from man of the match Broad helped secure a seven-wicket victory. = Australia = Having reached the semifinals of the first World T20 and won the previous three World Cups, Australia started the tournament as one of the favorites. They fielded a team that included future World Cup- winning captain Michael Clarke as T20 skipper after Test and ODI captain Ricky Ponting had withdrawn from Australia's T20 side, and he was backed up by players who had won Ashes series, World Cups or both, including batsman Michael Hussey (joined by brother David in the team), fast bowler Shaun Tait, all-rounder Shane Watson and Steve Smith, who was still a leg-spinning all- rounder at the time instead of a specialist batsman. Pacer Dirk Nannes was also in the team, having become an Australian citizen after helping his native Netherlands shock England at Lord's during the previous World T20. Stalwart fast bowler Brett Lee had also been named in the squad but was unable to participate. They won Group A after beating both Bangladesh and defending champion Pakistan, and in the Super 8s, they comfortably defeated India, Sri Lanka and the West Indies to progress to the semifinals for a rematch with Pakistan. Pakistan batted first and posted a challenging total of 191. The Australian top order had no mercy for the Pakistani bowlers, but the match looked to be in the defending champions' hands, as Australia was left having to score 18 runs in the final over against touted off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, a member of Pakistan's 2009 World T20 champions. Mike Hussey rose to the occasion, however, hitting three sixes and a four to get Australia to the target for a three-wicket victory with a ball to spare. Man of the match Hussey finished on 60 not out from 24 balls, having hit the most final over runs to complete a T20 international chase (his 22 was not surpassed until the West Indies' Carlos Brathwaite scored 24 off four consecutive sixes with 19 required against England's Ben Stokes to win the 2016 final.)  Team Composition  Both teams were unchanged from their semi-final winning squads. Match details =Match officials= The on-field umpires were Aleem Dar of Pakistan and Billy Doctrove of West Indies, with New Zealand Billy Bowden being the third (TV) umpire. Rudi Koertzen of South Africa was the fourth umpire. Ranjan Madugalle of Sri Lanka was the match referee. = Toss = England captain Collingwood won the toss and chose to field first. = Match Summary = Australia started the match rather surprisingly. Both openers went for just 2 apiece, as Watson was caught by Swann when Kieswetter parried a chance off Sidebottom's pace bowling followed by a Lumb run-out of fellow opener David Warner. Sidebottom then had Aussie wicketkeeper Brad Haddin caught by Collingwood for Australia's third wicket down for just 8 runs. Captain Clarke paced the innings with David Hussey until Collingwood robbed his opposite number of his wicket with a diving catch off Swann's off-spin to leave Australia at 45/4. However, David Hussey continued his form with middle order batsmen (including Michael Hussey), scoring 59 off 54 as Australia posted 147 for 6 in their 20 overs. England's first wicket fell for just seven runs as Lumb was caught by David Hussey trying to drive Tait past mid-on. However, England then took control as Kieswetter and all-time run scorer Pietersen (47 off 31) took the game away from Australia with a 111-run partnership for the second wicket, allowing Morgan and Collingwood to complete the chase with three overs to spare. With his 63 off 49 for his maiden international T20 half century, Kieswetter was adjudged man of the match, while Pietersen was the player of the tournament. The win marked England's first ever ICC world championship after losses in the finals of the 1979 World Cup against the West Indies at Lord's, the 1987 World Cup against Australia in Kolkata and the 1992 World Cup against Pakistan in Melbourne, as well as a loss in the 2004 Champions Trophy final against the West Indies at the Oval. It also marked England's third world championship in one of their major sports after the 1966 FIFA (Football) World Cup, which England won as hosts, and the 2003 IRB Rugby World Cup, which England had also won against Australia in Sydney. Both England and Australia also named a number of their T20 players who contested the final in their Test squads for the Ashes, which England won 3‚Äì1 to not only retain the Ashes but also record its first Ashes series win in Australia for 24 years.

Zotti built up a fully-fledged bank at a renowned New York address, the Amerikansko-Hrvatska ≈†tedionica (American-Croat Savings Bank). He published the widely read Narodni list (USA) (National paper), a weekly newspaper, and he even managed to become president of the Hrvatska zajednica (Croat Union), which later transformed into the Croatian Fraternal Union (CFU). Zotti's activities reached across the Atlantic, and he was perhaps the most illustrious example of South Slav migrant elites. His success ended in 1908 when he was charged with larceny and went bankrupt.

It is located 15 km from Hosur on Rayakotta Road and 65 km from Bangalore. Hosur is a rapidly growing industrial hub as well as a famous pilgrimage centre, and is also known as Dakshina Kashi (\\"Southern Kashi\\"), since the town is surrounded by the three hills of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, which are not seen anywhere else in India.  Legend  Narasimha slaying Hiranyakasipu As per Hindu legend, a demon king named Hiranyakasipu was troubling the Devas (celestial deities). He obtained limitless powers from Brahma, that no human could kill him, nor could he be killed in morning, noon or night, nor in air, water or ground. Contrastingly, his son Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu, whom his father hated. Hiranyakasipu tried to kill Prahalada numerous times, just for him to be saved by the divine grace of Vishnu. During the last heated argument between the father and the son, Hiranyakasipu asked if Vishnu was present everywhere and went on to break a pillar with his weapon seeking to see Vishnu in it. Vishnu, pleased by the devotion of Prahalada, took the avatar of Narasimha and came out of the opening in the pillar. Narasimha's avatar was a lion-faced human and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. Ages passed by, when the sages were praying Narasimha to seek his blessings. They were guided by the pretext of Vishwamitra gaining the Rajarishi title with his prayers to Narasimha.  History  Swayambu of Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy During 1998, Mr. Rama Krishna, a small shop owner from Bangalore and his friends who were developing a 2.75 acres residential layout near Agaram village, faced obstacles in selling a part of land. During the construction of the compound, a worker experienced feelings believed to be spiritually caused. They approached many astrologers and pandits to determine the cause, and were told that they were answers from Lord Lakshmi Narasimha. Swayambu of Sri Hanuman Since Mr. Rama Krishna Guptha was in his business and unaware of Poojas to be performed, he decided to perform Poojas or donate the land to someone who can perform them. While their group of friends were trying to move a heavy spiritual object, the chains and belt fell apart and stood exactly at 90 degree angles facing the center of the property. Again, the pandits told that the event was caused by Lord Narasimha Swamy's presence. As construction continued, a severe water drought occurred, and no water trucks were able to deliver any supplies. So they decided to put a borewell where it went till 850 feet and no water was found and was a subsequent failure. Then they prayed Lord Narasimha Swamy as per advice of their Guru ji Shri Kodandarama Swamy and decided to build a small water sump on the deva moola of the temple premises, but for surprise they found water gushing at 7 feet level and till today the water has been utilized by the entire villagers as there was no water there. Swayambu of Sudarshana Chakra There were many instances of miracles happening including a big serpent guarding the temple premises every day where it will not allow any ladies entering the temple during their mensuration periods . Also, 32 elephants came to the temple and destroyed an illegal compound of the neighbor who produced disturbances to the temple trustees where you can see the compound wall now is also a miracle as they have never seen elephants in that area. Currently a portion of the land where swamy is situated has been donated to Ahobila Mutt and still it is under the control of the mutt where they decided to build the temple shortly .  Important events  His Highness 46th Jeeyar Sri Satakopa Sri Ranganatha Yateendra Mahadesikanu of Ahobila Mutt During 2013, his highness, 46th Jeeyar Sri Satakopa Sri Ranganatha Yateendra Mahadesikan of Ahobila Mutt visited Hosur Town. During that time his highness was looking for a piece of land in Hosur for temple construction. Mr. Rama Moorthy and his wife took his blessings and thought of donating the piece of land to Ahobila Mutt where they can see the Nitya Poojas and Yagnas for generations in the future. As per their request, his highness visited the temple. There was a rock which was supporting Swayambu Narasimha Swamy on the back side and is rare to find elsewhere, which was confirmed by his highness. He also wrote about this Hindu temple miracles as which was published in 2013 at Lakshmi Priya monthly magazine belonging to Ahobila Temple which was widely circulated all over the world. They donated a piece of land to Ahobila Mutt where swamy is situated and the Ahobila Mutt decided to build the temple in that place.  Festival and religious practices  The major festival of the temple is the fifteen-day Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March ‚Äì April) when the image of presiding deities are taken around the streets of the temple in a temple chariot. Other festivals of the temple include Chittirai Tamil New year, Vaigasi Visagam, Telugu New Year, Avani Pavitrotsavam, Narasimhar Jayanthi, Vaikunta Ekadasi and Thai Pongal during various months of the year.

The underground workings consisted of narrow, 1.5m-wide slopes above a northwest-southeast-trending level. It was the subject of further exploration during the mid-1950s when the original shaft was reopened to a depth of 21 meters. History Initially Lisdrumgormley Mine was part of the North Eastern Mining Company of Ireland. It was formed on Monday 6 April 1846 at The Angel Hotel in Liverpool, with Capt James Skimming (Annaglogh) as its Agent. The North Eastern Mining Company also encompassed nearby Annaglogh Mine, Coolartragh (Bond Mine) Lemgare Mines and Hope Mines near Castleblayney. Lisdrumgormley was recorded in 1922 as being under development by The Farney Development Company. Assays of over 22% Pb were recorded at the location by the Mining Corporation of Ireland in 1956. The access to the underground mine was by way of a shaft apparently almost 50m deep.  Condition and shaft collapse  The plug of this shaft collapsed in 2012 revealing a cylindrical shaft, collared in stone, dipping steeply east. The shaft was subsequently back-filled and fenced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) in 2012 at the landowner's request. Unfortunately, a horse from a neighbouring farm which had wandered into the property fell into the collapsed shaft and was lost. Remains A largely overgrown waste dump and a disused outbuilding are the most obvious traces of mining on the site. A depression approximately 20 x 10 m in size adjacent to the waste heap may be a consequence of further subsidence above the underground workings. Mineralised material in the waste dumps consists of greywacke sandstone cut by thin dolomite veins containing galena as well as sandstone with quartz and carbonate, with or without galena or barite. The only tangible mine feature that remains on the site is the waste dump. Boulders within this dump do provide evidence for the mineralisation but it was found that they were not particularly impressive examples and were insufficient to warrant County Geological Site (CGS) status for the site at that time.

Flowtite Manufacturing Process  Flowtite pipes can only be produced with a custom-designed production equipment, which has a basic filament winding machine as a basis. It consists of a continuous steel band mandrel, supported by beams installed circumferentially to form a cylindrical shape. The mandrel moves continuously in a spiral path towards the exit assembly. As the mandrel rotates, all composite materials are metered onto it in precise amounts, forming one layer after another. As a pipe is being formed on the mandrel, it moves forward to the curing and cutting areas and the finished product comes out at the end of one continuous production process.Flowtite Pipe Systems.

Life Bawa's recommendation for Emirship was announced soon after the death of his father in November 1919, he was formally installed by Hugh Clifford in February 1920. His reign started during the period of Indirect rule and as such he was head of Ilorin Native Authority. His reign coincided with the construction of motorable roads in Ilorin township, including roads connecting Ilorin emirate to Lafiaji, Jebba and River Niger.Jimoh, L. A. K. (1994). Ilorin: The journey so far. Ilorin, Nigeria: L.A.K. Jimoh. P. 245- 247 In 1935, the Ilorin traditional council had a crisis initiated by the protest of Mogaji Aare, the Baloguns and the Baba Isale, who were all reputable chiefs in the town. The traditional council members were protesting the usurpation of their jurisdiction by some palace officials and Native Administration staff. The chiefs boycotted the palace for a few months until the conflict was settled by the colonial resident. In 1956, another group under the name Ilorin Talaka Parapo became prominent in the Native Authority administration. Originally a formally apolitical and trade oriented organization led by some traders such as Sule Maito, a cattle dealer, and Busari Isale Oja, a merchant. The group became agitated due to perceived excess of the Native Authority, such as the imposition of a water rate in Ilorin township. After being rebuffed by the national leadership of the Northern region dominated NPC, the organization teamed up with the Western region based Action Group and later won key elections to the Native Authority government in 1956. The group went on to effect some changes in the structure of the authority, dismissing loyalists of the traditional emirate council. However, a decision to contemplate merger with the Western region led an exodus of the non-Yoruba members within the group and the group's power declined.

Responsibility was claimed by the Taliban. Background Sixty to seventy guests were believed to be staying at the hotel at the time of the attacks. Thirty provincial government officials were staying at the hotel to attend a briefing about the transition of security responsibilities from the U.S. Military to the Afghan security forces. Most of the hotel's guests were in the hotel's dining hall at the time of the attack. Initial reports suggested that a wedding party may also have been hosted in one of the dance halls. The attack The attackers passed three security checkpoints and made their way to the rear of the hotel under concealment of thick vegetation. The assault on the hotel began at 10:00 p.m. local time armed with assault rifles, hand grenades, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, machine guns, and anti-aircraft weapons. Armed Afghan law enforcement personnel fled the area and failed to engage the attackers. Nine attackers were captured on surveillance camera entering through the rear hotel garden where only two guards were stationed during a dinner for hotel guests. Suicide vests were detonated at the entrance to the hotel and on the second floor. Two dance halls were destroyed in the initial attack. The attackers then ascended to the fifth floor. Exchanges of weapon fire between law enforcement occurred until the early morning hours. Hotel guests were told to barricade themselves in their rooms, while others escaped by jumping from the hotel's windows. Termination of the attack Entry forces ascended the first two floors killing a militant in the process. The security forces attempted to disarm the explosive vest the attacker was wearing. The attackers took up firing positions on the hotel roof when the fight entered its climactic end. Three combatants on the hotel roof were attacked by two of three circling NATO helicopters. The militants may have been killed in the strike or may have detonated their vests. One U.S. Blackhawk helicopter carried International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) snipers while an MC-12W Liberty and an MQ-1 Predator remotely piloted aircraft provided critical aerial surveillance. Afghan policemen could not be coaxed by police chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi to enter the building after the attackers were killed. At one point, an Afghan intelligence official informed the press that it believed it had eliminated all but one militant. One injured suicide bomber hid in a hotel room and ambushed and killed a Spanish pilot after the declared conclusion of operations. Electricity to the hotel was restored after the end of military operations, and a scheduled briefing on the transition of security responsibilities from the U.S. Military to the Afghan security forces proceeded the next day. Victims Among the wounded were five Afghan policemen and thirteen civilians. Five hotel staff including one hotel security guard and a hotel chef, and three policemen were killed. Perpetrators Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid claimed Taliban responsibility for the attack and lauded the militants that killed \\"dozens of the foreign and local top-level officials\\". The Long War Journal reported that the attack was carried out by the \\"Kabul Attack Network\\". According to the Journal, the network was an ad hoc organization with insurgents and operatives from Afghan and Pakistani Taliban groups, the Haqqani network, Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, and with support from Lashkar-e-Taiba and al Qaeda. The network is led by Dawood (also spelled Daud), the Taliban's shadow governor for Kabul, and Taj Mir Jawad, a leader in the Haqqani network. The Journal also stated that the organization is sometimes assisted by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.Roggio, Bill, \\"ISAF airstrike kills senior Haqqani Network commander involved in Kabul hotel attack\\", Long War Journal, 30 June 2011. The ISAF believes that the operation was supplied by the Haqqani network. Ismail Jan, Deputy to the senior Haqqani commander, was killed in an airstrike in Paktia province which borders Pakistan's FATA a day after the attack.

Built in 1822 for a local businessman, it is a regionally rare example of Federal period double house, and one of the only ones known in the state that is built of wood. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Daniel Young House is located in Lubec's main village, on the south side of Main Street just east of the Congregational Church. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. Its street-facing front facade is six bays wide, arranged symmetrically with a pair of doorways flanked by sash windows. The doorways are set under a shared cornice, with pilasters at the outside and between them, and each topped by a half-round transom. The panel doors, with windows in the upper half, are a c. 1900 alteration, as are the corbelled brick chimneys and the two-over-one sash windows. A single-story ell extends to the rear. The house was built in 1822 for Daniel Young, a local businessman who occupied the right unit. The house has been a two-family for most of its history, although it spent some time in the 20th century divided into four units. It is the only known example of this form in eastern Maine, and is comparable in the state with brick examples in Portland.

The insurgents and at least seven others were killed and 15 were wounded. It was the first incident in the capital in which widely separated targets came under simultaneous attack. Elements within the Afghan and Pakistan governments were suspected of complicity in the attacks. The attacks On 13 September 2011, just after noon, four to six insurgents left a car at a checkpoint at Abdul Haq square and entered a nine- floor partly constructed building near Kabul's diplomatic district. They were armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers, AK-47s and suicide vests. They fired rockets at the U.S. Embassy and NATO headquarters. Three other insurgents died when they attempted to carry out suicide attacks on Afghan police buildings in another part of the city. A gun battle around Abdul Haq Square continued into the early evening. Afghan security forces regained control of the nine-story building, with assistance from helicopters of the Afghan and US armies. All the militants were killed by the next day. Three police officers, four civilians and up to six insurgents were killed and 15 people wounded in the four attacks. It was stated to be the first incident in the capital in which widely separated targets came under simultaneous attack. No US embassy personnel were hurt in the incident,thanks to the heroic efforts of the RSO's and the Delta shift embassy security forces, although four Afghan visa applicants who were waiting at the embassy were wounded. Another deadly attack occurred later the same month.NYT: September 26, 2011, attack Responsibility for the attacks The attacks were seen as a move by the Taliban to strengthen their negotiating position in expected talks with US representatives. Suspicions were voiced that the attackers must have received assistance from within the Afghan security structure, pointing out that they had evaded multiple checkpoints. The United States blamed Pakistan's government, mainly Pakistani Army and its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network as the masterminds behind the attack. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, told Radio Pakistan that \\"The attack that took place in Kabul a few days ago, that was the work of the Haqqani network.

Design & development In 1930 the Direction G√©n√©rale Technique issued a programme for an aircraft to operate in the French Colonies. It was to have three Lorraine 9N Algol engines, an all- metal structure and to be capable of reconnaissance, observation, policing and bombing as well as medical evacuations or general transport. The Nieuport- Delage NiD 590 was one of nine prototypes built for this programme. =Description= The NiD 590 was an entirely metal aircraft, with light alloy used for most of its structure and skin. The wing was in three parts, with a rectangular centre section and trapezoidal, cantilevered outer panels. It had a two spar structure, with ribs joining the two into a box to which the separate leading edge was bolted and the trailing edge hinged. High aspect ratio ailerons filled about 75% of the trailing edges. The NiD 590's two pilots sat side by side at the front of the cabin. Their cockpit was semi- enclosed with glazing ahead and above but with open sides fitted with wind deflectors. They had dual controls and seat-type parachutes. This part of the cabin, under the wing, was conventional, with box-frame sides and bulkheads; just behind the seats there was an access passage with a side door from which both the controls and the rear cabin could be reached. Aft of this the final conventional bulkhead leaned backwards towards the tail, forming the start of the NiD 590's most unusual feature: the rest of the cabin was under an arched roof, extending from the forward cabin structure but the sides were only about high, with no glazing. Careful fuselage design deflected the slipstream beyond the rear of the cabin and provided its various occupants with a calm working environment and an excellent all-round and downwards view of the French colonies below. Their rear view was greatly enhanced by the very unusual rear fuselage: beyond the trailing edge the aft end of the cabin tapered rapidly in plan onto the vertical part of a T-shaped bulkhead supporting the arched upper structure. Behind it, the fuselage maintained this upper structure on two longerons, with very narrow, concave sides down to a third, lower, longeron. This narrow rear fuselage provided a wide rearward and downward view even from the back of the cabin where the rear gunner sat with a twin Lewis gun on a flexible mount. The tail was conventional, with a near triangular fin and straight-edged rudder. The NiD 590's tailplane was straight tapered and mounted on top of the fuselage. Its undercarriage was fixed, its mainwheels on bent axles with streamlined drag struts and short, vertical oleo struts to the forward engine mounting frame. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, and there was a castering tail wheel. Steering on the ground was controlled through hand-operated differential brakes. =Powerplant= Two of the three nine- cylinder radial Lorraine 9Na Algol engines were mounted under the wings at the inner-outer panel junctions, enclosed in narrow-chord cowlings on frames inside streamlined nacelles. These were suspended on a group of three short struts from the forward wing spar, two attached to a ring at the middle of the nacelle and a third to its rear. Another strut joined the nacelle rear to the rear spar. The third engine was in the nose of the fuselage. =Crew and mission equipment= The NiD 590 was described as a two-place aircraft but its military \\"Col 3\\" designation suggests it usually had a crew of three. Since it was intended to cover a range of tasks, crew numbers were likely to vary and there was provision for three parachutes in the cabin behind the pilots. As well as the rear gunner's position, the open part of the cabin had positions for navigation, ground photography, radio operation, visual observation and bomb-aiming. The NiD 590 carried grenades, which were delivered down a chute and twenty-four bombs distributed from two racks. Operational history The NiD 590 flew for the first time during the week 27 June - 3 July 1932. By the start of November it had undergone very successful trials at V√©lizy ‚Äì Villacoublay Air Base. It appeared on display at the November 1932 Paris A√©ro Show. A second example was flown but the Colonial tri-motor contract was awarded to the Bloch MB.120, so no more NiD 590s were built.

It is native to Western Australia and the Northern Territory.  Description  Ficus coronulata is a tree growing up to tall. It is dioecious. Its twigs hang down, are from in diameter, and have glassy hairs lying close to the twig (appressed), with the twigs becoming smooth with age. The leaf stem is long and in diameter, and is rough to the touch (or with scattered ascending glassy hairs), and deeply channelled on the upper surface. The leaves are alternate but occasionally opposite. They are narrowly elliptic or lanceolate in shape, and have a recurved entire margin. The leaf tip gradually tapers to a point apex acuminate, and the base of the leaf is wedge- shaped. The leaf dimensions are 50‚Äì333 mm long and 12‚Äì105 mm wide. The leaf surfaces is lightly rough to the touch (scabrid), occasionally with scattered appressed glassy hairs on the lower surface. The leaves also have cystoliths (hard stony structures) which are visible as raised opaque dots on upper surface. The lateral veins occur in 20‚Äì46 pairs. Stipules are lateral (occasionally interpetiolar) and are up to 21 mm long, with scattered appressed glassy hairs, and have ciliolate margins which lose their hairs. The fruit (syconia occur in the leaf axils, are globular, and up to 21 mm long and 21 mm in diameter, and they too are lightly rough to the touch. The ostiole protrudes into a crown with numerous ciliolate bracts (bracts with \\"eyelashes\\"), and is green to yellowish green at maturity. The peduncle is 21 mm long, 0.6-1.0 mm in diameter. There are three bracts at the base of up to 4 mm in length, with appressed glassy hairs, and the margins have minute hairs (cilia) which persist. Male florets are ostiolar in up to 4 rows, on stems with 4 or 5 tepals with cilia (\\"eyelashes\\") and each with one or two stamens. The female and gall florets are generally without stems (sessile), with 5 ciliolate (with \\"eyelashes\\") tepals. Interfloral bracts are absent. In the Northern Territory it has been found flowering in January, March, May, June, July, September, October and November, and it fruits all year round. It is not usually confused with other fig species, being distinctive by the green (or yellowish-green) of its mature syconia, and by its narrowly elliptic or lanceolate leaves. It is not a strangling fig.  Taxonomy  It was first described in 1862, by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel from a specimen found in 1855 in Arnhemsland (Arnhem Land) by Ferdinand von Mueller.  Distribution and habitat  In the Northern Territory it is found in the bioregions: Arnhem Coast, Arnhem Plateau, Central Arnhem, Central Kimberley, Daly Basin, Darwin Coastal, Gulf Coastal, Gulf Fall and Uplands, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Pine Creek, Sturt Plateau, and Victoria Bonaparte. In Western Australia it is found in the bioregions: Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, and Victoria Bonaparte. It is found along rivers and creeks. It has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii.  Aboriginal names  For the aboriginal language group, Jaminjung, it is Ngaliwurru and Nungali; for the Garnimbi it is Jabawi; for the Mangarrayi and Yangman it is Garranba; for the Ngarinyman it is Jabawi; and for the Wagiman it is mardengdeng and dengdengin.  Uses  Ficus coronulata is used both as medicine and as food by many indigenous groups across the Northern Territory, and the Jawoyn also use it for making fire- sticks. Indigenous people could feed themselves and toss fruit in the river to attract turtles, which they would then catch. Rarely cultivated, Ficus coronulata has potential as a specimen tree in parks and gardens. It is also used as an herbicide. It is known for its debilitating effects on humans if accidentally ingested.

In 1962, Wilson founded the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds, a performance company which collaborated on all of his early works, including Deafman Glance, The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud, The King of Spain, The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin, and KA MOUNTAIN and GUARDenia Terrace. Notable collaborators of the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds included Gordon Matta Clark, Jack Smith, Sheryl Sutton, and Jerome Robbins. During this period, Robbins was creating Watermill, a ballet with music by Teiji Ito, with early rehearsals and workshops taking place outdoors in Water Mill, New York. Wilson was Robbins's assistant at the time. Previously, Wilson had apprenticed under architect Paolo Soleri at the experimental community of Arcosanti in Arizona. In 1992, Wilson acquired The Watermill Center's current facilities, which had previously housed a telecommunications laboratory for Western Union, and began to stage experimental performances on site. Early collaborators in these works included Trisha Brown and Susan Sontag, and Philip Glass and Lucinda Childs, who had previously collaborated with Wilson on Einstein on the Beach, and others. Author Brad Gooch worked at Watermill on a production of Persephone, staged by Wilson in 1995, and Isabelle Huppert rehearsed her role in Virginia Woolf's Orlando in 1993, returning in 2006 to act in Heiner M√ºller's Quartet. In 2000 Watermill was the origin point for a production of Lady from the Sea and in 2003-04, Wilson's epic theater work I La Galigo with a cast of 53 Indonesian actors was developed there. Other notable productions initiated by Wilson with students at The Watermill Center include Time Rocker with music by Lou Reed, Jean Genet's Les Negres, Eugene Ionesco's Rhinoceros, Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata, Claudio Monteverdi's The Coronation of Poppea, HAMLET: a monlogue, Lady from the Sea, and Adam's Passion, with music by Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt.Le Watermill Center de Robert Wilson - Op√©ra national de Paris  Design  The Watermill Center at sundownWhen Wilson acquired The Watermill Center facilities in 1992, he began a total renovation of the original structure of the Western Union laboratory on which it was founded. The Watermill Center has received numerous accolades and recognitions for its designed minimalism and theatricality. Following certain precepts of Bauhaus design (Wilson was a student of Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, architectural scholar and spouse to Bauhaus artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy), Watermill's design influences also include the traditional architecture of Indonesia, as well as certain structural ideas Wilson incorporates in his theater productions. The Watermill Center is situated on a 10-acre campus consisting of gardens, natural environments, and permanent installations of wooden sculptures and megalithic stones from Indonesia.  Programs  ;Artist Residency Program The Watermill Center hosts over 200 artists every year as part of its interdisciplinary Artist in Residence program. Combining international outreach with support for local practitioners, previous residencies have featured artists from the Shinnecock Indian Nation, British sound artist Oliver Beerhttp://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2015/08/26/watermill-center- names-5-new-artists-in-residence/ , artist Geoffrey Farmer (Canadian Pavilion commission for the 2017 Venice Biennale), American author Ishmael Reed and German artist Jorinde Voigt.

Park & Peter Simonson (Eds.), International Histories of Communication Study, New York: Routledge Siepmann was instrumental in drafting the FCC document \\"Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees\\", which became known as the \\"Blue Book\\" for its distinctive colour. Though he was an academic, Siepmann remained an advocate for the democratic potentials of radio and television and was \\"overtly political and engaged with media policy interventions\\" during his career. His advocacy was met with a \\"storm of protest in the [broadcast] industry\\" and he was frequently red-baited for his views. Biography =Early life= Siepmann was born in 1899 in Bristol, England and served in the first World War. After the war he began working for the BBC where he advocated and developed educational programming. In 1937, after twelve years at the BBC, where he had \\"fallen foul of power struggles in the upper echelons of BBC management\\", Siepmann left for the United States. As part of a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study educational broadcasting in the United States, Siepmann \\"visited key educational broadcast stations across the country\\". Subsequently, he was offered a job at Harvard University where he worked until 1942, at which point he left to join the US Office for War Information. = Work at the FCC = In 1946, FCC commissioner Clifford Durr employed Siepmann to draft a report on broadcasters' public service responsibilities and performance. This document, \\"Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees\\", relied on data collected by Dallas Smythe, and later became known as the \\"Blue Book\\". The book was highly critical of US broadcasters and ignited a storm of controversy. While broadcasters were vehemently opposed to the book's findings, The New York Times stated that it was required reading for all interested in the future development of one of the country's major media for mass communications\\". Most controversial was the book's advocation that FCC mandates would require that \\"broadcasters devote a certain amount of time to local, non-profit, and experimental programming while also cutting down on 'excessive advertising'\\". = Academic career = In 1946, Siepmann began working at NYU as Chair of the Department of Communications in Education and as Director of NYU's film library. Siepmann remained at NYU until 1968, at which point he became a professor emeritus. He then went to Sarah Lawrence College, where he continued to teach until 1972. Even after leaving the classroom, Siepmann continued to host students at his farm in Vermont, and was well-regarded by his pupils. = Academic Scholarship = Siepmann generated a large amount of writing during his career, both in scholarly and popular venues. His writing \\"typically focused on broadcast media's normative role in a democratic society, with a recurring focus of the degradations of excessive advertising and commercialism\\". Siepmann wrote six books, and in addition to the Blue Book is best known for Radio's Second Chance (1946), The Radio Listener's Bill of Rights: Democracy, Radio and You (1948), and Radio, Television and Society (1950). In Radio's Second Chance, he made the case that opportunities which were lost with AM radio could be reclaimed with the new FM technology. In The Radio Listener's Bill of Rights, Siepmann contributed to the media reform movement and \\"described three major impediments to actualizing the democratic prospects of radio: public ignorance, indifference, and inertia\\". Radio, Television, and Society was the most academic of Siepmann's major works and \\"focused on questions about the theories, laws, policies, and practices underlying freedom of speech, and its relationship to broadcasting\\". In addition to books, Siepmann published considerable work in various academic journals including Studies in Philosophy and Social Science, Public Opinion Quarterly, and the Yale Law Journal. =Marriage and children= Siepmann was married to Charlotte ‚ÄúDolly‚Äù Tyler in 1942 with whom he had two daughters and a son.

J.\\" Reddy (6 August 1945 - 31 March 2019) was an American artist, poet, activist, and musician.  Early life  Artist T. J. Reddy works on a mural in Charlotte, N.C. Reddy was born in Savannah, Georgia. During his childhood, black children were barred from public libraries, so, his school principal turned her house in to a library which he visited often as a passionate reader. His family moved to New York City when he was 14. He moved to Charlotte, N.C. in 1964 to study at Johnson C. Smith University and then transferred to University of North Carolina Charlotte where he helped to found the Black Student Union and the African and Afro-American Studies Department. During the 1960s he was active in Civil Rights activities, protesting the Vietnam War and opposing intensive military draft activities in the black community. Reddy repeatedly visited military recruiting centers, wearing different disguises each time, and handed out antiwar flyers. Reddy received his B.A. in History from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 1974 and a Master's degree in Education from the same university three years later. In the late 1980s, he studied painting in the Master's of Fine Arts program at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina.  Career  During the time Reddy was actively engaged in the Civil Rights Movement, he and two other African-American activists, James Grant and Charles Parker, visited the Lazy B horse stables. The three had been turned away from the stables because of the color of their skin. One year later, the trio were charged by the federal government in connection with a fire which killed fourteen horses. During the 1972 trial, they were labeled as political terrorists and became known as the Charlotte Three. Reddy was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 1974, the two key witnesses \\"revealed that the federal government had paid them $4,000 each as a \\"relocation fee\\" following their testimony against the accused.\\" A series of appeals, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, were denied. In 1979, North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt commuted the sentences and Reddy was paroled. New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote that it was \\"one more of those vengeful miscarriages of justice by which comfortable society attempted to label urban unrest, racial disorders ‚Ä¶ and anti-war activity as the work of agitators and terrorists.\\" A collection of correspondence, legal documents and other material about this period of Reddy's life are archived in The J. Murrey Atkins Library Special Collections at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. While a student the University of North Carolina Charlotte, Reddy was a poetry consultant and associate editor of arts magazine Three. In 1969, he won the LeGette Blythe Creative Writing Award. Among the publications in which his poetry appears are the Red Clay Reader (1969), Southern Poetry Review (1970), A Galaxy of Black Writing (1971), Hyperion Journal (1975), Miscellany (1974). His poetry has been collected in two books: Less Than a Score, But a Point (Random House‚Äôs Vintage Books, 1974) and Poems in One Part Harmony (Carolina Wren, 1980). Reddy often reads the poetry of Beat poet Bob Kaufman, his favorite poet. Reddy has been inspired by French artist Marc Chagall, who is also a painter and poet. Reddy's artwork as a Social Realist painter that reflect the traditions of the Harlem Renaissance are held in permanent collections at the Tweed Museum of Art in Duluth, Minnesota and University of North Carolina Charlotte's Murrey Atkins Library. \\"Reddy's mixed media paintings largely use acrylics and he has added natural materials, such as paper, sand, wood, fabric and clay. He is also known for his murals and public art projects. \\"His work is inspired by travels throughout the Caribbean and seacoast islands of the southern United States, and by the migrations of people of African and Caribbean descent to the Americas,\\" according to the University of North Carolina Charlotte Africana Studies Department where Reddy was a visiting artist in 2008-2009. \\"His paintings are richly textured two-dimensional narratives with a spiritual and universal quality that expresses a profound appreciation for culture, which he defines as shared human values.\\" His work was on display in a 2013 exhibit on the Civil Rights Movement at the Levine Museum of the New South in Charlotte, N.C. A solo exhibition of his work was held in 2014 at the St. Helena (SC). York W. Bailey Museum at Penn Center. Reddy's murals continue to adorn walls in around Charlotte, his longtime home. He was commissioned to paint \\"Remembrances of Charlotte's Second Ward: Brooklyn and Blue Heaven\\" at the Charlotte Convention Center. In fact, the convention center was built in what had been a tradition African-American neighborhood. Reddy's mural depicts the values and lives of the African Americans who once lived at that very site. Reddy's work includes many series, reflecting his activism and attunement to deep historical, cultural trends. His \\"Psychological Castration Series,\\" 15 paintings produced in the early 2000s were a reaction to the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments conducted between 1932 and 1972 in Alabama. Under the pretext of free health care by the U.S. Public Health Services, syphilis in African-American men was untreated to study the course of the disease. Another series, reflects the male archetypes explored by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung: the King, the Lover, the Warrior and the Magician. Among the instruments that Reddy plays in performances is the kalimba, an ancient African instrument, that the artist has said directs him on an subconscious level. At performance in Charlotte, NC, in April 2017, Reddy explained the connectivity of his art, poetry and music. \\"When you look at my paintings, I want you to sense the music, the lyrics in it.\\" During the summer of 2017, the Projective Eye Gallery at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte presented a retrospective of Reddy‚Äôs life of creativity titled \\"Everything is Everything.\\" \\"The exhibition includes imagery from many different bodies of work ‚Äì King Warrior Magician Lover, Blues Men and Women, Scenes for the Teacher, Family Portraits, Havoc in Haiti, Savanah Scenes, poetry books, and papers ‚Äì all made during a courageous life triumphant in its affirmations.\\" \\"There are four magic ingredients in every TJ Reddy painting: color, symbolism, narrative, and transformation. His work is often categorized as a kind of social realism; a better description may be a social surrealist, with a propensity towards nature and narrative.\\" Five decades into his creative endeavors, Reddy is still producing new works. \\"There are more works in progress ‚Äì subjects of domestic violence and abuse, jazz, and sculpture,\\" he said. \\"Where I go from here is not a foregone conclusion. It is all, from beginning to end, still and yet a vision within the scope of the all, the concept of everything is everything, uniquely and irrevocably intertwined and combined into creative resolve and life sustenance.\\"  Accomplishments  * From 1967 to 1969: Resident Manager & Project Director, Charlotte Urban Ministry‚Äôs Tenth Street Community Youth Center * From 1969 to 1972: Writer for the Charlotte Observer. * From 1978 to 1979: North Carolina Arts Coalition * 1979: Afro-American Cultural Center in Charlotte * From 1980-1981: Free Lance Artists * From 1982: Owner Operator of the Ready Art Shoppe  Publications  Reddy's poetry is included in several publications: * The Red Clay Reader (1969) * Southern Poetry Review (1970) * A Galaxy of Black Writing (1971) * The Hyperion Journal (1975) * Miscellany (1974) * Eleven Charlotte Poets (1971).

Based on the trio of Tom Robinson, Hereward Kaye and Raphael \\"Ray\\" Doyle, they recorded one self-titled album on the Konk record label, produced by Ray Davies of the Kinks. History The band came together in London in 1973, although the three original members had known each other for several years, first meeting in Kaye's home town of Middlesbrough. They all sang, played guitar, and wrote songs. When living in London, they began performing together in a folk rock style as \\"Hereward & Friends\\" at clubs including Bunjies, and were mentored by Alexis Korner. After adopting their new name of Caf√© Society, they won a residency at the Troubadour Club where they were heard by Ray Davies. He signed them to his record label, Konk, and produced their self-titled 1975 album, together with fellow Kinks Dave Davies and John Gosling. Cafe Society, Discogs.com. Retrieved 25 February 2016 However, the album reputedly only sold 600 copies, and the band were unhappy about the instrumentation added in its production. They released a single, \\"Whitby Two Step\\", and undertook a nationwide tour supporting Barclay James Harvest before adding a bass player, Nick South (from Vinegar Joe), and drummer Nick Trevisick. They continued to perform in pubs in the London area. After seeing a gig by the Sex Pistols, and becoming increasingly politicised following a raid on a gay bar, Robinson wrote \\"Glad to Be Gay\\", which the band performed, but their musical differences soon led to Caf√© Society splitting up before recording a second album. A feud developed between Robinson and Ray Davies, with Davies maintaining control over Robinson's song publishing for some time, and each writing songs critical of the other. Davies wrote \\"Prince of Punks\\", B-side of the late 1977 Kinks single \\"Father Christmas\\", whilst Robinson wrote \\"Don't Take No For An Answer\\", released in early 1978 on the Rising Free live EP. Robinson formed the successful Tom Robinson Band in 1976, and later became a radio presenter. Hereward Kaye released a solo album, Golden Mile, in 1980; he was later a member of the Flying Pickets, and the lyricist for the 1992 stage musical Moby Dick.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=224458 on 2016-02-08 Description This genus, almost entirely represented by extinct species, is of slender form and elevated, evenly and gradually acuminate spire, conspicuous development of the spiral lyrae and short aperture. It should evidently be considered especially with Trypanotoma and allies, but it is somewhat of an annectant form, as the American species at least have true ribbing on the nepionic whorls which becomes completely lost on the larger volutions of the shell. It is therefore one of those puzzling exceptions which render an arrangement of the genera in a dichotomous table so difficult and unsatisfactory. The embryo in the type, Pleurotoma basteroti Desm., of the European Miocene, is said by Cossmann to be paucispiral, but the drawing shows a multispiral protoconch. This is, however, a matter of minor importance. The anal sinus is broad, sometimes very feeble and always median in position on the spire whorls though not identified with any particular one or more of the subequal and rather coarse flat spirals. The beak has no external oblique tumidity. There can be but little doubt, in view of geographical variations and wide distribution of this genus, that Endiatoma, of Cossmann, should be regarded as a synonym or as constituting a slightly differentiated section of Asthenotoma.

Education Fenton was a student at Ilford County High School for Boys (1967‚Äì1974) and studied mathematics at the London School of Economics (1975‚Äì78) gaining a first class Bachelor of Science degree and also winning the ‚ÄòSchool Scholar‚Äô prize in 1976 and 1977. He gained his Master of Science at the University of Sheffield (1978) winning the \\"ATM Flett Prize\\", and Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield (1981) under the supervision of Peter Vamos. His thesis was on \\"Representations of Matroids\\". In 2007‚Äì2008 Fenton completed a course in expert witness training with Bond Solon under the auspices of Cardiff University Law Dept. Career Between leaving school and going to university, Fenton worked for Hedge and Butler Wine Merchants (1974‚Äì1975) and also worked there in subsequent summers (1976 and 1977). After his PhD in 1981, Fenton joined University College Dublin (Mathematics Department) as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow. From 1982 to 1984 he was a postdoctoral research fellow at Oxford University (Mathematics Institute), and also member of Wolfson College. In 1984 he joined South Bank University (Dept Electrical & Electronic Eng) first as senior lecturer and then reader. He set up and was director of the Centre for Software & Systems Engineering before leaving in 1989 to join City University (Centre for Software Reliability). In 1993 Fenton was appointed professor at City University (aged 34). In 1989 Fenton, along with Martin Neil and Ed Tranham, set up the company Agena Ltd in Cambridge. Fenton was CEO between 1998 and 2015 and remains a director. In 2000 Fenton joined Queen Mary University of London (School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science) as professor (part-time) and he has been there since. He is director of the Risk and Information Management Research Group. In 2015 Fenton formed a new company Aldgate Analytics Ltd where he is CEO. Research Fenton currently works on quantitative risk assessment. This typically involves analysing and predicting the probabilities of unknown events using Bayesian statistical methods including especially causal, probabilistic models (Bayesian networks). This type of reasoning enables improved assessment by taking account of both statistical data and also expert judgment. In April 2014 Fenton was awarded one of the prestigious European Research Council Advanced Grants to focus on these issues. Fenton's experience in risk assessment covers a wide range of application domains such as legal reasoning (he has been an expert witness in major criminal and civil cases), medical analytics, vehicle reliability, embedded software, transport systems, financial services, and football prediction. Fenton has a special interest in raising public awareness of the importance of probability theory and Bayesian reasoning in everyday life (including how to present such reasoning in simple lay terms) and he maintains a website dedicated to this and also a blog focusing on probability and the law. In March 2015 Norman presented the BBC documentary Climate Change by Numbers. Fenton has published 7 books and 230 referred articles and has provided consulting to many major companies worldwide. His 2012 book was the first to bring Bayesian networks to a general audience. Fenton's current projects are focused on using Bayesian methods for improved legal reasoning and improved medical decision making. Since June 2011 he has led an international consortium (Bayes and the Law) of statisticians, lawyers and forensic scientists working to improve the use of statistics in court. In 2016, he is leading a prestigious 6-month Programme on Probability and Statistics in Forensic Science at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge. In addition to his research on risk assessment, Fenton is renowned for his work in software engineering (including pioneering work on software metrics); the third edition of his book \\"Software Metrics: A Rigorous and Practical Approach‚Äù was published in November 2014.

The editors of Massaquoi's autobiography give 1904 as the probable though not certain birth year, which raises questions concerning her school / graduation age. was an educator in Liberia, West Africa. After completing her education in the United States, she returned to Liberia in 1946, where she contributed much to the cultural and social life of the country. Born into a family of African royalty, Massaquoi grew up in the care of an aunt in Njagbacca, in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County of southern Liberia. After seven years, she returned to the northwestern part of the country in Montserrado County, where she began her schooling. In 1922 she accompanied her father, a diplomat, to Hamburg, Germany, where she completed her school education and started a course in medicine at the University of Hamburg. In 1937 she moved to the United States for further education, studying sociology and anthropology at Lane College, Fisk University and Boston University. While in the US, she collaborated on a dictionary of the Vai language and wrote her autobiography, though a legal battle ensued over the rights to her story. She won an injunction barring others from publishing and returned to Liberia in 1946, immediately beginning collaboration to establish a university there, which would become the University of Liberia. Committed to national cultural preservation and expansion, Massaquoi served as the director, later dean, of the Liberal Arts College and was the founding director of the Institute of African Studies. She co-founded the Society of Liberian Authors, helped abolish the practice of usurping African names for Westernized versions, and worked towards standardization of the Vai script. In the late 1960s, Vivian Seton, Massaquoi's daughter, had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation. After Massaquoi's death, her writings and notes were rediscovered, edited and published in 2013 as The Autobiography of an African Princess. Early life and education Massaquoi was born in Gendema in the Pujehun District of southern Sierra Leone in 1912 (others give 1904),cf footnote 1; there is also a difference in both sources about her place of birth between Gendema and Njagbacca the daughter of Momolu Massaquoi, who in 1922 became Liberia's consul general in Hamburg, Germany, and Massa Balo Sonjo. At birth, she was given the name Fatima Beendu Sandimanni, but dropped the Beendu before it became part of her records. Her paternal grandfather was King Lahai Massaquoi of the Gallinas, and her paternal grandmother was Queen Sandimannie (or Sandimani) of Sierra Leone's aristocratic Vai family. She was also the great-great-granddaughter of King Siaka of Gendema who ruled over the Gallinas in the 18th century. Massaquoi spent her first seven years with her father's sister, Mama Jassa, in Njagbacca in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County. While she was there, one of her father's six wives, Ma Sedia, seriously injured Fatima's hands for a misdemeanor. This caused her considerable pain throughout her childhood, hampering her ability to play the violin. She later became a highly competent player, though she remained self- conscious about the scarring even as an adult. After elementary school, she was sent to boarding school at Julia C. Emery Hall, attached to the Bromley Mission near Clay-Ashland in Montserrado County. Momolu Massaquoi (c.1905) Momolu Massaquoi sought to give his favourite child, and only daughter, the very best education. She went with him to Hamburg in 1922, where she lived at the consulate at 22 Johnsallee. Receiving her primary school education at St. Anschar H√∂here M√§dchenschule, Massaquoi quickly mastered German. On the recommendation of the consulate's housekeeper, Gertrude von Bobers, to whom she became very attached, in 1932 she spent some time in Geneva, Switzerland, where she learnt French at the √âcole Sup√©rieure et Secondaire. The same year, she returned to Hamburg, attending the Helen Lange Schule, where she received her school leaving certificate in 1935. She then started to study medicine at the University of Hamburg but broke this off when she left Germany. Hans J. Massaquoi, her nephew, who was in Hamburg during the same period, recounts that \\"Tante Fatima\\" dressed exotically in African clothing, proudly maintained her African habits and spoke the Vai language. One of her fondest friends in Hamburg was Richard Heydorn, a pianist, with whom she gave many recitals. An opponent of Nazism, when war broke out he was sent to Russia, and was later reported missing in action. Being part of the first black diplomatic family in Germany had always been challenging, but with the rise of the Nazi regime, Massaquoi's father began fearing for her safety. With the assistance of friends, he helped her relocate to the United States to avoid the Aryan policies and restrictions placed on women. Years in the United States Massaquoi arrived that same year in the United States and experienced the racial segregation and Jim Crow laws of the Southern States. She first attended Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, graduating in sociology. Two years later she moved to Fisk University in Nashville earning two master's degrees, first in sociology and then in anthropology in 1944. She assisted her professor, Mark Hanna Watkins, in his understanding of the Vai language, cooperating with him in compiling a Vai dictionary. She agreed to accept a fellowship as a linguistic advisor, after her father died in 1938. She taught French and German at Fisk and also paid her way by giving instruction in African and European folk dancing, as well as teaching the violin, thanks to her own competence on the instrument. In 1940, Massaquoi finished writing an autobiographical account of her early life as a tribal child, her life experiences with Europeans and education in Germany and Switzerland, and impressions of America. Watkins told her the English was too poor for publication, but later he claimed in a 1944 letter that she had written the account upon his insistence. While awaiting the editing, Massaquoi continued helping the school prepare a dictionary on the Vai language, teaching cultural dance and language, but was unhappy with the arrangement which paid only a small sum. When she attempted to retrieve her manuscript, Watkins refused and she sued the university for its return and to bar them from publishing her works. In 1945, she won a permanent injunction against Watkins, Dr. Thomas E. Jones, president of the university, and Fisk University prohibiting them from publishing or receiving any financial rewards from any publication of the work. Massaquoi felt that she had been \\"conspired against\\" because she was foreign and a presumption that she did not have the strength to fight for her rights. In 1946 while at Boston University, Massaquoi completed editing the autobiography (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: The Autobiography of a Vai Noblewoman). Thanks to her extensive travels and education, by this time, she spoke several languages‚Äîat least eight and four tribal dialects. In addition to her native Vai and Mende, she spoke English which she had first learnt at school in Liberia, German from her many years in Hamburg, and French from her schooling in Switzerland. Return to Liberia University of Liberia (2009) Upon the invitation of President William Tubman, Massaquoi returned to Liberia on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in Monrovia. She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at Liberia College, later the University of Liberia (UL). In 1956, she became director, then dean (1960), of the Liberal Arts College and was a co- founder of the Society of Liberian Authors. In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies, which would evolve into the Institute of African Studies at UL. During her term at the university, Massaquoi succeeded in overcoming the requirement that students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script. With a view to enhancing educational developments in Liberia, in late 1963 and early 1964, Massaquoi spent six months in the United States on an education scholarship, visiting fine arts colleges and university departments of anthropology and sociology, mainly in the east and mid-west. In 1968, while living in Monrovia, Liberia, with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren, Massaquoi suffered a stroke. This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother's unpublished autobiography microfilmed, calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University of Liberia. Massaquoi retired from the university in the summer of 1972, receiving an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. She was also decorated as a Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by the president of Liberia. Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh died in Monrovia on 26 November 1978. Posthumously, her microfilmed manuscripts were discovered by German researcher Konrad Tuchscherer, while conducting other research. Arthur Abraham, a historian at Virginia State University, Massaquoi's daughter, Vivian Seton, and Tuchscherer, edited the accounts of her early experiences in Germany and the United States. The book, The Autobiography of an African Princess, was published in 2013 and was well received by critics. Tamba M‚Äôbayo of West Virginia University, stated: \\"The strengths of this autobiography could be gauged at two or more different levels. First, its down-to-heart and honest account of even the most disturbing personal experiences‚Ä¶Second the larger canvas of Sierra Leonean and Liberian cultural and ethno-linguistic history in which Fatima‚Äôs story is told. Rich in content and well orchestrated‚Ä¶\\". Accolades Throughout her life, Massaquoi received a number of awards and honors, both locally and internationally. She was bestowed with the Tricentenary Bust of Moli√®re by the French Government in 1955. In 1962, she was honoured with the Gro√ües Verdienstkreuz erster Klasse from the Federal Republic of Germany by President Heinrich L√ºbke. Upon her 1972 retirement, she was granted an honorary Doctor of Humanities from UL and awarded the rank of Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by President William R. Tolbert, Jr. When Massaquoi died, a tribute was held at the University of Liberia. Mary Antoinette Brown-Sherman, who up to that time was the only woman to have served anywhere in Africa as a university president, proclaimed, \\"Hers was a life of dedication to the Liberian nation and to the cause of education.\\" Selected works   *Massaquoi-Fahnbullet, Fatima (1953). \\"The Seminar on Standardization of the Vai Script.\\" University of Liberia Journal, 3/1, 15‚Äì37.

Between the late fifth century BC and its destruction in 146 BC, Carthage produced a wide range of coinage in gold, electrum, silver, billon, and bronze. Only a minority of Carthaginian coinage was produced or used in North Africa. Instead, the majority derive from Carthage's holdings in Sardinia and western Sicily. The base denomination was the shekel, probably pronounced in Punic. Carthage issued ¬Ω-shekel, shekel (7.20 g), 1‚Öî-shekel, double shekel, and triple shekel coins. 5-shekel pieces were issued in Sicily. Background Between the ninth and seventh centuries BC, the Phoenicians established colonies throughout the western Mediterranean, particularly in North Africa, western Sicily, Sardinia, and southern Iberia. Carthage soon became the largest of these communities, establishing particularly close economic, cultural, and political ties with Motya in western Sicily and Sulci in Sardinia. Although coinage began to be minted by Greek communities in Sicily and Southern Italy around 540 BC, Punic communities did not begin producing coins until around 425 BC. The first Punic mints were in western Sicily, at Motya and ·π¢y·π£ (probably Panormus, modern Palermo). The coinage that these communities produced is known as Siculo-Punic coinage. Like the coinage produced by the Greek communities in the western part of the island, it was minted solely in silver on the Attic-Euboic weight standard, and its iconography was mostly adapted from other pre-existing Sicilian coinages - principally those of Himera, Segesta, and Syracuse. This Siculo-Punic coinage probably preceded Phoenicia's own Tyrian shekels, which developed . First Carthaginian coinage (c. 410 - 390 BC) The first Carthaginian coinage seems to have been minted in 410 or 409 BC, to pay for the massive Carthaginian military intervention in Sicily that led to the Second Sicilian War (410-404 BC) and it continued through until the end of the Third Sicilian War (398-393 BC). This coinage consisted solely of Attic-weight silver tetradrachms, known as Series I (c. 410-390 BC), containing five separate chronological sub-groups (A-F). The obverse of these earliest coins bears the front half of a horse facing right, with a Punic language legend reading QRT·∏§D≈†T (ê§íê§ìê§ïê§áê§Éê§îê§ï, 'Carthage'). The reverse depicts a date palm tree, with the inscription M·∏§NT (ê§åê§áê§çê§ï, 'the encampment'). From sub-group B, the obverse also features a winged Nike flying over the horse, holding a caduceus and a wreath. In the final sub- group, F, the forepart of the horse is replaced with a full horse, prancing freely. This silver coinage may have been accompanied, in its later stages by the first Carthaginian gold coinage, known as Jenkins-Lewis, Group I. This coinage is known from a single example. It was minted as a shekel or didrachm on the Phoenician weight standard. Its types, a horse on the obverse and a palm tree on the reverse are very similar to those of the silver, Series I, sub-group F. Alongside these first Carthaginian issues, separate coinages continued to be produced by other cities within the Carthaginian sphere in western Sicily, notably Motya (until 398/7 BC), ·π¢y·π£-Panormus, Eryx, and Segesta. =Date and mint location= The date of Series I (c. 410-390 BC) is established by several pieces of evidence. A coin from sub-group B was overstruck by a coin of Agrigentum. Since minting activity ended at Agrigentum in 406 BC, when the Carthaginians destroyed the city, Series I (B) must have already been in circulation before this date. The series had come to an end by the early 380s BC, since a selection of all the sub-groups appears in two hoards deposited at that time: Contessa and Vito Superiore. The latter is particularly significant since the most likely occasion for its deposition is the Siege of Rhegion in 387 BC. The patterns of die linkage within the series - with relatively high ratio of reverse dies to obverse dies and relatively few reverse dies shared by multiple obverse dies - indicate that minting was \\"intensive though spasmodic.\\" Bringing this numismatic data into connection with the historical situation in these years as known from literary sources (primarily Diodorus Siculus), Kenneth Jenkins argued that the Carthaginians initiated minting in order to pay for their initial expedition to Sicily in 410 BC (or possibly their second intervention in 409 BC, which was on a much larger scale), and continued producing coinage as required by their fluctuating circumstances during the following seventeen years of war, until peace was declared in 393 BC, following the Battle of Chrysas. The reverse legend, M·∏§NT, meaning 'encampment' has military overtones which support the idea that this coinage was intended to pay for ongoing military campaigns. The location of the mint where this coinage was produced is not certainly known. Later issues of Carthaginian silver were produced in Sicily, at Lilybaeum (modern Marsala), but this city was only founded in 397/396 BC, following the destruction of Motya. It is unlikely to have been produced in Motya before that date, since Motya seems to have continued minting its own coinage until its destruction. Therefore, the initial production of the series presumably took place in Carthage itself. There is an iconographic shift at the transition from sub-group E to sub-group F, in which the obverse design goes from a depiction of the forepart of a horse to the depiction of a full horse. It is possible that change coincided with the shift of minting to the new city of Lilybaeum. The gold-issue, Jenkins-Lewis Group I, is dated solely on the basis of its iconographic similarity to the final sub-group of the silver (Series I (F)), which suggests that it was minted at the same time. It may have been minted in Carthage or Lilybaeum. In the ancient Mediterranean, the issue of gold coinage was often connected to times of particular crisis, when silver stocks had been exhausted and states were forced to resort to melting down jewellery and religious dedications. This might fit with production in the later stages of the seventeen year Carthaginian war in Sicily. =Iconography= Series I introduces two key motifs that continued to appear regularly on Carthaginian coinage throughout its history: the horse and the palm tree. The significance of both symbols is disputed, with a particular divide in scholarship around whether they should be interpreted in terms of Punic or Greek cultural traditions. Three main interpretations of the horse have been proposed. One is that the horse was a symbol of Baal Hammon, the chief god of Carthage, who was probably associated with warfare and the sun. However, our knowledge of Carthaginian religion and the nature of its deities is very limited. On much later Carthaginian coinage, the horse sometimes appears with a sun disc, which might support this interpretation. The second interpretation is that the horse refers to a foundation legend of Carthage, known from the Roman historian Justin. According to him, at the foundation of Carthage a horse's head was found in the ground and was interpreted as an omen of the city's future prosperity.Epitome of Pompeius Trogus 18.5 It was common on Greek coinages in Sicily and southern Italy to depict motifs connected to the minting city's foundation. But it is not clear whether the Carthaginians themselves knew this foundation story. The third interpretation is that the horse refers to the military purpose of the coinage. Important for this interpretation is the fact that from sub-group B onwards, the horse is accompanied by a winged female figure holding a wreath and a caduceus. In Greek art, this figure is a symbol of victory, known as Nike, and the wreath was awarded to victors in contests and battles. These three interpretations are not necessarily mutually incompatible. The usual interpretation of the palm tree is that it was a type of visual pun intended to signify the minting authority, since the Greek word for palm tree, phoinix is also the Greek word for 'Phoenician/Punic'. This kind of visual pun, often known as a 'canting type', was common on classical Greek coinage, particularly in Sicily, where prominent examples appear at Himera, Selinus, Zancle, and Leontini. Edward Stanley Robinson challenged this interpretation, on the grounds that a Greek pun would be surprising on a Punic coin. However, Greek was widely known and spoken in the Carthaginian-controlled portion of Sicily; on several earlier Siculo-Punic coinages, the coin legends are in Greek. An alternative explanation is that the palm was a symbol of the sun god Baal Hammon - if he was a sun-god - but there is not much evidence for this, except that the palm was a symbol of the Greek sun god, Apollo, at Delos. On sub-group E, two unusual double-tiered pots appear on the obverse in between the letters of the legend. These vessels are a type of incense burner or thymaterion, which is commonly found in pottery assemblages at Punic sites from this period. Its presence may support attempts to read the iconography of these coins in terms of Carthaginian religion. Mid-fourth century (c. 350/340 - 320/315 BC) A silver Carthaginian shekel bearing the wreathed head of Tanit and a standing horse before a palm tree and beside a star. A Carthaginian shekel bearing the wreathed head of Tanit and a standing horse. After a hiatus in minting, a new Carthaginian coinage began to be struck between 350 and 340 BC. The new Carthaginian coinage consisted of another series of silver tetradrachms, known as Series II, with four subgroups (A-D), which lasted until 320/315 BC. This was accompanied by a new gold coinage, Jenkins-Lewis, Group II, in two denominations (a shekel and a fifth-shekel), which was produced on a much larger scale than previous issues. It was followed by Jenkins-Lewis, Group III, the first large Carthaginian electrum issue (95% gold, 5% silver), with nine subgroups (A-I), which began being minted some time after 350 BC and continued until around 320 BC. It consists of an overweight shekel of 9.4 g and a number of smaller denominations (a half, a quarter, a fifth, and a tenth). A set of bronze coins, SNG Cop 94-97 were produced from around 350 to around 330 BC. The iconography of the coins builds on themes already present in the earlier issues. The silver coins of Series II have a female head on the obverse, modelled on the depictions of Kore (sub-groups A.i, B, and C.iv) and Arethusa (sub-groups A.ii, C.i-iii, and D) on Syracusan coinage. The reverse usually has a horse standing still, with a palm tree behind it. The first issue has the legend QRTHD≈†T, followed by M (ê§å) and BTW'L (ê§Åê§ïê§Öê§Äê§ã) later in sub-group A, and by ·∏§B or B·∏§ (ê§áê§Å or ê§Åê§á) in sub-group C. The gold coinage of Jenkins-Lewis, Group II and subsequent groups also has a female head modelled on Kore and a horse on the reverse, but there is no palm tree and no legend either. The bronze coinage bears a male head on the obverse and a leaping horse on the reverse. The impetus for this renewed minting seems to have been the Carthaginian interventions in eastern Sicily following the demise of Dionysius II's regime in Syracuse and then the Sixth Sicilian War against Timoleon. It was accompanied by renewed minting at a number of other Siculo- Punic centres, including ·π¢y·π£/Panormus, R≈°mlqrt (Selinous or Lilybaeum?), Therma, and perhaps Solous. =Date and mint locations= The date of the silver coinage is indicated by the fact that only early issues (sub-group A.i) appear in the Nissora and Gibil Gabib hoards (IGCH 2133 and 2132), which were deposited in the 330s BC. This implies that the first sub-group began some time in the 340s BC, which syncs well with the historical circumstance of Timoleon's war with the Carthaginians from 344-341 BC. Sub-group D is known to be the last sub-group of the series, because it is die-linked with the first issue of the next set of silver coinage produced by the Carthaginians (Series III.A). Coins of sub-group D appear in the Megara Hyblaea hoard (IGCH 2135) which was deposited in the 320s BC, indicating that the series must have been coming to an end in that decade. The gold of Jenkins-Lewis, Group II is dated by stylistic comparison with the obverse of the early silver, suggesting a date in the 340s BC, but might actually begin earlier. Jenkins-Lewis, Group III is absent from the Avola hoard deposited around 360 BC and must therefore post-date it. The subsequent Jenkins-Lewis Group V occurs in the Scoglitti hoard (IGCH 2185a), deposited in the 290s BC, so Group III and Group IV were probably minted between c. 350 and 310 BC. The date of the bronze is indicated by archaeological finds in the western portion of Sicily. The silver mint is generally identified as the product of a mobile military mint that was usually located in Lilybaeum (modern Marsala). The gold of Group II may have been minted there as well, or in Carthage. Group III and subsequent groups do not seem to have been minted in the same place as the silver. They have a totally different system of control marks (the silver uses symbols, the electrum uses a system of dots). They are also stylistically distinct, with the silver tending to closely follow models from Syracusan coinage, while the electrum types are not imitations of other coinage. Finally, from Group IV onwards (310s BC?), the electrum dies were regularly aligned, so that the top of the obverse die and the top of the reverse die match. The silver tetradrachms continue to have loose dies. This indicates that different manufacturing techniques were being used for the two different metals. All of these factors imply that the electrum was manufactured at a different mint from the silver. Usually, this mint is identified with Carthage itself. The location where SNG Cop 94-98 were minted is uncertain. Suzanne Frey-Kupper argued that the mint was located in Sicily, since the vast majority of these coins have been found in Sicily and there is no other Punic bronze that could have been minted on Sicily in this time frame. Paolo Vison√† argues they were minted in Carthage, since the smallest denomination (SNG Cop. 98) has only been found at Carthage itself. =Iconography= The identity of the female head appearing on the obverse of the gold and silver issues has been subject to dispute. The head is a close imitation of obverse dies from the mint of Syracuse depicting the goddesses Kore and Arethusa. Some scholars have argued that this was simply a design that had currency and was not intended to mean anything except that the money was trustworthy. Other scholars have argued that it should be interpreted as a depiction of the goddess Kore. In support of this is the fact that Demeter and Kore were worshipped in Carthage, where they had had a temple since 396 BC. Furthermore, the one significant change made to the image is the addition of a wreath made out of sheafs of wheat, which might have been intended to make clear that the image depicted Kore, as goddess of grain and the harvest. Donald Harden argued that the head should be interpreted as the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, \\"in the guise of the Sicilian Persephone [i.e. Kore].\\" Kenneth Jenkins suggests that this could be linked with the interpretation of the horse on the reverse as a symbol of Baal Hammon, since one of Tanit's main epithets in Carthage was Pene Ba'al (face of Ba'al), but he concedes that evidence that the Carthaginians identified Tanit with Kore is \\"lacking.\\" Jenkins interprets the ray-ed disc that accompanies the horse on the reverse of one issue of the silver (within sub-group B), as supporting the identification of the horse with Baal Hammon. =Exchange rate= The gold and silver coinage were intended to function together as a single system, but the rate of exchange between them is not known for certain. Jenkins and Lewis proposed that in the time of Group II there was a silver:gold ratio of 15:1, in which case one gold shekel in this period would have been equivalent to 25 silver drachms. On this ratio it would not have been practically easy to exchange one of the gold coins for its equivalent in silver. For the subsequent Group III, the weight of the main gold denomination was increased from 7.6 g to 9.4 g, but was adulterated with silver (5 %). Jenkins and Lewis propose that the silver to electrum ratio was 11¬º:1, later falling to 11:1. Thus, one electrum shekel would have initially been worth 25 drachms and later 24 drachms. On this argument the smaller denominations belong to two different stages. The fifth and tenth units would belong to the earlier period and have been worth 5 and 2.5 silver drachms respectively, while the half and quarter would have belonged to the later period and have been worth 12 and 6 drachms respectively. Late fourth century (320-305 BC) The next series of coinage continued directly out of the previous issue. It consisted of two sets of silver tetradrachms. One of these, Series III consisted of four sub-groups (A-D), which were minted continuously in large quantities. The other issue (Series IV) was minted occasionally, in small quantities, alongside Series III. A new electrum issue, Jenkins-Lewis, Group IV, was perhaps minted in the 310s BC and contained four sub-groups (A-D). It returned to the normal shekel of 7.2 g, with two smaller denominations (a fifth and a tenth), but had a much lower gold content than the previous group (72 % gold, 28% silver). The bronze issue, SNG Cop. 102-105 began sometime between 330 and 310 BC. The iconography of the main silver and electrum issues basically continues that of the preceding ones. Group IV continues to depict a female head on the obverse and a standing horse on the reverse, exactly as on Group III. The main silver issue, Series III has a female head modelled on depictions of Arethusa on Syracusan coins on the obverse and a horse standing in front of a palm, like most of the Series II silver. On sub-group A, the legend on the reverse reads  øM MHNT (ê§èê§åê§åê§áê§çê§ï, 'people of the encampment'). On later sub-groups, it is abbreviated to MM (ê§åê§å, III.B),  ø (ê§è, III.C), M (ê§å, III.D). Series IV has a totally novel iconography. The obverse shows a head, probably female, wearing a Phrygian cap, while the reverse depicts a lion stalking in front of a palm. The bronze coins, SNG Cop. 102-105, have a palm tree on the obverse and a horse's head on the reverse. =Dating and mint location= The continuity with the previous issues means that the mint locations of the electrum and silver issues are almost certainly in the same location as in the previous period. The legend on the silver coinage supports the idea that it was minted at a mobile military mint. The beginning of Series III of the silver is inferred from the ending date of Series II in the 320s BC. It is presumed that the new series was begun to fund the interventions in eastern Sicily at the start of Agathocles' reign in Syracuse. Series III had ended by the time the Pachino 1957 hoard (IGCH 2151) was deposited in the 290s BC. The Series IV coinage is dated by its appearance in the same hoard, as well as by its stylistic links to Series II.D and Series III.A of around 320 BC. The bronze coinage, SNG Cop. 102-105 includes coins overstruck on SNG Cop 94-98, indicating that it followed that issue. Like SNG Cop 94-98, it comes with two distinct types of flan: a bulging round flan (SNG Cop 103-105) and a flat, cast flan with bevelled edges (SNG Cop 102). Metal analysis shows that the same alloy is used for both issues and for both flan types. This is strong evidence that SNG Cop 102-105 was minted at the same mint as SNG Cop 94-98. SNG Cop 102-105 was itself overstruck at Syracuse by bronze coinage of Hicetas (289-287 BC), indicating that SNG Cop 102-105 remained in circulation through the 290s BC. =Iconography= The key iconographic problem is the identification of the head on the Series IV silver. One suggestion is that it depicts Dido, the semi-mythical founder of Carthage. This would fit into a common pattern on Greek coinages of Sicily and southern Italy, which often depict the founder of the community. Another suggestion is that the figure is a personification of Libya - a theory rejected by Jenkins as \\"hardly consistent with Carthaginian nationalism.\\" Jenkins himself found close parallels in terracotta figurines of Artemis, which show Artemis alongside a lion or a palm tree.e.g. Higgins BMC terracottas #731, 1212, and 1362; Archaeologica Classica 9 (1957), pl. XXIV.2 He proposes that onomastic evidence shows that Artemis was identified with Tanit and thus that it is Series IV that depicts the goddess Tanit. A large mass of bronze and silver coins and smaller issues in gold and electrum were struck on Sicily under administrators described as . First Punic War (264-241 BC) A electrum (silver-and-gold) Carthaginian coin bearing the wreathed head of Tanit. billon Carthaginian tridrachm coin bearing the wreathed head of Tanit. The Siculo- Carthaginian issues of the First Punic War include one series featuring Melqart (\\"Hercules\\") obverse and a horse's head reverse. More commonly, Carthaginian currency featured a female head identified as the goddess Tanit. One issue of bronze coins in two denominations‚ÄîTanit the god of sun on the obverse and a galloping horse reverse‚Äîwas coined at Kerkouane on Cape Bon during the resistance to the invasion of Regulus amid the First Punic War. A great deal of highly debased coins were struck at the end of the First Punic War, however, to deal with the empire's revolting mercenaries. Interwar Period (241-218 BC) A Carthaginian shekel, dated 237-227 BC, depicting the Punic god Melqart (equivalent of Hercules/Heracles), most likely with the features of Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding a war elephant Between the First and Second Punic Wars, Carthage only issued bronze coins in North Africa, although the Barcids issued gold and silver coins in Spain bearing the head of Melqart obverse and a horse and palm tree reverse. The gold coins were produced at a weight of 7.50 g, reflecting a value of 12 silver shekels each at a bullion exchange rate of 1:11‚Öì. Second Punic War (218-201 BC) Spanish expansion and Roman plunder permitted issues in precious metals during the Second Punic War, including two large silver issues for use on Sicily. One set of half-shekels featured a diademed male head obverse and elephant reverse; another featured a male head with grain wreath obverse and a galloping horse reverse. By the war's end, bronze was again being used and, following the war, debased silver. The shekel also decreased in Barcid areas from 7.2 to around 7.0 g over the course of the war. Bronze coins similarly varied in weight between 8 and 10 g owing to varying exchange rates between it and the silver currency. Final period (200-146 BC) The last issues before the Third Punic War attest to the city's revitalization, as they are again pure silver with a serrate edge. Numidian coinage Numidian coins also circulated but were entirely of bronze. History of research =Collections= A collection of recovered coins is maintained at the Tunisian Mint Museum () at the Central Bank in Tunis. =Speculative theories= Recently, it has been proposed that the Germanic penny, ', ', &c.; may derive from an early borrowing of Punic (Pane or Pene, \\"Face\\"), as the face of Carthaginian fertility goddess Tanit was represented on nearly all Carthaginian currency. The theory is, however, still disputed. Similarly, the supposed discovery of a cache of Carthaginian coins on Corvo in 1749 is the basis for supposing that the Carthaginians reached the Azores, but remains contentious.

From November 2015 to April 2016, he was the acting president of the German Football Association along with Reinhard Rauball. Koch is a member of UEFA's Appeals Body. Professional career Koch completed his schooling at Wilhelmsgymnasium Munich and then did his military service. From 1979 to 1984 he studied law at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. After receiving his doctorate, he worked in the Bavarian judicature. After working in various local courts, he worked for three years at the Saxonian University of Applied Sciences of Administration in Meissen. Koch was the deputy head of the IT authority of the Bavarian justice for several years. Since 2008, Koch has been a judge at the Oberlandesgericht Munich. Because of his diverse obligations as a sports official, he converted to a part-time job. Sporting career =Bavarian Football Association= In his youth, Koch played football for the Kirchheimer SC and for the TSV Poing. From 1977 to 1980, Koch was coach of the D and C junior teams from Kirchheimer SC. Also in Kirchheim, Koch took over head of the youth department from 1989-1990. Starting in 1975, he was a referee at the Bavarian Football Association (Bayerischer Fu√üball-Verband, BFV). Up to 1986, Koch refereed nearly 1,000 football matches, including some in the Bayernliga, which was then the third highest league in Germany. From 1987 to 1989 he was an official referee observer. He also coached the A youth team of Falke Markt Schwaben. Koch acquired the coaching license B in 1982. At the age of 24, in 1982, he was an observer in the referee committee of the football district of Munich, which he held until 1986. After a work-related break, Koch returned again in 1990 to the BFV and became chairman of the Jugend-Sportgericht (Youth Sport Court) in the district of Upper Bavaria. After six years he was assessor in the association sports court, the leading sports court in the BFV, which he chaired from 1998 until 2004. In November 2004, Koch was unanimously elected President of the Bavarian Football Association. As president, he visited the district and regional days in BFV, promoted the efforts against match fixing, and strengthened the lower divisions in the association. In the following BFV general meetings in 2006, 2010 and 2014 Koch was unanimously re-elected. =Southern German Football Association= Koch was elected in 2005 as vice president of the board of the Southern German Football Association (S√ºddeutscher Fu√üball-Verband, SFV). The SFV is made up of the football associations in Bavaria, Hesse, Baden and W√ºrttemberg. Koch is President of the SFV since 22 October 2011. =German Football Association= Koch in 2011 In 1996, Koch was made assessor of sports court of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund, DFB), to which he was elected chairman in 1998. In this position, Koch was much more involved in the investigation of the Bundesliga scandal 2005. Under his chairmanship, the court imposed the highest fines in the DFB-history for racism from football fans. In October 2007, Koch was elected DFB vice- president and then gave up the chair of the sports court. As DFB vice- president he was involved in fighting against racism and violence in football stadiums. On 25 October 2013, Koch took over the responsibility for amateur football as 1st Vice President of the DFB board. In this capacity, he is chairman of the conference of 21 state and five regional association presidents.

The valley stands within the north-eastern boundary of the Peak District National Park just west of the village of Low Bradfield. The dale is drained by the Strines Dike which becomes the Dale Dike lower down the valley, these being the headwaters of the River Loxley. The dale contains two reservoirs, Strines and Dale Dike, and a third Agden Reservoir stands in a side valley just above Low Bradfield. The dale is characterised by agricultural land interspersed with farming and residential buildings. It is approximately long from its foot at Low Bradfield to its head on Strines Moor. Roads Two roads travel up the valley from its lower regions: Dale Road passes on the north side of the dale with Blindside Lane on the south. Mortimer Road traverses around the valley at a height of around . This road was named after Hans Winthrop Mortimer, the Lord of Bamford and a former Member of Parliament, who obtained an Act of Parliament in 1771 to improve the bridleway between Penistone and Bamford by repairing, widening and building bridges to make it fit for wheeled traffic. Great Sheffield Flood The lower part of Bradfield Dale was the first area to be inundated by the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864. The dale beneath the stricken Dale Dike reservoir is rural with very few habitations. However, the farmstead of John Empsall and his family which stood by the Annet bridge was completely swept away by the torrent. Luckily the Empsalls including their three children survived, as did their lodger William Rose, a reservoir construction worker. They had been forewarned of the imminent disaster ten minutes earlier by local resident Thomas Fish. The Annet bridge was destroyed in the deluge, to be rebuilt at a later date. Significant buildings Hallfield House and Sugworth Hall are the best two examples of residential houses within Bradfield Dale, both being given listed status by English Heritage. Hallfield dates from at least the 14th century, while Sugworth was mentioned in documents in the 16th century although it was then completely different in character to its present form. Just to the north of Sugworth Hall stands Boot's Folly (also known as Sugworth Tower), a conspicuous landmark on a hillside above Strines Reservoir. Haychatter House =Thornseats Lodge= Thornseats Lodge is an imposing house, which stands high () on the north side of the valley off Mortimer Road above Dale Dike Reservoir dam wall. It was built in 1855 for the steel maker Sidney Jessop as a base for grouse shooting on the surrounding moorland. His better known brother Thomas Jessop (1804‚Äì1887) inherited the lodge and made significant improvements. The lodge eventually passed to Thomas' son William (1856‚Äì1905). Sheffield City Council purchased the building for use as an orphanage and then a children's home in the 1930s. In the 1980s it was sold to local businessman Doug Hague, and it now stands in a derelict state. Thornseats Lodge and other buildings. Cruck barn at Woodseats farm =Farm buildings= Many of the farm buildings in the valley are of some age. Lower Thornseat farmhouse on Dale Road (grade II listed) dates from 1721 and stands within a small group of buildings which includes the Dale Dike reservoir keeper's house, a substantial stone built house dating from the 1870s. Further down Dale Road is Walker House Farm, which includes an early 17th-century cruck barn. Woodseats Farm on the dale's northern slopes also has a surviving cruck barn. Almost adjacent to Walker House on Dale Road is Haychatter House, which dates from the late 1500s and was a farm building for several hundred years. When the reservoirs were built in the dale during the 1860s the farm became a public house serving the large number of navvies who arrived to do the construction work. Initially called the Reservoir Inn and then the Haychatter Inn, the pub closed in 2003, being run by the Siddall family for last 30 years of operation. Today it is a private house. Edgefield House, now marked on maps as Edgefield Farm, is one of the largest houses in the dale; built in a sunless north-facing position off Hoar Stones Road, it was the home of the eminent Sheffield solicitor William Tattershall (1774‚Äì1834). By the roadside is a small unusual listed building, erected to protect people from a spring in which a child drowned in 1832. Gives details of buildings. =Strines Inn= The Strines Inn, the only public house left in the dale with the closing of the Haychatter, stands at the head of the valley on Mortimer Road at a height of 1000 feet above sea level. Although there are claims that there was a structure on the site in the 13th century, it seems that the building dates from the 16th century, with the upper wing added in the 18th century and the part adjacent to the road constructed in 1860. The Worralls were a local gentry family who lived at Strines, and their coat of arms is carved above the doorway. The inn was converted to a public house in the 1770s.

The shell has a white color turning to light fawn at the top of the spire. (Original description, translated from French into English) The solid shell has a fusiform shape. It consists of one turreted and elongated, conical spirewith 7 1/2 barely convex whorls. The first two (embryonic) are smooth and shiny, the other grated with decurrent spiral striae (5 or 6 on the penultimate whorl and about fifteen on the last) and by well marked growth lines, strongly arched in the middle of the upper striae on top of the last. The aperture is fairly narrow, not reaching half the total height of the shell and terminating at the base in a very short, wide open canal. The columellar edge is arched at the top, then with a plicate projection turning obliquely downward. This edge is provided with an eye-catching and limited callus.

Biography Giovanny Lammona was born in Moscow, to Yoakhim de Lammona, an Italian artist and decorator. His mother Pelageya Vasilyevna Azarevicheva was a serf actress at Count Semyon Zorich Theatre, whom Yoakhim married when working with that troupe as decorator, in the early 1800s. –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –ò–≥–Ω–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ñ–∏–≤–æ–∫–∏–Ω–∏ at Krugosvet/–ö—Ä—É–≥–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç Online Encyclopedia In 1824, still a senior year student at Moscow Theatre Institute, Lammona joined the Moscow's Maly Theatre. From 1826 onwards, when, after his first marriage, he joined the Russian Orthodox Church, he's been known under his assumed Russian name, Vasily Zhivokini. For the next fifty years Zhivokini was one of Moscow's leading actors, engaged in all the key comic parts of the contemporary repertoire: Dobchinsky and Zemlyanika in Gogol's Revizor; Zagoretsky and later Repetilov in Griboyedov's Woe from Wit, Kochkarev and Podkolesin in Gogol's Marriage, Rasplyuyev in Krechinsky's Marriage (by Aleksandr Sukhovo-Kobylin), and many others. He was appearing regularly in plays by Alexander Ostrovsky (Rispolozhensky in It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves, Gradoboyev in An Ardent Heart, Kuritsyn in Live Not as You Would Like To, etc.), mostly as merchants and senior servants, habitually resorting to humorous improvisations playing havoc with the original text, much to the amusement of the appreciative audiences. In 1873 Zhivokini's health severely declined and he was advised to retire. Once having felt better, on 17 January 1874 he came up on stage, managed somehow to finish the show and died several hours later. Vasily Zhivokini's Memoirs, serialized originally in 1864 (Teatralnye Afishi) and 1874 (Moskovskiye Vedomosti), came out as a book in 1914. Legacy Konstantin Stanislavski remembered: \\"Having entered the stage, he immediately headed for the audiences, pronounced his greetings, received the ovation and only then addressed the task of playing his part. Such an outrage would have been unacceptable at any more or less serious theatre, but this habit just couldn't be taken away from Zhivokini, such an integral part of his artistic persona it was. Just seeing their favourite actor filled people's hearts with joy and he invariously received his second, massive ovation later - for being Zhivokini, for giving people those moments of happiness that make life so wonderful...\\" \\"Zhivokini... never created characters, he what he used to do was take any particular mask and stuck it onto his own persona... Endowed with enormous gift, he never even thought of trying to develop it by hard work. He went by pure inspiration, his performances were patchy and unhinged, but for all that, immensely absorbing. According to one critic, 'For fifty years Zhivokoni played himself and nobody else but did this in such a way that the audiences never had a single dull moment in the course of this half a century,'\\" the theatre historian M. Vasilevskaya wrote.Vasilevskaya, M.–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –ò–≥–Ω–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ñ–∏–≤–æ–∫–∏–Ω–∏ at the Russian Biographical Encyclopedia.

The action was justified by reference to Bourguiba's failing health and Article 57 of the country's constitution. Reports later surfaced to indicate that the Italian intelligence services had been involved in planning it. Sources sometimes identify the 1987 coup as the \\"R√©volution de jasmin\\" (Jasmin Revolution) as the jasmine flower is considered a symbol of Tunisia. However, more recent sources also use exactly the same term to identify the 2011 Tunisian Revolution. Events During the night of 6 November 1987 a group of seven doctors signed a medical report attesting to the mental incapacity of Bourguiba. The political journalist Mezri Haddad summarised the report as follows: At the same time, Bourguiba demanded new trials for 15 suspected Islamists, and that all but three of them be hanged by the following weekend. When this order became known, a number of Tunisian political leaders, including longtime supporters of Bourguiba, feared that Bourguiba was no longer acting or thinking rationally. Later, one human rights activist said that if the orders had been carried out, it would have triggered a civil war. In justification of the coup, Prime Minister Ben Ali invoked Article 57 of the constitution, as he assumed power. He rapidly emerged, therefore, not merely as the constitutional president, but also as the commander in chief of the army. The journalists and Jean-Pierre Tuquoi summarise the circumstances under which the necessary medical opinion had been obtained: The next day the new president addressed the nation on Radio Tunis. He paid tribute to the huge sacrifices that his predecessor had made, supported by brave men, in his service to the liberation and development of Tunisia. At the same time Ben Ali took the opportunity to make a declaration: \\"In the times in which we live it is not longer enough to put up either with presidencies for life or with automatic succession for the head of state, under a system from which the people are excluded. Our people deserve a modern politics, based on a genuinely multi-party system incorporating a plurality of mass organisations.\\" The further justification was later given that fundamentalist movements were preparing a coup of their own, and had prepared a list of assassination targets in connection with their plans.Michael Collins Dunn, Renaissance or radicalism ? Political islam. The case of Tunisia's al-Nahda, √©d. International Estimate, Washington D.C., 1992 Intelligence head's revelations and prime ministerial denials Fulvio Martini, a former head of the Italian Intelligence Service, gave an interview to the newspaper la Repubblica on 11 October 1997 in which he asserted that Italian Intelligence had played an important role in the removal of Bourgiba. \\"Everything began with the visit of the Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi to Algeria in 1984\\", he explained. \\"The Algerians were nervous about growing instability in Tunisia and were ready to intervene\\" because of the risks the situation presented to their own strategic interests. This meant that the Algerian army was ready to invade the part of Tunisia crossed by the natural-gas pipeline transporting Algerian gas to Sicily. Martini continued: \\"In 1985 Prime Minister Craxi asked me to go to Algeria and establish contact with the security services there ... in order to avert any sudden move by Algeria. That was the start of a lengthy foreign policy operation in which the security services played a central role. In the end the parties agreed that General Ben Ali would be better able to guarantee the stability of Tunisia than Bourguiba.\\" Martini added: \\"We suggested this solution to the Algerians and they discussed it with the Libyans. I went to talk to the French [...but...] the French security chief at that time, Ren√© Imbot reacted with arrogance, and simply stated that we Italians should not become involved, because Tunisia was part of France's imperial legacy\\". The priority was to organise a coup as invisible as possible, and this gave rise to the idea of a \\"medical coup\\". Italy would guarantee to support a Ben Ali takeover, and this choice was also approved by Libya and Algeria. \\"It is true that Italy replaced Bourguiba with Ben Ali\\" Martini agreed after 10 October 1999 when la Repubblica (the newspaper) referred to a report that Martini had revealed before a parliamentary commission on 6 October 1999. On the other hand, Prime Minister Craxi disputed any involvement by the Italian Security Services. Also speaking on 10 October 1999 he addresses the French Press Agency office in Tunis: \\"There was no Italian manoeuvring or interference in the events that carried President Ben Ali to power in 1987\\". The closeness of Craxi's own complicated and long standing relationship with the Tunisian political establishment led at one commentator to prefer his version of events to that of his intelligence chief. Aftermath Ben Ali took control of the ruling Socialist Destourian Party, renamed it and transformed it into the Democratic Constitutional Rally. The promised elections took place in 1989 and were won by the new party. In principal Ben Ali followed similar policies to Bourgiba, positioning himself as the spiritual successor to his superannuated predecessor. He remained in power for 23 years, until 2011, when he was deposed in the Tunisian Revolution.

Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds. Prince Albert, the Duke of York (later King George VI), unveiled the memorial on 25 June 1925, six years after the memorial fund was opened. It consists of a stone cross high on three stone blocks and a stone base, beneath which are two further blocks and two shallow steps. It sits in a memorial garden, with an entrance designed by Lutyens using the remaining funds for the memorial. The memorial itself is a grade II* listed building, having been upgraded when Lutyens' war memorials were designated a \\"national collection\\" in 2015. The piers and gate at the entrance to the garden are listed separately at grade II. Background The Devon County War Memorial, outside Exeter Cathedral, was also designed by Lutyens and was unveiled in 1921. It and the York City memorial are unusual in being iterations of Lutyens' War Cross to stand in a city. In the aftermath of the First World War, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed The Cenotaph in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations; the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing, the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the Stone of Remembrance, which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic memorials. The York City Memorial was the fifteenth and final War Cross designed by Lutyens, all to a broadly similar design. Most were commissioned for villages‚Äîthe Devon County War Memorial in Exeter is the only other example of a War Cross serving as a civic memorial in a city.Skelton, p. 112. Proposals for a war memorial in York were mired in controversy from the outset. A war memorial committee was established after a council meeting in May 1919 and the committee opened a memorial fund for donations in August, but six years elapsed before the City War Memorial was unveiled. The first point of contention was one that arose in many communities when considering a war memorial. Some felt that the war dead should be commemorated through a building with some community purpose rather than a purely decorative monument. Multiple ideas were put forward and the council tasked the war memorial committee with considering several proposals, including a new city hall and a convalescent home. The committee generated several ideas of its own including a new bridge over the River Ouse, homes for war widows, a maternity hospital, and several ideas for an educational institution. A series of public meetings produced still further ideas until a meeting on 14 January 1920, where a consensus was established in favour of a monument rather than any utilitarian proposal.Skelton, p. 59. The committee requested that the city engineer produce a design for a memorial garden with an archway and a cenotaph. The city engineer reported back with a design which he estimated would cost around ¬£7,000 and the war memorial committee appointed Lutyens to oversee the project. Lutyens had recently been commissioned to design a memorial for the North Eastern Railway Company (NER) which was based in York and planned to erect its own memorial in the city dedicated to those of its staff who fought and died in the war. Inception The section of York city walls near Lendal Bridge at approximately the original planned location of the City War Memorial; the North Eastern Railway Company's memorial can be seen in the background to the left. The committee gave Lutyens a budget of ¬£2,000 (1920). The architect visited York on 12 August 1920. Accompanied by the lord mayor and the city engineer, he reviewed nine potential sites for the memorial. His preference was for a former cholera burial ground just outside the city walls, but the committee opted for his second choice of a site inside the walls in the moat by Lendal Bridge, from the proposed location for the NER's memorial. The committee asked Lutyens to submit a formal proposal, which they received eleven weeks later. The design consisted of Lutyens' Stone of Remembrance, complete with its characteristic base of three shallow steps, raised on a large podium taking it off the ground. It was the only design for the Stone of Remembrance to treat it as an object of veneration‚Äîin all of Lutyens' other designs for the stone it functioned as an altar, albeit more symbolic than practical‚Äîand one of the most ambitious of all his war memorial projects. The committee endorsed the proposal on 24 June 1920, after which it was published in the local newspapers as part of a public consultation. It was eventually approved at a further public meeting on 25 November 1920.Skelton, pp. 59‚Äì60.Pevsner, p. 203. Nonetheless, objections were raised after the approval. The York Archaeological Society (YAS) and the Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society (YAYAS) felt that the scheme was not in keeping with the existing architecture in the area, particularly York's ancient city walls, and that it would obstruct views for pedestrians coming into the city from the railway station. Other members of the community, including a local councillor, were concerned that the city's memorial in its proposed location would be overshadowed by the railway company's, given that the NER had granted Lutyens a budget of ¬£20,000‚Äîten times that allocated by the city‚Äîfor which he had proposed a obelisk and large screen wall. Given the proximity to the city walls (Lutyens' initial proposal for the NER abutted the walls) both the city's scheme and the NER's required the consent of the Ancient Monuments Board (later English Heritage and then Historic England). Charles Reed Peers, the board's chief inspector of ancient monuments, attended a meeting at the NER's offices on 8 July 1922 to hear representations for and against both schemes. He requested Lutyens make modification to the NER's memorial, but approved the city's, noting that the proposed site was not part of the walls' rampart and had been created when Lendal Bridge was built in the mid 19th century.Skelton, p. 61. Public opposition to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to apply pressure, calling another public meeting‚Äîwhich it scheduled for 3 May 1923‚Äîforcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between the company and the city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new location‚Äîa War Cross and a Stone of Remembrance‚Äîwhich would have cost almost ¬£2,500. The scheme was scaled back to just the cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the ¬£1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.Skelton, pp. 61‚Äì63. History and design Lutyens designed the piers and gates at the entrance to the war memorial garden with remaining funds raised for the memorial. The memorial was unveiled a year after the North Eastern Railway War Memorial, at a ceremony on 25 June 1925, which was attended by large crowds. Prince Albert, the Duke of York (later King George VI), performed the unveiling and the Archbishop of York Cosmo Gordon Lang gave a dedication. The Duchess of York had earlier that day unveiled the Five Sisters Window in York Minster, dedicated to \\"women of the Empire\\" killed in the First World War. Of Portland stone construction, the memorial is in the form of a high, lozenge-shaped shaft with short, chamfered arms, moulded where they meet the shaft to form a cross. The cross stands on a base of four uneven rectangular blocks, below which is an undercut square platform, which itself stands on two square blocks. At the very bottom are two wide, shallow steps. The largest block of the base bears the only inscription on the memorial: \\"TO THE CITIZENS OF YORK 1914 ‚Äì 1918, 1939 ‚Äì 1945\\" on the south face, and \\"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\\" on the north; the dates of the Second World War were added later. As a memento, a bottle, several coins, and a newspaper were placed inside the structure.Skelton, p. 63. The memorial stands in a war memorial garden on the south bank of the River Ouse; it overlooks the river and the ruins of St Mary's Abbey on the opposite bank.Burnham, pp. 100‚Äì102. When the accounts were reconciled in April 1926, there remained ¬£400 in the memorial fund after Lutyens' fee of ¬£122 and expenses of ¬£20, so the committee commissioned Lutyens to design a set of entrance gates and a pair of supporting piers at the entrance to the memorial garden. The tall, rectangular piers are of limestone construction with cornices and finials in the shape of balls. The gates themselves are iron, painted black and gold, with iron panels linking them to the piers and an overthrow above, in the centre of which is the City of York's coat of arms. The gates open towards the memorial and are aligned with it. To wind up the memorial fund, the committee spent the remaining ¬£17 on three wooden benches for the memorial garden. The York City War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building (a status which offers statutory protection from demolition or modification, applied to structures of \\"special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them\\") on 10 September 1970 and the gates and piers were separately listed at grade II on 24 June 1983. The nearby NER memorial, just the other side of the city walls, was listed at grade II* (defined as \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applied to about 5.5% of listed buildings) on 10 September 1970.

She bears the common title lady of the house. Her husband or parents are not mentioned in her tomb. The burial of Senebtisi was found by an American expedition in 1907 at Lisht as part of the funerary complex belonging to the vizier Senusret.W. C.

The mummified body of Senebtisi was placed in a set of three coffins. There was an outer wooden coffin, inscribed with text, but only badly preserved. There was a middle coffin with only on inscription on gold foil on the lid. The innermost coffin was human shaped but only very badly preserved. Senebtisi was adorned with an array of personal adornments, many of them especially just made for the burial. There are three broad collars, armlets and anklets and several bead necklaces. The body was also adorned with an array of weapons and royal insignia. Around the pelvis she was wearing a royal apron.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 February 2016. Life Jan van Orley was born in Brussels in 1665 and trained with his father Pieter (called Siret), who was a landscape artist and miniaturist. He was the younger brother of Richard van Orley who was a prominent engraver and painter.Jan van Orley at The Netherlands Institute for Art History The van Orley family was a leading artistic dynasty and the profession was passed on from father to son over the centuries. Bernard van Orley (1488-1541) was the most famous scion of the family.Jan van Orley, Madonna and Child at liveauctioneers Resting Diana, from the 'Triumph of the Gods' tapestry series Unlike his brother Richard or his contemporary Victor Honor√© Janssens, Jan van Orley never studied or lived in Italy. Jan is mainly recorded as having worked in Brussels.A-J Wauters, 'Jean van Orley' in the Biographie National Belge, Volume 16, pp. 281‚Äì283 Jan van Orley started his career as a miniaturist. On 13, 14 and 15 August 1695 French troops carried out the first artillery bombardment on a civil population in modern history. This event, known as the Bombardment of Brussels, caused the destruction of a third of the buildings in Brussels, including civil and religious buildings.V√©ronique Van de Kerckhof, 'Le peintre et l'arpenteur: images de Bruxelles et de l'ancien duch√© de Brabant', Renaissance Du Livre, 2000, p. 71 The centre of the city was almost entirely destroyed by fire. After the destruction, Brussels' authorities and institutions commenced rebuilding immediately and places of worship, public buildings and guild halls arose from the ashes. This led to many commissions for artists to replace destroyed artworks. Jan van Orley and Victor Honor√© Janssens were the principal history painters in Brussels who benefited from this situation.Delmarcel 1999, pp. 311‚Äì312 Jan van Orley succeeded in securing commissions for about 30 paintings for the decoration of religious and civic buildings. These included a Crucifixion for the chapel of the Black Nuns and a Christ among the Doctors (St Nicolas Church, Brussels). Another painter who received many commissions to redecorate the Brussels churches was Zeger Jacob van Helmont and some works of van Helmont were earlier misattributed to Jan van Orley.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 974 Adoration des Mages at KIK-IRPA Work =General= Adoration of the shepherds, oil on canvas Jan van Orley was a prolific artist and left an extensive oeuvre in a wide variety of techniques including painting, drawing, printmaking and tapestry design. His principal subjects are history and mythology.Jan van Orley at Royal Library of Belgium, Brussels Van Orley's work marks the transition from the 17th century Baroque style to the classicism of the 18th century. Jan's work was dependent on Flemish Baroque and French academic Classicist painting of the 17th century. In particular, the influence of the work of Peter Paul Rubens, Charles Le Brun and G√©rard de Lairesse are visible in his work.Koenraad Brosens, 'Eighteenth-Century Brussels Tapestry and the Go√ªt Moderne: Philippe de Hondt's Series Contextualized', in: Studies in the Decorative Arts Vol. 14, No. 1 (FALL-WINTER 2006-2007), pp. 53-79 Published by: University of Chicago Press Van Orley also executed a number of portraits of members of the royal families of the Spanish and Austrian regime. =Tapestry design= Jan van Orley is regarded as one of the last important Flemish tapestry designers. In the early 1700s Jan van Orley and Augustin Coppens were the leading team of tapestry designers for the Reydams Leyniers tapestry workshop in Brussels. The two artists often collaborated on tapestry cartoons with Coppens designing the landscapes and Jan van Orley adding the staffage. The pair jointly created a neo-Baroque style for the Brussels workshops. In their works of the early 1700s, van Orley and Coppens developed mythological, romance and genre scenes which gave of a lighter spirit and tone to tapestry designs.Thomas P. Campbell, Pascal-Fran√ßois Bertrand, Jeri Bapasola, 'Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan 2007, p. 487, 488, 504 They contributed to the early 18th century shift of the Brussels workshops towards more playful forms, away from the severe Baroque historical and mythological subjects. This lighter style was referred to as the R√©gence style. This involved a more relaxed narrative in the tapestries and sometimes the loose compilation of associated subjects, chosen according to a client's request. False Micomicon princess imploring Don Quixote, tapestry Jan van Orley and Coppens contributed together on a series on The Triumphs of the Gods for the Leyniers workshop. The two artists were the last to rework the famous Acts of the Apostles cartoons of Raphael. The marquis of Pri√© who was the acting governor of the Austrian Netherlands had brought watercolor copies of seven of the Raphael tapestries from Rome to Brussels. Van Orley and Coppens were commissioned by Urbanus Leyniers to turn the copies into new tapestry cartoons. The first edition of the tapestry series was woven in 1727 for the duke of Norfolk.Delmarcel, 1999, p. 317 Other series on which Jan van Orley worked for the Reydams Leyniers workshop are the 'Story of Don Quixote', \\"Teniers' and the \\"Story of Telemachus II'.Campbell, 2007, p. 452 The cartoons created by van Orley were still used by the Brussels workshops many years after his death as is shown by the fact that the design by van Orley and Coppens for a 'Diana resting' tapestry was still used for a new edition in 1768.Campbell, 2007, p. 488 In later years van Orley worked for other workshops such as the Jasper van der Borcht workshop for which he produced the models for the Life of Christ series realized in 1731.Delmarcel, 1999, p. 322 The set of 8 tapestries together with the cartoons, which were painted in oil on canvas, are now in the St. Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges. The influence of the work of Charles Le Brun is evident in the series. Altogether van Orley and Coppens collaborated on designs for at least 15 tapestry series and these were provided to various workshops such as de Vos, Auwercx, Le Clerc, van den Hecke, Reydams-Leyniers and van der Borcht. Jan also collaborated with his brother Richard on tapestry designs for the local tapestry workshops.Christiaan Schuckman and Dominique Vautier. \\"Orley, van (ii).\\" Grove Art Online.

He has spent most of his creative life in China and has released more than 50 albums. In constant search for new sounds, he was one of the first to use the Zhonguran and Pipa, ancient Chinese instruments, in electro and rock composition and on stage. He was one of the first foreigners to write songs in Chinese and to sing those songs to a Chinese audience in China. He sings in English, French and Chinese. He has also created some of the first electric versions of Chinese instruments Pipa, Guzheng and Zhongruan, he uses these instruments on stage. His extended use of these three electrified classical Chinese instruments in modern music hasn't been matched by any other artists yet in or outside of China and is seen as a pioneering act for these instruments.  Biography  = Early Times = Born in 1980 in Bordeaux, France, Djang San spent his early childhood in South America (1980‚Äì1986, Lima, Peru). In 1987 he went back to Bordeaux and started learning violin. Inspired by the eclectic music records available at his home, he started playing guitar and writing songs with friends in a music band called Soda, which will later become Blue Karma, during high-school. = Encounter with China = Djang San went to Beijing for the first time in year 2000. It is around that time that Djang San met with most of Beijing's underground music bands and artists of the time and got influenced by their music: Wild Children, Second Hand Roses, Buyi, Cold Blooded Animal, Wang Juan, Wan Xiaoli, Brain Failure, Dou Wei, Song Yuzhe etc. In 2001, he decided to stay in Beijing for a year and was playing every Wednesday night at the \\"River bar\\", at the time, one of the center of the Beijing underground music and art. The bar closed in 2003. Travelling frequently in China from 2000 to 2004 (Beijing, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, Taiwan‚Ä¶.), he experimented with all kinds of music including folk, rock, electro. = First albums = Back to France in 2003, he recorded his first album in Chinese, \\"Lotus\\". This album is inspired by a trip with the members of the band Wild Children and Mutuigua band leader Song Yuzhe to Lanzhou city. Together, they climbed the Lotus mountain (Lianhuashan), located in the south of Gansu province in order to listen to the songs of a local ethnic minority. The album includes a remix of the Lianhuashan songs, as well as a tune that Djang San composed with a Xinjiang instrument called Rivapu. In his next albums, \\"Is it China\\" and \\"Naixin\\", Djang San used ancient Chinese poetry and mixed it with music coming from his own imagination. For example, the songs \\"Tianjing Sha Qiu Si\\" (Naixin) and \\"Jianlou house\\" (Is it China) are based on ancient Chinese poems.\\"Tianjing Sha Qiu Si\\" was written during the Yuan dynasty by poet Ma Zhiyuan, \\"Jianlou House\\" corresponds to the poem \\"Lou Shi Ming\\", written during the Tang dynasty by poet Liu Yuxi. Djang San was also one of the first musicians to use ancient Chinese poems in music, the idea being to re-give a life to some poems originally written for music but for which the musical parts have been lost. The idea of the album \\"Is it China\\" was to create a mix between ancient Chinese music and culture and modern Western music by using Chinese music instruments such as Zhongruan or Hulusi (Ëë´Ëä¶‰∏ù) as well as traditional rock instruments such as guitar, bass, and drums. On that album (and for most songs he wrote), Djang San has recorded all the instruments himself. On some of the songs, singer Liu Hong joined him. Djang San was probably the first foreigner in China to write songs using a Zhongruan The next album, \\"Naixin\\" , more acoustic, was mainly a series of songs composed on guitar and zhongruan. The album followed the same idea as \\"Is it China\\", with stronger influence from Blues and Electro music. In 2006, artist Chen Zhuo asked him to write music for her sculptures exhibition \\"Born in the 80's\\" which took place in Tianjin the same year. These music recordings will lead to the release of the EP \\"R√™ves d'enfance\\". = Back to China = In 2006, as he came back to live in Beijing, Djang San met with Ghanaian percussionist Sunny Dee and Benny Oyama, young American guitar player from New York. Together they created \\"The Incredible JSB!\\", in order to create a mix of musical styles ranging from Jazz to Rock, Bossa Nova, Reggae, and Chinese Folk. Between 2006 and 2010, the band released one studio album \\"Mad in China\\" and two live albums. Under the influence of Benny Oyama, Djang San started studying jazz standards and music theory in harmony. In 2009, Benny Oyama went back to New York and \\"The Incredible JSB!\\" adventure ended. In search of new ways to go back to his rock and roll music roots, Djang San formed a new band, \\"The Amazing Insurance Salesmen\\" (AIS) and started playing some of his old rock songs with the band. In 2010, \\"The Amazing Insurance Salesmen\\" won the \\"Global Battle of the Bands (GBOB)\\" in Beijing and Hong Kong against 84 other bands. The band participated in 2011 to the world final of the GBOB where 18 countries competed, but didn't win. Still in 2010, while writing songs and developing the sound of The AIS, Djang San recorded a new album \\"Mandarin(e) Jazz\\". The album is a mix of jazz, world music, rock and experimental music. In this album, Djang San recorded two jazz standards, \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Take the A Train\\" using the Zhongruan, a Chinese folk instrument used in Chinese opera. It is the first time that instrument is ever used in that way, using the technique of the walking bass onto it. A live album would follow, \\"Live in Jiangsu\\", recorded with his old friend Mathieu Wahiche on solo guitar. The same year, Djang San released an EP, \\"Uranus\\", which gathered a few songs recorded between 2006 and 2011. = Djang San = Djang San and Band on air CCTV3 2015.jpg In 2011, after touring with The AIS, Djang San decided to change his name to Djang San (he was using Zhang Si'an before), and started experimenting with electronic equipment, samplers and keyboards. Between July 2011 and January 2012, Djang San recorded three live performances in Beijing and released them under the name \\"One man live orchestra Volume 1 to 3\\". This was a new path for Djang San at the time, who now can play three different sets of music, one experimental, one folk, one electronic, sometimes mixing the different ideas all at once Dang San, as solo performer is playing several instruments including guitar, zhongruan, hulusi (flute), keyboard, drum machine during his sets. In 2013, Djang San created \\"Djang San + Band\\" around Djang San's own electrified version of the Zhongruan. By doing so, Djang San created a new present and future for this forgotten instrument and gave it a new sound and a new direction with albums such as \\"Tofu √©lectrique\\" and \\"Bridges\\". In 2014, Djang San creates the electric pipa and starts recording albums with it, the first to be recorded is \\"Experimental Electric Pipa\\", most of his albums since this one all include one or more electric pipa tracks. From 2015 the band becomes more international with tours in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and across Mainland China. The band also starts participating in more and more festivals such as the Strawberry, Zandari Festa, Seoul Music Week, Hokkaido WMDF, Tiger Ramble Outdoors Music Festival in Taiwan, the Zhujiajiao World Music Festival, the Shanghai WMF etc. He continues recording as a band and solo with albums such as \\"What You Want', \\"The fog in our hearts\\", \\"Eye\\" and many more, releasing an average of 4 albums a year In 2018, Djang San releases \\"Tofu Electrique\\" in Japanon CD to Tower Record stores and tours the country to promote the CD. In 2019, Djang San creates a sequel to \\"The Amazing Insurance Salesmen\\" under the name \\"Bob Dupont & The Outstanding Vegan Bankers\\" as a sarcastic reminder of the original band name and releases \\"Dolphin Sandwich\\". In 2019 Djang San is invited to tour Ta√Øwan and creates music with kids of minorities living in the poverty stricken areas around Hualien. Djang San also composed and recorded music for films and has, so far, recorded more than 50 albums. He plays in numerous concerts and festivals around China and Asia. He has been interviewed countless times and had documentaries done about him on Chinese TVhttp://ent.cntv.cn/2015/11/25/ARTI1448413692259668.shtml and Radio stations. He is regularly interviewed about the Chinese music scene by Western Newspapers and magazines (\\"Liberation\\" \\"L'Express\\"http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/fete-de-la-musique-a-pekin- du-rock-dans-la-chine-pop_1273374.html etc.). = A Theory of Intelligence and other projects = A theory of intelligence Djang San theory graphic In 2014 Djang San released an album called \\"A theory of intelligence\\" in an effort to express an idea he drew on his phone while on a night train from Beijing to Kunming. The album is based on a graphic describing Djang San's theory, the music is made to accompany the theory. As a musical experimenter Djang San doesn't stop developing ideas and experimenting with music styles and musical concepts. His ability to experiment is clearly seen in albums such as \\"8 Bit Boy\\", an album trying to recreate an 80's NES game that never existed, \\"Elevator Music for Shampoo Commercials\\", an album using 1950's commercials as a background for a critic of consumption society, \\"Mini Symphony in Smog Major\\", a reflection on Beijing smog through classical music, \\"Beijing Frogs of the Night\\", a collaboration with bassist Clancy Lethbridge using field recordings, \\"Cigarettes, Bricks, Dust, Alcohol\\", an album about loneliness in Beijing during the destruction and bricking of the city's popular hutong areas, \\"The Goat who Fell from Earth\\", the story of a goat drifting through space and fighting interstellar injustice, a story created by Djang San, 2400 Meters High Improvised Music Session - 2400 Á±≥È´òÂç≥ÂÖ¥Èü≥‰πêÂΩïÈü≥, an album improvised in one afternoon in a studio in Lijiang, Yunnan with Djang San playing all instruments except for keyboard played by David Bond. As a multi- instrumentalist, Djang San plays most instruments on his albums as he can play guitar, zhongruan, pipa, hulusi, bass, drums, a little bit of keyboard, and a variety of other instruments. = The Beijing Underground = In 2013 Djang San creates the Beijing Underground group on Facebook in order to give more exposure to the Chinese underground music scene. The group quickly becomes the biggest group on Facebook for underground music in China with more than 20 000 members. With the success of the Facebook group Djang San quickly creates a website dedicated to interviews of the Chinese and Asian underground artists and to concerts, showcases and festivals he organizes in Beijing under the Beijing Underground Banner.

It was set up as an alternative to Disney, attempting to rival films such as Mickey Mouse, while spreading the Nazi ideology and propaganda through a less aggressive entertainment source. Hitler, Goebbels and other Nazi Party members watching filming in 1935  Creation  Goebbels wrote in his diary in 1934, \\"Film is one of the most modern and far-reaching media that there is for influencing the masses.\\" This opinion led to film being used as one of the main mediums of propaganda, with the view that the Ufa needed to be expanded to utilize film for the best political gain. Goebbels believed, unlike Hitler, that art and propaganda should intermingle; leading to the creation of the Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme GmbH, with the hope that entertainment could be used to carry a political message. Goebbels entrusted the creation of the company to Cautio Treuhand as he provided a large amount of investment, meaning there was little economic worry for the organisation. He provided monthly subsidies until June 1942, when the Ufa took over the funding. The politics of the DZF were entrusted to Oberregierungsrat Neumann who had no prior experience with animation and Dr Werner Kruse was hired as technical head, who had applied merely to avoid being drafted. Although the motives and experience of some members were questionable, due to the fact they were able to avoid military service, it has to be said that the DZF was a large operation, starting in 1941 with 6 studios, 5 chief animators, 6 female animators, 1 head of colour, 12 colourists and 14 female tracers and ending in May 1944 with 94 employees and 151 trainees.  Early years  Neumann had the vision of concentrating all animation activity under one roof. This however was not agreeable with all Nazi ministers, who were sceptical this could be achieved. Neumann addressed these concerns in a letter, containing five and nine year plans of expansion and growth. In addition, he trapped employees in a contract which made them unable to quit, making sure the best animators in Germany worked for the DZF. The pay scale can also be viewed as a reason for the attraction to the profession, as working for the DZF could generate 50-100% more income than working in the same job at another company. This is represented by how colourists at the DZF earned between 200-250 RM, but working for the Ufa- Werbefilm would only earn 120-200 RM, clearly showing how important the Nazis thought the DZF was to the war effort and Nazi regime. It also meant they could attract the best animators, with the hope to fulfil their goal of creating 19 short animations by 1947 and having the first full-length film in cinemas by 1950. The early years of the DZF also became entangled with anti- Semitic policy. The Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazis in 1935 were not only aimed at restricting the Jewish rights and property, but also marriages between Jews and Aryans. The laws argued that any German who married a Jew was inferior and any children they bore should be treated no better than the Jews. This policy became relevant when it was found that Dr Werner Kruse had a Jewish spouse in 1942. Although he was categorised as having a 'privileged mixed-marriage' and Jews married to Aryans were not deported until 1944, this was still a tarnish to his name which the Nazis felt the need to distance themselves from. He was removed from the DZF, but continued to work for the Ufa, which demonstrates how important animators were to the regime, propaganda and the war effort. In addition to this, Kruse was able to keep his wife safe from arrest and deportation as the war progressed, further cementing the views that not only were the animators important, but that they were also powerful in the regime, due to the Nazis need for animated propaganda.  Animations  Animated folk tales, such as Armer Hansi, stood at the forefront of the Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme GmbH, with the aim of glorifying peasant life. Goebbels tried to exemplify this as a German virtue, as well as promoting literature by Adolf Bartels, who presented peasant life as bedrock culture for German community. This shows peasant life was a prominent theme in Nazi culture, linking closely to the trope of the Volksgemeinschaft and clearly demonstrating why this theme is so important in DZF animations. After Kruse was expelled from the DZF in 1942, Frank Leberecht took over the technical control of the film. Leberecht summoned a group of newspaper cartoon artists to discuss possible gags for animations. From this circle several scripts were submitted, for example, Dr. Ernst Keienburg submitted the story of a dog who wanted to be a seal. Most of the submitted ideas followed the same lines of an animal who wanted to be something else, but would then realise their true form was the best for them. This idea of sticking to the ‚Äòstatus-quo‚Äô fits in with the Nazi ideology, but the standards that the DZF held, meant that often these scripts were bought for their rights then never made or rejected altogether. The first and only short animation film produced by the DZF was Armer Hansi released in 1943. After the idea was submitted by Hermann Krause in October 1941, work was set on modifying the plot to fit the Nazi ideology perfectly. Armer Hansi clearly shows that it is better to stay at home as he grows bored of the freedom he gained and returns to his cage. It also demonstrates dangers in the wild, representing the hazards throughout Europe, furthering the message that Germans should stay in Germany. This, like other Nazi propaganda, reinforces the idea that German's should not try and strive for adventure and individual pursuits, but to sacrifice and put their efforts to furthering the Volksgemineschaft. Armer Hansi is said to be the closest to Disney quality the Nazis achieved, this was a main aim of Goebbels and the propaganda ministry. However he was still not happy with the quality, as seen in his diaries, ‚ÄòThe first character of film, which is presented to me from his production, still shows a lot of weaknesses, but he is still a good start‚Äô. The DZF believed that it would be able to catch up to Disney despite its 20-year lead. This has been widely debated, and through the statement Goebbels made about Armer Hansi, he clearly believed that the DZF had the ability. Work did start on a second animation, Schnuff der Nieser, starring puppies, however this was completed after the war by DEFA, the East German state film studio, due to the DZF‚Äôs fall in 1944.  Propaganda  The use of animal imagery was prominent in all Nazi animation films, both those produced by Hans Fischerkoesen and the DZF. Using animal imagery was the case for many animated films of the period, such as Walt Disney's Snow White, showing that the Nazi's wanted to use popular culture and aspects of animation that they knew would draw crowds to the cinemas. This was due to the need to entertain people in order for the propaganda to be effective, it meant citizens could enjoy film as an entertainment piece, rather than a political propaganda medium, which allowed the Nazis message to be seen by a wider audience. By intertwining entertainment with political messages, it kept the public returning to view subsequent propaganda films. However, it has to be said that the majority of the tropes used within the DZF animations, such as anti-Semitism, were already firmly in place prior to the Nazis seizure of power. This can therefore explain why their animations were so successful with the public, as propaganda was meant more to reinforce existing values, rather than to convert the population to a new way of thinking. Richard Taylor argues that the Nazis inherited a passive population, which is why their propaganda was so successful. Applying this hypothesis would have meant that values were very easy to reinforce and that the Nazis could rely on entertainment value to carry their messages, compared to the more aggressive nature of the propaganda made by the Soviets. The development of Nazi policy towards propaganda in Germany impacted the animation industry greatly. The years 1933-37 saw the co- ordination and consolidation of the industry, with Goebbels starting the nationalization process by 1937. This meant that all production, development and screening came under direct control of the Nazi party. Nationalization led many international film companies to stop distributing films in Germany, causing artists who were excluded from the Volksgemineschaft, mainly those with a Jewish background or left-wing political views to leave the country. The depletion of non-Aryans and political opponents from the film industry meant films became more \\"parochial and nationalistic\\". This relates directly to the DZF and the idealistic animations that were produced. Animations reiterated values of old Prussia and emphasised the Volk focusing clearly on the Nazi ideology.  A rival to Disney  It is undisputed that Hitler was a fan of Disney. Goebbels‚Äôs wrote in his diaries on 22 December 1937, \\"I give the leader 12 Mickey Mouse films for Christmas‚Ä¶ He is very excited and quite happy about this treasure.\\" The DZF were determined to rival Disney, due to the high quality and clear entertainment value of the films that gripped the population. This rivalry can be explored through the development of effects by the animation film industry in Nazi Germany. Goebbels mandated several new effects to be developed and studied, one of which was \\"three-dimensional\\" effects that can be considered to compete with Max Fleischer's Stereo-optical process or Disney‚Äôs multiplane camera. This development of techniques was a clear attempt to rival Disney and solidify Germany as one of the most advanced nations, demonstrating German superiority to not only the German population but the world. The trope of superiority and development has been evident in other propaganda, including their work programmes such as the autobahns. By continuing to advance their technology, and push their superiority through propaganda, the Nazis managed to rival the main animation distributor, whether they were even within reach of Disney's standards is something that is still debated today. Although the DZF spent time trying to rival Disney in terms of effects and techniques, it can be questioned as to whether they were successful. Claudio Ravenstein argued that the similarities were shocking; not only due to the copied techniques, but in that Goebbels was extremely impressed with Walt Disney propaganda. However, on a business level, historians, such as Ralf Forster and Jeanpaul Goergen have stated that the company was so inefficient that it is unable to redeem claims that it was even a remote rival to Disney. Although this is accurate due to the lack of profit and erratic spending by the DZF, it has to be questioned as to whether this meant they failed, seen as their main purpose was to deliver propaganda, which they did to a high standard. As this the issue of rivalry has been widely debated in academia, it shows the importance of the topic as it was of contemporary importance to the Nazis during this period and gives the modern day audience an insight into the aims of the Goebbels and the DZF.  Fall  As the Germans conquered more territory they hired talent from European countries, including France, where they recruited Robert Salvagnac, who had already been offered a job at Disney. Goebbels wrote ‚ÄòExceptional talent in French film must be hired by us as soon as possible‚Äô, showing that the art of their propaganda was so important they were willing to hire non-Germans from occupied countries. Nevertheless, as the war progressed, and due to the large amount of able bodied workers at the DZF, employees needed to be drafted and were no longer seen as \\"indispensable\\", indicating that animation propaganda took a back seat. The DZF liquidated in July 1944, with payments from the Ufa stopping in the September and all employees were sent to work in armaments factories. After the fall of the Third Reich in 1945 all remaining film from the DZF was confiscated by Soviet forces and remained in their possession until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The school has a Catholic ethos and falls under the Trusteeship of Catholic Education an Irish Schools Trust. Academic The school operates Junior Certificate, Transition Year, Leaving Certificate Applied, the L.C.V.P. programme, also called Link Modules and Leaving Certificate courses. The school has a number of non academic activities for the students. History Isabella McLoughlin and Catherine Meighan trained in Cove Lane in Cork City with the Presentation Sisters which had been founded by Nano Nagle. Isabella became Sr. M. Joseph McLoughlin, aged 23 and Catherine became Sr M. de Sales Meighan in June 1800. The two young women were from St. Mary's Parish Kilkenny city. The Bishop of Ossory, Dr. James Lanigan wanted to bring the kind of caring for the sick and education of the poor to come to Kilkenny and he arranged for the religious sisters to come to the city in September 1800. With the permission given by Bishop Hamilton of the Church of Ireland they were able to open a convent and school in Kilkenny a month later. Permission was needed due to the continued Penal Laws. The nuns were noted for having worn their habits as soon as they took over the building. The school started as a primary school with sixty girls within a month of the arrival of the nuns. This school was housed within the convent which was possible through the donation of Mr. James Murphy of Dublin. The school also provided some education for adults in the evenings Expansion needs meant that new buildings were added in 1817 on Chapel lane. After the 1930s the convent added the post primary school to the campus. The continued growth of the secondary school through the 20th century combined with the open nature of the old buildings on the James's St. campus which were being used for the secondary school lead to the purchase and building of a new school in Loughboy which was opened in November 1985. The convent and buildings in James St. and Chapel Lane were knocked down in order to make way for the Market Cross shopping centre. In 2016 the school choir appeared on the TV show Britain's Got Talent. 57 students and the choir director got through the open auditions to appear in front of the judges where they got four Yes votes. They advanced to the live semi finals.

Donnelly Science Center  Donnelly Science Center The Donnelly Science Center was one of his most well- known designs. The site for the building was green space, which prompted debate about whether anything should be built there. But Browne, and then Loyola College, agreed on the plans and the Building was constructed in 1978. The science center started construction in spring of 1978 and was completed by the fall of 1978. The $3.9 million building was dedicated on December 3, 1978, and named after Edward J. Donnelly, the largest private donor. The 60,000 square foot building included 25 laboratories, 5 classrooms, offices, and computer facilities. The four story building, with three floors above the grade was built on the corner of North Charles Street and Cold Spring Lane.http://search.proquest.com/docview/542067335/ Although the college was excited for the new science center, there was concern about the destruction of the green space and trees on campus. According to Browne, the construction of the center \\"would not require the cutting of more than a half-dozen of the graceful, mature trees that dot the corner‚Äôs hillside.\\"http://search.proquest.com/docview/541186137/ Another concern from the Loyola College community was the want for a formal entrance.

History The Burnaby Lake Aquatic Club (BLAC) was founded in 1966. In 1989, the club changed its name to the Burnaby Lake Rowing Club (BLRC). The club has helped produce many world- class rowers. For the list of Burnaby Lake Rowers at the Olympics, see below. ;Early Years In 1966, rowers Max Wieczorek, Daryl Sturdy, Roger Jackson and Robert Stubbs decided to train at Burnaby Lake. They lacked a coach, equipment and facilities. They approached Lawrence West who agreed to coach them. The crew loaned a coxed four rowing shell from the Lake Washington Rowing Club in Seattle, US, as well as four oars from the Shawnigan Lake School (SLS) in Vancouver Island. In addition, SLS's coxswain Billy Wheaton came from the city of Victoria to train with the crew during the summer. The Burnaby Lake Boosters AssociationThe Burnaby Lake Boosters Association (BLBA) was incorporated in 1936 under the BC Societies Act with an aim to create a recreational area around the lake for water sports, nature trails and bird watching, as well as to improve the quality of the lake. enlisted the Reeve (Mayor) of Burnaby, Allan Emmott to be part of the group to support the oarsmen under the name Burnaby Lake Aquatic Club. Through the generosity of the Municipality, the club was able to operate out of an abandoned house at the bottom of Piper Avenue. The Vancouver Sun newspaper published an article about the crew: \\"Oar deep in lily pads, the crew of the Burnaby Lake Aquatic Club starts looking into open water. That's 18-year-old coxswain Bill Wheaton looking forlornly over his shoulder as Daryl Sturdy, Max Wieczorek, Roger Jackson and Bob Stubbs heave to in an effort to escape the green jungle.\\" Ken Oakes, a Vancouver Sun photographer, took a picture of the crew out in the lily pads. The photo and story were featured in newspapers across the country, in the magazines Life and Paris Match. In 1968, Daryl Sturdy and Robert Stubbs rowed in the 2x for Canada at the Mexico City Olympics. Both of them personally contributed $500.00 to be on the team to Mexico while the rowers from eastern Canada didn't have to. Harry Jerome suggested setting up a provincial association to get a more equitable distribution of funds forthcoming from the province. After the Olympics, the British Columbia Rowing Association (BCRA) was founded in 1969. The Burnaby Lake rowing course was dredged in 1971-1972, in preparation for the 1973 Canada Summer Games. In 1973, Rowing Canada Aviron (RCA) established the first national training centre at Burnaby Lake. At that time, the organization was called the Canadian Association of Amateur Oarsmen (CAAO). Alan Roaf was the RCA's first professional coach. Initially, Allan was the only national coach at the lake. As the buildup to the Montreal Olympics in 1976 continued, more male rowers were training at the lake. Then the female rowers under Lawrence West emerged. The Canadian national rowing team transitioned from a club to a composite crew development program conceived by Martin Bielz, who was the Technical Director of the RCA at that time. Burnaby Lake was the center of this transition. After the Montreal Olympics, in the 1977-78 season, Patrick Sweeney joined the Burnaby Lake club to coach the women. ;Later Years Robert Stubbs invited Richard (Dick) McClure to join the club in 1976. Initially, Dick engaged in boat maintenance and fundraising. In 1978, Dick started coaching junior rowers. From 1980 to 2010, he was the club's volunteer head coach. During his tenure, 58 Burnaby Lake rowers become members of the Canadian national rowing team. Over the years, the lake deteriorated as a result of natural infilling and sedimentation. The rowing course was dredged again in 2010-2012 to rejuvenate the lake's precious open-water quality. The club works closely with Rowing Canada and BC Rowing, and continues to run programs for all levels of rowing and has strong Novice, Junior, Senior and Masters programs. Facilities The club uses a 2,000 metre long water course along Burnaby Lake. The course has an east-west orientation. For regattas, the course is buoyed with a six-lane albano system. The course is one of three FISA standard courses in Canada. It provides ideal racing conditions with calm waters and minimal wind. Membership The club's membership includes around 90 members. ;Lifetime Membership The club bestows a Life membership to an individual who has given an outstanding contribution to the sport of rowing.

After Howard leaves, Chuck returns to his piano, turns on the metronome, and stares at it silently. =Main story= Before a meeting between Hamlin Hamlin & McGill and D&M;, Kim rearranges the seating so that she and Jimmy sit side by side. On a break, they share a cigarette and a kiss, and she gives him a travel mug that originally read \\"World's Best Lawyer\\" but which she has altered to read \\"World's 2nd Best Lawyer\\". They agree to meet later that night. At the nail salon Jimmy receives his new company car, a Mercedes-Benz, and is frustrated that his new mug does not fit in the cup holder like it did in his old car. At the courthouse, Mike is surprised to see Daniel Wormald (\\"Pryce\\") arrive in his Hummer. As Daniel tells Mike about the burglary at his house, Mike cautions him about talking to the police. Daniel is adamant about getting his baseball cards back and disregards Mike's advice. In order to prevent Daniel from implicating him in Daniel's drug deals, Mike offers to find the cards. He tracks down Nacho at his father's upholstery shop and asks for the cards. Nacho brushes him off, so Mike threatens to inform Tuco about Nacho's secret drug deals. Nacho agrees to bargain, and they make a deal for Daniel to trade his Hummer to Nacho in return for the baseball cards and $10,000. Chuck sits in during a meeting between HHM and D&M.; Jimmy is hesitant to continue but with silent encouragement from Kim he discusses the Sandpiper clients. Mike phones Jimmy and asks him to represent Daniel, whom the police want to interview. Daniel tells the detectives that he has retrieved his baseball cards so there's no need for further investigation, but the detectives are skeptical. Jimmy talks to them privately and fabricates a story about a failed gay love affair and the stealing of the baseball cards as revenge. To provide an explanation for Daniel's hiding place, Jimmy claims it contained videos of Daniel sitting on various types of pies and crying, a fictitious fetish supposedly called \\"Hoboken squat cobbler\\" which he describes in great detail. The detectives eventually believe him and let Daniel go. That night, Jimmy tells Kim about Daniel's case, including fabricating a video to \\"prove\\" the reason Daniel had a hiding place behind his couch. Kim is appalled that Jimmy has resorted to such an underhanded and unlawful scheme, which could jeopardize his career. Jimmy counters by asking why she was willing to play along with conning Ken. She retorts that it had nothing to do with work. She asks him why he was willing to falsify evidence to exonerate a client, and when Jimmy cannot provide a satisfactory answer Kim says, \\"I can't hear about this sort of thing ever again\\" to which Jimmy responds, \\"You won't\\". Production Bob Odenkirk was said to have inspired the name of the episode and the fetish portrayed in the police interrogation room scene. Peter Gould said \\"There weren't as many names. In fact, I don't know that we named it at all. I think (Jimmy) just said, 'He sits in pies.' He pitched the idea: 'Sex acts all have a name. Shouldn't there be a name for this thing?'\\" \\"On this show, he mostly is a performer, but every once in a while, you see that he really is one of the great comic minds of our time. That was an example of Bob giving us a direction that we ran with, and then he ran with it in performance. And I just love it. I have to say, that was an interesting evolution of that scene. I'm really proud of it.\\" Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode received 2.23 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.0.

It holds a 100% positive rating with an average score of 8.47 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \\"With sharp dialogue and a seamlessly developing plot, \\"Cobbler\\" steers its central character ever closer to the horribly compelling tumble from greatness Better Call Saul is building toward.\\" Terri Schwartz of IGN gave the episode an 8.8 rating, noting that the episode \\"made excellent use of Bob Odenkirk's humor, delivering some of the funniest moments of the series\\". The Telegraph noted how \\"amid the chuckles were intimations of darker days ahead\\". Donna Bowman of The A.V.

Nicholas Parco of The New York Daily News said of the police scene and the episode as a whole that \\"Sure, McGill [...] is nowhere near the Goodman that Breaking Bad fans fell in love with, but in the final scene of the aptly titled ‚ÄúCobbler,‚Äù the evolution shines through more than ever. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the scene \\"the funniest Breaking Bad universe moment since Jesse thought Walt was going to build a robot, and the show sending a reassuring message that it will do just fine whenever the switch in Jimmy's office flips permanently to the Saul position.\\" David Segal of The New York Times called the scene \\"my favorite scene of this very young season. I particularly loved the notion that as convincing as Jimmy was, the cops apparently ended the interview less than fully persuaded that a lover‚Äôs spat, and the aforementioned fetish, explained the home robbery of Daniel Wormald, the world‚Äôs most irritating na√Øf.\\" Jonathan Banks's role as Mike was received positively by critics as well. Sean T. Collins of The New York Observer said \\"Mike‚Äôs material is strong even by his own standards. His dynamic with Daniel Wormald [...] is exasperatingly entertaining enough to come with the Curb Your Enthusiasm soundtrack. [...] And it‚Äôs worth pointing out that in deciding to help reclaim the cards only after Dan reveals some of them belonged to his dad, we catch a glimpse of the tragic father-and-son backstory we learned about Mike in Season One‚Äôs strongest episode.\\" References External links *\\"Cobbler\\" at AMC * Category:Better Call Saul (season 2) episodes ","title":"Cobbler (Better Call Saul)"},{"id":"49364097","text":"\\"Amarillo\\" is the third episode of the second season of the AMC television series Better Call Saul, the spinoff series of Breaking Bad. The episode aired on February 29, 2016 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. Plot =Opening= In Amarillo, Texas, Jimmy bribes a Sandpiper bus driver to have his bus \\"break down,\\" allowing him to sign up new residents as plaintiffs for the lawsuit while ostensibly complying with bar association rules against soliciting clients. =Main story= On returning to Albuquerque, Jimmy presents his client outreach report at a joint Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill-Davis & Main strategy conference, proudly announcing he's obtained twenty-four more clients. Chuck expresses suspicion about the legality of Jimmy's methods, pointing out only one response to the law firms' mailed notices to prospective clients, and wondering if Jimmy has engaged in illegal solicitation. Jimmy explains that retirement homes are tight knit communities and information spreads fast by word of mouth, which satisfies everyone but Kim. Kim is wary and warns Jimmy to keep his methods legitimate, since she recommended him to D&M; and his actions will reflect on her reputation. Jimmy tries to use the standard mailing of legal notices to prospective Sandpiper clients, but with little success, due to the elderly recipients either ignoring the letters or Sandpiper intercepting their mail. Jimmy suggests filming a targeted television ad, since the Sandpiper residents set aside one hour of free time to watch television. Cliff Main is intrigued by Jimmy's idea and promises to talk to him more about it when he returns from a week-long business trip. Jimmy views Davis & Main's previous television ad (for a mesothelioma class action lawsuit), but finds it dull and lacking \\"showmanship.\\" Jimmy independently films his own TV commercial, hiring the camera crew he previously used for the billboard stunt. He contacts the sales department of KKTV in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a market that showed zero responses from the Sandpiper legal notice mailings, and arranged for the commercial to be run in that market as an \\"experiment\\". The ad depicts one of his elderly clients as a poor old woman being victimized by Sandpiper Crossing and the ad closes by urging residents to call D&M.; Kim is impressed with Jimmy's work, and Jimmy decides to run the ad without the firm's approval. It is a massive success, with D&M; gaining over a hundred clients in a single day. However, Cliff is furious that Jimmy released the ad without consulting him or the partners first and demands an explanation from him. Jimmy then lies to Kim about the setback. Stacey voices concerns to Mike about gunshots she has heard in her neighborhood over the past two nights, and says the police have done nothing about them. Mike does overnight surveillance without Stacey's knowledge and finds that the \\"gunshots\\" were apparently the sound of newspaper deliveries hitting the sidewalk. Stacey calls Mike the following morning, and says there were three more gunshots the night before. Mike visits Stacey's house and she points out a chip in an outside wall that she insists is from a bullet. Despite knowing that there were no gunshots, Mike tells Stacey what she wants to hear ‚Äì that he will help her get out of the neighborhood. Dr. Caldera offers Mike a lucrative job as an enforcer for a loan shark, which pays better than bodyguard jobs. Mike declines, as he is not interested in performing any more illegal work, especially work that requires him to hurt or kill others. Caldera points out that if Mike wants \\"next level pay\\", he must be willing to do \\"next level work.\\" Mike later receives a call from Caldera, who tells him about a job offer with a client who specifically requested Mike. Mike meets the client, who is revealed to be Nacho, and they discuss what seems like a \\"hit\\" on some \\"guy\\".

Club gave the episode an A- rating, writing, \\"as season 2 hits its stride, Gilligan and Gould are doubling down on their radical narrative strategy of simplicity. Characters pause before they make decisions. The small and finite set of contexts and causes impinging on them is clearly delineated. Consequences proceed directly from actions.

Lot and his daughters, 1544. \\"Godless painters\\" is a term used by art historians to refer to Sebald Beham, his brother Barthel, and George Pencz, as exemplified in the title of a 2011 catalog of the Beham brothers' works, The Godless Painters of Nuremberg: Convention and Subversion in the Printmaking of the Beham Brothers.Die gottlosen Maler von N√ºrnberg: Konvention und Subversion in der Druckgrafik der Beham-Br√ºder, edited by J√ºrgen M√ºller and Thomas Schauerte. See book review. The epithet was coined in derision of the three painters during an inquest conducted by the Lutheran dominated city council of Nuremberg in 1525, which concerned the artists' protestant heterodoxy. The term is a double entendre eluding more to the content of the \\"godless painters\\" works, rather than the doctrinal views for which they were condemned. The typically small-scale prints often depicted biblical or moral themes with a touch of eroticism. The \\"godless painters\\" are also considered to be leading representatives of the group of little masters.Barthel Beham, Vanity, 1540, Hamburger Kunsthalle. The inquest consisted of numerous interrogations concerning matters of baptism, the Eucharist, and the role of secular authorities. Imprisonment and torture were threatened, but ultimately the three were condemned to short-term exile from the city.Alison G. Stewart, The Artist's Lament in 1528. Exile, Printing, and the Reformation, 2015Alison G. Stewart, Sebald Beham: Entrepreneur, Printmaker, Painter, 2012 The inquiries took place during the German Peasants' War, which involved theological controversies between Martin Luther and Thomas M√ºntzer on the matters at issues in the inquest into the beliefs of the painters. Historical accounts regarding the painters have often been cursory, and sometimes confused due to the lack of availability of primary sources. The aforementioned catalog, The Godless Painters of Nuremberg, promises to correct this deficit.

Based in London and owned by Wireless Group, it is the sister station of national stations talkSPORT (itself originally known as Talk Radio UK), TalkSport 2, Virgin Radio UK and Times Radio. History The original Talk Radio started in February 1995 using the AM wavelengths previously occupied by BBC Radio 1 (1053/1089 kHz). It saw a number of different presenters host shows in its first two years but settled down to a regular schedule with presenters such as Scott Chisholm, Anna Raeburn, Tommy Boyd and Mike Dickin. It failed to make sufficient revenue and in the late 1990s introduced sports output which increased. In 2000 the station changed its name to Talksport and almost all programming was of a sporting nature other than overnights and the mid-morning show. In March 2012, this 39-hour block of non-sporting content was axed from the station. The introduction of a new DAB multiplex enabled talkRADIO to be relaunched on DAB on 21 March 2016. At launch, the station featured presenters Paul Ross, Julia Hartley-Brewer, Sam Delaney, Jon Holmes, Jonny Gould, and Iain Lee across its weekday schedule. At weekends, the station features Alexis Conran, Eamonn Holmes, Bob Mills, Martin Roberts, Penny Smith, Jerry Springer, Anna Williamson, and Jake Yapp. The station offers news bulletins every hour. News bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried at weekends. Overnight programming was originally simulcast from talkSPORT until January 2018. In January 2018, talkRADIO underwent a revamp to the weekday and weekend schedule in a bid to boost ratings and make the station more news-focused. In June 2020, talkRADIO announced that it would be moving from DAB to DAB+. The DAB+ signal began transmitting on 9 June alongside the DAB signal. The DAB signal ceased transmission on 26 June. Controversies Presenter James Whale was suspended over a 30 July 2018 interview with an alleged sex assault victim that was said by the station to have ‚Äúcompletely lacked sensitivity‚Äù. He was given a week‚Äôs suspension and his show returned soon afterwards, on 13 August. He apologised to the alleged victim. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom ruled in 2019 that two episodes of former MP George Galloway's show breached impartiality rules due to the lack of dissenting views to Galloway's own on the subjects of Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party and the Salisbury poisoning. In June 2019, Galloway was sacked by the station for a tweet in which he praised Liverpool F.C. for winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final instead of Tottenham Hotspur, a team with strong links to the Jewish community; he wrote \\"No #Isra√´l [sic] flags on the Cup!\\" Tottenham Hotspur and Jewish organisations condemned Galloway's comment.

Their remains were discovered in July 1979 approximately 80 miles north of Forestville, concealed within duct-taped garbage bags and buried within an embankment of a heavily overgrown woodland area located beside a remote section of Highway 20, 12 miles from the city of Willits. Due to the advanced state of decomposition of the girls' remains, the specific cause of death of each victim has never been established, although both girls' deaths have always been considered to be a homicide. Furthermore, Graham's body was mistakenly identified as that of a male until genetic testing proved otherwise. The bodies of Kerry Graham and Francine Trimble would remain unidentified until November 2015, when their identities were confirmed via the use of DNA profiling. The case itself remains one of the oldest cold cases within Mendocino County. Disappearances Graham and Trimble both resided in Forestville, California. The two girls were next-door neighbors and inseparable friends, having known one another since they had become acquainted while attending elementary school. On December 16, 1978, the two girls left their homes, reportedly to visit the Coddingtown Mall in Santa Rosa, with Graham having informed her mother of her intentions to shop for Christmas gifts prior to leaving her household. Neither family ever heard from their daughter again. Within 24 hours of her disappearance, Trimble's mother had filed a missing person report on her daughter with the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office; Graham was reported missing to the same sheriff's office on Christmas Eve the same month. Family members of both girls informed investigators of their fears their daughters had become the victims of foul play, perhaps having been kidnapped prior to their departing to the mall from the Trimble residence, and possibly by someone they knew, as there were no signs of a disturbance having occurred at either girl's residence, and makeup was found arranged upon a dresser in Trimble's bedroom. In addition, neither girl had taken any personal possessions from her household prior to her disappearance, and although Graham was known to have previously run away from her home, at the time of her disappearance, she had recently undergone an operation to remove her appendix, and was still physically recovering from the procedure, having also left her prescribed antibiotics in her bedroom. Nonetheless, neither family could completely discount the possibility the girls may have hitchhiked to various regions, including New Jersey, or as far as Nova Scotia, Canada. Initially, investigators concluded Graham had arrived at Trimble's home on the date of the girls' disappearance when no other member of Francine's family had been present within the household, and that the two girls were likely together at the time of their disappearance later that day. Furthermore, although investigators initially concluded the most likely explanation for the girls' disappearance was that they had been runaways, they could not discount the families' theory both girls had been abducted from Trimble's home. As no signs of a struggle were noted within the Trimble household, had this been the case, the two girls would have either known their abductor, or been taken from the residence at gunpoint. The aunt of Francine Trimble would later recollect that on one occasion, out of sheer desperation, her family had contacted a psychic in the hope of obtaining information regarding the girls' whereabouts and welfare. Mendocino County police officers at the location where the bodies of Graham and Trimble were discovered, July 8, 1979 Discovery The unclothed, skeletal remains of Graham and Trimble were discovered by two tourists traveling to Fort Bragg, California on the afternoon of July 8, 1979. Following a minor argument within the car, the two tourists had stopped their vehicle on private land near the Jackson Demonstration State Forest, alongside Highway 20 in Mendocino County, approximately 12 miles west of Willits and 80 miles from the girls' residences. One of these individuals exited his vehicle to briefly walk in the vicinity where the two had parked. Venturing into a steep, heavily overgrown area near James Creek, this individual located a human skull protruding from a shallow grave in brush midway down an embankment of the creek, a short distance from the road. The tourists left a can of soda at the side of the road to mark the location of the remains and drove to the city of Willits, where they reported their discovery to the police. External view of the location upon Highway 20 where the girls' bodies were discovered. July 8, 1979 Responding to the tourists' discovery, Mendocino County sheriff's deputies extensively searched the area in and around James Creek, finding numerous skeletal remains later determined to belong to two individuals. Both victims had been bound with duct tape and concealed within plastic, before being buried in a shallow grave. Sections of duct tape, hair, and numerous bones were scattered in the vicinity of this grave‚Äîindicating the bodies had been disturbed by wild animals. Investigators would subsequently conclude the two victims had been murdered elsewhere, and their bodies later buried at the scene of their discovery, with this act most likely occurring after nightfall. No clothing was present with either set of remains, although a solitary shell earring depicting a bird‚Äîlater determined to belong to Francine Trimble‚Äîwas discovered at the scene. Following a two-day search of the crime scene, in which approximately 90 percent of the victims' bones were recovered with FBI assistance, the remains recovered from the embankment alongside Highway 20 were sent to the coroner's office to undergo a thorough forensic examination. Investigation =Initial examination= The initial autopsies conducted upon the remains recovered from James Creek revealed little accurate forensic information about the victims beyond the fact both had been approximately 14 years of age, likely of Caucasian race, and that the two victims had likely been murdered on or about December 8, 1978. However, the coroner was unable to determine whether the victims' remains were male or female, but after further examining the remains with the assistance of a forensic pathologist, declared one decedent had been male and the other female. By 1980, the results of all tests conducted upon the remains had been concluded. The results of these initial examinations also established several approximations of the physical statistics of the victims, including their sexes, ages and heights, and although the actual cause of the victims' deaths could not be determined due to the advanced state of decomposition and the lack of any evident trauma upon the largely skeletal remains, both the coroner and the forensic pathologist could not exclude the possibility that each victim had been strangled to death. Although both victims were correctly determined to be of Caucasian race, both the coroner and the forensic pathologist determined they could not be completely sure of the specific ethnicity, or the precise gender of one of the recovered bodies, which was initially determined to be that of a male. The initial autopsy reports also erroneously concluded the two victims may have been related, stating there was a \\"high probability\\" the two decedents were a brother and sister. The earring worn by Francine Trimble, subsequently found with her remains The first victim to have been recovered from the crime scene (later identified as Francine Trimble) was estimated to have been between and tall, possibly in height. The age of this victim was initially placed as being between 10 and 20 years old‚Äîperhaps being no older than 14. Her remains were found with a single earring of a bird, presumed to be handmade and constructed from a shell-like material described as being often seen in the works of \\"hippies and Native Americans.\\" The second victim recovered from the crime scene and the subject originally believed to have been a male (later identified as Kerry Graham) was inaccurately estimated to have been between and tall, possibly in height, when in reality, Kerry Graham had been just in height. The age of this victim was also initially placed as being between 10 and 20 years old‚Äîperhaps being no older than 13. As had been the case with the first body recovered from James Creek, this decedent also had light brown hair, and had received excellent dental care in her lifetime, having never undergone a tooth filling procedure. Following their initial autopsies, the girls' remains‚Äîinformally known simply as \\"John Doe\\" and \\"Jane Doe\\" among homicide detectives‚Äîwere interred in a cement crypt in the Russian River Cemetery in the city of Ukiah. =Developments= By 1985, the remains recovered from James Creek had remained unidentified for six years. The same year, all evidence pertaining to the case was submitted to the FBI to undergo further examination, although the case would largely remain cold for the following 15 years. Nonetheless, on several occasions between the years of 2000 and 2011, the decedents' remains would be exhumed to undergo further forensic analysis in an effort to determine their identities. Speculation as to the accuracy of the initial theory of a probable relation between the victims first arose in 2000 when a further examination of the decedents' dental charting revealed dissimilarities too great for the pair to have been biologically related. The initial assumption the victims had been related was first questioned by a forensic odontologist named Jim Wood who, having closely examined the jawbone of each victim, concluded the jaw structure and actual dentition were too dissimilar for the decedents to have been related, and further opined his belief that both victims had most likely been female. This belief that both victims had not been related was formally confirmed via an examination of the victims' mitochondrial DNA the following year, which conclusively determined that the two victims had not been maternally related. Despite these revelations, speculation remained the decedents may have been in a romantic relationship, which may have been a reason why they were together at the time of their deaths. As no contemporary missing persons reports of a male and a female missing since late 1978 or early 1979 existed in California which matched the physical characteristics of the decedents, theories remained that the pair may have hitchhiked to California, perhaps from as far away as the Midwestern United States, and possibly as runaways. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the victims, created and released by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2012. The facial reconstruction of Graham is depicted on the left as a male subject =Facial reconstructions= Beginning in the 1990s, several forensic facial reconstructions of the decedents were created and released to the media depicting reconstructions of just how the two decedents may have physically appeared in life. Initially, these reconstructions had been in the form of clay sculptures created using three dimensional photographs of the victims' skulls to create forensic models of the physical appearances of their faces. With advances in technology, these clay sculptures would be replaced by digital reconstructions of the decedents‚Äîstill believed to have been a male and a female‚Äîthat were released to the media in the early 2000s. In July 2012, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released updated, digital renderings of the victims' faces. These renditions had been obtained with the assistance of a forensic anthropologist, who‚Äîvia performing a modern CT scan upon the skulls of the two decedents‚Äîhad been able to construct a more accurate digital, three- dimensional reconstruction of the victims' faces as they had most likely physically appeared in life. This forensic examination had also narrowed the ages of both victims to being most likely aged between 13- and 15-years-old at the time of their death, although the anthropologist did not question the original 1980 conclusion that one of the victims' skulls had been that of a male. This entire process was covered by the BBC America network, who had paid to have the victims' skeletalized remains exhumed in 2011 in order to produce a documentary detailing ongoing cold case investigations within the United States and worldwide as part of a series they had commissioned titled Naming the Dead. This documentary had detailed just how the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children utilize modern technology, the work of forensic artists, the Internet, and general law enforcement determination in the hopes of identifying unidentified child murder victims, and the methods currently used to do so, with these two decedents intended as being the primary case focused upon within this program within the series. Identification Some contemporary missing persons reports had erroneously listed the date of Graham and Trimble's disappearance as being 24 December 1979, whereas Graham had been reported missing by her mother on 24 December 1978. Furthermore, all primary sources pertaining to the two decedents had listed Graham's remains as being those of a male until DNA testing conducted in 2014 concluded her remains were actually those of a female. When these errors had been corrected, as a result of the renewed publicity and focus on the case following the 2012 screening of the BBC America series highlighting the work of forensic artists at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a sibling of Kerry Graham contacted authorities voicing her concerns one of the decedents may be her missing sister, adding that at the time of her disappearance, she had been in the company of Francine Trimble. As investigators had initially concluded the two girls were likely together at the time of their disappearance, DNA samples were obtained from family members of both girls. These samples were entered into both the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children databases for comparison with nationwide unsolved murders and unidentified decedents (within which the subjects of whose DNA, odontological, anthropological, and other general information already exists). These DNA comparisons later corroborated this sibling's belief. Consequently, 36 years after their murders, the two decedents discovered alongside Highway 20 in Mendocino County on July 8, 1979 were formally identified as being Kerry Ann Graham and Francine Marie Trimble. The formal identifications were made in November 2015, and later announced to the media via a February 2016 joint press conference held by the Mendocino and Sonoma county sheriff's offices in Mendocino's county seat of Ukiah, and in which both girls' families were informed that the disappearances of Graham and Trimble had never been connected with the remains discovered alongside Highway 20 as police had originally believed the victims had been a young boy and a young girl, and that a likely factor in the original misidentification of one of the bodies as being that of a male was that much of the skeletal structure of young females typically resembles those of males until a female begins to physically mature. Following this formal announcement, one of the individuals who had worked on the forensic reconstruction of the victims' faces was to state: \\"It's been such a collaborative effort giving these victims back their names; an identity that has been lost for 30-plus years. It's extraordinary that we were able to help the investigation and these families find answers to their questions. I can't sum up how incredible that is.\\" The remains of Kerry Graham and Francine Trimble were released to the surviving members of their families in February 2016. At a press conference, one family member stated that although both families had \\"largely resigned [themselves]\\" to the fact foul play was an extremely likely reason the girls had disappeared, both families were \\"glad to know\\" the girls' bodies had been identified, in order that they could receive a dignified burial by their families. Ongoing investigations Mendocino County investigators have stated that although no official suspects have been identified, investigations into the deaths are ongoing, with the case being \\"as active as it's ever been\\". Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman has also stated that with the identification of the victims, investigators are hoping to obtain more information about the hours leading up to the girls' disappearance in the hopes of capturing the individual or individuals responsible for their deaths and the subsequent concealment of their remains. =Persons of interest= Although no definite suspects have ever been named in the murders, the murders of Kerry Graham and Francine Trimble remain an open and active case. In 2000, a man incarcerated at a New Jersey prison falsely confessed to the murders. This false confession had led to the first exhumation of the victims' bodies from the cement crypt in which their remains had been interred following their initial autopsies. This individual was quickly excluded as a suspect in the case after investigators discovered he would have been approximately 12 years old at the time of the murders, in addition to the fact that this individual had \\"never [even] left New Jersey\\" in his lifetime. The man is believed to have falsely confessed to the girls' murders after reading about the case in a local newspaper. Investigators have also stated that they are eager to learn more details surrounding the girls' deaths in order to conclusively prove they were murdered. It is unknown if Graham and Trimble had hitchhiked to the Coddingtown Mall, had ever reached their destination, or even if they had actually intended to visit the Coddingtown Mall on the date of their disappearance. According to a friend of the two girls named Eileen Goetz, she had last seen Graham and Trimble in the grounds of El Molino High School on the date of their disappearance. The two girls had joined Goetz to smoke cigarettes in a parking lot near the school's tennis courts. According to Goetz, neither girl had actually attended school that day, and had informed her (Goetz) of their intentions to hitchhike to a party in Santa Rosa. Both girls had asked Goetz whether she wished to accompany them to the party, but she declined this offer. Another friend would later state that on the date of Graham and Trimble's disappearance, she had seen the two girls hitchhiking near a local Chevron gas station. Several serial killers such as Rodney Alcala and Gerald and Charlene Gallego have been identified as potential persons of interest in the murders of Graham and Trimble. The speculation of a serial killer as being the perpetrator of this crime was partly conceived due to the number of young females abducted and murdered in California during the late 1970s‚Äîsome within the same county of the victims' disappearance. A possible connection to the Santa Rosa hitchhiker murders has also been suggested, although the confirmed victims in this case were murdered between 1972 and 1976. No definitive suspects in the murders of Kerry Graham and Francine Trimble have been officially named.

Commissioned by the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation of the Library of Congress, the work premiered on May 3, 1947, at Cambridge High School in Boston, Massachusetts. Night Journey is the third of Graham's dances derived from Greek mythology, following Cave of the Heart and Errand into the Maze.  Theme, synopsis and original cast  Graham based the 30-minute-long ballet on a fragment of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Original program notes explain \\"the action takes place in Jocasta's heart at the instant when she recognizes the ultimate terms of her destiny.\\" The original cast members were Graham in the role of Queen Jocasta and Erick Hawkins as King Oedipus. Mark Ryder as the blind Seer (Tiresias) was accompanied by the Daughters of the Night (Furies), a chorus of six women: Pearl Lang, Yuriko, Ethel Winter, Helen McGehee, Natanya Neumann and Joan Skinner. The piece opens with Jocasta standing at extreme stage right illuminated in a conical spotlight. She twists slowly, holding aloft a loop of rope with which she intends to kill herself. At the first performance, a sustained note from the orchestra's horns created a mood of impending doom. But, when the sound ceased, Jocasta recoiled in horror. Hastening to her room, she collapsed on the bridal bed. The ballet was reworked shortly after its debut. In the revised version, Jocasta's suicidal thoughts are interrupted by the entrance of the Seer, followed by the Furies. After wrestling briefly with the oracle, she retreats to her bed to assess her life. As she relives her past in flashback, she sees her husband/son as a young man. She remembers him as a triumphal young warrior, surrounded by an adoring public bearing black laurel leaves. He performs a dance of the domineering suitor, she one of acquiescence. Wrapping her in his cloak, Oedipus and Jocasta engage in what appears to be an exchange of vows. In the pas de deux that follows, Jocasta embraces Oedipus, in gestures both maternal and sexual. At the duet's culmination, the pair wrap themselves in a tangle of rope atop their marriage bed, the rope representative of umbilical cord as well as the tie that binds their marriage. The pair is interrupted by the Seer, who breaks their bond, symbolically and literally, with his staff. Jocasta then recalls the Seer's revelation of her true relationship with Oedipus. Forced to drop the rope connecting them, the couple performs a dance of realization and shame. In the original production, Oedipus hoisted and rotated a painted plywood eye, blue on one side, bloodied on the other, as a portent of his fate. The prop was later eliminated as unnecessarily redundant. The desolate king removes the brooch fastening Jocasta's cloak, gouging out his eyes and groping his way offstage. The queen removes her cloak, the symbol of her sovereignty, winds the rope around her neck and falls lifeless to the floor.  Set and score  Noguchi's gray and white set is more elaborate than most he produced for Graham. A series of hourglass- and lyre-shaped stools, of increasing height, are placed diagonally from upstage left to right center stage. An offset stool/pillar serves as the throne where Oedipus makes Jocasta his queen. Inspired by the contours of the female pelvis, Jocasta's angled, raised rectangular bed resembles a stack of enlarged human bones. In some versions of the ballet, an oval-shaped wheel (of Fate) is located upstage right. The ominous artifacts and abstract elements combine to create a mood of impending doom. Schuman‚Äôs harsh, dissonant, dramatic music reflects Jocasta's state of mind, underscoring the ballet's eroticism and expected unhappy ending. Strings and wind instruments dominate the work, for the most part strident, sweeping or shrill, with occasional percussive passages. While still maintaining an undercurrent of doom, the music softens when Jocasta recalls Oedipus as her lover.  Choreography  Each of the three central characters dance with a distinctive set of movements. Costumed in a mask with covered eyes and a weighted cloak, the Seer moves with an air of power and purpose. He carries a heavy wooden staff that he strikes noisily on the stage and bed, emphasizing the seriousness of his message. Tiresias \\"sees most and least, takes up huge amounts of space when moving or standing still, yet never becomes personally engaged in the tragedy.\\" Holding his torso rigid, Oedipus struts and stamps, in a display of strength, the phallic thrusting of various limbs a gesture of his masculinity. At moments he lunges atop Jocasta. With a flexed foot, he pins her to the bed and throws a leg across her chest. Jocasta's dancing is the least self-assured. She darts and wanders indecisively, frequently slumping to the ground by means of back bends and back hinges. She opens her knees to Oedipus in invitation, only to later close them, drawing an arm across her pelvis in a gesture of shame or remembered sexual pleasure. In her autobiography Blood Memory, the choreographer provides insight into a specific recurring gesture in the work. \\"Now Jocasta kneels on the floor at the foot of the bed and then she rises with her leg close to her breast and to her head, and her foot beyond her head, her body open in a deep contraction. I call this the vaginal cry ... It is either the cry for her lover, her husband, or the cry for her children.\\" The chorus is an extension of Jocasta, \\"the memories of things we dread to remember, things we wish to forget - the terrors.\\" They anticipate events before they happen, frequently attempting to prevent their occurrence \\"always in extreme body shapes and percussive energy.\\" The group repeatedly executes \\"bison jumps,\\" a jet√© leap in contraction with the legs at sharp angles and the arms held back, elbows high above the torso. In addition to the choreography's psychosexual symbolism, a motif of seeing and not seeing runs through the dance. The Seer's eyes are covered. The chorus members hold cupped hands in front of their faces in an effort to avoid watching the unfolding tragedy. Oedipus wraps his head in his cloak, suggesting his inability to see Jocasta's true identity, and at the ballet's climax, blinds himself with the clasp from her cloak.  Critical reception  The New York Herald Tribune noted, \\"Miss Graham has created a fine and stirring work‚Ä¶and her own performance as Jocasta is generally a brilliant one...\\" The Dance Observer's article said, \\"In the opening dance of tragic resignation, and in her solo bit at the end of the work, Martha Graham has invented for herself movement patterns which are among the most evocative and beautiful in her entire repertoire. So expressive in their violence, so provocative in their implication, so moving in their emotional content are these expressions of Jocasta's realization...she might easily be able to tell the entire story without benefit of the actual appearance of Oedipus, or the Seer, or the Daughters of the Night.\\" Schuman's score was also very well received. Critic Walter Terry wrote its patterns provided exactly what Graham's \\"dance style needs most-abrupt, harsh rhythms, staccato phrases that are brief and insistent, long-held steely notes against which she seems to lean and swell.\\" Another reviewer described the score as \\"distinctive, ominous and foreboding, completely fitting in every respect.\\" Several reviewers made mention of Noguchi's set, which was far more elaborate that those he had made previously for Graham. One wrote, \\"Each set per se seems right, each one becomes more beautiful than its predecessor... more imposing...more attention demanding, and consequently less effective.\\" It \\"could almost stand by itself in a museum, and as a sculptural exhibit tell most of the story without benefit of figures.\\" The bed, especially, was singled out for either praise or criticism. The New York Herald Tribune's critic \\"particularly like the glittering yet distorted bed which focused upon and symbolized the nature of the evil tragedy which best Jocasta and Oedipus.\\" The New York Times reviewer John Martin found it \\"highly stylized...over-designed and distracting.\\"  Background notes  The making of Night Journey meshed with Graham's personal life. Dancing the role of Jocasta, and other characters she created from 1946 through 1950, became a way for her to channel the emotions of her difficult domestic relationship with Hawkins. In parallel with the Oedipus myth, Hawkins was significantly younger (15 years) than Graham. Dance critic Marcia B. Siegel wrote, \\"What Graham constructed for herself over the ruins of Hawkins idyll, re-imagined through dreams, myth, and an assiduously cultivated unconscious, was a series of central roles in a series of remarkable dances. The vengeful Jocasta wasn't the first but it was probably the most striking.\\" The work also reflects Graham's interest in Freudian and Jungian analysis. Both she and Hawkins met with Jungian psychotherapists in 1945 and 1946. Many Graham scholars remark on the fact the piece is presented from Jocasta's point of view. Not only does this make the Queen the focus of the story, it alters its content as well. \\"Graham makes space in this dance for something Freud forgot in his analysis of the Oedipus complex: women's sexual pleasure...what is highlighted in Night Journey is not the son's desire, but the mother's.\\"  Performance history  Night Journey has been a staple of the troupe's repertory since its premiere and is one of the few dances Graham permitted to be filmed. Pearl Lang took over the Jocasta role from Graham. In 1975, Rudolf Nureyev appeared as Oedipus. Peggy Lyman, Christine Dakin and Terese Capucilli appeared as the queen in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. With the rest of the company repertoire, the work was not performed during the protracted Graham vs. Graham lawsuit, which raged from 1999 to 2003. When legal battles over rights to Graham's work were settled, Night Journey reentered the Martha Graham Dance Company repertory. Since then, Elizabeth Auclair, Katherine Crockett, and Blakeley White-McGuire have been among the dancers portraying Jocasta. Night Journey was filmed for educational television by director Alexander Hammid as part of a three episode series. Graham appeared as Jocasta, Bertram Ross as Oedipus and Paul Taylor as the Seer. Helen McGehee led the chorus, which included Ethel Winter, Mary Hinkson, Linda Hodes, Akiko Kanda, Carol Payne and Bette Shaler. Graham had misgivings about having her dances filmed, but ultimately relented to producer Nathan Kroll for the making of the documentary A Dancer's World. After the short was televised in 1956, Kroll asked permission to film two of her most famous ballets, Appalachian Spring and Night Journey. They were aired in 1958 and 1960, respectively.

The Harpin-PSS (HrpZ; TC# 1.C.56.1.1) protein is secreted by Pseudomonas syringae via the Hrp secretion system (IIISP; TC# 3.A.6) and elicits a hypersensitive response (HR) in non-host plants upon infection and pathogenicity in hosts. It contains several repetitive regions and exhibits two extended (20 residue) regions of moderate hydrophobicity that might serve as Œ±-helical TMSs. The HrpZ cation channel is predicted to be largely of Œ±-structure. HrpZ - a harpin - is a highly thermostable protein that exhibits multifunctional abilities, e.g., it elicits the hypersensitive response (HR), enhances plant growth, acts as a virulence factor, and forms pores in plant plasma membranes as well as artificial membranes. Homologues are not found in organisms other than P. syringae. Function When inserted into liposomes and synthetic bilayers at low concentrations (2 nM), it provokes a cation-selective ion current with large unitary conductance. Chloride is not transported. It has been hypothesized that such channels could allow nutrient release and/or delivery of virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.

He is also a member of the International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence. His field of expertise is Theory of Evidence Law, and he is considered one of the leading experts in the world in this area.  Biography  Doron Menashe was born in Ramat Gan, the middle child of three boys. He was raised and educated in Bnei Brak. Menashe studied at the Bnei Brak Municipal Public High School, excelling in mathematics. After his high school studies, he served in the Israel Defense Forces in a classified intelligence unit. He completed his undergraduate, master's (summa cum laude) and doctoral studies (with distinction) in law at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Law. At the same time, he completed a degree summa cum laude in philosophy at the Department of Philosophy of Tel Aviv University. Menashe also has formal university training in mathematics. Menashe began teaching in the University of Haifa in the year 2000, also lecturing at Tel Aviv University and many colleges across Israel. In addition, in 2006, Menashe founded a unique program in the field of adjudication and criminal procedure for the LL.M degree in the Faculty of Law at the University of Haifa. He has been the academic coordinator of the program since its inception. Over the past few years, he has served as the editor of Israel's first online law journal, He'arat Din and today he is the Editor-in-Chief of Haifa Law Review. Menashe is also a member of the International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence. As a youth, Menashe played football professionally, and since 1980 he has held the Israeli record for ball control with feet (he bounced a soccer ball 22200 on one foot which was considered to be a world best achievement at least back then). In his personal life, Menashe is Jewish (religious), living in Ramat Gan, married to Ora Menashe, and the father of five.  Publications  Doron Menashe's articles have been published in the most prestigious professional journals in the area of evidence and procedure, including The Berkley Press, Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal, International Community Law, International Commentary on Evidence, Criminal Law Quarterly, The International Journal of Evidence and Proof, Criminal Justice and Behavior, San Diego, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Yeshiva University, Buffalo etc. Menashe's articles were also published in Australia, Italy (translated to Italian) and in China (translated to chinese). Menashe is on the editorial board of one of the most prominent periodicals in the world specializing in evidence, International Commentary on Evidence, and Law Probability & Risk (Oxford). Doron Menashe's writing is often cited by the Supreme Court of Israel.  Philosophy and research  The main thrust of Doron Menashe's research is the theory of evidentiary law, an area which suffers from a relative lack of professional analysis. In his writing, Doron Menashe integrates theoretical-fundamental perspectives with practical- applicatory perspectives. Doron Menashe's writing is analytical, dealing with the clarification of concepts and logical aspects of the rules of evidence, including mathematical analysis of rules, the application of economic principles to law and specifically in the context of incentives for disclosure of information. In addition, Doron Menashe has special expertise in forms of evidence which relate to specific areas of law, such as forensic evidence in criminal proceedings, bribery cases and white-collar crimes in general (see his articles about the Aryeh Deri case and the Holy Land case against Ehud Olmert); and in the context of science and health, specifically in the context of proving mass injuries due to the danger of exposure to toxins (toxic torts). (See his critical evaluation of the Report of the Government Investigation Committee on the Results of Military Activities in the Kishon River and the Surrounding Water on the Health of IDF Soldiers.) In addition, Menashe writes expansively about areas beyond the rules of evidence, for example the place that the element of mercy should play in judging and sentencing, e.g. (with Y. Kaplan) \\"Mercy in Judging and Sentencing\\" 32(3) Iyunei Mishpat: Tel Aviv University Law Review (2011) 583-648 [Hebrew]. His writings also deal with the nature of judicial proof, e.g. \\"Is Judicial Proof of Facts a Form of Scientific Explanation? A Preliminary Investigation of 'Clinical' Legal Method,\\" above Section D, Serial No. 19; \\"On the Inadmissibility of the Aggregated Probabilities Principle.\\" He also analyzes the objectives of the rules of evidence in a criminal trial, e.g.: \\"The Ideal of Finding Truth and the Principle of Minimizing False Convictions: An Analysis of a Complex Relationship;\\" The Logic of the Admissibility of Evidence (2008) [Hebrew]. He also dissects the basic conceptualization of the rules of evidence such as probative value, admissibility, suppressed evidence, levels of proof, e.g. \\"The Probative Value of Belated Testimony.\\" In addition, he formulates decision-making strategies for determining findings of fact, e.g. \\"Judicial Discretion in Fact-Finding, Freedom of Proof, and Professionalism of the Courts.\\" He addresses the theoretical and practical difficulties in identifying suspects, e.g. (with R. Assy) \\"Mistaken Facial Identification of Suspects: Invitation to Research and Reform.\\" He also writes about applying the economic approach of law to rules of evidence, e.g. (with L. Riza) \\"An Interested Party's Behavior Can Serve as Evidence: Analyzing Incentives in English Legislation.\\"  Objectives of rules of evidence  As opposed to the traditional-formalistic approach to the rules of evidence, according to which the point of the rules of evidence is to reveal the truth, Doron Menashe sees in the rules of evidence a domain in which various principles apply, which may come into conflict with one another, revealing the truth being just one of them. In addition to revealing the truth, the rules of evidence seek to protect the innocent, and this principle imposes limitations on the principle of finding the truth. Simply put, the principle of finding the truth yields epistemological consideration, while the principle of protecting the innocent yields normative considerations; thus, the rules of evidence are dominated by both epistemological considerations and normative considerations, whereas the normative considerations delimit the parameters of the application of epistemological considerations. The normative considerations produce the risk-of-error allocation of criminal proceedings, through which Menashe develops a concept called \\"decision-making strategy.\\"  Risk-of-error allocation  In criminal trials, allocations of risk of error must reflect a balance between the principle of protecting the innocent and the public interest of criminal law enforcement. Since the normative considerations justify a particularly strong defense of the principle of protecting the innocent, so that convicting the innocent is considered more serious than vindicating the guilty, this demands an unequal risk-of-error allocation, so that a higher risk is justified for an erroneous vindication and a lower risk, if possible, for an erroneous conviction. The risk of wrongful conviction must be as low as possible, one step removed from making criminal law enforcement utterly infeasible. This allocation of risk-of-error is applicable throughout the judicial proceeding, not only at the time of the verdict being issued at its conclusion. In this, Doron Menashe disputes the approach of Larry Laudan, who is of the opinion that, aside from the stage of final decision, the only consideration which is relevant is the epistemological consideration of maximizing the discovery of the truth. Doron Menashe's approach in these contexts dovetails with that of the prominent expert on evidence, Alex Stein. On the other hand, in civil law, Menashe sees as justified the equal allocation of risks of error, based on the principle of offering equal protection to the plaintiffs and to the respondents.  Decision-making strategy  Decision-making strategy is a term for the outline which should manage judicial discretion when coming to conclusions in judicial proceedings. In other words, the main objective is to provide the court with general guidelines according to which it should reach its specific verdict. Decision-making strategy may be determined by the legislature through lawmaking or by the court itself through precedent. Decision-making strategy may exist in the context of procedure and the rules of evidence. In this context, when the decision-making strategy is determined by the court, the court does not play a passive role in using the rules of procedure and evidence, but rather an active role, as even before the specific verdict has been reached, it considers the resolution of the question of decision-making strategy. Decision-making strategy must accommodate the objectives of the stated judicial context. Thus, one must distinguish between criminal decision- making strategy and civil decision-making strategy. Criminal decision-making strategy must reflect the objective of criminal procedure and rules of law; more generally speaking, it must reflect the objectives of criminal justice on the whole. As mentioned above, these objectives are the enforcement of criminal law, protecting the innocent and finding the truth. Decision-making strategy may be the strategy of the verdict at the conclusion of the legal proceedings. Menashe defines this strategy as personal or circumscribed strategy. In this case, to the extent that the decision is factual, the decision-making strategy relates to the level of proof and its application. However, the discussion is not limited to the verdict. Decision-making strategy also pertains to conclusions and choices made throughout the trial before the verdict, expanding and applying at every juncture of judicial decision throughout the proceedings which may influence the allocation of risks of error during the trial, particularly the level of risk of the innocent being convicted. These decisions may touch on the weight of evidence; interpreting the rules which dictate the admissibility or sufficiency of evidence; applying judicial discretion to those matters which are not explicitly addressed in the law, et cetera. Menashe refers to this strategy as general criminal decision-making strategy. In criminal law, decision-making strategy, whether general or specific, must reflect the goal of maximizing the protection of innocent, up to the edge of making it impossible to enforce criminal law with reasonable effectiveness. In terms of allocating risks of error, one must allocate, as much as possible, the risks of error to the state (running the risk of vindicating the guilty) to the level that any further risk allocation would make reasonable enforcement of the law impossible. From this point onward, the risks of error may be allocated to the defendant (the risk of convicting the innocent). Thus, Doron Menashe offers a unique approach, unlike other modes of thought, such as the Bayesian-Pascalian approach, Jonathan Cohen's inductive reasoning, or Ronald Allen's narrative approach. On the other hand, the decision-making strategy in civil law reflects an allocation of risk of error which is equivalent between plaintiffs and respondents, between errors based on accepting that which should have been rejected and those based on rejecting that which should have been accepted. Similarly, there is equivalency between an overly stingy assessment and an overly generous assessment.  Published books  * D.

It was formed as CYBG plc by National Australia Bank (NAB) in February 2016, in advance of the divestment of its UK business through a stock market flotation. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Australian Securities Exchange; it is also a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History =Formation of CYBG plc= National Australia Bank acquired Clydesdale Bank in 1987 and Yorkshire Bank in 1995. Fred Goodwin, an accountant working for Touche Ross, worked on the acquisition of Clydesdale Bank. In 1995 Goodwin, with little direct banking experience, was appointed deputy CEO of the Clydesdale Bank. Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank began operating under a single banking licence in the UK in 2005: Yorkshire Bank became a division of Clydesdale Bank but retained its own name for trading purposes. National Australia Bank confirmed in October 2014 that it planned to exit the UK, and was considering a number of options for Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank, including a possible stock market listing. Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank were demerged and placed in a separate holding company, CYBG plc, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and Australian Securities Exchange for conditional share trading on 3 February 2016 and unconditional trading from 8 February 2016. =Acquisition of Virgin Money= On 7 May 2018 it was reported that CYBG plc had made a ¬£1.7bn all share offer to acquire Virgin Money plc. On 18 June 2018 it was announced that the takeover had been agreed. Arrangements were made for CYBG to license the Virgin Money brand for ¬£12 million a year (later rising to ¬£15 million a year) and to move all its retail customers to the Virgin Money brand over the following three years. The acquisition of Virgin Money plc was completed on 15 October 2018. The assets of Virgin Money plc were legally merged into Clydesdale Bank plc on 21 October 2019. =Rebrand to Virgin Money UK plc= The group's name was changed from CYBG plc to Virgin Money UK plc on 31 October 2019. CEO David Duffy's pay rose by 84% from ¬£1.8m in 2018 to ¬£3.4m in 2019. This was despite an investor revolt in which a third of shareholders opposed the payout, citing the fact that company had suffered its second consecutive annual loss, caused by a ¬£385m charge for mis-sold payment protection insurance. Duffy's increase was largely due to a bonus of ¬£1.3m linked to the 2015 demerger of Virgin Money's predecessor bank, CYBG, from National Australia Bank, as well as incentives from 2016.

Plot In the heart of Blackveil in the castle Argenthyne, Karigan is confronted by a mysterious figure wearing a mirrored looking mask. To prevent Mornhavon the Black from possessing such a powerful magical item she shatters it and is propelled into darkness. She awakens to find herself sealed within a stone sarcophagus, delirious she fights to break out, desperately starved of air she starts to fall unconscious only to be released from the tomb into the bright lights and loud music of a circus stage. She staggers from the arena and through a dark city completely disoriented, she is set upon by a rowdy bunch of thugs but makes quick work of them with her bonewood staff. An unexpected ally arrives but before she agrees to go with him to a safe haven she is drugged and whisked away. When Karigan awakes, she has various injuries including a broken arm and can barely walk. Promptly a housekeeper informs her that this is her 'uncle's' house and she is safe and should rest. Her uncle it transpires is a professor of archaeology from high society and has no idea that his new house guest is a real life artifact. Soon it is revealed to her that she has been transported nearly 200 years into the future. Karigan no longer recognizes the city - an industrial revolution is underway, with gas lighting, steam engines, factories belching smoke, cotton mills run on slave labor and curious animatronic law enforcers. With women forced to cover their faces and not speak unless instructed, Karigan struggles to fit into her role in this new society. One of her Eletian companions, from her mission to Blackveil was also pulled through time, however Lhean is weakened by the lack of magic in the world. He is captured and taken to be presented to the Emperor as Eletians were believed to be extinct having been hunted and killed during the fall of Sacoridia nearly 200 years ago. Karigan convinces the professor and his assistant Cade Harlow that she is in fact the real Sir Karigan G'ladheon from 200 years in their history. The professor explains that all knowledge of the empires history is restricted, and that the emperor who now rules is merciless, powerful and immortal. They reveal they are part of the resistance to bring down the empire and restore a monarch to the throne. They also explain that Arhys, a young girl the professor employs as a maid is the last living descendant of King Zachary and that she is unaware of her royal bloodline. Finally the professor confesses that Cade is in training to become Arhys' bodyguard, a new generation of Weapon. Arhys becomes jealous of the professors new found interest in Karigan, and the young girl reports the strange nocturnal activity of the professor to the authorities. The professor's secret underground museum and training facility is breached by the law enforcers and in a desperate bid to buy Karigan and Cade time to escape, the professor blows up the entire complex including himself. Karigan catches the interest of the professor's rival Dr. Silk, a cruel and ambitious man. His aim is to curry favor with the emperor and earn himself eternal life. Learning of Lhean's fate, Karigan travels with Cade and Luke, a former groomsmen of the late professor, to the new capital to rescue him. At their arrival of the palace they are immediately captured, Luke is killed, Cade imprisoned and Karigan strikes a bargain with Dr. Silk to ensure Cade's well-being before his inevitable execution. In the depths of the palace, Cade is shown a woman, known as The Witch, she has been mutilated and tortured for centuries by the emperor's preferred inner circle, he is warned that should he not cooperate this will be Karigan's fate. Karigan comes face to face with the Emperor who is none other than King Zachary's cousin Xandis Amberhill. She realizes however it is not just Amberhill residing within his body and that there are two other personalities fighting for dominance. She is forced to placate his more aggressive personas and duel the emperor's personal bodyguard, The Eternal Guardian. The Eternal Guardian reveals himself to Karigan as Fastion, King Zachary's sworn Weapon, who was killed only to be reanimated by Mornhaven to serve for eternity. With Fastion's help she is able to free Lhean and Cade, who in turn releases The Witch. All hell breaks loose as the witch, once free, is returned to full power as Yolande the sea goddess, who floods the country in revenge for her imprisonment. Karigan is able to cross the threshold of the world and travel back in time with Lhean, however as she tries to bring Cade with her she is prevented and Cade releases her so that she can safely return home. Karigan returns to her own time with the knowledge from the future that Xandis Amberhill will bring about the doom of Sacoridia.

While working as a lawyer and tax assessor, Fallou established himself as an independent scientist, a recognized authority in the natural history of farm and forest soil. In 1862 he advanced the idea that soil was separate in nature from geology. Intent on establishing the study of soils as an independent science, Fallou introduced the term pedology (). Life Friedrich Albert Fallou came from an aristocratic French Huguenot family. He was the son of a judicial bailiff, and spent his childhood in Rochlitz and Grimma, where he was a student at the Gymnasium St. Augustine. He never married. From 1814 to 1817 Fallou studied jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig. From 1818 to 1824 he worked as a lawyer in Colditz. In 1825 he was appointed town clerk of Waldheim and worked as administrative officer at the City Court, and as a land value tax assessor. His love of nature turned his attention to soils, which he studied as an independent scholar. He also wrote geographic descriptions of Saxon regions and towns, which he published in the journal \\"Saxonia\\" under the pseudonym \\"Baldwin from Eichberg\\". In 1833 he resigned as city clerk and again ran a practice as a lawyer and land evaluator, this time until 1850. After that, Fallou devoted himself almost exclusively to geological, mineralogical and pedological studies. In 1856 he moved to the Diedenm√ºhle near Waldheim in Saxony, living here as an independent scientist until his death. Profession Working in soil evaluation for most of his professional life, Fallou was unhappy with the declining soil quality in his region. He developed a passionate interest in soil. Fallou conducted independent geological, petrographic and mineralogical studies in the 1830s. He had a particular interest in the granulite geology near Prachatice on the eastern edge of the Bohemian Forest. In the years after 1840 he devoted his time to the origin of agricultural and forest soils. His first major publication was a description of the rock formations of Muldengaues and their influence on vegetation. This was published in 1845 and received an award from the Princely Jablonowski'schen Society in Leipzig. In 1853 he published his book \\"The arable lands of the Kingdom of Saxony\\", along with a second edition in 1855. Through numerous study trips in Saxony and neighboring countries, Fallou recognized the need to make soil science knowledge applicable to agriculture and forestry use. In his two books \\"First Principles of Soil Science\\" (1857, 2nd ed. 1865) and \\"Pedology or General and Special Soil Science\\" (1862) he developed his collected field observations of soil into a systematic approach. He explained why soil formation was worthy of study and appealed for recognition of soil science as a discipline. In the 1862 work, he presented a proposal for soil profile description, discussed the physical and chemical properties of soils, and proposed classification of soils based on mineral properties. Based on these two works, Fallou is mentioned prominently as the first among founders of modern soil science. Fallou's subsequent works were \\"The land of the Kingdom of Saxony and its surroundings ...\\" (1869) and \\"The main soil types of the North and Baltic countries of the German Empire scientifically considered\\" (1875). These along with several articles published in Julius Adolph St√∂ckhardt's magazine Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsche Landwirthe (Journal for German farmers) gained him recognition for his scientific advancements. Vasily Dokuchaev (1846-1903) was more influential than Fallou, however in the years closely following Dokuchaev's death, Fallou was regarded as the founder of modern soil science by Dokuchaev's student, influential Russian pedologist Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka (1867-1927). Fallou's historical status as founder is supported by Moscow soil scientist and bibliographer of Russian soil science, Arseny Yarilov, Editor of ‚ÄúPochvovedenie‚Äù (means soil science). Yarilov titled his 1904 article about Fallou in Pochvovedenie Friedrich Albert Fallou, Founder of Soil Science. Quote *Es giebt ja in der ganzen Natur keinen wichtigeren, keinen der Betrachtung w√ºrdigeren Gegenstand und wenn ein ber√ºhmter Philosoph und Staatsmann der Vorzeit (Cic. de off. I. 42.) den Ackerbau f√ºr das w√ºrdigste Gesch√§ft eines freien B√ºrgers erkl√§rt, so mu√ü es auch ein ebenso w√ºrdiges Gesch√§ft f√ºr ihn sein, sich mit dem Boden bekannt zu machen, ohne welchen kein Ackerbau denkbar. There is no more important object in nature, no object more worthy of contemplation, and if a famous philosopher and statesman of the past declares agriculture to be the worthy business of a free citizen (Cic. de off. I. 42.) it would also be an equally worthy business for him to get acquainted with the soil, without which agriculture is not conceivable. * in Pedology or General and Special Soil Science, Dresden 1862. .

She was also known as the \\"Mother of probation\\". She lobbied the government to make changes to the way juvenile cases were processed in the court system, helped establish a probation office as well as a juvenile court system, and became the first probation and welfare officer in the country. She was honoured as a recipient of the Order of the British Empire in 1978 and in 2011 was designated as a National Hero of the Cayman Islands. Biography Sybil Joyce Russell was born on 25 August 1913 in the Cayman Islands to Edward and Jane Russell. She married Wilfred Augustus \\"Conrad\\" Hylton and worked as a community volunteer in youth advocacy, through projects with the Cub Scouts and Lions Club. While attending a court proceeding of a juvenile offender in the 1950s, Hylton was alarmed that the child was being treated by the courts as an adult. Hylton was not the first to work with juveniles, but she was the first to bring her concerns to the government. Pressing for change in the system, she was instrumental in the passage of several pieces of legislation concerning offenders rights, and was referred to as the \\"Mother of Probation\\". The \\"Probation of Offenders Law 1963\\" provided for the establishment of probation officers for the island, established codes for adult offenders' supervision, and proscribed the managerial duties for the principal probation officer. Shortly thereafter, Hylton was appointed as the Cayman's Island's first probation officer. Recognizing that troubled youth were usually products of troubled families, Hylton pressed for social services to be added to her position. Soon after, the \\"Poor Persons' (Relief) Law 1963\\" was passed and assigned to the Probation Services department. Duties proscribed under the Relief law included an assessment process and funds allocation from the public funds to assist those in reduced financial circumstances or health problems. She continued pressing for the separation of juvenile justice. In 1964, the Juvenile Offenders' Law was passed. This resulted in the creation of a distinct unit ‚Äì the Juvenile Court ‚Äì and legal procedures, including juvenile probation services, which were specifically aimed at administering justice for children aged sixteen and under. The administration of social inquiry reports for both children and adults was supervised by the probation services, which included advice, agency referral, counselling, and filing court reports. In 1974, Gay Jackson was appointed as an assistant to Hylton and Steven E. Smith was hired as a social worker to strengthen the services offered. In 1982, the Probation and Welfare Office was absorbed within the Department of Social Services; Hylton retired subsequently. Post her retirement, Hylton continued working with the Young Parents Programme and as an adviser to the Adoption Board. She also enjoyed gardening, serving as a member of the Garden Club of Grand Cayman. In 1986, she co-founded the Cayman Orchid Society. Hylton died on 1 October 2006 in George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and was buried in the Dixie Cemetery of George Town. Honors and awards In 1968, Hylton was honoured with the Cayman Islands Certificate and Badge of Honour and received the designation MBE Order of the British Empire in 1978. In 2011, she was designated as a National Hero of the Cayman Islands and in 2013 was honoured as Youth Services Pioneer, by the Cayman government.

Kohlreiter Square dates to the early twentieth century, when it served as a plaza to the Arverne ‚Äì Gaston Avenue Long Island Railroad (LIRR) station. The station opened in 1887, shortly before the completion of Arverne-By-The-Sea, a community of upscale summer homes and hotels along the beach. The neighborhood‚Äôs name is an abbreviation of its developer‚Äôs name, Remington R. Vernam. The tracks were elevated in 1942, with the Rockaway Freeway running beneath them. As part of a grade elimination project, undeveloped and condemned properties along the Freeway were acquired by the city as parkland. The station plaza was acquired from the LIRR in 1946. In 2001 construction commenced on a new residential community that revived the name Arverne-by-the-Sea.

A radical separatist in London before and during the English Civil War, he became a leading Leveller, a treasurer of the movement. A public servant and land speculator under the Commonwealth and Protectorate, he became rich and campaigned for social, moral and financial reform. He was ruined by the Restoration and returned to live in relative poverty in his native Shrewsbury. Origins and early life Samuel Chidley was the first surviving son of :* Daniel Chidley, listed in 1621 by the Shrewsbury Burgess Roll, under the spelling Chidloe, as a tailor and the son of William, a yeoman of Burlton, a village to the north of Shrewsbury.Shrewsbury Burgess Roll, p. 80. :* Katherine Chidley, Daniel's wife, whose origins are unknown. Remains of old St Chad's, Shrewsbury. The present church, on a different site, was built after the medieval building collapsed in 1788. The Burgess Roll records Samuel himself as being four years of age. Assuming this is correct, he was about two years old when his christening was recorded in the parish register of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury on 13 April 1618:Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 7. Here his father is called \\"Daniell Chedler:\\" although earlier documents record the surname with numerous spellings, Katherine and Samuel consistently used the form Chidley in their signatures and title pages. It has been suggested that the naming of Samuel was a deliberate allusion to the Biblical story of Hannah, who in dedicated her first child, Samuel, to God and refused the traditional purification ritual until the child was weaned.Gillespie, p. 80. This suggests that Samuel was intended from the outset as the child who would be dedicated to God's work. Daniel and Katherine Chidley were denounced as separatists by the Puritan public preacher of Shrewsbury, Julines Herring,Clarke. p. 465. and this separatism may account for their reluctance to have their children baptised at their parish church. However, by 1629 St Chad's had baptised a further seven Chidley children and buried one, Daniel, who died in infancy.Coulton, p. 82-3. The second Daniel's baptism was recorded on 12 February 1626,Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 46. and after this birth, at least, Katherine refused to undergo the Churching of women, although this may not have been the first time, and she was not unique. She and six other women were cited for refusing to take part later in the year during an episcopal visitation.Coulton, p. 83. This was part of protracted hostilities between the High Church incumbent, Peter Studley, and his Puritan parishioners in which both the separatists and the moderate Presbyterians around Herring were accused of absenting themselves from the Eucharist and setting up conventicles. Separation and advancement in London property mark of the Haberdashers' Company. The decision of the Chidley's to move to London has been attributed to both religious persecution. and a desire for relative anonymity. In 1630 Daniel Chidley, described as the Elder, together with John Dupper or Duppa and Thomas Dye, helped to form a separatist church in London.Burrage, volume 1, p. 321.Burrage, volume 2, p. 299. Frequently referred to by historians as the Duppa church, this splinter group rejected the baptism of Anglican parish churches and on these grounds broke away from an Independent church led by John Lothropp.Burrage, volume 2, p. 301-2. The initiative seems originally to have stemmed from Duppa's demand that Lothropp's church, in renewing its covenant, should \\"Detest & Protest against ye Parish Churches.\\" The splinter group were lucky to avoid the wave of arrests that struck the more visible parent body in 1632.Burrage, volume 1, p. 322-3. Samuel Chidley lived with his parents as an adult in London, and with his mother until at least 1652. He seems to have been active with his parents in their separatist group, supporting John Lilburne from the 1630s, during the period of Thorough, the attempt by Charles I to practise absolute monarchy. David Brown, a veteran of the group led by Duppa and the Chidleys reminisced about tearing a surplice as a deliberate act of iconoclasm one St Luke's Day (18 October) at Greenwich, a place made notorious in their eyes for the Catholic chapel that Queen Henrietta Maria had installed in her house there.Brown (1652), p. 14. The Chidleys seem also to have been very open to the economic opportunities afforded by the capital. Daniel became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers in 1632.Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. Samuel, was admitted to the Company as an apprentice in 1634.Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. The Chidleys' anonymity was decisively ended with the collapse of Thorough and the king's reluctant decision to call Parliaments. The Scottish Covenanters had defeated the king in the Bishops' Wars and when Parliament entered into negotiations for an alliance, pressed for a Presbyterian reformation of the Church of England.Shaw, volume 1, p. 128-9. At this juncture, Thomas Edwards, an irascible English Presbyterian controversialist, published Reasons Against the Independent Government of Particular Congregations, an attack on the Congregational polity. In October 1641, Katherine Chidley issued a counterblast: The Justification of the Independant Churches of Christ. Being an Answer to Mr. Edwards his Booke. The Biblical texts she placed on the title page both attested her preference for thinking through the experience of the Judges and the early Israelite monarchy, tending to confirm the significance of Samuel's name. , allowed her to take on the role of David, while allowed her to be Jael.The Justification of the Independant Churches, Title page. Samuel had begun his pamphleting career by 1643/4, when he released A Christian plea for Christians baptisme, a defence of infant baptism against the Particular Baptist Andrew Ritor's A Treatise of the Vanity of Childish Baptism, which had also strongly upheld baptism by immersion.Ritor (1642). The high places Henry Burton. Signatures of Samuel and Katherine Chidley on the initial covenant of the Bury St Edmunds Congregational Church. John Goodwin, an 18th-century satirical engraving. Samuel Chidley acted as spokesman for his church repeatedly in the 1640s, invariably on a variation of Duppa's founding principle of \\"Detest & Protest against ye Parish Churches.\\" The first recorded instance seems to have been in June 1645, when he, together with two other members, John Duppa and David Brown, took part in a conference with Henry Burton of St Matthew Friday Street.Brown (1650), p. 1. At the time, they were calling their group the Separation. The key tenet they wished to defend in the debate was that the former parish churches were to be shunned and demolished as were the \\"high places\\" of the Ancient Canaanite religion by the kings of Judah. Brown helpfully included a list of what the Separation regarded as relevant texts in his report of the conference,Brown (1650), p. 8. including , an account of Asa's destruction of the Canaanite shrines. The separatist position was in direct contradiction to the concluding statement of the Directory for Public Worship, adopted by an act of parliament in January 1645 to replace the Book of Common Prayer. :As no place is capable of any holiness under pretence of whatsoever Dedication or Consecration, so neither is it subject to such pollution by any superstition formerly used and now laid aside, as may render it unlawfull or inconvenient for Christians to meet together therein for the publique worship of God. And therefore we hold it requisite that the places of publique assembling for worship among us should be continued and imployed to that use.Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660: An Ordinance for taking away the Book of Common Prayer, and for establishing and putting in execution of the Directory for the publique worship of God. Thomas Edwards, in the first part of Gangraena, related an incident two months later in which Katherine Chidley debated at Stepney Meeting House with the moderate Independent William Greenhill, noting the Chidleys' distinctive avoidance of places previously dedicated to Saints and Angels, which they regarded as sites of idolatry.Edwards (1646), p. 79-80. First edition of Gangr√¶na. Samuel Chidley emerged as his mother's key assistant in her evangelism, helping her to plant new separatist churches. One of these was at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk and its covenant of 1646 has survived. It was affirmed in the names of eight adults and six children, with both Katherine and Samuel Chidley signing as witnesses. The covenant was radically separatist and strongly reflects the Chidleys' preoccupation with boycotting the old parish churches. Its members were \\"conuinced in conscience of the evill of ye Church of England, and of all other states wch are contrary to Christs institution.\\"Bury St Edmund's Church Covenants, p. 334. They declared themselves \\"fully separated\\" not only from Anglicans but also those who had dealings with them, as well as the \\"high places\\" they had used for worship. Beside their signatures, Samuel and Katherine Chidley described themselves as \\"members of the Church of God in London.\\" Edwards specifically mentioned the Suffolk mission in the third part of Gangraena: :There is one Katherine Chidly an old Brownist, and her sonne a young Brownist, a pragmaticall fellow, who not content with spreading their poyson in and about London, goe down into the Country to gather people to them, and among other places have been this Summer at Bury in Suffolke, to set up and gather a Church there, where (as I have it from good hands) they have gathered about seven persons, and kept their Conventicles togetherEdwards (1646), p. 170 Edwards alleged that the Chidleys worked together \\"one inditing, the other writing,\\" and that they had issued a polemical pamphlet against him from Bury. He was certain that their work in Suffolk was part of a wider pattern of planting such congregations. The theme of the high places dominated all of Samuel Chidley's contributions to his own church's mission in this period. Although explicitly directed against the Anglican and former Catholic places of worship, it was used exclusively in debates with other Independent churches which the members of the Separation or Church of God in London regarded as insufficiently rigorous and from which they wished to distinguish themselves. This became increasingly important as the attempt to impose a Presbyterian polity, which had so concerned all Independents, foundered in the face of opposition from within army.Shaw, volume 2, p. 34ff. The Presbyterian structures that had been built fell into neglect after 1648,Shaw, volume 2, p. 28. mainly because the Second English Civil War, stemming from the king's conspiracy to have himself restored by a Scottish invasion, finally discredited the Presbyterian system and its Parliamentarian supporters and brought effective toleration for the Independents. In August 1648 Samuel Chidley debated with John Goodwin, the minister of St. Stephen Coleman Street, who had attempted a compromise between a gathered church and a parish church: he used St Stephen's as a teaching and preaching base in this most turbulent and lively part of the capital, while administering communion only to the select group, not necessarily from the area, approved by himself and his elders.Johns, p. 41. Differences between Chidley and Goodwin initially centred on the domestic problems of the Goodsones: the husband, William Goodsone, an officer in the navy, attended Chidley's Separation, while his wife worshipped at St Stephen's, as Chidley outlined in a letter to Goodwin.Brown (1650), p. 9. It seems likely the two churches were close and to some extent competitors for local support. According to Brown's report, which was bundled with his notes on the earlier conference with Burton, the discussion began with Goodwin making the eirenic gambit: :Suppose it be granted that all our matter be so corrupt, as you presuppose it is, yet it is lawfull for your Members to communicate with ours; for saith he, it is lawfull for a man to communicate with one whom he doubts whether he be a Believer or not.Brown (1650), p. 10. This was contested by Chidley who took the rigorist position: :First, That whatsoever is doubtfull is not to be practised, though it be a thing indifferent, because it is not of faith, and therefore a sin, because whatsoever is not of faith is sin. Secondly, much more is he to forbeare that which is contrary to the word of God, as to communicate with one of whom we have not good testimony of his life and conversation, and that the work of grace is wrought upon him, that he is effectually called, and separated from Idolatry, and cleaveth unto the Way of Christ in purity. William Goodsone himself said that he could not be in communion with Goodwin's church \\"because Mr. Goodwins Peoples practice was to preach and heare in the Parrish-Churches of England, and to Worship in the Idolls Temples, and to Baptize the Children of unbelievers, and such like.\\" Almost immediately the debate moved on to the question of the high places,Brown (1650), p. 11. the separatists' distinctive theme, and did not stray from it until the end. Leveller Agreement of the People John Lilburne By the time of his debate with John Goodwin, Samuel Chidley had earned a reputation as a prominent Leveller. He and Thomas Prince became the treasurers of the movement, which was based on Independents within the army. With the key leaders, John Lilburne and Richard Overton in prison, Chidley and Prince were especially important in the latter part of 1647, as capable and literate proponents of the cause.Brailsford, p. 256. During this period, the first Agreement of the People took shape among the Agitators, the representatives of the soldiers, setting out a series of demands that they considered would protect the gains made in the Civil War and constituting a rejection of the army commanders' Heads of Proposals. The Agreement provided part of the agenda for the Putney Debates in October, between the army and its commanders. With the inconclusive ending of the debates, Samuel Chidley was one of those who took forward the Agreement as a propaganda document to a rendezvous of the army at Corkbush Field, near Ware, Hertfordshire, where the commanders hoped for a decision in favour of the Heads of Proposals and of Thomas Fairfax personally. It was rumoured that the army radicals were to be joined by a large force, up to 20,000, of London weavers,Brailsford, p. 289. a constituency to which Chidley had ready access. The resulting Corkbush Field mutiny of 15 November 1647 was suppressed mainly by the prompt action of Oliver Cromwell, who ordered the immediate execution by shooting of a single Leveller, Richard Arnold of Robert Lilburne's regiment.Brailsford, p. 296-7. Chidley seems to have been greatly exercised by the issue of capital punishment even at this stage, and an \\"inquisition for the blood\\"Brailsford, p. 311. of Private Arnold was one of the requests he and small delegation now took in a petition to Parliament, presented on 23 November 1647, and entitled \\"The humble Petition of many free- born People of England.\\"House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 23 November 1647: Petition from free-born People of England. The petition was included in a letter to the Speaker, William Lenthall, and sent to a committee, which quickly rejected it, on the ground that it was :a seditious and contemptuous Avowing and Prosecution of a former Petition, and Paper annexed, stiled, \\"An Agreement of the People,\\" formerly adjudged by this House to be destructive to the Being of Parliaments, and fundamental Government of the Kingdom. The Petition of the People had been submitted to the House two weeks earlier, on 9 November, when the expression \\"destructive to the Being of Parliaments, and to the fundamental Government of the Kingdom\\" was first used.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 9 November 1647: Petition of the People. The document made numerous demands about the conduct of Parliament and of elections, including that a dissolution of the Parliament be scheduled for 30 September 1648The Agreement of the People, as presented to the Council of the Army, s. 2. and that Parliaments thereafter be of a fixed two-year term, with elections on the first Thursday in March.The Agreement of the People, as presented to the Council of the Army, s. 3. The petition also challenged Parliamentary sovereignty by asserting that \\"the power of this, and all future Representatives of this Nation, is inferior only to theirs who choose them,\\"The Agreement of the People, as presented to the Council of the Army, s. 4. and proposing to exclude from political control \\"matters of religion and the ways of God's worship.\\" Having rejected these demands already as seditious, the House was now able to hold the Leveller petitioners as guilty of sedition and contempt of court. Chidley and Prince, described as a Cheesemonger, were imprisoned in the gatehouse of Parliament during the pleasure of the house.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 9 November 1647: Persons committed. The three Levellers accompanying the, Jeremy Ives, Thomas Taylor, and William Larner were committed to Newgate Prison. To rub salt in the wound, the House also deputed Sir John Evelyn to write a letter thanking Cromwell for the summary execution of Arnold and urging him to carry out further \\"condign and exemplary Punishment.\\" Chidley and Prince had escaped fairly lightly, in view of the possibility of a prosecution for sedition. It seems that Chidley's incarceration was short, as he was involved in organising a Leveller petition again in January 1648. The documents at the forefront of Leveller agitation at that time were John Lilburne's Earnest Petition,Brailsford, p. 320. which called for a greatly extended suffrage, election of magistrates and other constitutional innovations,Brailsford, p. 321. and The mournful cries of many thousand poor tradesmen, which drew attention to widespread economic distress.Brailsford, p. 324. It seems likely that Chidley played his part in arguing for these. He was almost certainly involved also in the 1649 petitioning of Parliament after the arrest of four Leveller leaders, Lilburne, Overton, William Walwyn and Prince: it is thought that his mother wrote the women's petition on this occasion.Brailsford, p. 317. However, the movement was effectively defeated or sidelined during the course of that year and Chidley's only other major involvement was when Lilburne was imprisoned for a final time in 1653.Brailsford, p. 616. When Katherine Chidley organised a women's petition, Edward Hyde, the royalist commentator, was told that it gathered over 6000 female signaturesCalendar of Clarendon State Papers, volume 2, p. 236-7 and that \\"the ringleader was the wife of one Chidley, a prime Leveller.\\" It is likely that Hyde mistook the relationship and meant Samuel Chidley: his father, Daniel, was by this time dead and had never been a \\"prime Leveller.\\" Businessman Although committed to an austere and rigorous Puritan sect and a radical political movement, Samuel Chidley found opportunities to prosper as a businessman and administrator. He became a Freeman of the Haberdasher's Company in 1649.Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. His father became a Master of the Company in the same yearHaberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. but does not seem to have long survived. Katherine Chidley continued her husband's business, probably with Samuel's help, and it was she who was named as payee for over ¬£350 worth of stockings for the army involved the final phases of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.Calendar of State Papers Domestic Series 1651‚Äì1652, p. 578.Calendar of State Papers Domestic Series 1651‚Äì1652, p. 586. In 1649, the year he became a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company, Samuel Chidley was appointed Register of Debentures, a post he acquired allegedly with the assistance of David Brown. This was part of Parliament's scheme to use the value of Crown Estates in England and Wales to meet the huge pay arrears of the New Model Army. The troops received, in lieu of pay, debentures that allowed them to purchase portions of the royal estates left owner-less by the execution of Charles I.Gentles (1976) The scheme was ultimately to realise ¬£1,434,239. The necessary legislation for the sale of the royal family's property was passed on 11 July 1649,House of Commons Journal Volume 6: 16 July 1649: Crown Lands. acknowledging in its preface that Parliament was \\"engaged both in Honor and Justice to make due satisfaction unto all Officers and Soldiers for their Arrears,\\"Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660: July 1649: An Act for sale of the Honors, Manors, Lands heretofore belonging to the late King, Queen and Prince. although Chidley's post had already been established on 22 June. He was based in Worcester House, then a prestigious address near St James Garlickhythe, used by the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers and with a notable view across the River Thames. Chidley used his post as an access point for private business, buying debentures speculatively on his own account and buying fifteen lots of crown land, not all for his own possession: the manor of Greens Norton in Northamptonshire was sold back to thirteen of the tenants. He did, however, build up a substantial property portfolio in London, mainly in the St Giles in the Fields and High Holborn areas. Accusations of fraud and lawsuits followed. It seems that David Brown, now disillusioned with Chidley's leadership of the Separation as well his personal probity, was behind some of the disquiet. In the resultant internal power struggle, Brown, who claimed to be one of the longest-serving members, was excommunicated from the sect. In 1652 Brown and Chidley clashed in print, with Chidley publishing a riposte to an attack by Brown on the Leveller leadership: The Dissembling Scot Set Forth in his Coulours. Chidley continued to prosper throughout the Protectorate. Campaigner and pamphleteer Chidley had written pamphlets earlier in his career. In the 1650s, however, he released a series of short leaflets, pamphlets and books, creating controversy and discussion. =Capital punishment= The Tyburn gallows, c. 1680. Chidley's campaign against the death penalty for theft was launched well before his 1652 book Retsah, a cry against a crying sinne, as it is made up documents he had already submitted in furtherance of his aims. Retsah was the transliteration, accepted at the time, of the Hebrew word for killing or murder in the Ten Commandments. Chidley's preface stated his position immediately: :THis little Book reflecteth upon all those who have broken the Statute Lawes of God, by killing of men merly for Theft, Let such sinners who are the Judges, or Executioners of such over-much Justice, be ashamed, and confounded for defiling the Land with Bloud;Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 2. There followed documents he had presented to the City of London Corporation, to Thomas Andrewes, who had been Lord Mayor of London for the year 1650‚Äì1, to the English Council of State and to Parliament's own committee on law reform. In his submission to London's councillors, Chidley made clear his contention that the lex talionis was a strict limit, not a minimum demand: :According to the rule of Equity, there is required life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe, . It is not life for eye, but eye for eye; not eye for tooth, but tooth for tooth; so that if a man require more it is iniquity, .Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 7. Colonel Pride refuses admission to the Presbyterian members of the Long Parliament. Pride was a prominent member of the Duppa church and a collaborator with Chidley until he felt he was being manipulated. However, the most substantial document was that presented to the Army Council by Colonel Thomas Pride, the instigator in 1648 of the famous Pride's Purge that cleared the Commons of its Presbyterian majority. Pride was a member of the Separation and seems to have been willing at this stage to associate himself with Chidley. The basic argument was set out as a near-syllogism. :That God is the only lawmaker;‚Ä¶ :God hath no where given liberty, but hath prohibited, that the life of any Man should be taken away for stealing‚Ä¶ :The putting them to death is expresly against the Law of God‚Ä¶Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 14. He added that the death penalty for theft permanently prevented the victim ever receiving due compensation. At several points in the argument, Chidley appeals not just to Biblical authority but to reason against what he calls \\"the irrationall and irregular proceedings of men.\\"Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 13. It had now been established by the courts, claimed Chidley, that only 13 pence need be stolen for the convicted thief to be hanged. :THis murdering Law is the cause wherefore many murders are committed by Robbers in the act of stealing, for the Theeves know its a hanging matter to steale, and its no more to commit murder.Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 15. Even more perversely, it discouraged prosecution, as the injured party knew the litigation might be costly and troublesome, without hope of recovering any losses.Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 16. Noting that the Biblical solution to the problem was enslavement for theft, Chidley suggested a period of forced labour to compensate the victim, as already practised in the Dutch Republic, mentioning plantation slavery or employment in the mines. However, this was presumably intended only for very serious cases, as he argued \\"They are not sold for ever, but only for their Theft, and its a worser slavery, and a great tyranny indeed, to take away their lives.\\"Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 17. He suggested a thief should generally be expected to make double restitution, but four-fold if the money had already been spent. Chidley did not take up fully the more difficult issue of capital punishment for murder, but was confident that \\"If this course were well followed, Tyburne would lose many Customers, for it would much abate the number of Theeves, and Murderers.\\"Chidley (1652). Retsah, p. 19. =Public debt= Chidley's campaign on public debt quickly led to a breach with Colonel Pride, the most prominent member of the Separation. Pride had both a professional and a personal interest in the issue of arrears in the army. He received debentures but also bought them from the men of his regiment, presumably using Chidley's good offices, and used them to acquire Nonsuch Great Park or Worcester Park in Surrey for ¬£11,591. However, Chidley launched a campaign in December 1652 for a more prompt settlement between the Rump Parliament and state creditors, who were offered repayment only if they \\"doubled\\", i.e. immediately advanced the identical sum again. He issued a leaflet announcing a mass petition to be organised at the Bell Savage Inn on Ludgate Hill. This and explicitly recommended the petition to those \\"are desirous to bee satisfied out of that Security which is propounded to the Parliament by Collonel PRIDE, D. GEURDAIN, and the rest of the UNDER-TAKERS on behalfe of the COMMON-WEALTH,\\"Chidley (1652). All those wel-affected Creditors of the Commonwealth. suggesting, perhaps intentionally, that Chidley's agitation was aligned with Pride's initiative. Moreover, the use of upper case type turned this into a major selling point. Pride, however, publicly dissociated himself from Chidley's venture, and the breach between the two men seems to have been permanent. Chidley continued his attempt to build a popular movement of creditors. In December 1653, after the dissolution of the Rump, he issued another pamphlet, A Remonstrance to the Creditors of the Common-Wealth of England, giving a critique of Parliament's arrangements for settling public debt, particularly its concentration of efforts on those who had served in Ireland rather the much older debts accrued in the English Civil War.Chidley (1653), page unnumbered. =Thunder from the Throne of God= St Botolph's Church, Boston, with its prominent tower, known as \\"the Stump.\\" In 1656 Chidley returned to an old theme, presenting to the Second Protectorate Parliament Thunder from the Throne of God Against the Temples of Idols, a denunciation of the \\"high places\\", packed with supporting Biblical texts and fiery rhetoric.Woodford, p. 9. Chidley inveighed in particular against bell towers and steeples as relics of the Catholic past, demanding their complete destruction: \\"Down with them and their Babylonish Bells, to the very ground, and let not a stone of them remain upon another.\\"Gaunt. Cromwellian Britain - Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon. The title was apparently inspired by a recent lightning strike at St Botolph's Church, Boston, a very prominent Lincolnshire landmark. The book is generally reckoned to have been written some years earlier, perhaps in early 1653. However, it certainly came before Parliament only in 1656. It seems that Chidley had the book delivered to the House of Commons, accompanied by a letter to Cromwell. It was drawn to the members' attention on 20 October 1656 by Colonel Jephson.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 20 October 1656: Obnoxious Publication. Chidley was summoned to the bar of the House and the book and letter shown to him: \\"Who acknowledged he wrote the Epistle; and doth own it, and all that is in it; and owns the Book too, and all in it, the Printer's Errors excepted.\\" The book was then referred to a committee, which included Jephson and Colonel Shapcott, an MP who had complained to the previous parliament when he became the subject of a scurrilous publication.Woodford, p. 8. Later in the session, the House decided to use the same committee for a more general review of censorship. It committed Chidley to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 20 October 1656: Regulating the Press. As on the previous occasion, he was not detained long: the House released him after hearing his humble petition on 28 October.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 28 October 1656: A Person discharged. =To His Highness= The following year Chidley issued a general diatribe addressed To his Highness the Lord Protector, and the Parliament of England, &c.; Beginning with a ringing announcement of the brotherhood of all humans in the image of God,Chidley (1657), p. 1. he went on to bemoan the inactivity of Parliament: :You have sate now above these 40 days twice told, and passed some Acts for transporting Corn and Cattel out of the Land, and against Charls Stuart's, &c.; but (as I humbly conceive) have left undone matters of greater concernment...Chidley (1657), p. 1-2. These lapses, he predictably announced, included a failure to abolish the death penalty for theft and leaving the public debt unpaid.Chidley (1657), p. 2. This allowed him to unite both issues in a picture of a land where there was no support for the poor, who were excluded from the enclosed fields and orchards, justice was denied, lawyers prospered by lying, while beggars and thieves swarmed.Chidley (1657), p. 3-4. He concluded by pointing out the responsibility for the state of the nation lay with Parliament, urging it to \\"unbinde, loosing the bnds of wickedness, undoing the heavy burdens, and letting the oppressed go free, and breaking every yoke.\\" Increasing difficulties Chidley seems to have become increasingly dogged by ill-fortune and political change as well as his own mistakes in the later years of the Protectorate: a pattern that continued after 1660. On 9 May 1657 he again clashed with the House of Commons. Although the circumstances are unclear, the House noted that Chidley was involved in legal action against Robert Fenwick, an MP for Northumberland, and Ralph Darnall, a Commons official and brother of the prominent lawyer Philip Darnall. By bringing against them Subpoenas from the Court of Chancery while the House was in session, Chidley had breached parliamentary privilege. Once again the House committed him to custody as a delinquent.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 9 May 1657: Privilege. In 1659 Chidley and his wife, Mary, were summoned to the Court of King's Bench, charged with a serious assault on a servant girl. The return of the monarchy in 1660 brought far greater difficulties. Crown lands were taken back into royal ownership, despite an apparent promise to the contrary in the Declaration of Breda. This effectively ruined Chidley and many like him, whose fortunes were founded on land speculation under the Commonwealth. The publication information he attached to RetsahChidley (1652). Retsah, p. 1. and the Remonstrance on public debt both showed Chidley living on Bow Lane, near St Mary-le-Bow. A decade later, in 1662, he was in a house of two hearths in Chequer Alley in the Bishopsgate Ward,Hearth Tax: City of London 1662, Bishopgate ward, Chequer Alley. part of the densely populated areaJohns, p. 33. to the east of Coleman Street. Chidley seems to have suffered all the vicissitudes of Restoration London. In 1664 he was imprisoned as a Nonconformist, for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. Although the details are unknown, he is said to have lost his family in 1665's Great Plague of London and much of his remaining property in 1666's Great Fire of London. In 1668 he was imprisoned again as a disturber of the peace. Last years and death Chidley is known to have spent his last years in his native Shrewsbury, where he occupied a house with a single hearth in 1672. He died some time thereafter.

It was known for bicycles of higher quality and lower weight than other bicycles of its time. Despite a nationwide bicycle craze in the late 1800s, the company was undercut by lower-priced competition, nearly went bankrupt in 1897, and never recovered from an 1899 fire. The company was sold in 1900. History Albert Overman started the Overman Wheel Company in 1882 in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts with an investment of $62,000. Overman were the first American manufacturers of the safety bicycle. In 1888 the company began making its own bicycles, with a staff of about thirty men. At its height, the factory employed about 1,400 men in five buildings. The factory produced 80,000 bicycles per year, the only bicycle factory at the time which made the entire bicycle. Victor Bicycle The flagship product of the Overman Company was the Victor Bicycle. The Victor Bicycle made extensive use of interchangeable parts, an innovation which allowed the owner to make minor repairs, without bringing the bicycle to a professional mechanic. The metal parts of the Victor bicycle were all steel; it was the first bicycle to use no cast metal parts. It was also one of the first bicycles to use a hollow pneumatic tire. The Overman Victor \\"Flyer\\" of 1893 The first Victor bicycle, introduced in 1883, was a three-wheeled bicycle produced in Chicopee Falls. It was the first American-made three-wheeler. Three-wheelers were at the time considered a safer alternative to the high wheeler bicycle and started to gain in popularity. Overman also manufactured some high-wheelers in the 1880s. By 1886-1887, new safety bicycles, introduced by John Kemp Starley, were becoming popular in England. While most American manufacturers stuck with the traditional high-wheel bicycles, Overman rushed a safety bicycle to production before the end of 1887. Despite its higher price, Overman's safety bicycle quickly became a sensation. Overman soon followed up with innovations such as a hollow core \\"cushion tire.\\" By 1893, Overman's Victor bicycle was considered an elegant, premium machine, the \\"highest grade bicycle of 1893\\". It was correspondingly priced at the high end of the market. The Overman factory made the complete bicycle, including tires, saddles, rims, etc. By 1895, eight models of the Victor were offered; five heights for men, two heights for women, and a racer which was available in five different heights. The 1895 Victoria Ladies' Bicycle sold for US$100. The Overman Wheel Company was a pioneer in using testing equipment to measure things like bicycle power output and tire elasticity. This gave Victor bicycles a significant weight advantage over competitors of the time. The Overman factory complex was made up of three buildings, and was located in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. It was considered the \\"most complete bicycle plant in the United States.\\" The company had offices in Boston, New York, Detroit, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon. Downfall Victor bicycle advertisement Overman had contracted with the Spalding sports equipment company as their sole bicycle distributor. This worked well for a few years, but by about 1892 or 1893, the two companies had a serious falling out. The two companies first brought lawsuits against each other for thousands of dollars. Then they began competing head-to-head for the sporting goods market. The Spalding company started making their own line of bicycles in their own factory in Chicopee Falls, and the Overman company entered the sporting goods market with baseballs, bats, footballs, and boxing gloves, \\"everything in the sporting goods line that the Spaldings made.\\" Spalding wasn't the only new competition faced by Overman. In 1896, there was simultaneously a bicycle craze and an economic slump, such that hundreds of manufacturers got into the bicycle business. People were buying bicycles, \\"whether they could afford them or not\\". This created a massive over-production, followed by a crash in bicycle prices. Despite this competition, Overman held firm to its $100 bicycle prices, which hurt sales. By December 1897, the company, facing bankruptcy, was in debt for over a half-million dollars, their shops closed, and hundreds of employees were thrown out of work. Creditors extended a last- minute effort to revive the company on January 1, 1898. By May 1899, the company was desperately trying to regain market share by slashing bicycle prices down to $40. A fire broke out at the Overman factory on November 23, 1899, creating considerable fire and water damage. Overman sold his bicycle business to the Stevens Arms & Tool Co. of Chicopee Falls, MA in 1900. Overman Automobile Company As early as 1899, Overman was turning his attention to automobiles. In 1901 Overman reorganized as the Overman Automobile Company, which sold a vehicle called the Victor Steam Carriage. Sales were not very high, and the company merged with Locomobile Company of America in 1904. Albert H. Overman Albert H. Overman Albert H. Overman was born in Fulton County, Illinois, on March 21, 1850. He started experimenting with wooden human-powered vehicles in his youth. He graduated from Illinois State Normal University. In 1881 he left Chicago and moved east. Albert married Millie E. Benton in 1873. The Overmans lived in a mansion in Springfield, Massachusetts, three miles from his factories. They were known for entertaining lavishly. Overman died July 30, 1930, in Westmoreland, New Hampshire, of a cerebral hemorrhage.

In 1957, members of the society in Northern Rhodesia formed the Constitution Party, which sought to promote Capricornist ideals. A multi-racial party, its membership included several prominent political figures, including Stirling, Harry Franklin, Stewart Gore- Browne, Lawrence Chola Katilunga, Gabriel Musumbulwa and Alexander Scott. However, after failing in the 1958 elections, it was disbanded. Its position as the bastion of Northern Rhodesian liberalism by the Central Africa Party. The Northern Rhodesian branch of the Capricorn Africa Society was subsequently dissolved in 1961. Aims The society's aims were stated in the Capricorn Declarations in 1952: \\"We hold that all men, despite their varying talents, are equal in dignity before God and have a common duty towards one another... We hold that the differences between men, whether of creed or color, are honorable differences.\\" The organisation sought to unleash the industrial potential of East‚ÄìCentral Africa. However, the sparse population and lack of indigenous skills and capital made the area a power vacuum. The society saw a \\"partnership of Africans and immigrant Europeans working together... for the benefit of both\\" as a means of filling this vacuum and positively integrating the region into the world economy. The Society issued declarations at the end of 1952 as an \\"interim statement\\". Six months later a full manifesto was published.

Its failure in March 1985 led to a bank holiday for 70 other savings institutions that were insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a private organization. Background Home State Savings Bank was the largest savings institution in Ohio, with $1.4 billion in assets. It was owned by Marvin L. Warner, a local real estate developer and investor. He bought the bank in 1958. Warner had been a part owner of the New York Yankees and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1970s, and was the original owner of the United States Football League Birmingham Stallions. Warner was also a substantial political donor, and had been appointed as the United States ambassador to Switzerland in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Downfall ESM Government Securities, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was a securities brokerage firm specializing in term repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. The company was shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 1985. The company had incurred large losses and had pledged collateral to more than one lender. Home State Savings Bank was doing substantial business with ESM. After ESM failed, it was revealed that Home State would suffer a loss of about $150 million from their transactions with ESM. A run on the bank ensued with over $100 million withdrawn in a few days. The bank was closed on March 9, 1985. Bank runs ensued on other institutions insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund after it was revealed that the fund had insufficient funds to pay off Home State depositors. On March 15, 1985, Ohio Governor Dick Celeste declared a three-day banking holiday for the 70 other savings institutions covered by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund. They were then told to remain closed until they obtained federal deposit insurance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or until they merged.Chronology of Home State Scandal The Blade: Toledo Ohio March 3, 1987 Aftermath Home State Savings Bank was sold on May 29, 1985, to Hunter Savings Association, a part of American Financial Group, and the bank reopened on June 14, 1985.

Biography Birgit √Ökesson trained as a dancer at Mary Wigman's school in Dresden from 1929‚Äì31. After having danced with her a few years, √Ökesson knew she wanted something else from this art, but she could not quite put her finger on it yet. She wanted to explore the body‚Äôs possibilities and limitations. She then decided to go to Paris and start from zero. According to her, she listened to her body and the memories that were stored in it. In 1934 she made her debut with her very own choreography at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in Paris, but her real breakthrough came only in 1951, when she performed two solos, one in complete silence. After these performances the press went wild and she soon became one of the leading figures in European avant-garde dance.Contemporary Dance in Sweden, Bodil Persson, Svenska Institutet 2007, sidan 14. In the 1950s, she worked together with text and music printer Erik Lindegren and Karl-Birger Blomdahl, and created various works at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. She mainly created ballets, but also dance scenes in the opera Aniara, where √Ökesson's role in the 1959 set are among the most famous. Aniara was an example of an avant-garde idiom in expressionist dance. She left the Opera in 1967 and subsequently spent much time on research trips. √Ökesson wanted to find the real essence of dance and its roots, which brought her to Africa. She said that the dance in Europe had lost contact with their origin, and the best ways to study the origins were in Africa. From there she collected a number of dance masks from different countries. After √Ökesson‚Äôs death, her collection of dance masks was donated to the Museum of Ethnography, Sweden, whom subsequently had a show of them in 2008. Birgit √Ökesson was one of Sweden‚Äôs pioneering choreographers during the 1900s. In 1998 she was awarded the Swedish Academy‚Äôs grand prize. She received an honorary doctorate from Stockholm University in 1999. She together with Egon M√∏ller-Nielsen had one daughter, Mona. She was married to Carl Fredrik Reutersw√§rd.

Following military service during World War II, he joined the Department of External Affairs in October 1945 as second secretary in the political intelligence section.  Career  Whilst Australian Ambassador to Greece between 1968 and 1972, Gilchrist developed a fascination with Greek-Australian history. Whilst living in Athens, Gilchrist heard the story of Diamantina Bowen (n√©e di Roma), a noblewoman from Greece and later the wife of the first Governor of Queensland, George Bowen. Gilchrist's commitment to Greece and the Greek people stayed with him into his retirement, when he began researching to write the three volume Australians and Greeks. The New South Wales Migration Heritage Centre described the trilogy as containing both \\"definitive history... and an entertaining array of colourful characters and stories\\". In 1992, the first volume of Australians and Greeks was published, The Early Years. The second volume, The Middle Years, followed in 1997. In 1998, Gilchrist was awarded the Gold Cross of St Andrew by the Greek Archdiocese of Sydney. Volume III, The Later Years, was issued in 2004.

The incident escalated from the government's crackdown on unlicensed street hawkers during the Chinese New Year holidays. Eventual violent clashes broke out between police and protesters, resulting in injuries on both sides. The Hong Kong government has classified the violent incident as a riot (Êó∫ËßíÊö¥Âãï), while some media outlets and social media platforms have opted for calling the event the \\"Fishball Revolution\\" (È≠öËõãÈù©ÂëΩ), in reference to fishballs, a popular Hong Kong street food. The violence has been described by The Economist as \\"the worst outbreak of rioting since the 1960s.\\" Background =Political context= After the 2014 protests, the popularity of Leung Chun-ying continued to be low, dropping slightly below the low point it had during the protests. His administration also received poor popularity ratings in a survey by HKPOP, an institute affiliated with the University of Hong Kong. The relationship between the Hong Kong Police Force, often referred to as \\"Asia's finest\\" in the past, and the public also became strained mainly due to a number of controversies, including the beating of protester Ken Tsang by seven plainclothes officers in Admiralty, the indiscriminate clubbing of members of the public by superintendent Franklin Chu in Mong Kok during the 2014 protests and the considerable delay for them to be prosecuted ‚Äì in the case of Chu, the police refused to prosecute. The events of 2014 spawned a number of new activist groups with some taking an anti-government and militant stance. Hong Kong Indigenous, a localist group formed in early 2015, had previously been involved in violent clashes with police in several anti- parallel trading protests. The various localist groups hold a strong anti- mainland sentiment, generally with the view that the increasing political and economic integration of Hong Kong and Mainland China, as well as the influx of Mainland tourists and immigrants are undermining the autonomy and identity of Hong Kong. =Hawkers crackdown= The Chinese New Year holidays have traditionally attracted many unlicensed hawkers (street vendors), selling Hong Kong street food and other products, at popular locations including Sai Yeung Choi Street, Mong Kok and Kweilin Street, Sham Shui Po. Despite operating without licence, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) had, in the past, not taken action against hawkers during the New Year holidays. However, in the years prior to the unrest, the FEHD had begun monitoring unlicensed cooked food hawkers during the Chinese New Year at night markets over fears of unsanitary practices, obstruction of roadways and general disruption. During Chinese New Year in 2014, FEHD staff conducted surprise inspections at Kweilin Street Night Market making arrests and confiscating stalls causing some public disquiet. However, shortly after the FEHD officers departed, the hawkers returned and a lively night market resumed. In November 2014 Sham Shui Po District Council, passed a motion of \\"zero tolerance\\" towards unlicensed hawkers for the upcoming Chinese New Year. However, grassroots organisations complained that, due to the government's refusal to issue new hawker licences or construct new markets, hawkers could only subsist by defying the law; they further asserted that Kweilin Street night market was enjoying a resurgence in popularity and a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy would only exacerbate grievances. During Chinese New Year in 2015, there were at least three groups giving vocal support to street vendors in Sham Shui Po with Hong Kong Indigenous embarking on a campaign of street cleaning to allay concerns over hygiene. In 2016, however, street hawkers were put under pressure by a citywide FEHD crackdown which drew discontent from locals. From the evening of 2 February 2016, in the run up to Chinese New Year, hawkers in Tuen Mun who were setting up stall outside a mall near Leung King Estate, operated by Link REIT, were opposed by a group of masked men identifying themselves as \\"management\\" and claiming to represent The Link. These men later insisted that hawkers could no longer set up in or around the estate, so as not to affect the mall tenants. During the late night market, a number of incidents occurred but were not acted upon by police. On the evening of 7 February, Chinese New Year's Eve, tens of hawkers began setting up stall in Kwelin Street night market but were chased away by the FEHD. Sociology lecturer and activist Lau Siu-lai, wishing to provoke public debate over the hawker issue, acted in deliberate defiance of the FEHD and was arrested. Originally wishing just to enjoy the ambience of the street market, Lau was arrested when she began to help sell grilled cuttlefish in defiance of the FEHD officers and her arrest was ordered by the senior officer present. There was disquiet over her arrest at the scene, and a number of protesters immediately went to picket the Sham Shui Po Police Station where she was held. That night and through the next day activists began to contact hawkers to encourage them to set up stall in Mong Kok, and also began the online call for supporters to protect local Hong Kong distinctiveness. Course of events On 8 February, the first day of the Chinese New Year, FEHD officers attempted to patrol the side streets of Mong Kok. Hong Kong Indigenous called for action online to shield the hawkers, and by around 9 pm a few hundred had gathered and verbally assaulted the FEHD officers. At around 10 pm, a taxi driving into Portland Street accidentally hit an old man. Protesters blocked the road and prevented the taxi from leaving. The Hong Kong Police arrived and surrounded the car, warning others not to get closer. The police left shortly after and returned with a portable podium for crowd control at 11:45 pm, this sparked anger in the crowd. Around midnight, violent clashes broke out between police and protesters as police urged them to clear the street. The police put on protective gear, including helmets and shields and used batons and pepper spray on the protesters, while some of the protesters, equipped with home-made shields, goggles, helmets and gloves, threw projectiles at the police. At around 2 am, a traffic police officer was injured on Argyle Street. Protesters continued to surround the injured officer and attacking him with projectiles, prompting his colleagues to approach the scene to protect him. One such officer fired two warning shots into the air in an attempt to prevent further advancement of the protesters. Warning shots are not permitted in the Use of Force guidelines in the Police Force Ordinance. The scene descended into chaos as protesters charged the police line and engaged in scuffles and fighting with the police and tossed glass bottles and rubbish bins at them, At 2:30 am, more police arrived at the scene to disperse the protesters. The standoff subsequently moved to Nathan Road at 3 am. At 4 am, the first of multiple fires was started in Sai Yeung Choi Street South, followed by three more ignited in the same street. Some protesters set fire to rubbish bins surrounding Shantung Street and Soy Street, including the junctions of Fife Street and Portland Street and of Nathan Road and Nelson Street, these were put out by the police and firemen. Both lanes of Nathan Road were blocked from south of Argyle Street and the Mong Kok MTR station was shut down. At 4:30 am, the Special Tactical Squad were deployed in the intersection of Soy Street and Sai Yeung Choi Street South as a result of failure of combatant from the police force and the escalation of the rioters. They successfully cleared the protesters within 30 seconds. However after 5 minutes, due to lack of reinforcements, they were forced to fully fall back, with one constable injured. A fire set in Soy Street by the rioters on the morning of 9 February. At 7:15 am, protesters were dispersed from Soy Street near Fa Yuen Street, following a long standoff, after police officers of the Police Tactical Unit were deployed. Protesters gradually dispersed around 8 am. The streets in Mong Kok were calm by 9:00 am, and Mong Kok MTR station was reopened at 9:45 am. A total of 61 people were arrested, including Edward Leung, spokesman of the Hong Kong Indigenous and candidate for the Legislative Council by-election. One of the members of Youngspiration, another localist group, was also arrested. 90 police officers and several reporters were also injured in the violence. The Hong Kong Journalists Association said that a Ming Pao journalist was beaten by a policeman despite declaring his identity. Reporters from broadcasters RTHK and TVB were also injured by protesters. =Incidences of intimidation at Leung King Estate by \\"management\\"= Separate minor conflicts continued to occur at Leung King Plaza in Leung King Estate, Tuen Mun where hawkers had gathered. A group of men dressed in dark jackets with \\"manager\\" (ÁÆ°ÁêÜÂì°) printed on the backs were reported to be acting, according to residents and hawkers, in an intimidating manner nightly since 2 February. More than 200 showed up to protest against the men combating the hawkers on the night of 8 February. Some minor clashes broke out between the self-proclaimed managers and the protesters, and required mediation by the police. Two protesters were arrested and one reporter was injured during the clash. Conflicts between the control team and the public reoccurred on the night of 9 February. The control team was filmed beating up protesters while police stood by and prevented others from being involved. A reporter was also beaten up by the control team. A 31-year-old man was arrested for causing disorder in a public place. He allegedly interfered with a worker performing his duties at Leung King Estate. The Link REIT distanced itself from the clashes and denied the hawker control team was part of its staff. Reactions =Chinese government= Following the incident the central government declared the localist groups, which it deemed responsible for the violence, as \\"separatists\\". On 11 February, more than two days after the unrest, a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the \\"riot [was] plotted mainly by local radical separatist organisation ... The Chinese central government believes and firmly supports the Hong Kong SAR government and the police in safeguarding social security, protecting Hong Kong residents and their property, and punishing illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the law, so as to maintain the overall stability of the Hong Kong society.\\" Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Zhang Xiaoming, branded participants as \\"radical separatists\\" who were \\"inclined toward terrorism.\\" The People's Liberation Army released a statement holding \\"individual local radical separatist organisation(s)\\" responsible for the riot as well as criticising western media for \\"beautifying the unrest\\" in its early reports. =Hong Kong government= The Hong Kong Police referred to the event as a \\"riot\\" and the protestors a \\"mob\\". \\"Radical elements have come with self-made weapons and shields and clashed with police,\\" Crusade Yau Siu-kei, deputy Mong Kok district commander said. \\"The situation ran out of control and became a riot.\\" It also said it does not rule out the riot was \\"organised\\", claiming that prearranged vehicles were used by protesters to transport equipment. The police released a statement released at 3:23 am on 9 February, strongly condemning the clashes in Mong Kok, and defending its \\"resolute actions\\" including the deployment of batons, pepper spray to stop \\"unlawful violence acts,\\" and vowed \\"resolute enforcement actions will be taken against any illegal acts to preserve public order and safeguard public safety.\\" Another statement released at 6 am said: \\"Police reiterate that any acts endangering public order and public safety will not be tolerated. The Hong Kong community regard that the public should express their views in a rational and peaceful manner. Police will take enforcement actions decisively on law-breaking behaviours.\\" The Hong Kong government condemned the protests, saying \\"mobs have taken part in a riot in Mong Kok, attacking police officers on duty and media covering the incident at the site\\" in a statement. It stated that \\"the mobs would be apprehended and brought to justice.\\" Chief Executive Leung Chun- ying justified the police firing of warning shots, as the rioters had attacked policemen who were already injured and lying on the ground. \\"Any big city facing a similar nature of events would classify it as a riot, not just for the government but society as a whole,\\" he said. \\"The police exercised maximum restraint\\" when compared with other western countries. =Politicians= Ip Kwok-him, a Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) legislator and chairman of panel of Security of the Legislative Council, defended the police decision to open fire as \\"appropriate\\" given the critical circumstances and believed it was an organised crime. Yau Tsim Mong District Council chairman Chris Ip Ngo-tung, a DAB member, also condemned the violent actions, stating his belief that the people of Hong Kong \\"would not agree with such barbarian acts.\\" He thanked police and reporters for their duties during the events. The Democratic Party, a pro-democracy party, also released a statement saying that it condemns and does not tolerate any violence and acts of arson, while sending their sympathy to the injured. It urged a full investigation over the firing of warning shots by a police officer, and asked the government to reflect on the underlying problems such as the people's frustration, their loss of faith in the government, and the government's hawker policy. Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a thinktank close to Beijing, suggested that the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, the proposed national security law which is strongly opposed by the Hong Kong public, should be introduced in the wake of the Mong Kok unrest. =Student groups= Seven local university student unions issued statements condemning police violence and declaring their support for those who took part in the protests in Mong Kok. The Hong Kong University Students‚Äô Union (HKUSU) issued a statement entitled \\"Forever we stand with the rebels\\", pledging that they \\"shall never turn our back on or leave them alone and unassisted.\\" The Hong Kong Baptist University Students' Union's statement also condemned the government and the police for the unreasonable arrest of protesters, beating up journalists and oppressing Hong Kong Indigenous members. \\"Between the high wall and the egg, we will always stand on the side of the egg,\\" it said. The Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong criticised police action and said that the fire of resistance had been ignited by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. \\"Hongkongers must remember the totalitarian regime and unite,\\" it said. =Activist groups= Scholarism, a student activist group that took a leading role in the 2014 protests, condemned police for the excessive use of force since the 2014 protests. The group expressed shock at the police's deliberate provocation of citizens and for escalating violence on protestors. Joshua Wong, the group's convenor, disagreed with the violence, noting that peaceful protest did not achieve any change, blamed the government for the increasing divisions in Hong Kong society and the radicalisation of protests since 2014 Hong Kong protests. Wong questioned the rapidity of the police arrests on this occasion compared with the apparent stalling in prosecuting the officers accused of beating Ken Tsang during the Umbrella Revolution. Ray Wong, convenor of Hong Kong Indigenous who also took a role in the early stage of the protests, disagreed with Leung Chun-ying framing the clashes as \\"riot\\", stating that protestors were only helping the hawkers to do business until the police rushed into Shantung Street at midnight. He dismissed the claim that the violent clashes were staged. He thought that throwing bricks should not be considered as fierce, as compared to other countries. He also believed that firing warning shots was inappropriate. =Journalists= The Hong Kong News Executives' Association, the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association, and the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) all released statements condemning the acts of violence and verbal assaults against reporters, as well as the prevention of reporters from reporting. The Hong Kong News Executives' Association stated that these actions were a serious impediment to the freedom of the press, destroyed the rule of law in Hong Kong, and deprived the public of their right to know. =Social media= Hong Kong social media users took to Twitter using the hashtag #fishballrevolution, in reference to a popular street food. Some highlighted the fact that the protest was about the problems faced by street food hawkers, while the other suggested that violent factions had hijacked the protest for their own ends. Google Trends showed a sharp uptick in interest over fishball in the light of the unrest, with searches for \\"fishball\\" jumping 34 per cent and \\"fish ball\\" 26 per cent, mainly from Singapore and the Philippines. Subsequent events =Arrests= Between the end of the protests and 10 February 54 men and 9 women have been arrested for suspected involvement in the unrest. Edward Leung and around 20 members and volunteers of the group were arrested. A member of Youngspiration and another from Civic Passion, two localist groups, were also arrested. Their alleged offences include participating in unlawful assembly, attacking police officers, refusing to be arrested, obstructing police and carrying weapons. 38 of them have been charged with rioting under the Public Order Ordinance (), which was amended in 1970 in the wake of the 1967 Leftist riots. A lone man, who was walking towards Argyle Street on 8 February and who then found himself surrounded by ten police in riot gear, was arrested on charges of obstructing police but later charged with \\"rioting\\". A video showing the events leading up to the arrest, showing that he followed orders shouted at him by police, quickly went viral. On 10 February Derek Lam (ÊûóÊ∑≥Ëªí), a 22-year-old member of Scholarism, was arrested by the police at the Hong Kong airport while en route to a vacation in Taiwan with his family. He was taken into custody and subsequently charged with rioting. The group confirmed that Lam was present in Mong Kok from 10:00 pm Monday night to 2:15 am, but was not involved in the violence. The police also attempted to search Lam's flat without a warrant but were prevented by Lam's lawyer. Scholarism protested at the \\"arbitrary\\" arrest, and the Divinity School of Chung Chi College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where Lam was a student, also defended Lam and denied he had been involved in the riots. The school also demanded the police provide justification for his arrest. Police suspected a possible link of an eco- warehouse in Kwai Chung to the Mong Kok unrest. On 11 February morning, three people, a 34-year-old architectural draftsman, an unemployed woman aged 46 and a woman aged 47 who sold organic food, were arrested on suspicion of possessing offensive weapons with intent after the police raided their leased unit in the Vigor Industrial Building. A number of items that police deemed were offensive weapons, including 18 knives, wooden batons, metal rods, water pipes, surgical masks, work gloves, Walkie-talkies, a toy gun and bottles of liquid and crystallised chemicals of unknown composition were seized. However, the environmental protection group \\"Oh Yes It's Free\\" ‚Äì which operates the warehouse aiming to categorising rubbish and recycling it ‚Äì protested that those arrested were innocent and the confiscated articles were donations they had received from the public. The goods and materials found at the site were collected as part of the group's philosophy of reuse and recycling and were temporarily stored in the warehouse awaiting treatment, disposal or collection by the next public. On 11 February, police raided the home of Hong Kong Indigenous convener Ray Wong in Tseung Kwan O but did not find him. Subsequently, Wong disappeared from all media contact. Wong was arrested at a friend's residence in Tin Shui Wai on 22 February for \\"incitement to riot and possessing prohibited items\\". By 23 February, a total number of 74 people had been arrested in connection to the clashes, of which more than 40 were charged with rioting. =Complaints against police= A Ming Pao journalist, surnamed Tang, filed a formal complaint with the Complaints Against Police Office after he was filmed being pushed down and beaten by officers. In the video, Tang is heard identifying himself repeatedly as a journalist. Ming Pao released a statement condemning the police officers involved and called upon the force to investigate. =Official inquiry= The Hong Kong government flatly rejected holding an independent inquiry into the civil unrest, and its official statement caused controversy. In referring to the Mong Kok incident as a \\"riot\\" and the 1967 leftist riots, lasting over six months and led to over 50 deaths, as \\"disturbances\\", the government apparently sought to redefined the 1967 riots as legitimate political struggle. On 9 February, police commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung announced that a \\"full investigation\\" will be held to determine whether the firing of two warning shots by an unidentified police officer was appropriate. =Disappointment within police force= Frontline police officers were reported deeply disappointed with their senior management that left more than 90 officers wounded. They were disappointed with Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung's announcement of a full investigation. \\"What does he need to investigate? Lo should have stood up for the frontline officers who were beaten up and attacked by the mob, like [former commissioner Andy Tsang] did in the past,\\" an officer said. Lo was questioned whether he could safeguard the pride and dignity of the force when he appeared \\"soft\\" and \\"feeble\\" to the public. An officer slammed the force for poor arrangements and inadequate gear, citing the least equipped traffic officers being at the very front to handle the protestors. He questioned if a political agenda was behind the decision not to use tear gas. He suggested the use of rubber bullets would be justified in the face of such a violent, large- scale riot. Junior Police Officers‚Äô Association chairman Joe Chan Cho-kwong appealed to Legislative Council to back the use of \\"new model weapons and gears\\", including water cannons to maintain public order. =New Territories East by-election= In the Legislative Council New Territories East by- election took place on 28 February, Edward Leung Tin-kei who took a main role in the unrest, received a better-than-expected result by taking 66,524 votes, 15% of the total votes, coming behind pro-democratic Civic Party Alvin Yeung (37%) and Beijing-loyalist DAB Holden Chow (35%).

Biography Before WWII he was a teacher and a headmaster. Active in the French Resistance, he was elected as mayor of his home town Lamentin in 1945.

It was Philips' first entry into musical instruments and targeted the home market.  History  The Philicorda came out of the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium in Eindhoven, under Tom Dissevelt and Dick Raaijmakers, who worked on electronic music and electronic musical instruments; it was here that the prototype of the AG7400 organ was produced.  1960s Models  The AG7400 was launched onto the market in 1961, as a four-octave, 49 keys single manual, beginning with tone C version. Unusually for the time, it offered several audio inputs and outputs. The organ also shipped with a volume pedal and offered three settingsorgan, organ with bass keys and single-finger chords. The AG7400 did not have an internal speaker. At the beginning of 1963, its successor, the AG7500, was officially launched as the Philicorda. As well as the AG 7500/00, various other versions were produced amongst others for the English (AG7500/11?) and German (AG7500/22) markets. Located below the AG7500 was a tube amplifier with speakers. The AG7600, launched soon after, was a soundbar type separate amplifier with loudspeakers and offered a spring reverb effect. The Philicorda 751 (22GM751 with various country specific suffixes such as 22GM751/22 for Germany) was launched in 1967, some of them had both valves (preamp stage) and transistors, followed by the 22GM752, which was fully transistorized. A later model, the 22GM753, launched at the end of 1967, was designed for the stage and was fully transistorized. Although Philicordas, from the AG7400 to the 22GM753, had slight differences in sound, the Philicorda's typical warm tone, produced using cold cathode tube oscillators, was consistent over the years.  Single-Finger Chords  Each Philicorda had 17 pre-programmed chords (C - A7 - Dm - Eb - Em - F - D - G - E7 - Am - B - G7 - Cm - B9 - Gm - F7 - C7), although key assignments varied between models.  Licensing  In the US, the Philicorda 753 was distributed by J. C. Penney under the Penncrest name, available in blue or black, as opposed to the previous natural wood finishes.  1970s Models  The GM754 was launched in the early 1970s, with altered chord availability, speaker holes below the chassis and sliders instead of knobs. The GM760 series were double-manual organs. In the late 1970s, Philips launched the double-manual PhilicordaRhythm series.  In pop music  In the 1960s, the Philicorda was utilized by bands including The Monks. In recent years, the organ has undergone a revival. Notable users include Nick Power of The Coral and Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake. The Philicorda also features on 19 by Adele.

He studied architecture in 1819-20 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under the tutelage of Christian Frederik Hansen. Thielemann was mainly taught the Neoclassical style but during the 1880s Historicism flourished and he adapted to the new style. After graduation Thielemann worked for Christian Frederik Hansen and Gustav Friedrich Hetsch as a conductor for their projects. In 1851 Thielemann replaced Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll as royal building inspector of Jutland and Fuenen. His tenure was notable for his careful treatment of old buildings. Thielemann frequently re-used the original materials during restoration projects and preferred to rebuild in the original style. His best known remaining works are the main building of Vilhelmsborg Manor (1843) and the old Aarhus city hall (1857‚Äì58). Thielemann also drew up plans for an expansion of Jydske Asyl which was initially rejected as being too expensive but during the 1856-57 expansion the designs were incorporated into the project by the architect Ferdinand Meldahl on behest of Carl Emil Fenger.

It has smooth white to greyish bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus fraseri is a tree or mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth white to greyish bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, dark bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish to glaucous, petiolate leaves that are egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides when mature, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven or nine on a thick, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical operculum that is often striated. Flowering occurs between January and March or April and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Balladonia gum was first formally in 1972 by Ian Brooker in the journal Nuytsia and was given the name Eucalyptus conglobata subsp. fraseri. Brooker collected the type specimen near Balladonia. In 1976, Brooker raised the subspecies to species status as Eucalyptus fraseri. The specific epithet (fraseri) honours Sir Malcolm Fraser, Surveyor General of Western Australia from 1872 to 1883. In 2001, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus fraseri (Brooker) Brooker subsp. fraseri has smooth bark throughout; * Eucalyptus fraseri subsp. melanobasis L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill has a stocking of thick, hard black bark on the lower of the trunk. Distribution and Habitat Eucalyptus fraseri grows in open shrubland on open plains, low dunes and hilly areas between Norseman, Scaddan and Balladonia growing in calcareous loam or sandy soils over limestone. Subspecies melanobasis has a distribution restricted to the upper parts of the Fraser Range. Conservation status Subspecies fraseri is classified as \\"not threatened\\" but subspecies melanobasis is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

Early life and education  Edwin Ume-Ezeoke was the ninth son of his father's fourteen sons and was born at Obiagu village, Amichi to Igwe Umeorimili Orji Ezeoke and Lolo Ugbana Umeorimili Ezeoke (later baptized and renamed Elizabeth). His father became a warrant chief in 1914 and held that position until his death on 23 June 1952. His mother was the daughter of Igwe Dim Oriaku Udensi of the present day Ihitenansa in present day Imo State. A free minded child, kind and exceptionally friendly with his brothers and age mates, Edwin, was surrounded with love. His Father being the President of the Customary Court by virtue of his position as the traditional ruler of the town, traveled a lot and always took his son Edwin with him. It was during these trips to the Customary Court combined with his occasional presence at the settlement of inter-village disputes that his interest in the study of Law was born. Young Edwin's education commenced at St.Eugenia's Catholic Primary School, Obiagu Village, Amichi in 1943. Displaying early signs of leadership abilities, he was made the class monitor and was saddled with the responsibility of being the school regulator/bell ringer. He captained the school football team and participated actively in athletics, winning a number of prizes during the Empire Games held annually at Nnewi during the British Colonial rule. He passed out in 1951 with the First School Leaving Certificate. Edwin Ume-Ezeoke passed the entrance examination into the prestigious St.Patrick's College, Calabar in 1952 and was admitted into the College by the then principal, Rev. Fr. Keans. The College exposed him and enabled him to interact with other students of different ethnic groups. It was not long before his leadership qualities were once again detected and recognized. He became dormitory prefect and college Athletics Captain and led his team to victory in 1955 during the Calabar Provincial Winston Parnaby Athletics competition for colleges in Calabar. He passed out from St. Patrick's College in 1956 and obtained his West African School Certificate. Because it usually took a year for the results to be made public, he applied and was employed as a teacher at St. Micheal's Catholic School, Ezinifite, Nnewi South L.G.A. of Anambra State. Edwin resigned his teaching appointment and proceeded to Portharcourt in 1958 where he secured appointment in the Department of Custom and Excise. The nature of his work was to collect revenue such as taxes and government duties on goods imported into Nigeria. While working in Customs he furthered his education through a private institution and obtained Advanced level Pass in History. He resigned his appointment with Customs and Excise Department and his quest for further knowledge took him to England in 1960 financially supported by his older brother, Geoffrey. In London, Edwin Ume-Ezeoke initially attended the North-Western Polytechnic from 1960 to 1962. He then acquired the G.C.E. Advanced Level in Economics, History and British Constitution. With his advanced Level, he was admitted in the Inns of Court Middle Temple to study Law.. He proceeded to Holburn College of Law, University of London and finished successfully in 1966 with an award of LLB (Hons) and returned to Nigeria. Thereafter he was called to the Bar.

He was appointed by prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on 1 September 2014 after serving as Thailand's chief of defense forces.  Chief of Defense Forces  Thai Chief of Defense Forces Gen. Thanasak Patimaprakorn and the military chiefs host a lunch for U.S. Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Bangkok, June 5, 2012. Patimaprakorn served as Thailand's chief of defense forces from 2011 to 2014. In this position, he oversaw combat readiness and commanded military operations in all three branches of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. His position was at the top of the military chain of command, although in practice he remained subordinate to army chief Prayut Chan-o-cha. Role in the Cabinet =Deputy-Head of the National Council of Peace and Order= On May 22, 2014, it was announced that Patimaprakorn would serve as the Deputy-Head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He is one of 11 military officers appointed to the 32-member cabinet. This announcement took place during the Thai military coup of 2014. It was initially thought that the military had no interest in a coup, as Patimaprakorn had made a public statement in early May 2014 suggesting as much. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has stated that the goals of the NCPO are greater political stability and reforms for Thailand, and Patimaprakorn supported that statement in his message to the United Nations in September 2014. He stated that Thailand was \\"not retreating from democracy; it just needed time and space to bring about reconciliation, undertake political reforms and strengthen democratic institutions.\\" In a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Pratimaprakorn has also acknowledged the importance of addressing climate change and extremism in Thailand. Pratimaprakorn has also addressed the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE). In his remarks in June 2015, he mentioned the need for combating extremism once again, in addition to expressing a need for greater disaster management in Asia and emphasizing Thailand's efforts to address human trafficking. He ended his remarks by stating that Thailand would be happy to work as a bridge between OSCE and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Pratimaprakorn has also been vocal in the need to support migrants off the coast of Thailand. In a special meeting attended by 16 powerful countries in the region, Pratimaprakorn urged unity on the issue and said that all countries must work together to solve what is a very complex problem. He also described the actions Thailand is currently taking on the issue, which includes deploying vessels at sea as floating platforms to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants. =Minister of Foreign Affairs= Thanasak Patimaprakorn made an official visit to the Philippines As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pratimaprakorn is responsible for communicating and meeting with foreign governments. One of the major actions he has undertaken in this position is working closely with Prime Minister Chan-o-cha to ensure closer ties with China. He has said of the two countries' diplomatic relations, \\"At this moment we believe this is the best time for our relationship. Especially for my personal contact with minister Wang Yi who is a very nice and polite person.‚Äù Yi had similar comments about Pratimaprakorn and about China's relations with Thailand, saying that they are \\"as close as family members.\\" China and Thailand have recently been working to join hands on projects like infrastructure and clean energy, and Pratimaprakorn has even said that \\"the China-ASEAN bloc works as more of a community of shared destiny.\\" In January 2015, Pratimapragorn welcomed U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel to Thailand on a visit meant to show that the U.S wanted to be more assertive in its relationship with Thailand. The visit turned controversial, however, after the U.S urged Thailand to end martial law and return to civilian rule. In December 2015, Patimaprakorn also welcomed the Ambassador of the Russian Federation, Kirill Barsky, speaking with him about increasing tourism to Russia from Thailand and preparing to jointly celebrate the 120th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Thailand.

Its text is a German translation by Eduard von Bauernfeld of \\"Who is Silvia?\\" from act 4, scene 2, of The Two Gentlemen of Verona by William Shakespeare. \\"An Sylvia\\" was composed during a peak in Schubert's career around the time he was writing the Ninth Symphony \\"Great\\" (D 944), two years before his death. Creation Although considered to be myth, it is said that Schubert first came up with the idea to write \\"An Sylvia\\" as he was walking in Vienna and entered a beer garden with friends. There, he found a volume of Shakespeare on a table and as he was reading, he apparently exclaimed, \\"Oh! I have such a pretty melody running in my head. If only I had some paper!\\" His friend drew staves on the back of a menu, and, as it came to his head, Schubert spontaneously wrote melodies to the words he was reading in the play. The handwritten score was originally entitled \\"Gesang\\" and appeared within a small booklet labeled W√§hring, July 1826 (W√§hring was a town outside of Vienna where Schubert stayed with his friend Franz von Schober). The score had no tempo markings and served as Schubert's only draft of \\"An Sylvia\\" which allowed him to write additional notes in the score over time as ideas came to him. In addition, the title \\"Gesang\\" was crossed out and instead \\"An Sylvia\\" was written in its place. \\"An Sylvia\\" became one of three Shakespeare texts set to music by Schubert; the other two are \\"St√§ndchen\\" (\\"Hark, hark! the lark\\") and \\"Trinklied\\" (\\"Bacchus, feister F√ºrst des Weins\\", D 888). Schubert's friend, Franz von Schober, kept the original manuscript and managed Schubert's music after the composer's death. After the Lithographic Institute of Vienna published \\"An Sylvia\\" in 1828, Schober published it himself shortly after. In 1829, \\"An Sylvia\\" was assigned opus number 106 after Anton Diabelli published the work. Composition \\"An Sylvia\\" is written in the key of A major with a time signature of alla breve. A four-bar introduction by the piano is followed by 25 bars, a strophic form identical for each stanza. The song is in bar form, which follows a pattern of A‚ÄìA'‚ÄìB: a main melody, or in German, followed by an ending melody known as the . The majority of the piece stays in close proximity to the tonic and is generally simplistic in form. However, the second phrase of the (A') is the only phrase that passes through the third scale degree and demonstrates Schubert's ability to bring out emotional qualities through unexpected changes in the harmonization. In addition, the B section is the only phrase to cadence on the tonic. Other key features of \\"An Sylvia\\" include an echo on the piano at the ends of phrases, ascending figures in the piano accompaniment's bass, and a separate melodic figure in the piano's top (treble) staff at the end of the B phrase. All of these characteristics demonstrate Schubert's emphasis on interdependency between the melody and the accompaniment. Text The poem introduces Sylvia who is characterized as a beautiful, fair, and innocent woman admired by her suitors. The question becomes whether or not Sylvia is as kind as she is attractive, because only kindness can make her beautiful. When Sylvia is in love with one of the suitors, her eyes appear softer, helping the suitor to see that she is a kind and caring person. Was ist Sylvia, saget an, dass sie die weite Flur preist? Sch√∂n und zart seh' ich sie nahn, auf Himmels Gunst und Spur weist, : dass ihr Alles unterthan. : Ist sie sch√∂n und gut dazu? Reiz labt wie milde Kindheit; ihrem Aug' eilt Amor zu, dort heilt er seine Blindheit, : und verweilt in s√º√üer Ruh'. : Darum Sylvia t√∂n', o Sang, der holden Sylvia Ehren! Jeden Reiz besiegt sie lang, den Erde kann gew√§hren: : Kr√§nze ihr und Saitenklang! :Schubert's Werke, Serie XX: S√§mtliche einstimmige Lieder und Ges√§nge, volume 8, 1823‚Äì1827, no. 505 (pp. 232‚Äì233), Leipzig: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1895, plate F.S. 866 Who is Silvia? What is she, That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she; The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admir√®d be. Is she kind as she is fair? For beauty lives with kindness. Love doth to her eyes repair, To help him of his blindness, And, being helped, inhabits there. Then to Silvia let us sing, That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling: To her let us garlands bring. Dedicatee Schubert dedicated \\"An Sylvia\\" to one of his donors, Marie Pachler, a successful woman, talented pianist and composer from Graz who knew Beethoven personally and enjoyed bringing musicians over to her house for entertainment.

The direct continuation of Howitzvej, it runs from Nordre Fasanvej in the east to the northern end of S√∏nderjyllands All√© in the west where it turns into Jernbane All√© on the municipal border with Vanl√∏se. The street crosses Dalgas Boulevard and passes under the S-train network's Frederikssund radial. The modern Flintholm neighbourhood is located on the north side of the street and the Lindevang Park on its south side. The street is named after the Nobel Prize-winning physician Niels Ryberg Finsen. History The Finsen Power Plant in the 1920s Finsensvej was established in 1755 as part of a link between Frederiksberg and Bogholderg√•rden in Vanl√∏se. Finsensvej and present- day Howitzvej were collectively called Lampevej (Lamp Road) from about 1860. The name referred to one of the first outdoor street lamps in Copenhagen which was situated outside a midwife's practice to make it easier for customers to find their way ind the dark. The West Line towards Roskilde crossed Lampevej at Nordre Fasanvej from 1864 when Copenhagen Central Station was moved to a new location. The road passed through open countryside until the late 19th century. Frederiksberg Brewery opened on the north side of the street in 1880 but closed when it merged with several other breweries under the name De Forenede Bryggerier (United Breweries) in 1991. In the 1890s, Frederiksberg Municipality acquired a large site on the north side of Lampevej, west of Nordre Fasanvej, which was designated for municipal utility and service functions. Frederiksberg Gasworks relocated to the site in 1898. It was joined by the Finsen Power Station (Finsensv√¶rket) in 1908. The two road sections, east and west of Nordre Fasanvej, received their new name on 1 January 1906. The railway crossing disappeared when the central station moved to its current location. Krystalv√¶rket, a plant producing ice for cooling, opened in the area in 1914 and Solbjerg Fairty established there in 1925. Frederiksberg Gasworks, Krystalv√¶rket, Finsen Power Station and Solbjerg Dairy all closed in the 1960s and most of their buildings were demolished. Notable buildings and residents The Yellow House, now a cultural centre Treledet (No. 61-71), a Functionalist apartment building from 1930-31 design by Palle Suenson and Thorvald Dreyer, is one of the earliest examples of the bay window-balcony typology which would become emblematic of Danish residential architecture of the 1930s and 1940s. A yellow building, M√•lerhuset, located on the eastern corner with Dirch Passers All√©, is the only surviving building from Frederiksberg Gasworks. Built in 1895, it is now known as the Yellow House (Den Hule Villa) and is now used as a local cultural centre. It was listed in 2003. The rest of the gasworks site has since 2004 been under redevelopment into a new mixed-use neighbourhood and is now called Flintholm. The building society development Frederiksberg Kommunale Funktion√¶rers Boligforening, also known as Frederiksberg Haveby or Ved Gr√¶nsen (\\"On the Border\\"), consisting of some one hundred single family detached homes and double houses were built by Frederiksberg kommunale Funktion√¶rers Boligforening between 1914 and 1919. The architecture is strongly influenced by the Bedre Byggeskik, a Danish version of the Arts and Crafts movement. Transport Fasanvej metro station is situated just south of Finsensvej's eastern end. The station is served by the M1 and M2 lines of the Copenhagen Metro. The western part of the street is located approximately midway between Flintholm Station to the north and Peter Bangs Vej station to the south, both of which are stations on the Frederikssund radial of the S-train system. Flintholm is also served by trains on the S-train system's Ring Line and the M1 and M2 metro lines. The street crosses the Ring 2 ring road just after turning into Jernbane All√© on the border to Vanl√∏se.

The leaves themselves are without translucent tips, unlike some other Haworthia species. The rosettes dry and contract in the arid summers. It is sometimes confused with the widespread Haworthia decipiens (decipiens = deceptive) which occurs in the Great Karoo to the east. However H. decipiens has shorter, flatter, wider leaves; a lighter colour; translucent leaf tips; larger and sparser bristles which are mainly only on the leaf margins; and only a very weak leaf keel.Distinguishing Haworthia arachnoidea from Haworthia decipiens Distribution This most well-known form of this species occurs in the Breede River valley, in the areas of Worcester and Robertson (H. arachnoidea var. arachnoidea). Other varieties of this same species occur northwards into the Namaqualand (var. namaquensis), and eastwards as far as Port Elizabeth (vars. xiphiophylla, aranea and setata). It occurs in a wide range of habitats and usually in the shelter of protective rocks and shading plants. It is a widespread and extremely variable species, with no typical form. There are also a range of intermediate forms between this species and some of its neighbouring species. Intermediate forms exist in the transition between this species and Haworthia decipiens to the east. Also with Haworthia mucronata to the south-east. Many of these intermediates are treated as a variety, and given the name Haworthia arachnoidea var. nigricans. To the north, it joins its relative, Haworthia nortieri.http://haworthiaupdates.org/haworthia- revisited-2-haworthia-arachnoidea/ Subordinate Taxa * Haworthia arachnoidea var. arachnoidea (autonym) * Haworthia arachnoidea var. aranea (A.Berger)M.B.Bayer * Haworthia arachnoidea var. calitzdorpensis (Breuer)Breuer * Haworthia arachnoidea var. namaquensis M.B.Bayer * Haworthia arachnoidea var. nigricans (Haw.)

During the medieval period it was the city residence of the noble von Leden family. Having initially been an extensive courtly building complex, today only the seven-storey Steinwerk (stone structure) building and the great hall with stair tower remain. Since 2002 the Ledenhof has been the main office of the Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung (German Foundation for Peace Research).  History  The Ledenhof, located close to the Baroque Schloss Osnabr√ºck (Osnabr√ºck Castle) and the late Gothic Katharinenkirche (St. Catherine‚Äôs Church), was first mentioned in records in 1499. The wine merchant Johann Leden had established himself on the fringes of the Osnabr√ºck Altstadt (old town) during the mid-14th century, where he had built a half-timbered residential house and a wine store. The third Heinrich von Leden, who in 1499 had been given extensive privileges by then-German King and later Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, built a great hall on the rests of this house.The building, in Weser Renaissance style, was completed in 1588 The Ledenhof remained an enclosed area through to the late 18th century; the ‚ÄúDu Plat‚Äôsche Karte‚Äù map from 1787 displays it as a rectangular courtyard with a gatehouse. It is likely that the Ledenhof was once the location of a mint. The building complex was referred to as the ‚ÄúAlte M√ºnze‚Äù up to the early 20th century; it was only after 1930, when Rudolf vom Bruch published ‚ÄúDie Rittersitze im F√ºrstentum Osnabr√ºck‚Äù (Manor Houses of the Principality of Osnabr√ºck‚Äù), when the name ‚ÄúLedenhof‚Äù came back into fashion. During the 19th century the ownership of the Ledenhof changed multiple times. Parts of the premises belonged to manufacturer Heinrich Wilhelm Storck, others remained the property of the counts of M√ºnster until 1781. In the late 19th century, Friedrich August Koch and Ernst Conrad Kromschr√∂der used the Ledenhof for business purposes. Since 1930 the Ledenhof has belonged to Osnabr√ºck City Council. Throughout World War II and its aftermath, the remaining buildings of the Ledenhof were under serious threat of collapsing. Between 1964 and 1976 the stone structure and great hall underwent extensive renovation. In 1980 Osnabr√ºck City Council received the Europa Nostra Award for its exemplary restoration of the Ledenhof. Before it became the head office of the Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung in 2002, the Musikbibliothek (music library) was located here.  Sections  = Stone structure = The most prominent of the Ledenhof‚Äôs buildings is the Steinwerk made from quarried stone and featuring a saddle roof. It is one of Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs most distinctive medieval buildings. The Steinwerk dates from the 14th century and has exterior dimensions of 9.15 by 9.13 m. Unlike other Steinwerk buildings it did not function as a castle tower as the construction style seems to suggest, rather as a warehouse. The entrance to the cellar ‚Äì vaulted unlike usual castle towers ‚Äì is situated at ground level and was therefore easier to access than the castle tower with its higher lying entrance, which was easier to defend. Originally the Steinwerk did not have a chimney. In the 15th century the Steinwerk became a keep with seven floors and hatchways on the south side. The third Heinrich von Leden, who had the great hall built, created an entry point between the two buildings and also had a lavatory added. = Great hall = The great hall with two pediments was built in the 15th century by Heinrich von Leden ‚Äì the third consecutive bearer of this name ‚Äì as a prestigious residence. The ground floor consists of a four-metre high hallway whose other dimensions are 9.64 by 8.18 m; this used to serve as a combined kitchen and living room and had a parlour situated at the back measuring 3.84 by 8.18 m, which can be accessed by two doors next to the fireplace. The parlour was presumably the bedroom of Heinrich von Leden and his wife Margarete von Bar. A flight of stairs ‚Äì replaced in the late 16th century with a polygonal spiral staircase tower made from oak ‚Äì led to the upper floor, which includes a ballroom. This features much valuable ornamentation upon its beamed ceiling and used to be attached to a gallery room on its east side. This was removed when the stair tower was added. There was also an entrance to the Steinwerk building on this floor. The great hall was furnished with decorative paintings from diamond-shaped bands on plaster in white and gold; these were restored during the renovation works.  Other information  During the time the building complex was referred to as the ‚ÄúAlte M√ºnze‚Äù, the name ‚ÄúLedenhof‚Äù was used to denote the area on which the Marienst√§tte monastery had once stood. The name ‚ÄúLedenhof‚Äù is also used to refer to an underground garage right next to the Ledenhof itself. There is a street around the area of the Ledenhof which today bears the name ‚ÄúAlte M√ºnze‚Äù.

It has been used on all variants of Soyuz other than the Soyuz 7K-L3 and early flights of the Soyuz 7K-OK, as well as Progress, TKS, ATV, and on all Soviet and Russian space stations. History SSVP was initially conceived in 1967 by the TsKBEM design bureau for use on the then-planned OIS military space station. Though OIS never flew, in 1970 the design was selected for use on the Salyut and Almaz space stations. During its first attempted use on the Soyuz 10 mission, docking was unsuccessful due to a faulty hatch, and a failure in the automatic docking system. This led to a number of redesigns to reduce damage from accidental loads. In the 1980s, SSVP was further upgraded to support docking of large modules, such as the ones that would be used to construct Mir. They were used to attach all pressurized modules of the Mir, and for most spacecraft dockings (with the exception of the Space Shuttle flights, and Soyuz TM-16, which used the APAS-89 docking mechanisms located on Kristall and the Mir Docking Module.) The modern version of SSVP is SSVP-G4000. The Russian segment of the International Space Station features four available passive SSVP-G4000 ports, located on Zvezda-aft, Rassvet, Poisk, and Pirs. An additional port, on Zarya-nadir, was used to dock Rassvet. In addition to Russian spacecraft, the SSVP was also used on the European Automated Transfer Vehicle, which docked to the aft port of Zvezda. These ports were provided by Russia in exchange for the Data Management System, supplied by ESA for use in Zvezda. An upgraded version, designed for reusability and to provide a wider tunnel, is planned for use on the next-generation Orel spacecraft. Design SSVP consists of two components; an active probe, and a passive drogue. The probe enters the drogue, and its tip is grasped by soft-capture latches which are then retracted using electrically-driven motors to provide close alignment. Eight hard-capture locks then firmly attach the two spacecraft. After hard docking, the pressure between spacecraft is equalized using the Interface Leak Check System. The port contains a transfer tunnel, with an internal diameter of 800 mm. The ring surrounding this tunnel also includes a number of connectors, providing for transfer of power, data, and fuel between two docked vehicles. Hybrid A \\"hybrid\\" version, combining the design of SSVP and APAS-95, is also available, used for permanent docking of space station modules. This version uses the probe-and-drogue design of the standard SSVP, but with a hard-dock collar from APAS-95. The APAS-95 collar has twelve latches instead of the eight of standard SSVP. This variant is known as SSVP-M8000. These hybrid SSVP ports are used to permanently connect Pirs, Poisk and Zarya to Zvezda.

Recording In his book I Am the Wolf: Lyrics & Writings, Lanegan writes he traveled to Houston in 2002 \\"to fulfill a publishing contract I had signed with an old friend, producer and label head Randall Jamail, a talented man who took no shit from anyone and who would not have been pleased if he knew the honest state of my unprepared and unraveling songcraft, such as it was.\\" Lanegan wrote many of the songs in the parking lot on the spot as the band overdubbed in the studio. As he recalls in I Am the Wolf: Mark Deming of AllMusic: \\"The arrangements are full-bodied but leave plenty of open space, which suits the dusty overtones of Lanegan's melodies, and this music is a fine match for the phantoms and lost souls who populate Lanegan's songs (ten of which get their first public hearing on this release).

While Wasserman writes about business corporations, Mark Charendoff, the president of the Maimonides Fund applies this dichotomy to philanthropic gifts, arguing that donors should ask themselves if the CEOs of non-profit organizations are more interested in the results derived from their donations, or in their own careerist self-interest.

Earliest records of the community show that in 1983, a post office was established there with Thomas A. Stephens as postmaster. At that time, the community was called Stephen, likely in reference to the Stephens family. The post office was closed and moved to Pine Level within only a couple years. Early newspaper records show that after the post office closed, the community became known as Sandy Branch, but by the late 1890s, it was more widely known as just Sandy. In 1989, the post office reopened again under Postmaster Thomas A. Stephens, who also opened the first general store that year. By 1900, Sandy was home to 164 people. By this time, the community had grown enough to warrant its own society section in the Manatee River Journal newspaper. In 1913, a new building was constructed for Sandy School.

Regional geological setting  geological sutures. Germany is located at the centre of the map. Germany is located between the geologically very old (Precambrian) East European Craton (Baltica) to the north and north-east (that further north is exposed as the Baltic Shield), and the geologically young (Cenozoic) Alpine-Carpathian Orogen to the south. The corresponding crustal provinces of Germany are thus geologically \\"middle-aged\\" and were accreted onto the East European Craton during the Paleozoic through plate tectonic processes. These areas form the geological basement of Germany. The basement is the oldest of the four geological crustal levels (German: ) that overlap in Central Europe, north of the Alps. The levels mainly reflect the age relationships of rocks and the great tectonic trends that the Earth's crust was subjected to in the course of its geological history: crustal extension and widespread, mostly marine, sedimentation alternating with crustal compression/orogeny and extensive erosion. The surface geology of Germany has evolved to its current configuration due to regional differences in the action and appearance of external and internal forces during the last 20 million years. Germany can be divided into three physiographic regions: the Central European Depression, the Central European Blocks and the Alps.  Physiographic regions  violet (Mesozoic + Zechstein + Ruhr Carboniferous (Silesian)) and brown (before late Carboniferous). In the far south are the Alps. = Central European Depression = The northern third of Germany is part of the Central European Depression (German: Mitteleurop√§ische Senke), corresponding roughly to the North German Plain. The Central European Depression is a long-term subsiding area containing a sedimentary rock sequence, several thousand metres thick, of Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic age and is characterised by a strong glacial overprint as well as salt tectonics of Permian salt diapirs together with minor long-range effects of the Alpine Orogeny. = Central European Blocks = South of the Central European Depression is the Central European Blocks area (German: Mitteleurop√§isches Schollengebiet), which geographically includes the Central Uplands, the South German Scarplands, the Upper Rhine Plain and foothills of the Alps. The long- range effects of the Alpine Orogeny were relatively strong in this area and the effects of the Pleistocene glaciations were small. The region is divided into several structurally uplifted blocks, where extensively folded Paleozoic basement outcrops, and some subsided/non-uplifted blocks capped almost exclusively by Mesozoic or Cenozoic rocks. The uplifted blocks are the Rhenish Massif (excluding the Ardennes), the Saxon and Thuringian blocks (not to be confused with the Saxothuringian Zone) including the Harz, the Thuringian Basin, the Thuringian Forest, the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains and the Fichtel Mountains-Ore Mountains. The latter three geological units form the north-western edge of the Bohemian Massif, which is the largest contiguous outcrop of basement in Central Europe. The north-east edge of the Bohemian Massif is the Sudeten Block. The western edge of the central part of the Bohemian Massif, the Bohemian Block, extends into Germany with the mountain ranges of the Upper Palatinate Forest and the Bavarian Forest. The subsided/non-uplifted blocks are the Lower Rhine Graben (or \\"Ruhr Graben\\") with the Cologne Lowland, the M√ºnsterland Cretaceous Basin (Westphalian Lowland), the Solling Block (Hessian Depression), the South German Block (the South German Scarplands together with the Odenwald, the Spessart, the Black Forest and the Molasse Basin) and the Upper Rhine Graben. = Alpine- Carpathian Arc = South of the South German Block and the Bohemian Massif is the Alpine-Carpathian Arc (German: Alpen-Karpaten-Bogen). Although its extent in Germany is limited to the extreme south of Bavaria, this narrow strip has relatively high geological diversity. In this region, three of the four major tectonic \\"domains\\" of the Alps are found: the Helvetic nappes, the Penninic nappes (as the Rhenodanubian Flysch Zone) and the Eastern Alps (as the Northern Limestone Alps).  Geological levels  North of the Alps, four crustal \\"levels\\" of surface and underground rocks in Germany are traditionally distinguished by age and structural characteristics (from deep to shallow): the basement, the transition level, the Mesozoic platform and the Cenozoic platform. The latter three are also summarised under the generic term \\"platform\\", in contrast to the basement. = Basement = Road cut with Devonian slates near Z√ºschen in the Rothaar Mountains (Rhenish Massif) Quarry in the Brocken granite pluton on Wurmberg in the Upper Harz Mountains, parts of which are of early Permian (Asselian) age, one of the youngest rock bodies of the Variscan basement The basement (German: ) consists of folded rocks, some of which are metamorphic rocks, mostly of marine-sedimentary and submarine-volcanic origin, intruded by granitoid plutons. Most of these rocks are of late Carboniferous age or older. Folding and metamorphism of these sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and the emplacement of the granitoids, occurred mainly in two Paleozoic orogenies: the Caledonian Orogeny in the Late Ordovician and the Variscan Orogeny in the early Carboniferous. In the oldest folded Variscan rocks, evidence exists of an older orogeny, the Cadomian Orogeny, which occurred before the accretion of the crustal blocks of Proto- Europe (Baltica) (German: ). The folded basement rocks originated in the Proterozoic, but even older relics of continental crust are found in a paragneiss of the Bavarian Forest, the protolith of which was probably deposited subsequent to the Cadomian Orogeny. A sample of this paragneiss contains a detrital zircon grain, whose core crystallised from a magma during the Archean eon, before about 3.48 billion years ago. Whereas the Caledonian folded basement lies a few thousand metres below the surface of the Central European Depression, the Variscan basement or Variscides (German: ) outcrops in the Central European Blocks area, occurring extensively in several large highland areas and also sparsely in some lowland areas in the form of basement uplifts. A distinction is made here between rock complexes, commonly referred to as \\"slate belts\\" (German: ) made of unmetamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks (slate, chert, sandstone, limestone, altered basalt, phyllite and quartzite) which are intruded only to a small extent by granitoids, and rock complexes commonly referred to as crystalline, comprising weakly to highly metamorphosed rocks (phyllite, quartzite, marble, amphibolite, serpentinite, schist, gneiss, granulite and eclogite) which are extensively intruded by granitoids. The slate belt rock units were folded at a shallow depth at relatively low temperatures, whereas the metamorphic crystalline areas sank much deeper during the Variscan Orogeny, and were subjected to high pressures and, in some places, very high temperatures which caused partial melting of the rocks. The geochemical signature of the Variscan granitoids suggests that their magma was produced by the partial melting of deeply-buried sedimentary rocks. Outcropping slate belts are found mainly in the Rhenish Massif, the Harz and the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains. Outcropping crystalline areas are found mainly in the Black Forest, the western Odenwald, Vorspessart, the Ore Mountains, the Fichtel Mountains, the Palatinate Forest and the Bavarian Forest. = Transition = The transition level (German: ) includes all unfolded sedimentary and volcanic rocks of late Carboniferous (Stephanian) to mid-Permian (Guadalupian) age. \\"Transition level\\" refers, in part, to the stratigraphic position of these rocks: they are younger than the folded Variscides but older than the layers of the Mesozoic platform. In addition, they stem from a geological transition phase, which is characterised by the flattening of the Variscan mountains and by post-Variscan volcanism, which was accompanied by crustal extension in the Variscan Orogen. The rocks of the transition level differ from the younger platform sediments in that they are often relatively coarse-grained (conglomeratic) Molasse sedimentary rocks and acidic to intermediate volcanic rocks (especially rhyolite), whereas the Mesozoic platform has few conglomerates and no volcanic rocks. The transition level is divided lithostratigraphically into Stephanian and Permian (Rotliegend) sequences. Rocks of the transition level are found today mainly in the Saar-Nahe Basin, the Halle-Leipzig area (e.g. Halle Porphyry Complex), the Ore Mountain Basin and the Thuringian Forest. = Mesozoic platform = beds of White Jurassic limestone at the edge of the landslide at Hirschkopf near M√∂ssingen (Swabian Jura) The Schrammsteine, Upper Cretaceous sandstones in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains near Bad Schandau The Mesozoic platform (German: ) includes all virtually unfolded sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous), but also includes some Paleozoic deposits of the Lopingian epoch of the late Permian. In northern Germany, in principle, even the relatively unfolded or weakly folded post-Caledonian/pre-Permian sediments (including the Ruhr Carboniferous and its western continuation in the Aachen area) are included with the Mesozoic platform. The outcropping Mesozoic platform at the surface comprises Zechstein (Middle/Upper Permian) marine gypsum rocks and limestones, Buntsandstein (Lower Triassic) siliciclastic rocks, Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) marine limestones, Keuper (Middle and Upper Triassic) mixed evaporite-carbonate-siliciclastic deposits, Lower Jurassic (Lias/Schwarzjura) marine black shales, Dogger/Braunjura (Middle Jurassic) marine, often iron-bearing, siliciclastic rocks, White Jurassic/Malm (Upper Jurassic) marine limestones, Lower Cretaceous (Wealden) continental siliciclastic rocks and Upper Cretaceous marine limestones, sandstones and gaizes. Outcropping Zechstein rocks are limited to the edges of basement uplifts. Triassic rocks cover the largest area. In the South German Block, extensively outcropping Mesozoic rocks dip towards the south-east. Due to the alternating layering of weathering/erosion-prone shales and more resistant sandstones and limestones, a cuesta landscape has formed there in the past several million years. The most conspicuous of these cuestas is the White Jura of Franconia and the Swabian Jura. Uplands formed by relatively weathering/erosion-resistant sandstones of the early/middle Buntsandstein are the Palatinate Forest, the Odenwald, the Spessart, the S√ºdrh√∂n and the Burgwald. Ridges of Muschelkalk limestone are found mainly in the Thuringian Basin. Probably the most well-known occurrence of Cretaceous sandstones is the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. In northern Germany, individual blocks have been forced up by salt domes, and have been eroded down to the older layers of the Mesozoic platform. Erosion-resistant bedrock on these blocks forms small isolated ridges, especially in the northern Harz foreland region. These include the Elm hills (Muschelkalk), the Asse hills (Buntsandstein and Muschelkalk) and the Grosser Fallstein (Muschelkalk) as well as the island of Heligoland (Buntsandstein). Cretaceous chalk can be found, partly covered by thin Quaternary deposits, only in northern Germany, including in M√ºnsterland Cretaceous Basin, where the Cretaceous deposits directly rest on the Ruhr Carboniferous and continue westward into the Aachen Formation, as well as in the Hanover and Salzgitter area. Probably the most well-known Cretaceous limestones of Germany are those on the island of R√ºgen, on Germany's north coast. = Cenozoic platform = The Cenozoic platform (German: ) comprises Tertiary and Quaternary rocks. It is also known as the \\"unconsolidated rock\\" level because, due to their young age, the Cenozoic sedimentary rocks have often not experienced intensive diagenesis and are therefore often not cemented. Because the youngest deposits in an uplifted area are removed first, the Cenozoic platform deposits occur extensively only in young Cenozoic subsidence areas in the Central European Blocks region. The largest continuous outcrops are the Upper Rhine Graben with the Mainz Basin and the Molasse Basin (Alpine foreland trough). Special \\"subsidence areas\\" are the N√∂rdlinger Ries and the Steinheim crater, both originating through a meteorite impact event. The Cenozoic deposits in the Central European Blocks region consist of both siliciclastic rocks and limestones and both marine and continental sediments. The Cenozoic in Germany is also represented by volcanic rocks. In contrast to the mostly acidic (SiO2-rich) volcanic rocks of the transition level, the Cenozoic formations are mostly intermediate to very SiO2-poor (trachyte, basalt, phonolite, tephrite, nephelinite and basanite). The largest Cenozoic volcanic areas in Germany are the Vogelsberg Mountains, the Westerwald, the Rh√∂n Mountains and the Eifel. In northern Germany, almost the entire surface geology is made of Cenozoic sediments, mainly of Pleistocene and Holocene glacial or fluvioglacial deposits. Moraines and urstromtals determine the relief . Thus the Southern Ridge (German: ) is a moraine of the Saale glaciation and the Northern Ridge (German: ) is a moraine of the Weichselian glaciation. The material of these sediments was picked up by the ice sheet on its way from Scandinavia to Central Europe and was deposited during the melting there. The route that the ice took can be reconstructed with the aid of rocks, the cobbles in the moraine sediments, because these can be matched with certain regions in Scandinavia . In southern Germany, with the exception of the Alpine foreland and the Upper Rhine Graben, there are rather thin Quaternary deposits and formations, geographically confined mostly to lower slopes and valleys where they occur as scree and stone runs or as fluvial gravels and sands. In the foothills of the Alps, there are also Pleistocene moraines. There, however, the cobbles originate from the Alps and a different nomenclature than in Northern Germany is used for the glacial periods in which the ice from the mountains in the south pushed into the foothills: The Saale glaciation corresponds there to the Riss glaciation; the Weichselian glaciation corresponds to the W√ºrm glaciation.  German Alps  Rhenodanubian flysch: Rhythmic limestone-marl-mudrock interbedding of the Piesenkopf Formation (Late Cretaceous) in R√∂thenbachtal, Ostallg√§u The Alps are a young orogen, in which the relatively simple geological relationship between basement and platform that exists in the area north of the Alps has been overprinted and complicated by orogenic processes. The formation of the Alps happened in tectonic \\"domains\\", but within which basement and platform can be distinguished, which either jointly or separately, are built of separate nappes. The nappes outcropping in the German Alps invariably contain platform units of folded, unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks, mainly of Mesozoic age, which were deposited almost exclusively in a marine environment. They are associated with three of the four domains of the Alps. = Helvetic domain = The Helvetic Domain (also known as the Helvetic Nappes) (German: ) strikes approximately east-west in a strip, mostly only a few hundred metres wide, right at the northern edge of the Alps with siliciclastic and carbonate rocks of the Cretaceous and the early Tertiary that are overthrust towards the north onto the southern edge of the Molasse Basin. There are mainly shallow marine formations that are, for example, rich in nummulites (the Kressenberg Formation). They represent the inner continental shelf on the southern edge of pre-Alpine Europe and they were not affected by the folding and overthrusting processes of the Alpine Orogeny until relatively late. = Flysch zone = The Penninic Domain (also known as the Penninic Nappes) (German: ) strikes south of the Helvetic Domain in a strip, a few kilometres wide, in the form of the Rhenodanubian Flysch Zone. It comprises Cretaceous ‚Äì lower Tertiary siliciclastic-carbonate turbiditic deepwater sediments , which represent a portion of the erosion debris forming the Alpine sedimentary wedge that in the further course of formation of the Alps was itself incorporated into the orogen and overthrust over a distance of about 100 km to the north onto the Helvetic units. = Limestone Alps = bedded carbonates of the Wetterstein limestone (Middle Triassic) in the summit area of Zugspitze German Limestone Alps: Thickly bedded limestones of the Dachstein Formation (Late Triassic) in the east wall of Watzmann The Eastern Alps strike south of the Flysch Zone and occupy the largest area in the German Alps. In Germany, the Eastern Alps are, for the most part, Mesozoic mostly Triassic carbonate rocks. This carbonate rock association, whose outcrop (including the Austrian parts) runs in a 35 to 50-kilometre-wide strip from Vorarlberg as far as the Vienna Basin, is called the Northern Limestone Alps. In contrast to the Helvetic Domain and the Flysch Zone that still mostly have a low mountain character (German: ) although they are morphologically clearly set apart from the Alpine foreland, the Northern Limestone Alps form high mountains (German: ) of well over 2,000 metres above sea level. Of the high mountains of Germany, the highest is Zugspitze, with a height of 2,962 metres, more than a thousand metres higher than Feldberg in the Black Forest, Germany's highest mountain outside the Alps. The Northern Limestone Alps represent a depositional environment that was probably located several hundred kilometres to the south, relative to the current position of the rocks. This is reflected in facies as well as in the fossil record: While in the Eastern Alps platform carbonates with tropical faunas were established during the late Middle Triassic, the contemporary, epicontinental, partly terrestrial sequences in Central Europe north of the Alps are rather dominated by siliciclastics and had rather warm temperate faunas. Therefore, especially with regard to the formation of Triassic rocks, a distinction is made between \\"Germanic facies\\" (Central Europe north of the Alps) and \\"Alpine facies\\" (Northern Limestone Alps). Starting from the Late Cretaceous, the Eastern Alps were affected by the Alpine Orogeny and the rocks of the Northern Limestone Alps were stacked and transported northwards to their present position, overriding the Helvetic and Penninic domains.

He had antisemitic sympathies. He headed the conservative Organisation civile et militaire (OCM) in the later part of the war. After the war he was involved in various organizations to assist resistance members and families who had been disrupted by deportations. He supported eugenic approaches to revive the falling birthrate. He was a Conseller d'Etat from 1951 to 1962. Early years Maxime Blocq-Mascart was born in Paris on 17 November 1894 to an old banking family from Lorraine. He would himself become a banker. He was orphaned when a child, and was adopted by his uncle, a marine officer. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he joined the army on 2 September 1914 and was assigned to the 10th engineering regiment. On 18 March 1915 he was transferred to the 13th artillery regiment as a sergeant. In 1916 he was transferred to the 1st aviation group in Dijon, and in August 1917 graduated as a military pilot from the Avord school and was assigned to the 231 squadron. He was discharged in September 1919. Inter-war period Blocq-Mascart returned to Paris and studied at the Ecole libre des sciences politiques. He worked in various banks and industrial companies, worked for the Paris Chamber of Commerce and then was head economist for a Paris-based industrial group. He was both economic consultant and lobbyist. At the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45) he was also general secretary of the Europe nouvelle (New Europe) review and vice-president of the Conf√©d√©ration des Travailleurs Intellectuels (CTI, Confederation of Intellectual Workers). Blocq-Mascart was a founder of the Service Social des Travailleurs Intellectuels. World War II On 30 October 1939 Blocq-Mascart was assigned to the Mareil-sur-Mauldre chemical works. After the fall of France he was discharged in August 1940. He returned to Paris and formed a resistance unit with his friends from the CTI. In December 1940 this unit merged with the Mouvement des classes moyennes. The latter group was headed by the industrialist Jacques Arthuys and the professional officers Colonels Alfred Heurtaux and Alfred Touny. In the spring of 1941 the movement became the Organisation civile et militaire (OCM). The OCM was a group of anti-Vichy officers and professionals, particularly strong in Paris and the northern industrial regions. Arthuys led the movement and was assisted by Roger Souch√®re as Chief of Staff, Jean Mayer in charge of the first and third Bureaus, Touny for the 2nd Bureau, and Blocq-Mascart for Civil matters. The OCM drew its recruits from senior industrialists, civil servants and professionals. The first priorities were collection of intelligence and organization of fighting units. The group also published Cahiers that discussed the post-war economy and politics, which gave it the reputation of being elitist and technocratic. Blocq-Mascart was made head of the OCM civil office and a member of the OCM executive. He supported giving the OCM a political program and assisted with a project for constitutional and administrative reform that recommended a presidential system. Blocq-Mascart and Pierre Lefaucheux developed the OCM doctrine and program, and presumably expressed the view of many businessmen in their constitution project and in their studies in the Cahiers de l'OCM, although these views may not have been shared by all members. In 1941 Blocq-Mascart made contact with Jean Cavaill√®s of Lib√©ration-Nord and with the clandestine Communist Party. Arthuys and Heurtaux were arrested at the end of 1941, and Blocq-Mascart and Touny took over leadership of the OCM. The OCM had several thousand members by 1942. In 1942 Blocq-Mascart published a 50-page discussion of the \\"problem of minorities\\" in the OCM Cahiers. In it he traced the historical roots of antisemitism and its development in prewar in France, taking a position that could be taken as justification for the view. He identified the Jews as a group that caused \\"ongoing controversies\\". He concluded that members of national minorities or non-Christian background should be banned from various occupations and places of residence unless they could prove they had been assimilated for several generations. He did not mention recent legislation against the Jews by the Vichy or Nazi regimes. Although some Resistance leaders denounced the article, it reflected the views of most French people at the time. In April‚ÄìMay 1942 Blocq-Mascart joined the Centurie network that Gilbert Renault (\\"Colonel Remy\\") had formed with the OCM. On 26 March 1943 Blocq-Masart attended the first meeting of the Comit√© de coordination de zone Nord (Coordinating Committee for the Northern Zone). In May 1943 he refused to join the Conseil national de la R√©sistance (CNR) due to the OCM's opposition to including political parties in the CNR. On 28 August 1943 Blocq-Mascart went underground to avoid the Gestapo. He was vice-president of the OCM until Alfred Touny was arrested in February 1944, then headed the OCM until the Liberation of France. Until the end of 1943 he opposed the CNR structure defined by Jean Moulin. However, he joined the CNR in 1944 in place of Jacques-Henri Simon, and in June 1944 became CNR vice-president. As a member of the CNR executive he represented the OCM, Ceux de la Lib√©ration and Ceux de la R√©sistance, the three main movement in the Zone Nord. He supported the truce during the Paris insurrection. Blocq-Mascart was a delegate to the Algiers Provisional Consultative Assembly. He proposed that the provisional government issue a provisional constitution at once, with later revisions to be enacted by plebiscite or by an elected body. General Charles de Gaulle rejected this proposal as dangerous and illegal, and took a jaundiced view of the other OCM constitutional proposals, which he associated with an ambitious technocracy that was perhaps anti-democratic. After the Liberation Blocq- Mascart played important roles on the juries of honor and the committees of recognition of the Resistance. Later career Blocq-Mascart became vice- president of the Service Social des Travailleurs Intellectuels. He criticized the French Third Republic from a right-wing corporatist viewpoint. He was one of the founders of the OCM organ Parisien Lib√©r√©, which he directed until 1947. The journal took a centrist position. He was president of the National Federation of support centers for internees and political prisoners, then of Entr'aide fran√ßaise (French Mutual Assistance). This was a republican version of the Secours National social work organization of Vichy France. He was active in supporting the families of deportees. He was a co-founder of the National Confederation of volunteer fighters of the Resistance. Blocq-Mascart joined de Gaulle's Haut Comit√© Consultatif de la Population et de la Famille (HCCPF, Higher Consultative Committee on Population and the Family) in 1945. Blocq-Mascart supported eugenics as a way to address the low birth rate in post-war France, which he blamed on the casual view being taken of town hall marriages. He thought that couples should be trained before being married, and the examiner should be able to require a couple to undertake \\"additional research\\" if he thought they were unprepared for marriage. He was opposed to the family vote, but was generally overruled on this by the right-wing majority. After 1951 Blocq-Mascart represented the interests of France in its African colonies as a Conseller d'Etat during the transition to independence. In 1958 he supported the return to power of de Gaulle. That year he was a member of the Constitutional Advisory Committee. He was a councilor of state until 1962. He did not support de Gaulle's policy on Algeria. Maxime Blocq- Mascart died in Saint-Cloud in 1965.

Located at the modern day intersection of Betts Road and State Road 70, the area remains largely undeveloped or agricultural.  History  Parmalee was established in 1915 as a stop on the East and West Coast Railway between Verna and Myakka City. In January 1917, a post office was opened at Parmalee. Parmalee never grew beyond a small railway stop. It was home to a rice mill and grist mill as well as one store and storehouse. The town primarily relied on the lumber industry via the Updegraff Lumber Company mill. In 1926, the lumber company (by then known as Roux-Askew Lumber) sold a large tract of land which included the town of Parmalee to the Constructive Agricultural Syndicate of New York City. The organization cleared the land and developed multi-acre farming lots. A few months after the sale, the post office at Parmalee was closed, and the area ceased to go by that name, being largely absorbed into the growing nearby town of Myakka City.

The Italian vessels, and , launched two torpedoes each. The torpedoes fired by missed their target but one from hit the British tanker Desmoulea which had to be towed to Suda Bay in Crete and beached; the ship was disabled for the rest of the war. One other merchant ship turned back; the other eight vessels reached Piraeus. Background When hostilities commenced between Fascist Italy and Greece on 28 October 1940, the British began to send supplies of aircraft and stores through the Aegean Sea, to support the Greek war effort. The Greek government provided the Allies with tugs, harbour vessels and a naval base for the British Fleet at Suda Bay in Crete.Titterton, 2002, p. 154 Greece and Britain had concluded a co-operation agreement in January 1940, which secured commercial relations and made the Greek merchant fleet available for the transport of war supplies to the Allies, before the Greco-Italian War had begun.Koliopoulos, 1978, pp. 406‚Äì408  Prelude  = Allied forces = Convoy AN 14 consisted of seven British and three Greek merchant ships, escorted by the light cruiser (Commander Herbert Annesley Packer), the destroyers and and the corvettes and Gloxina.Hague, 2016, nopp The bulk of the convoy sailed from Port Said on 28 January, with the corvette Gloxina. Levernbank and the large tanker Desmoulea, escorted by Calcutta and Peony, departed Alexandria on 29 January. The troop transport Ethiopia, carrying RAF personnel, left Alexandria some hours later, with the destroyer . The cruiser and the Australian light cruiser were to provide distant cover; Jaguar and Dainty swept the Kasos strait ahead of the convoy.Smith, 1998, nopp = Italian forces = Since the beginning of the war with Britain in June 1940, Italian naval forces in the Dodecanese had limited capacity to supply garrisons. Most stores were carried by submarine and aircraft but the expedient was insufficient and the Italians began to use coastal ships. The ships ferried of supplies to the Dodecanese, even after the closing of the Corinth Canal, after the beginning of the Greco-Italian War.Smith, Walker, 1974, pp. 8‚Äì9 A flotilla of torpedo boats were deployed in the area by the in December 1940, under the command of captain Francesco Mimbelli to reinforce the ships around Rhodes and Leros, whose naval base of Porto Lago (Lakki) was the main Italian naval base in the Aegean.Mimbelli, 2016, noppGabellone, 2005, nopp  Action  Italian torpedo boat On 31 January 1941, the Italian torpedo boats departed Leros and while performing an anti-submarine search in the Kasos Strait, they spotted an Allied convoy, escorted by a cruiser and three destroyers. The two vessels separated, for to distract the escort while attacked with its torpedoes. The Italians reported that hit a large steamer with two torpedoes and then launched another two at a cruiser without effect. The Italians were engaged by the escorts but managed to steam away.Cocchia, 1959, p. 339 In the British account, only one torpedo hit the tanker Desmoulea, which was loaded with a cargo of petrol and white oils. Admiral Andrew Cunningham recorded that the tanker had been detached to Suda Bay from the Alexandria section of the convoy and was torpedoed at 18:00 on 31 January. Dainty, the close escort, took the tanker in tow at 20:00, after it been abandoned by the crew. Perth proceeded to assist but the Commander in Chief ordered Perth to resume escort duties.Cunningham, Simpsom, 1999, p. 270 Desmoulea had been hit abreast the engine room and left sinking, but the crew re-boarded the tanker when it became clear that it was still afloat.SSR 1947, nopp The Third Engineering Officer, George William Donn, was killed in the action. Desmoulea arrived in Suda Bay under tow at 08:00 on 1 February and beached with its cargo intact.Masters, 1953, p. 152 Peony survived an attack by bombers from Crete and the rest of the convoy reached Piraeus on 2 February 1941.  Aftermath  HMS Dainty Desmoulea remained at Suda Bay for several weeks, down on the sandy bottom by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo was transferred to the tanker Eocene.Smith, 1998a, noppHatfield, 2009, p. 116 Along with the torpedo damage inflicted on the cargo ship Clan Cumming on 19 January by the Italian submarine , which was eventually destroyed by the escorts, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea.Mattesini, 1998, p. 33 After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the more westerly Antikythera Strait.O'Hara, 2009, p. 85 Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers.

The ship was long, with a beam of and was assessed at . She had one 2 cyl. Compound engine driving a single screw propeller.  Sinking  On 4 June 1861, SS Canadian sailed from Quebec, Canada to Liverpool, United Kingdom with 60 crew and 241 passengers on board. When the Canadian sailed through the Strait of Belle Isle, ice and thick weather started to form and the captain ordered to slow the ship down to 5 knots while passing through the ice. At 11:50 AM the Canadian struck an iceberg which was largely hidden underwater. The collision fatally damaged the ship and the ship's 3 compartments were flooded quickly. Since the collision was at such a low speed and most passengers were preparing for lunch, nobody really noticed anything was wrong until passengers noticed that the crew in order of the captain were preparing the lifeboats to be lowered. Since the ship was sinking quickly, the crew needed to work very fast in order to evacuate everyone. All the lifeboats were safely launched except lifeboat number 8 which capsized when being lowered killing at least 30 people. The ship sank beneath the freezing ice filled waters a half hour after striking the iceberg. Some passengers and crew did not board a lifeboat and went down with the ship, in total 35 people perished in the disaster. Amongst those who perished was mail officer James Panton, who is considered to be one of the heroes during the sinking.

The council had representatives from various organisations. Vladimir Groman represented the Union of Cities. Problems with food supply in the Russian Empire did not so much arise from a fall in production, which undoubtedly there was, but rather as regards how grain was transported to the cities. Output had fallen by 10 million tons by 1916, but this had been offset by the cessation of a similar amount of grain being exported. The problem was rather that the railways were subject to military priorities, which meant that food did not consistently reach the cities. Likewise coal production had actually increased, but was disproportionately absorbed by the expanding war industries, so that frequently the trains were not able to run effectively. Likewise the production of rolling stock took second place to the production of arms, giving rise to another set of problems. This was an area which the Special Council on Food Supply monitored, for example concluding that Petrograd needed 12,150 wagon-loads of food a month. In 1916 the Russian economy was faced with an earlier version of the Scissor crisis of 1923: there was a widening gap (\\"price scissors\\") between industrial and agricultural prices. For example the price of Rye rose by 47% whereas that of a pair of boots rose by 334%. Peasants decided to feed their surplus grain to their cows or distill Vodka. In the reviling climate of inflation one peasant remarked: \\"the richness caused by the money is like the money itself: it is of paper, and has no weight, and good only to be counted. It goes like water, and leaves no trace\\". Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Rittikh was responsible for the introduction of grain requisitions in late 1916, before the Bolsheviks came to power, albeit in a less than efficient fashion. State Food Committee Following the February Revolution of 1917, it was renamed the State Food Committee.

He \\"practiced in all the courts of that circuit, and his name appears among those who attended court in old Franklin\\". Shortly after moving to Montgomery County he married Elizabeth Talbott,Louis Houck, A History of Missouri: From the Earliest Explorations and Settlements Until the Admission of the State Into the Union (1908), p 265. from an old and influential family there. He authored Rachel v. Walker, 4 Mo. 350 (1836), which freed an enslaved woman who had been taken to free territory by an Army officer. Walker was an important predecessor to the Dred Scott case. Mathias' brother, Isaac McGirk, represented Marguerite Scypion in her claim for freedom in the Missouri courts in 1805. An 1892 biography provided this sketch: McGirk was fond of agriculture, and built what was described as \\"a beautiful residence\\" on or near Lautre Island, one of the islands of the Missouri River, near the present town of Hermann, Missouri. Another biography described McGirk as follows: McGirk never had any children. His widow survived him by many years.
