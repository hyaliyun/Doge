Career  Badwan is an artist known for her work 100 Days of Solitude, for which she spent an extended period of time creating a beautiful space in her room where she could isolate herself and escape from reality of Gaza. She says living in a city where she \\"lost basic rights as a human being\\" inspired her to \\"create an alternative world\\" in her room. This project is composed of 25 photographic self-portraits taken in that room since 13 November 2013 that portray her during her twenty months of self-imposed exile, started after she was abused by members of Hamas in Gaza. She is a graduate of the Fine Arts School of Gaza's Al Aqsa University. Her story, reported in an interview with the New York Times, has made her known internationally, cited by many other newspapers, magazines and television from all over the world (such as ZDF, France24 and Sky Arte). After the years of Palestine, she moved to the Republic of San Marino, where she also worked as a university professor at the University of Design of the Republic of San Marino. Now, the artist lives in Italy. Her exhibitions have toured and are touring the world: after the first in Jerusalem, numerous exhibitions in Italy, San Marino, Denmark, Germany, US, Spain, United Arab Emirates. In 2016, she was selected for The 2016 Sovereign Middle East & North Africa Art Prize Finalists, a prize for the 30 best artists in the Arab world.

It was described by the German entomologist Karl Leopold Escherich in 1905 based on specimens collected in South Africa, but is found worldwide as synanthrope in human housings. In recent years, gray silverfish have increasingly become an issue in indoor environments in Europe, especially in newly built houses with a stable climate beneficial for the growth and reproduction of this species. As a food generalist with the ability to digest the cellulose contained in paper and cellulose-based textiles like rayon, Ctenolepisma longicaudatum is considered a pest species in cultural heritage institutions like libraries and archives. Nomenclature Most authors have historically treated the nomenclatural gender of Ctenolepisma as feminine, but in 2018 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature issued a formal ruling (ICZN Opinion 2427) stating the gender of Lepisma (and all genera with that ending) is neuter, following ICZN Article 30, which resulted in changes to the spelling of several well-known species, including Ctenolepisma longicaudatum (formerly longicaudata).ICZN (2018) Opinion 2427 (Case 3704) ‚Äì Lepisma Linnaeus, 1758 (Insecta, Zygentoma, Lepismatidae): Direction 71 (1957) reversed. The Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, 75(1):290-294 Description stemmata. The nymphs and adults are slender, agile, fast-moving insects with long, paired antennae and three long appendages at the posterior abdomen: a pair of cerci and the single central epiproct. Apart from the earlies instars, the body is covered with scales, giving the light- to dark greyish animals a glimmering appearance. With their brushes and bristles along the body sides, gray silverfish somewhat resemble the related firebrats. The eyes consist of twelve stemmata, which are rather more rounded in early instars. =Developmental stages= The eggs have an oval shape with dimensions of about 1.15 x 0.83 mm. Two to twenty eggs are laid per lot, and they are normally deposited about 2 mm into crevices or cracks, or under the edge of paper. Freshly laid eggs are smooth and cream- coloured; after three days the chorion turns yellow and exhibits shallow reticulate markings. First instar nymphs have a special hatching organ on the frons of the head that helps them break free from the egg shell; this organ is shed with the first moulting. The air-filled crop pulsates vigorously in the hatching process, which takes about five minutes. The hatched first instar nymphs have a pale cream body colour and lack hairs and scales, the appendages are short and soft, and the anus seems to be closed. The 2nd instar nymphs exhibit a firmer, darker cream sclerotisation, and the longer appendages can be freely vibrated. A few bristles mark the position where the ‚Äúbrushes‚Äú of the mature stages will be. This number of bristles increases with subsequent moultings, and the bristle pattern might be indicative for each instar. The 3rd, very active instar shows the body colour pattern of the succeeding instars: a dark cream colour with the edges of the thoracic terga and the anal lobes tinted purple. The first three instars also have an increasing number of tarsal segments, by which they can be distinguished: the 1st instar has legs with two tarsal segments, whereas the 2nd instar exhibits three-segmented tarsi on the metathoracic pair of legs. The 3rd instar exhibits the three- segmented tarsi of all following stages. In the 4th instar, the first pair of styli appears on the ninth abdominal sternum, as well as the scales covering the body. Instars five to seven exhibit no particular distinguishing characters. In the 9th instar, the second pair of styli appears on the eighth abdominal segment in males; in female, these appear in the 11th instar. The genitalia first appear in the 8th nymphal instar, developing from two small lobes on the intersegmental membrane at the base of the cleft in the ninth sternum. The shape of this cleft, which first appears in the second instar and becomes more pronounced until the eighth instar, allows the distinction of the sex. A small cleft in the female‚Äôs eighth sternum, which develops in early instars and completely divides this sternum in later instars, further facilitates sex determination. The genitalia lobes remain short in males until the shape of the penis can be distinguished in the 11th nymphal instar, when the internal reproductive organs will also have developed, including seven large testicles. The two short vasa deferentia, which fuse immediately anterior to the penis, are thin-walled and slightly dilated at their distal ends; they lengthen in the next instar and form two loops between the two cercal nerves. The seminal vesicles form in the 13th instar, when also the penis reaches is final adult form by the ventral fusing of its rolled edges. In comparison to males, the female‚Äôs genitalia lobes elongate in succeeding moultings. In the 10th nymphal instar, a second, anterior pair of lobes develops from the intersegmental membrane between abdominal segments 8 and 9 and extends to the ninth sternum‚Äôs cleft in the 11th instar. In the following 12th instar, both pairs of genitalia lobes are almost of equal length. In the 13th instar, the ovipositor of the adults is formed by fusion and interlocking of the posterior lobes with the anterior ones. The complete ovipositor extends circa 1.2 mm beyond the sternum. The spermatheca first appears in the 10th instar as a short lobe directed anteriorly from the gonophyses. In the 12th instar the two side sacs and the central neck are still thin-walled and rather undifferentiated, whereas in the following 13th instar, well-marked, soft walls have formed. The internal reproductive organs are developed until the 13th instar, although the accessory glands and the \\"yellow\\" glands still lack pigmentation and the ovarioles contain not yet differentiated ova. From the 14th instar on, no further development apart from a gradual increase in size takes place. At 24 ¬∞C, eggs hatch after 34 days, and nymphs develop to the 13th instar within 11 months, with sexual maturity probably reached at 18 months of age. Gray silverfish can reach ages of about eight years, and unlike the hemi- and holometabolous insects, the ametabolous silverfish undergo further moultings even as imagines, with three to five moults per year. =Digestive tract= Gray silverfish have a simple digestive tract, consisting of a hypopharynx, a large, thin-walled crop (with the same pH as the ingested food) that occupies more than half of the body length, followed by the toothed gizzard, the mid-intestine, anteriorly (pH 4.8‚Äì5.4) with sacculi and further posteriad (pH 6.4‚Äì7.0) with a peritrophic membrane enclosing the ingested food mass, the hind intestine (pH 2.6‚Äì3.8) with an anterior dorsal loop and ending in the rectum, with the anus being surrounded by two rows of papillae. The anterior region of the midgut exhibits gastric caeca, bladder-like extensions that absorb the nutrients of the digested food. Histologically, the midgut epithelium consists of a single layer of columnar cells that border the midgut lumen with a brush border membrane. Interspersed in the midgut epithelium are nests of stem cells. The surface of hind intestine and rectum is greatly increased by deep longitudinal folds, presumably extracting water from the faeces. The hypopharynx is flanked by a pair of large salivary glands which open into its lumen. The mid-intestinal cells of early instars are already as differentiated as in mature stages, and the gizzard is of the same form, although with fewer serrations and hairs on the teeth. The malpighian tubules are relatively large until approximately the twelfth larval instar. Biology Ctenolepisma longicaudata on paper. =Diet= Ctenolepisma longicaudata is a synanthrope in human housings, and its natural food sources are unknown so that information on the biology of this species comes from indoor observations and rearings. Gray silverfish feed on a wide spectrum of substrates, ranging from plant remains like dried grass over insect remains to bread crumbs, paper, and artificial silk and cotton fabrics. They also eat cast skins from previous moults, as they prove rich in nutrients, containing 1% of the fat and 6% of the nitrogen stored in the body. Gray silverfish will not feed on wool felt, flannel, carpet, fur felt and natural silk. Paper made from mechanical pulp is not attacked, and that from Kraft and Esparto pulps is slightly attacked; only paper produced from (bleached or unbleached) sulphite pulps is readily eaten. Paper consisting of 80% sulphite pulp and 20% mechanical pulp greatly reduces the attack by gray silverfish as compared to 100% sulphite pulp paper. Papers with 45% or more of mechanical pulp content are not attacked. Starvation experiments showed that gray silverfish can survive without food for up to around 250 to 300 days. While Lindsay (1940) states that gray silverfish do not actively take up (i.e., drink) water, but obtain it from the ingested food and from oxidation of food, Heep (1967) shows that free, dyed water is taken up into the gut by dehydrated gray silverfish. Dehydrated C. longicaudata are able to replenish their body water content from the water vapour in air of 60 to 100% relative humidity. =Rearing= For rearing purposes, gray silverfish nymphs and adults can be fed on tissue paper, gummed paper, artificial silk, ground whole wheat and yeast, or oat flakes. The related firebrat, Thermobia domestica, can be fed whole wheat or plain flour; thoroughly dried and pulverised meat can be used as a strong attractant. In a dry environment, gray silverfish will die within one month, therefore a high humidity of 70‚Äì85% must be maintained under rearing conditions, e.g. through open containers of water next to the rearing containers. In addition, a moist cotton wick or a shallow tray of sand that has to be kept always damp might be provided in the rearing containers. The cultivation temperature should be around 24 ¬∞C. For egg deposition under rearing conditions, cotton wool can be provided. Since silverfish are nocturnal and photonegative, the light regime for a successful culture should be kept in favour of darkness, e.g. eight hours of light and 16 hours of darkness. =Reproduction= Reproduction is slow, as gray silverfish reach sexual maturity at the age of two to three years. They will reproduce for at least three years. The related firebrat reproduces only once a year and in irregular intervals. =Attractants= In the past it was assumed that gray silverfish use a contact pheromone for aggregation and arrestment, and that the aggregation pheromone of the Lepismatidae species Lepisma saccharina (common silverfish) and Thermobia domestica (firebrat) has the same effect on the gray silverfish. Later research, first conducted on the firebrat Thermobia domestica, indicated that aggregation behaviour is not triggered by pheromones, but by an endosymbiotic fungus, Mycotypha microspora (Mycotyphaceae), and an endosymbiotic bacterium, Enterobacter cloacae (Enterobacteriaceae), which are present in the faeces. It was also shown that firebrats detect the presence of E. cloacae based on its external glycocalyx of polysaccharides, most likely based on its D-glucose component. Mycotypha microspora is only detected by firebrats in the presence of cellulose, suggesting that metabolites of the enzymatic cellulose digestion by M. microspora (such as D-glucose) serves as the aggregation/arrestment cue. In a follow-up study, it was shown that gray silverfish also respond with arrestment to Mycotypha microspora. =Natural enemies= Two species of Ctenolepisma are known to be parasitised by Strepsiptera: C. ciliatum is parasitised by Mengenilla chobauti, and C. michaelseni by Mengenilla parvula. It is not known as of yet, whether the gray silverfish is also parasitised by Mengenilla or other strepsipterans. Two species of gregarine parasites are recorded from the intestinal tract of the gray silverfish: Garnhamia aciculata and Lepismatophila ctenolepismae. The related Ctenolepisma lineatum contains on average 15 specimens of parasitic Apicomplexa per animal in their intestinal tract, especially the crop. The spitting spider Scytodes thoracica preys on Lepismatidae like the gray silverfish. Distribution The natural distribution of the gray silverfish is unknown, since all observations are from within or near human dwellings. The gray silverfish is recorded from the following European countries: * Albania * Austria: first record from a museum depot in Vienna in 2002 * Belgium: oldest record from 1998 * Bulgaria * Cyprus * Czech Republic: first record from 2017 * Denmark: first record in 2017 * Faroe Islands: recorded in 2017 * Finland * France * Germany: oldest record from Hamburg in 1906, where live specimens were intercepted from Echinocactus plants imported from Mexico * Greece * Ireland * Italy: first record 1908 from Italy as misidentification C. ciliatum var. dives * Lithuania * Luxembourg * Malta * Netherlands: oldest record from 1989 * Norway: oldest confirmed records 1979 from the Zoological Museum of Oslo, and 2006 from B√¶rum, officially registered for the country in 2014 * Portugal * Russia * Slovakia * Slovenia * Spain * Sweden: present since 1994 * Switzerland * Ukraine * United Kingdom: record from 2014 African countries with records of the gray silverfish: * Algeria * Botswana * Egypt * Malawi: oldest record from Blantyre in 1908 * Morocco * Mozambique: oldest record from Beira in 1912 * Namibia: oldest record from 1933 * Seychelles * South Africa: first record 1905 from Bothaville, the type locality of the gray silverfish * Zimbabwe American countries and regions with records of the gray silverfish: * Argentina * Brazil: oldest record from Santos in 1908 * Canada * Colombia * Cuba * Ecuador * El Salvador * Mexico * Panama * Paraguay * Peru: oldest record from Callao in 1908 * Puerto Rico * Trinidad and Tobago * United States: Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois, Hawaii, southern California (first(?) record 1955 from Pacific Beach) Asian countries and regions with records of the gray silverfish: * Afghanistan * Armenia * Bangladesh * China: Hong Kong * India * Israel * Japan * Lebanon * Malaysia * Philippines * Singapore * South Korea * Thailand * Turkey Oceanian countries with records of the gray silverfish: * Australia: oldest record from 1905 * New Caledonia * New Zealand * Vanuatu Damage of cellulose-based materials The gray silverfish is able to feed on paper and similar materials comprising cellulose. In a comparative screening for cellulolytic activity, the gray silverfish was found to have the highest relative cellulase activity, by far exceeding that of other cellulose-digesting insects like Conocephalus strictus (Orthoptera), the termite Reticulitermes flavipes (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), Cryptocercus roaches (Blattodea: Cryptocercidae) and Scolytinae bark beetles (Coleoptera). The highest activity of plant cell wall degrading enzymes is found in the head and especially in the foregut of the gray silverfish. Endoglucanase, which breaks down the cellulose chain into smaller fragments, is found in both the head and foregut part of the digestive tract, whereas Œ≤-glucosidase, which catalyses the final degradation into glucose, is present in the foregut, but not in the head tissue; Œ≤-xylosidase activity is very low in the head, but the enzyme is present in the foregut. Polygalacturonase activity is not observed in C. longicaudata. A cellulose- rich diet does not increase the cellulase activity, suggesting that the production of these cellulolytic enzymes is not diet-regulated. Although a mixed diet is necessary for the natural development of C. longicaudata, it can survive more than 600 days on a diet of cellulose alone. As such, the gray silverfish is a threat to cultural heritage institutions storing books, sheet music, paintings and similar objects. A Swedish survey on the damage impact of C. longicaudata reports attacks on: watercolor paintings; packing material; cartons; books, where the outer cover, glued areas inside of the cover and marbled paper were eaten; historical documents of handmade paper; paper documents; transcripts; stamps in showrooms; newly produced signs labels in showrooms; historical paper labels on objects; mounting paper on the back of a photograph; roll painting in genuine silk, mounted with starch paste on masonite; insects caught in adhesive traps. Control measurements In recent years, gray silverfish have been reported from a number of European countries (see section Distribution), where they have been recorded as a nuisance pest in houses, kindergartens and schools, but also as damaging cellulose-based materials in a warehouse and in cultural heritage institutions like museums, libraries and archives. In Norwegian houses, the number of pest control measurements against the gray silverfish have drastically increased since the year 2016. The majority of insurance cases involving the gray silverfish apply to new houses built after the year 2000, which, due to the improved wall insulation, assumingly provide more favourable living conditions for this species. Due to their relatively slow development and longevity and their ability to survive up to ten months without food, control measurements against the gray silverfish have to be applied over an extended period of time. An integrated pest management, applying several control measurements in parallel, has been proposed as the most promising approach for the control of this species. This includes the removal of potential food sources such as food crumbs by wiping the floor also beneath and behind cooking stoves and refrigerators, and storage of dried food products, including tea bags and animal food, in sealed containers. Reducing the amount of water used during cleaning will reduce indoor humidity, which is detrimental for egg development. It should also be kept in mind that gray silverfish do not have to drink, and can use the water vapour contained in air of 60% relative humidity and higher as their water source instead. =Trapping= A common control measurement is the use of sticky traps, especially for monitoring purposes to get an idea on the dimension of silverfish infestation. Adding milled cricket powder to sticky traps as protein-rich bait has been shown to result in a significantly higher average catch as compared to unbaited sticky traps. =Poisoning= Toxic baits are another means of reducing or eradicating silverfish infestation.

(2020) tested different commercially available paste-based products, containing imidacloprid, clothianidin, fipronil or indoxacarb as active ingredient, regarding their effect in pest management of gray silverfish. Imidacloprid was found to cause a mortality rate of less than 50% after 18 days, whereas the other three pesticides caused mortality rates above 90%. Indoxacarb application in field trials decreased gray silverfish populations to less than 10% within 10 to 12 weeks. Since silverfish also consume dead insects, including specimens of their own species, secondary poisoning through the consumption of primarily poisoned individuals has an additional population-reducing effect. With 75% mortality, indoxacarb was found to be much more potent in secondary poisoning as compared to clothianidin with a 15% mortality rate. Indoxacarb was therefore evaluated as the most potent poison against gray silverfish, and even six-month old bait was still able to cause a high mortality rate. Fipronil as poison was not further investigated due to its comparatively high toxicity for humans. When using toxic baits, attention should be paid to the secure placement of these baits to minimise the chance of unintentional ingestion by pets or children. Placing small droplets of gel-based poison into gaps, crevices and cracks that act as natural hiding places for silverfish during the day will reduce the likelihood of unintended contact and at the same time increase the chance of the poison being ingested by the gray silverfish. Distributing many small poison bait droplets, as opposed to few large portions, evenly over the infested area will further increase the success of the poison treatment. A study on the efficacy of various poisonous baits (containing boric acid, hydramethylnon, indoxacarb, abamectin, chlorfenapyr, dinotefuran, fipronil, metaflumizone, and novaluron) against the related Lepismatidae species Thermobia domestica and Lepisma saccharinum has been conducted by Sims & Appel (2012). =Pesticide spraying= Studies on the effects of pesticide sprays on Ctenolepisma longicaudata have not been published. A study by Faulde et al. (2003) investigated the knockdown (i.e., inability to move, and lying upside down) effect of fabrics spray-impregnated with permethrin on the related common silverfish (Lepisma saccharinum), where a 100% knockdown was observed after 5.5 ¬± 2.6 min of exposure to the permethrin coating. Since the premises inhabited by gray silverfish are usually co-inhabited by humans, the application of pesticides in the form of sprays should be avoided wherever possible, and more targeted approaches like bait poisoning should be considered. As pesticide-sprayed areas will be avoided by silverfish, a risk of their dispersal towards unaffected areas is given, which will prolong the pest management efforts. =Temperature treatment= At temperatures of 16 ¬∞C and below, the growth rate is considerably decreased, with an average length of adult stadia (i.e., the time between two consecutive mouldings) of 126 days as compared to 15 days at 29 ¬∞C. 16 ¬∞C can therefore be seen as limiting temperature for active feeding and growth. Torpor sets in at a temperature of 13 ¬∞C, and at 11 ¬∞C, ecdysis stops. Nymphs are much more sensitive to cold: at a temperature of 1 ¬∞C, second instar larvae die within two days, whereas adult specimens can survive several months. At 21 ¬∞C, egg development takes on average 49 days, which decreases with higher temperatures; at 29.5 ¬∞C, hatching occurs after 20 days. At 21 ¬∞C, the first larval instar is on average 9 days long, which is reduced to 5 days at temperatures of 24 ¬∞C and above. Prolonged temperatures above 24 ¬∞C are eventually fatal for gray silverfish: At 26 ¬∞C, the survival is 4 months, and at temperatures of 29 to 33.6 ¬∞C, survival time drops to 1‚Äì3 weeks. Heeg (1967) found the optimum temperature range of the gray silverfish to be in the range of 8 to 25 ¬∞C, with the upper avoidance temperature at 40‚Äì43 ¬∞C. Survival rate at high temperatures is higher in dry air of 5% relative humidity (RH) as compared to 85% RH, presumably due to water evaporation from the insects' bodies. However, prolonged exposure to such low humidity levels will lead to death within 2‚Äì4 weeks. A critical humidity value seems to be 55%, below which the period of survival is drastically reduced. These observations show that ambient temperature should be taken into account when applying an integrated pest management plan. If poisoned bait is used, temperatures should be at 20 ¬∞C or higher, as food is consumed much more rapidly as compared to 16 ¬∞C (at even lower temperatures, feeding comes to a halt). If the aim is to gain time to prepare control measures, a decrease in ambient temperature in the infested premises to 16 ¬∞C or lower is advisable to slow down population growth.

Parts of Croker-King's trepanning instrument Croker- King's trepanning instrument configured for use as a trepan (A) and as a trephine (B) Samuel Croker-King (28 June 1728 - 12 January 1817) was an Irish surgeon who was associated with Doctor Steeven's Hospital in Dublin for sixty years. He was the first president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), from 1784 to 1785. He is thought to have saved the life of the child who became the Duke of Wellington. He invented his own trepanning device. Early life Samuel Croker-King was born in the city of Dublin on 28 June 1728. His family hailed from Devonshire in England, and had been in the area for so long that a local distich reads that: :\\"The Crokers, Crewys, and Coletons, :When the Conqueror came were at home.\\" The first of the Croker family to travel to Ireland was Sir John Croker, who was cup-bearer to William III, a position which probably explains why the Crokers' crest is a goblet with two fleurs-de-lis. Jane King gave her property to Croker on condition that he added her name to his own which was done by letters patent in around 1761.Cameron, Sir Charles A. (1886) History of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and of the Irish Schools of Medicine &c; Dublin: Fannin & Co. pp. 305-308\\\\. Croker-King married the noted beauty Miss Obre, and they resided for many years in the then fashionable Jervis Street. Career Croker-King served his apprenticeship under surgeon-general Nichols. His first professional appointment was as surgeon to Steevens' Hospital in 1758, an establishment of which he later became a visiting surgeon and governor. As such, he was intimately acquainted with the procedures and rules of the hospital and The Gilbert Collection of the Dublin City Library contains the manuscript of his 1785 history of the hospital and description of its operations.Wea41 Evenews1. Dublin City Council. Retrieved 28 June 2018. This was published in book form by P. Dixon Hardy & Sons of Dublin in 1854, after Croker-King's death. In 1816 he gave evidence about the duties of the apothecary at the hospital, noting that in addition to preparing the medicines and dressings required by the hospital's physicians and surgeons, the apothecary was responsible for seeing that medicines were taken, had to be constantly at the hospital, and \\"especially\\" was required to sleep at the hospital every night. In addition to Steevens' Hospital, Croker-King was surgeon to the Rotunda Hospital, to the Revenue Department, and to the Hospital for Venereal Diseases in North King Street. His patients came mainly from the upper classes as shown by his fee-book which includes the noble houses of Charlemont, Enniskillen, Farnham, Howth, Leitrim, Tyrone, and Westmeath. The surgeon J. W. Cusack said of Croker-King, \\"He lived by the nobility and great landed proprietors, whilst I live by the people\\", adding, \\"but I make more money than he did.\\" Croker-King was the first president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), from 1784 to 1785.RCSI Presidents since its foundation in 1784.

Incidents He was credited with saving the life of the child who became the Duke of Wellington (1769‚Äì1852) after the child was brought to him following an incorrect diagnosis by a country doctor. In May 1791, Croker-King read a paper before the Royal Irish Academy which was subsequently published in their transactions as \\"Description of an Instrument for Performing the Operation of Trepanning the Skull, with More Ease, Safety and Expedition, than Those Now in General Use\\". In the paper he observed that surgical instruments had greatly improved in the present century with the exception of those used for trepanning, a procedure often required due to the frequency of accidents but which was difficult to carry out due to the nature of the instruments available and the \\"difficulty in keeping the patient quiet\\". If the operation went wrong and the brain was damaged, death might result.\\"Description of an Instrument for Performing the Operation of Trepanning the Skull, with More Ease, Safety and Expedition, than Those Now in General Use\\", Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol. 4 (1790‚Äì1792), pp. 119‚Äì139. In order to remedy the defects of existing devices, Croker-King had developed his own trepanning device which had been built specially for him by John Read, a cutlery and instrument maker of Skinner Row, Dublin.How Dublin's Georgian surgeons were a cut above during a gruesome era. Alan O'Keeffe, independent.ie, 3 June 2018. Retrieved 28 June 2018. It could be used either as a trepan or as a trephine and did not require any force or pressure to cut through the skull, thus avoiding the risk of accidentally damaging the brain. Croker-King wrote that he and other surgeons in Dublin had already used the device successfully. Fellow physician, John Gilborne, wrote verse in praise of Croker-King in 1775 as follows which mentions his use of the trepan: :\\"The fractur'd Skull, to Samuel Croker-King, :The broken Limb, Wounds, and Luxations bring; :There's no Disaster but he can set right, :With Splints, Trepan, and Bandage not too tight.\\" Death and legacy After sixty years at Doctor Steeven's Hospital, Croker-King died in North Cumberland Street, Dublin, on 12 January 1817, and was buried at St Mary's churchyard. A painting showing him wearing a crimson velvet coat, with lace ruffles and a powdered wig, passed to Charles Croker-King, his grandson and a fellow of the RCSI. An unsigned portrait of Croker is in the collection of the RCSI at their headquarters at Stephen's Green, Dublin. A similar painting was sold by Whyte's of Dublin in 2013.

It is present in the United States, specifically mountainous areas from southern Virginia to northern Georgia. These flies are known for their distinctive mating ritual in which the males offer the females a large empty sack filled with hundreds of silk bubbles.  Description  The thorax and head are darkly colored with grey frosted areas. Eyes are nearly holoptic, meaning that they almost meet in the middle of the head, but there is a slight separation. Legs are yellow with a dark ring where the femur ends. Wings are semi-clear with brown veins throughout. Males and females look quite similar. Two differences are that the separation between the eyes is usually wider in males, and the bristles on the upper part of the leg are shorter in males.  Behavior  Empis snoddyi flies have evolved a mating ritual in which males provide an empty sack filled with silk bubbles as nuptial gifts to females. Other species of Empididae provide nuptial gifts in the form of prey, wrapped prey, or sacks filled with prey, so it is likely that the empty balloons provided by Empis snoddyi relic related to these nutritious nuptial gifts. It has been hypothesized that these balloons are a representation of the male‚Äôs fitness, and it has been shown that large males with intermediately sized sacks have the highest mating rate. The prothoracic basitarsus in the male produces the silk for the balloon. The balloon complex is made up of air- filled polygons made of silk. The males are able to vary their output of silk, which leads an irregular pattern of different sized polygons.

The government town of Kringin was proclaimed on 25 September 1924 on land on the boundaries of the cadastral units of the hundreds of Kingsford and Peebinga to the immediate north-west of the Kringin Railway Station. The town was named after the railway station, a stop on the now-closed Peebinga railway line, and whose name is derived from an aboriginal word meaning ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù or ‚Äúspringing up.‚Äù The boundaries for the locality were created on 28 September 2000 and includes the site of the Government Town of Kringin which is located in its south- eastern corner adjacent to the Peebinga Conservation Park. A school operated in the town from 1926 to 1945. In 1991, it was reported that members of the Vietnam Veterans‚Äô Association were planning to purchase the town and develop it both as holiday accommodation and as a retirement community for Vietnam veterans. Land use within the locality is mainly concerned with ‚Äúprimary production‚Äù while land in its south-east corner located in the protected area, the Peebinga Conservation Park, is zoned for ‚Äúconservation‚Äù. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Kringin had a population of zero.

It was previously known as a dwarf nova with variable star designation V392 Persei. Dwarf nova A U Geminorum-type variable star or dwarf nova is a type of cataclysmic variable star consisting of a close binary star system in which one of the components is a white dwarf that accretes matter from a cool main sequence or subgiant companion. V392 Persei was discovered in 1970 and received its variable star designation a year later. It is normally visual magnitude 17.4 and experiences outbursts of 2-3 magnitudes. Its spectrum in the quiescent state has been studied and only the cool star is detected. The spectrum shows emission lines of hydrogen-alpha (HŒ±) and both neutral and ionised helium. The brightest recorded observations is at magnitude 5.6. Nova eruption On April 29, 2018 it was discovered by Yuji Nakamura to be extremely bright, and it was spectroscopically confirmed as a nova outburst with magnitude 6.2 on April 30. The spectrum includes broad HŒ± and FeII emission lines with P Cygni profiles. The absorption core is blueshifted by a velocity of 2,680 km/s, which would be the expansion velocity from the nova explosion. Observations with Fermi-LAT on April 30 show a strong gamma-ray source at the coordinates of the nova. Photometry of the nova from Konkoly Observatory on May 1, 2018 give apparent magnitudes of 7.38 in the V band and 8.22 in the B band, suggesting it is already declining. System V392 Persei is the southern of a pair of stars separated by 8.5\\". The symbiotic pair are unresolved and the nature of the cool component is unclear. The spectral energy distribution is inconsistent with a bright giant star but it could be less luminous red clump giant or subgiant. If the cool component was a main sequence red dwarf as expected for a dwarf nova, then the system would need to be closer than the suggested by its Gaia parallax.

It is found in the Caribbean Sea, Central America, and North America. Identification: Head: Brown to black with pale yellow marks. Face has a longitudinal yellow stripe each side of center; middle dark area appearing as a dark stripe, sometimes incomplete. Pattern of yellow oblong spots on top of head; can be obscure. Eyes multi-colored. Antenna: Brown except segment 1 yellowish, more so on underside. Thorax: Neck (prothorax) long and slender, more cone-shaped at head. Cream-colored patch at base and end of neck; rest yellowish-brown to dark brown. Usually with a light or dark colored longitudinal stripe down center. Thorax side on female dark with cream, curved lines. Male sides mostly pale. Wings: Wings clear with brown veins; no brown spots at wing tips. Base and outside edge of wings dark brown (costa area), with a faint yellowish streak. Stigma at end of costa also dark brown. Legs: Front legs modified, similar to praying mantis; dark brown with light streaks. Usually folded up and not used, except for eating. Mid and hind legs pale yellow with brown streaks; females have joint to body (coxae) brown; male coxae pale. Abdomen: Yellowish-brown to dark brown with yellow marks. Female abdomen always darker, and may be entirely black; the yellow marks vary considerably. Abdomen side edges cream, almost entirely on male, more spotted on female. Similar Species: Dicromantispa interrupta is a larger species with a dark patch near tip of wing. Leptomantispa pulchella has side-by-side (paired) yellow stripes of even width running down sides of abdomen, whereas D. sayi has uneven width pattern down sides. L. pulchella also has a bright, burnt orange stigma on wings, not brown as in D. sayi. Otherwise, these two are identical. Size: 14 to 15 mm long. Habitat: Forest edges and prairies where spiders are present. Food: Adults feed on small flying insects. Larvae hunt for just about any species spider eggs, but major hosts are Wolf and Hunting spiders Lycosidae, and Running Crab Spider Philodromus vulgaris. Flight Time: Jul 15 to Sep 4th. Peaks end of July Life Cycle: Females lay eggs on any substrate. Larvae hatch, wander, find and either penetrate wolf spider egg sacs, or hitch a ride on adult female spiders ready to lay eggs. 1st instar over-winters. One generation per year.

History  As the business was going well, the shareholders were able to purchase and extend the company premises in 1927. In doing so, they based the design and d√©cor of the facilities on the Velten-Vordamm stoneware factories. Margarete Loebenstein had also worked there previously. In March 1928, the Loebenstein brothers were killed in an accident on the way to a trade fair in Leipzig.http://www.euhausen-klaus.de/Euhausen_Heymann_Loebenstein_Marks.pdf Initially, the widow was successful in carrying on the business alone and, during the world financial crisis, was even able, despite sustained business losses, to present the new and understated crockery design \\"Norma\\" from 28 August to 1 September 1932 at the Leipzig Trade Fair. Yet the annual losses for the business year 1932 amounted to 33,768 Reichsmarks. The company failed to exhibit at the Leipzig Spring Trade Fair. New investment was needed for the continuation of the business in the old cocklestove factory, which Margarete Loebenstein closed down at the beginning of July 1933. August Wojak, the works manager who had been taken on from the Velten works of the stoneware manufacturer Velten-Vordamm, which went bankrupt in 1931, now tried to win over Adolf Kruckau, the Director of the successor company Ceramic Works Vordamm to the idea of re-founding the Velten factory in the old Marwitz cocklestove factory. Margarete Loebenstein had previously worked in the Velten works and the plan was for her to take on the role of Artistic Director and a half of the shares, amounting to 20,000 Reichsmarks. This was what was agreed between Kruckau and the liquidator appointed by Loebenstein, Dr Max Silberstein. Yet in September 1933, Loebenstein closed down the company once and for all and attempted to found a new company in Jerusalem.Eva Samuel, Ulrike Thomas: Courage to start again: Life in Palestine from 1932 to 1948. Berlin 2010, page 61, letter from 24 October 1933. As Nora Herz wrote to Hedwig Bollhagen, Margarete Loebenstein was expected back on 17 November for new negotiations on the basis of the agreements made previously. Heinrich Schild, who had already given his support to the workers who were laid off at the Velten works of the Velten-Vordamm stoneware factory as a bankruptcy advisor in 1931, restarted the negotiations and, on 1 May 1934, through the founding of the HB Workshops for Ceramics, was able to set up a new workplace for the employees of the stoneware factories, under the artistic direction of Hedwig Bollhagen. Schild took on the role of an unpaid managing director. Bollhagen became an employee of the new business. She was able to include existing and new kinds of decoration and existing and new models, through the use of both the repertoire of the Ha√´l Workshops ‚Äì including the \\"Norma\\" series ‚Äì and that of the Velten-Vordamm stoneware factories‚Äîincluding, through the re-employment of the painters, the \\"paradise pattern\\" by Charlotte Hartmann ‚Äîand add these to new groups of designs.

Built by the Aleppine wealthy businessman Subhi Kabbab√© during the days of the French Mandate for Syria, Villa Rose is the first building in Aleppo (and probably Syria) to feature pure European architectural elements, mainly based on Baroque principles. It is colloquially known as the Villa Rose because of the pink-colored stones of the building. In 1948, the building was purchased by Dr. Gregory Kassis who turned it into a maternity hospital. During the 1960s, the building was about to be dismantled by its new owner Jean-Frederic Rabbat. However, upon the demand of the citizens, then-governor of Aleppo Abdulghani al-Saadawi mediated the dispute, convincing the owner to preserve the palace. In 1983, the mansion was sold to a new group of owners and the building was listed among the architectural heritage monuments of Aleppo, in order to prevent any possible destruction by its future owners. Currently, Villa Rose is owned by the local businessman Abdul Aziz al-Sukhni who is among the tycoons of pharmaceutical industry in Syria.

Inspired in part by the nationwide teacher strikes in Republican-dominated states such as West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona, bus drivers for DeKalb County School District planned a \\"sick-out\\" to protest low wages and little employee benefits. About 42 percent of bus drivers in the county participated, causing nearly 60-90 minute delays in students being picked up for school. As a right-to-work state, public sector employees are prohibited in Georgia from striking. The strike resulted in at least 7 bus drivers, particularly ones who helped organize the strike, being terminated of employment.  Background  The planned sick-out was in response to ongoing pay cuts and lowered benefits for school bus drivers. Per the website, Indeed, the average school bus driver salary in DeKalb County was $23,000, and the starting pay was around $18,000 to $19,000 per year, which is 23% below the national average. A day prior to the sick-out R. Stephen Green, the superintendent for DeKalb County School District met with over 300 bus drivers about concerns over pay and benefits. Green said he was committed to improving the pay and working conditions for bus drivers, but did not propose anything further. The sickout was originally planned for April 19-23, the strike was organized by several bus drivers that went under the labor group name, \\"DeKalb County School Bus Driver Solidarity Coalition\\". On April 19, about 380 bus drivers participated of the 908 total, causing nearly 60-90 minute delays for the pickup of students. On April 20, that number decreased to 225. The following Monday, the number further decreased to 63.  Response  = DeKalb County School District administration = R. Stephen Green, the superintendent for DeKalb County School District condemned the strike. Green said \\"We have been clear from the beginning. We will keep an open dialogue with employees provided they work collaboratively and keep our children safe by reporting to work. Unfortunately, some employees chose another route, and that carries serious consequences.\\" On April 20, seven DCSD bus drivers, that were involved in leading the strike, were terminated of employment. Green claimed the bus drivers in DeKalb County were among the highest paid in the Atlanta metropolitan area. This included pay raises in 2014 and 2015 in the response of longer work days, that drivers receive benefits despite being part-time, and that the county provides a Transportation Leadership Academy to offer career advancement for bus drivers. Threats of a second strike seemed possible as the Coalition demanded the fired employees be granted their employment back. On April 26, Green said he would host a meeting with the DeKalb County School Bus Driver Solidarity Coalition to discuss a plan to improve pay and working conditions for bus drivers. Leaders of the Coalition said that Green did not invite the leaders of the Coalition and hand-picked bus drivers to shift the dialogue in his favor. = DeKalb County School District parents and students = On May 2, 2018 a change.org petition formed from the parents of DCSD urging Green to reinstate the terminated drivers.

For the anthropologist, of the analysis of the compilations of folklore it is deduced that the conception of the tradition and the traditional thing is a recent historical invention fixed in a canon built culturally from the romanticism and has strong ideological implications. The anthropologist D√≠az Viana denounces the current acculturation when it is accepted without criticism by the overmodernity ‚Äì technological fetishism and logic of economic progress ‚Äì that inevitably distances us from the human reality. He also criticizes some proposals to protect the rural environment: a conservationist model of nature, landscapes and countryside that has left the people who still live in it as figurines dams on postcards that some administrations keep there only to be visited.

The rally is part of the larger wave of teachers' strikes in the United States where protests occurred in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona.  Background  = State of education in North Carolina = Ahead of the protests the average salary for a teacher in North Carolina was $49,970, which ranked 44th in the nation according to a report by the National Education Association. Public school revenue per student in North Carolina ranked 43rd in the nation at $9,675. = Demands = The North Carolina Association of Educators (NCAE) demanded that the Government of North Carolina enacted legislation that increase per pupil spending, a multi-year pay plan for teachers, support staff, administrators, and all school personnel, which includes the restoration of compensation for longevity and advanced degrees. Additionally, the NCAE demanded that public schools in North Carolina increase the number of school nurses, counselors, social workers and other support personnel and expand Medicaid to improve community health. NCAE also demanded that the state legislature set up a statewide school construction board to fix older schools and reduce large class sizes.  Response  = Government of North Carolina = Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and the Governor of North Carolina, urged local and state officials to stop attacking teachers and unite together to support teachers and schools in the state. Cooper tweeted an editorial of The Charlotte Observer. Members from the North Carolina Republican Party sent out mass emails to constituents across the state explaining their support for public education and teachers. Joseph Kyzer, a spokesperson for House speaker Tom Moore stated that Republican leadership has continuously raised teachers salaries and that it was Democratic leadership in the state that stalled out spending. Teachers pointed out although salaries have increased, the increases have been modest and lagged far behind the national average, and that despite this, general education funding on supplies and per pupil spending have been continuously cut. A fellow Republican member, Mark Brody, who serves on the board of Union Day School in Waxhaw, N.C., called teachers protesting and the backers of the protest 'Union Thugs', that want to control the education process. Brody said he was speaking up because he did not want his local Union County schools or North Carolina schools in general to turn into Chicago. \\"Let the Union thugs get their way now and we are half way there,\\" he said. Brody would defend his statement, but emphasize that the \\"thug\\" remark was about trade unions, and not the teachers themselves. = Labor unions = The Raleigh-Durham chapter of the Industrial Workers of the World helped coordinate transportation for protestors who wished to rally with the teachers in Raleigh. = Political organizations = Several North Carolina chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America stood in solidarity with the NCAE, and offered coordination for individuals wishing to join the protest.

History Orville Botsford was born in Wayne County, New York in 1821 and settled in Farmington with his parents in 1836. Botsford purchased the property where this house is located in 1843. Botsford built this house in approximately 1860. The Botsford family owned the house until 1915. In approximately 1939, Earle Graser and his wife Jeane moved into the house. The Grasers carried out significant rebuilding of the house. They were apparently in the process of purchasing it when Earle Graser was killed in a traffic accident in 1941. Description The Botsford- Graser House is a two-story house of mixed Greek Revival and Colonial Revival style. It has a clapboarded exterior. The house is visually divided into two rectangular sections. The first, smaller sections fronts on the street, and is a gable-roofed Greek Revival section, with a broad frieze and classical cornices with returns. A larger section to the rear is also gable-roofed, but with the roof ridge perpendicular to the front section. This section is more Colonial Revival in design, but contains simplified Greek Revival elements. Windows in both sections are double-hung, six-over-six units.

A pioneer in executive education and in using the case method to teach management in Spain, he was committed to the world of business.Real Academia de la Historia, Antonio Valero y Vicente Valero served as a board member and advisor in public and private sector companies, and was an advisor to various government ministries.ABC, August 8, 2001 \\"Fallece Antonio Valero, primer director del IESE\\". He helped found the first centrist political parties in Catalonia. In 1968, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise.  Education  The son of Gabriel Valero and Dolores Vicente, he grew up in Zaragoza, where he began his higher education at the Escuela Profesional de Comercio (1943), before moving on to Industrial Engineering in Terrassa, where he finished top of his class (1949) and graduated with honors, earning the Premio Extraordinario de Fin de Carrera. In 1960, he completed his Ph.D. in Textile Engineering from the Terrassa School of Engineering, where he would also earn an engineering doctorate in Textile Industries Interview with Antonio Valero in Heraldo de Arag√≥n (June 9, 1981).  Academic Activity  Antonio Valero served as professor of the Chemistry of Dyes and Artificial Fibers, and of Prints and Textile Preparation (1954‚Äì1960), and later as professor of Industrial Organization and Business Administration (1962‚Äì1963) and of Theory, Structure and Economic Institutions, and Business Administration and Production Management (1963‚Äì1972) at the Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Terrassa. He was a professor of Economics at the Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales de Bilbao (1977‚Äì1990). Valero joined the University of Navarra's IESE Business School as dean and professor (1958-1994) the year of its founding. He taught Business Policy, later renamed General Management, in various executive education programs, always instilling a sense of what a company committed to society and based on the ethical principles of Christianity is From September 1994 to August 2001, he was professor emeritus on that same subject matter. Antonio Valero was also a visiting professor at the following academic institutions: Institut Europ√©en d'Administration des Affaires (INSEAD), Fontainebleau, France (1963); Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci√≥n de Empresa (IPADE), Mexico (1967‚Äì1968); Istituto Superiore per Imprenditori e Dirigenti di Azienda (ISIDA), Palermo, Italy (1970); Tel Aviv University, Israel (1971‚Äì1972); Austral University Business School (IAE), Argentina (1978); Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var de Caracas (1979), Venezuela; Associa√ßao de Estudos Superiores de Empresa (AESE), Lisbon, Portugal (1980); School of Management and Business at Universidad de La Sabana (INALDE), Colombia (1986‚Äì1987); School of management at the University of Piura (PAD), Peru; and Instituto de Desarrollo Empresarial (IDE), Guayaquil, Ecuador (1998). His role as a professor was complemented by his responsibilities in the management and guidance of educational organizations: He was a member of the Governing Board (1958‚Äì1967) and the Board of Trustees (1967‚Äì1974) of the University of Navarra and vice president (1964‚Äì1966), then president (1966‚Äì1968) of the European Association of Management Training Centers (EAMTC), based in Brussels.  Founding of IESE  Antonio Valero, 1988 In the summer of 1957, Jos√© Javier L√≥pez Jacoiste, an envoy of Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, met with Valero and conveyed the Opus Dei founder's desire to take measures to help business leaders manage their companies from a Christian perspective. Thus, Antonio Valero began the process commissioned by Escriv√° to create a school that would train business leaders and executives. Valero gathered information from several colleagues and friends about what was happening outside of Spain in the field of executive education. In the spring of 1958, he traveled to Lille (France), whose √âcole des Administrations des Affaires‚Äîdirected by an MBA graduate from Harvard Business School (HBS)‚Äîhad introduced the case method of teaching, a novelty in Europe. In May, Valero presented a proposal to Escriv√°, who gave his approval and set the 1958‚Äì1959 academic year as its launch date.Javier Pampliega ‚ÄúLa historia del IESE‚Äù Revista Pedres Albes, n¬∫ 5, mayo 2015, p√°gs.. 2-11 In the first action plan for IESE, Valero outlined the initial phase of the project, the professors who could take part in it and the name of the future educational institute, which was, after some discussion, was called the Escuela de Directores del Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (IESE). With Valero as dean, the next steps were to select the faculty and develop the curriculum for the first program, called the Programa de Alta Direcci√≥n de Empresas (PADE), which was aimed at business leaders with at least a decade of experience in senior management. On November 25‚Äì26, 1958, the first classes were held at the Hotel del Parque in Sant Andreu de Llavaneres. The Programa de Direcci√≥n de Empresas (PDE) followed in the 1959‚Äì1960 academic year, and the Programa de Desarrollo para Alta Direcci√≥n de Empresas (PDADE, now known as PDG) in 1961. In 1964, with the help of Harvard Business School (HBS), IESE launched the Master in Business Administration and Economics (MED). It was the first time the term \\"master's\\" was used in Europe; it later took on the standardized name of MBA. Antonio Valero during the Senior Business Management Program (PADE, 1959) The impetus for launching the master's program came from Escriv√°, who believed IESE should train not only business leaders and executives, but also young people. In February 1963, on a trip to Rome by professors Carlos Cavall√©, F√©lix Huerta and Antonio Valero, they confirmed the idea that had been developing for months. Participation by professors Cavall√©, Huerta, Juan Farr√°n and Esteban Masifern in the International Teachers' Program at Harvard allowed the IESE professors to get to know the school's master's program and some of its faculty members. In March 1963, Harvard professor Franklin E. Folts spent a month at IESE teaching classes and helping to develop the plan for creating the master's degree. In October of that same year, the Harvard- IESE Committee met for the first time, in Boston, with the Spanish business school seeking advice from the American institution on both academic and practical matters. For Professor Josep Faus, five strategic decisions by Valero shaped the philosophy and identity of IESE:J. Faus (2002), \\"Cinco decisiones clave de Antonio Valero.\\" In L. Dionis, et al., In Memoriam: Antonio Valero, pp. 4-5. * Start from the top. The first courses were created for executives who had at least 10 years of experience in senior management. * Professor training. Organization and financing of the most advanced specialization with doctorates abroad for IESE professors. * Internationalization. This was achieved through participation in supranational organizations and through doctorates in business administration. * Research beyond the creation of pedagogical materials and case studies. * Allocation of professors‚Äô time: 25%: academic activity 25%: research 25%: internal tasks at IESE 25%: external consulting Valero was the dean of IESE from its founding in 1958 until 1967, when he was succeeded by Professor Juan Ginebra.  Thinking: Business Policy  Business policy, an area of general management that Valero taught, is a humanist approach to management and corporate governance, with implications for business education. In that respect, Valero outlined the four fundamental points of general management and the firm:R. Calleja, and D. Mel√© (2017): \\"Valero's 'Enterprise Politics': A Model of Humanistic Management and Corporate Governance,\\" Journal of Management Development, vol. 36, no. 5, 2017, pp. 644-659. Available online * Community of people. * Intermediate social institution that serves the common good of society. * The nature of the company is different from political and technical practices, which leads upper management to employ practical reason and, at the same time, political skills and knowledge. * Role and responsibility of business leaders and senior management. He felt it was necessary to reach top business leaders and senior executives (who he regarded as \\"leaders at the peak\\") with a Christian and humanist message, distinguishing the benefit derived from innovative creativity and work versus that obtained from speculationL. Dionis (2002), \\"Ese era su mundo.\\" In L. Dionis, et al., In Memoriam: Antonio Valero, pp. 2-3. Available at: www.ee-iese.com/85/85pdf/portada.pdf His expression and objectives were clear: let other people continue giving handouts; he was there to help business leaders and senior executives with ethical and transparent management. One constant in his personality was the search for perfection in work, the result of him belonging to Opus Dei: according to his students, friends and colleagues, he was very demanding of himself and others, and, at the same time, affectionate and approachable.S. G√≥mez (2002), \\"Exigencia profesional y preocupaci√≥n por los dem√°s.\\" In L. Dionis, et al., In Memoriam: Antonio Valero, pp. 10-12. Available at: www.ee-iese.com/85/85pdf/portada.pdf. The philosopher Salvador P√°niker considered him a fiery presence, due to his passion and enthusiasm for infusing and provoking students in the difficult challenge of bringing out the best in themselves. In an interview with P√°niker in the early 1970s, Valero is an active, engaged person who believes that \\"the businessman is a philosopher in action\\". He defends economic freedom and the role of private initiative: \\"An intellectual, university education does not guarantee students will learn how to think. A free social structure forces students to think more than a planned and imposed one\\".S. P√°niker (1971), Conversaciones en Catalu√±a, Editorial Kair√≥s. As a professor and businessman, he captured his thoughts in several books and chapters in major publications, as well as numerous academic articles.  Presence in the Business World  With his extensive knowledge of the ecosystem of companies, Valero was a consultant, adviser, board member and executive, starting in 1950, when as a young engineer he helped to design a manufacturing plant with new technologies. Some of the most notable position he held included: * Advisor to Sobrinos de C. Valero, S.R.C. (1960‚Äì1964) * Member of the board of directors and of the executive committee, and chairman of the governing board of Editorial Salvat (1962‚Äì1988) * Member of the board of directors of Torras Herrer√≠a y Construcciones, S.

Simultaneously, he held various posts in the royal chancellery. As a loyal partisan of queen regent Elizabeth, he was an active participant in the feudal anarchy, when groupings of barons fought against each other for supreme power during the minority of king Ladislaus IV. For which, papal legate Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. Early life Nicholas was born into the Transylvanian branch of the gens (clan) K√°n, as the son of Ladislaus I K√°n, Palatine of Hungary and unidentified noblewoman. His grandfather was Julius I K√°n, the founder of the branch. Nicholas had two brothers, Ladislaus II, who functioned as Voivode of Transylvania and Judge royal twice, and Julius III, who possibly was killed in the 1260s civil war. Nicholas also had an unnamed sister, who married Alexander Aba. They were the parents of Demetrius Nekcsei and ancestors of the Nekcsei family.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Aba 8., Lip√≥c branch, 1. Nekcsei) In contemporary records, his name is referred to with the honorary title of \\"magister\\", demonstrating his education and skills in science. By the early 1260s, he joined the court of the king's eldest son Duke Stephen, who governed Transylvania and adopted the title of junior king. Stephen's relationship with his father B√©la IV deteriorated by the early 1260s. While Nicholas' brothers Ladislaus and Julius betrayed Stephen and defected to the royal court in 1264, Nicholas remained loyal to the duke, even after the emerging civil war between father and son. For his service, Duke Stephen appointed him provost of Transylvania in 1265, holding the office until 1276. In the next year, when Smaragd of Kalocsa died, Nicholas succeeded him as chancellor of Stephen's court. He issued two royal charters in this capacity. However, as a royal charter issued in 1267 narrates, Nicholas soon left Stephen's province to join B√©la's partisans. Although confidence was never restored between B√©la and Stephen, the political situation has stabilized by the last regnal years of the old monarch. Soon, Nicholas became a confidant of Stephen's spouse, Queen Elizabeth the Cuman. In 1272, he is referred to as her vice-chancellor, but it is possible that he already held the office under the direction of chancellor Philip, Bishop of V√°c in the queenly court since 1270, when Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne. In the feudal anarchy When the minor Ladislaus IV was crowned king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r around September 1272. In theory, the 10-year-old Ladislaus ruled under his mother's regency, but in fact, baronial parties administered the kingdom. As a supporter of queen dowager Elizabeth, Nicholas K√°n became vice-chancellor of the royal court, held the position until February 1273. Meanwhile, the episcopal see of Esztergom remained vacant after the death of Archbishop Philip T√ºrje in late 1272. Elizabeth was trying to achieve the election of her protege with all the means. When the cathedral chapter of Esztergom convened between 12 February and 1 March, Nicholas K√°n's army surrounded the building, locked the canons and deprived them of food and water with the tacit consent of Elizabeth. Under such conditions, the intimidated canons elected Nicholas as Archbishop of Esztergom. Additionally, he also became royal chancellor and isp√°n (count) of Pilis County for a short time in May 1273, when Queen Elizabeth temporarily regained her lost influence over the royal council due to the Bohemian invasion. However Pope Gregory X and most of the later liberated canons refused to acknowledge the validity and legality of his election. When the K≈ëszegi family and their allies deprived Elizabeth and his courtiers from the power in June 1273, they declared the episcopal see as sede vacante again. As Elizabeth never regained her central position and decayed into nominal regency, Nicholas K√°n lost his political influence for years. The canons of Esztergom elected Benedict as the new archbishop in February 1274, who held the dignity until his death in November 1276. Nicholas arbitrarily adopted the title of archbishop and vice-chancellor already in December 1276. However, some canons nominated Peter K≈ëszegi, an influential member of the rival baronial group to the position in March 1277. Pope John XXI summoned Nicholas to Rome per Lodomer, Bishop of V√°rad (today Oradea, Romania) the same month, but Nicholas refused to attend. Pope John died on 20 May 1277, and Pope Nicholas III succeeded him after a six-month vacancy. Nicholas retained his virtual position and became chancellor again. Nicholas participated in the general assembly at R√°kos in May 1277, which declared Ladislaus to be of age. Later Stephen B√°ncsa, Archbishop of Kalocsa, who acted as de facto head of the Catholic Church in Hungary, summoned an ecclesiastic congregatio in Buda and excommunicated the leaders of the Saxon rebellion, which devastated the province of Transylvania. Ladislaus IV commissioned Nicholas K√°n to lead a royal punitive expedition against the Saxons in Szeben region in 1278, in the same time with the defeat of the Geregye dominion in Tisz√°nt√∫l. Nicholas' army captured the rebellious Nicholas Geregye's fortress at Adorj√°n (now Adrian in Romania) in the first half of 1278, and marched into Transylvania, where defeated the Saxon rebels by early summer. Pope Nicholas III summoned both Nicholas K√°n and Peter K≈ëszegi to the Roman Curia on 27 January 1278. Nicholas refused to travel personally to Rome, but sent his emissaries, priest Karacin, archdeacon Benedict of B√©k√©s and cleric Nicholas. On 1 June 1278, Pope Nicholas decided not to confirm either nomination, instead, he wished to appoint the archbishop himself in accordance with the canon law. The vacancy of the episcopal see was declared again. The pope called Nicholas as a \\"reckless man, who burnt churches, ousted and looted the canons, appropriated the seal of the cathedral chapter in a guilty way, and, in fact, he never asked for confirmation of his election\\". It is possible that the pope also excommunicated him for the first time somewhat later. Nicholas ignored the pope's decision and continued to style himself as archbishop-elect. He again served as vice-chancellor, holding the position until his death. Meanwhile, Pope Nicholas sent Philip, Bishop of Fermo, to Hungary to help Ladislaus IV restore royal power and to fill the position of Archbishop of Esztergom. The papal legate arrived in Hungary in early 1279. Philip was willing to release Nicholas from the excommunication in May 1279, if he resign from the title, return the usurped lands and treasures, and leave Hungary for a pilgrimage to Rome. Pope Nicholas III appointed Lodomer as the new Archbishop of Esztergom on 13 June 1279. Philip of Fermo convened a synod in Buda on 14 September 1279, where adopted the so-called Cuman laws. In October, he excommunicated both Ladislaus IV and his ally, Nicholas K√°n, and placed Hungary under interdict. Around 9 December 1279, Nicholas fell ill. Feeling of impending death, he confessed his sins and requested his family to take his corpse before the papal legate. Philip ordered to bury him in the cemetery of the lepers in Buda, as his excommunication had not been released. The news spread that whoever is throwing a stone to the corpse, will receive forgiveness, thus his dead body, which laid in the still uncovered grave, was stoned by the mob just before the sepulture. According to a contemporary report, \\"in a short time, above the body, there was a set of stones that exceeded the height of a house\\". Some historians argue, when Ladislaus seized and imprisoned Philip of Fermo in early January 1280, one of his main motivations was the desecration of his loyal prelate's grave.

Later, thanks to a bull from Pope Pius II in 1462, Alfonso de Bola√±os was sent along with other monks to the missions in Guinea and the Canary Islands. = Mission in Tenerife = Alfonso de Bola√±os was established along with two other monks, Masedo and Diego de Belman√∫a, in the southeast of the island of Tenerife, in the Menceyato de G√º√≠mar in the Guanches era (ancient aborigines of the island). In this place he built a hermitage in what is now the town of Candelaria, a place where the aborigines venerated the image of the Virgin of Candelaria in the Cave of Achbinico. Although, his missionary project was not limited to the island of Tenerife but had as its main objective the African coast. These religious lived among the Guanches, speaking their language and baptizing many of them, they had the support of the native translator Ant√≥n Guanche, which had been Christianized years ago in Lanzarote. The Pope's support for his company led to tensions with the Franciscan Vicariate and with Diego de Herrera, lord of the Canary Islands, who considered him an intruder in his domains. It is believed that this incipient insular Catholicism must have been deeply inbuilt. measure of native elements, producing a religious syncretism between Christian beliefs and Guanches. After being named Sixtus IV as the new Pope, Alfonso de Bola√±os went to Rome to present the fruits of his evangelizing project. In the report presented to the Pope, Bola√±os claims to have \\"converted thousands of pagans\\", a figure considered by current analysts as exaggerated but necessary to continue counting on papal support. Pope Sixtus IV pleased named Nuncio and Commissioner for Guinea and Canary Islands, by bull of June 29, 1472. Four years later Alfonso de Bola√±os returns to inform the Pope of the development of his mission, in which he refers that four of the seven Canary Islands have already been evangelized and in the rest there are great expectations, especially in Tenerife where he leads the evangelizing process . = Death = However, this missionary project disappeared after the death of Bola√±os occurred in 1478 in the hermitage.Brev√≠sima relaci√≥n de la destrucci√≥n de √Åfrica.

Years later, already a Christian and baptized with the name of Ant√≥n, he returned to Tenerife after receiving freedom from his master so that he could convert his compatriots according to some, or fled during an arrival to the island according to others.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History John Axford purchased this farmstead in 1837, and likely constructed the original frame house at some point in the 1840s. Jacob Kline purchased the farm in 1848, and Kline family continued to own it until 1925. During this time, the farm was likely used to raise dairy cows and fowl. The farm went through multiple owners over the next 15 years, including going through foreclosure in 1929-31. In 1939, Detroit businessman (and later US Congressman) Howard A. Coffin and his wife Abbie purchased the farm and converted it into a country estate. The Coffins altered and added to the farmstead, creating their estate. It is possible that dairy operations on the farm continued during this time. In 1951, the Coffins sold the property to George H. and Guitenna Williamson. The Williamsons lived in California, and let out the house and farm for a series of uses, including cattle farming, as a group home, house farming, and as a commune. In 1996, Oakland Charter Township purchased the property, establishing it as \\"Cranberry Lake Park.\\" The section containing the farmstead was separately designated \\"Cranberry Lake Farm.\\" Description Cranberry Lake Farm is a roughly 16.5 acre parcel within the 167 acre Cranberry Lake Park, which encompasses the entirety of the former Coffin farm property. The farmstead is reached by a gravel drive looping from what is now a parking lot around behind the house and back to the road. The site includes the original farmhouse within the gravel drive loop, and four major outbuildings behind it: a caretaker's house, greenhouse, carriage house, and springhouse. Behind these are two more small outbuildings, and to the west are a silo and the remains of a barn.

The series is part of the Arrowverse franchise, alongside spin-off shows The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, Batwoman and other associated media. This episode is notable as the first Arrow episode to feature flashback sequences centered entirely on a character other than Oliver Queen, focusing instead on the backstory of the character Felicity Smoak, played by Emily Bett Rickards. The episode was written by Ben Sokolowski and Brian Ford Sullivan and directed by Michael Schultz. It premiered in the United States on The CW on November 5, 2014. The episode flashbacks to the late 2000s, exploring Felicity's time as a rebellious goth and student at MIT alongside her then- boyfriend Cooper Seldon, portrayed by Nolan Gerard Funk, which has repercussions for her in the present day.

Season three recurring stars Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer and J.R. Ramirez as Ted Grant also feature in the episode. The episode was watched live by 2.73 million viewers on its first broadcast, achieving the third-highest ratings share of the show's third season. It was generally well received with critics' praising the performances of Rickards and Ross and the character development in the episode, but criticizing the more predictable elements of the plot. The episode holds a critics' approval rating of 100% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.  Synopsis  In the late 2000s, Felicity Smoak is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Styling herself as a dark- haired goth, she considers herself to be a hacktivist, alongside her then boyfriend Cooper Seldon and his roommate Myron Forrest. Felicity creates a computer virus that enables the trio to access government mainframes, but objects to Cooper's plan to wipe all records of student loans from the system. However, his attempt is tracked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and he is arrested and later sentenced to jail. Following Cooper's apparent suicide, Felicity is shown to have changed her image, dying her hair blonde, and abandoning her goth style wardrobe. Five years later, Felicity discovers that cyber-attacks by a group calling themselves 'Brother Eye' have been launched using the code she developed whilst at MIT. Felicity and her mother, Donna, are kidnapped by the group, revealed to be led by an alive and well Cooper, who admits his suicide was faked by the National Security Agency. Felicity agrees to help him hack into the Treasury Department when he threatens to hurt Donna, but manages to secretly contact Oliver Queen, who aids in rescuing the pair. The episode ends with Roy Harper waking from a nightmare in which he sees himself shooting Sara Lance, making him wonder if he is in fact the killer.  Production  = Development = Arrow was developed for television by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg and Marc Guggenheim in 2012, and premiered on The CW in October of the same year. The series is loosely based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, and would go on to be the progenitor of a franchise of television shows and other associated media based around adaptations of a variety of DC Comics characters, set within a shared universe, collectively known as the 'Arrowverse'.See:    Loosely based on the DC Comics character of the same name, Felicity Smoak was originally written as a one-off guest star for the first season Arrow episode, \\"Lone Gunmen\\". The success of the character led to actress Emily Bett Rickards being promoted to recurring status throughout season one and to the main cast from season two onwards. In 2014, during Arrow's second season, executive producer Marc Guggenheim discussed ways in which the writing staff had worked to develop a deeper back story for the character, promising that more of this would be seen on screen in both seasons two and three. Interviewed at the San Diego Comic Con Arrow panel in 2014, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg confirmed that the third season of the show would contain an episode centered around the character, exploring her history in more depth. He also stated that the episode would be entitled \\"Oracle\\", a nod to the DC Comics character of the same name. However, in an interview given in August of the same year Guggenheim revealed that the title had been changed to \\"The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak\\". = Writing = Kreisberg confirmed that the episode would explore Felicity's time at MIT through the use of flashback sequences. Guggenheim stated prior to the episode that more would be revealed with regard to Felicity's family history, introducing her mother and examining the way \\"she and Felicity are two very different people\\", as well as \\"extending the mystery\\" of who her father was. Speaking before the episode aired, actress Emily Bett Rickards noted in regard to the Felicity the audience is introduced to during the flashback sequences that \\"she's younger, she was finding herself but she was on the track where we see her now\\" and that the story of her past would reveal her \\"deep turmoil\\". Discussing the relationship with her mother, Rickards called it \\"a flaky one, but a loving one\\", and described how the events of the episode helped Felicity to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Donna. The episode features several 'Easter egg' references to DC comics. Cooper's roommate is named Myron Forrest, a character who appeared in Jack Kirby's OMAC comic run published in the 1970s. In Kirby's story, the character is responsible for the creation of an advanced artificial intelligence named 'Brother Eye', which is the name given to Cooper's terrorist group in the episode. Lyla Michaels, an A.R.G.U.S. agent and John Diggle's ex-wife, is not present in the episode, but is stated to be in 'Santa Prisca', a fictional South American nation featured in DC comics. Discussing the younger Felicity's 'goth' persona, Rickards acknowledged that the costume design was 'a nod' to the character of Death in the Vertigo Comics series The Sandman. = Casting = The episode stars the main cast of Arrows third season; Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen, Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance, David Ramsey as John Diggle, Willa Holland as Thea Queen, Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak, Colton Haynes as Roy Harper, John Barrowman as Malcolm Merlyn and Paul Blackthorne as Quentin Lance. It also features the season's recurring stars J.R. Ramirez as Ted Grant and Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer, the latter being credited as 'special guest star'. The episode sees the introduction of Felicity's mother, Donna Smoak, with actress Charlotte Ross cast in the role in August 2014. Later in the same month, Nolan Gerard Funk was cast as Felicity's former boyfriend Cooper Seldon. = Filming = Filming for the episode took place between August 25 and September 4, 2014, in Vancouver, British Columbia, with exterior scenes set at MIT filmed on location outside Vancouver Public Library.  Reception  = Ratings = The episode was watched live by 2.73 million viewers, and had a ratings share of 1.1, the third highest share of the show's third season. In the United Kingdom it attracted 995,000 viewers for its premiere, making it the 3rd most watched program on Sky One for the week. = Critical response = On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 100% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The critics' consensus reads \\"Arrow finally has a Felicity-centric episode that ‚Äì aside from being well-done ‚Äì warrants attention because the flashbacks are finally about someone other than Oliver.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.5 out of 10 and noted that \\"this episode was definitely a great vehicle for Emily Bett Rickards to strut her stuff\\" and that \\"it was definitely a fun change of pace to see Felicity taking point in the conflict and using Ollie and friends as her muscle.\\" Overall Schedeen welcomed the fact that the episode allowed Felicity to take centre stage and for the audience to see her interaction with both her mother and old boyfriend, but felt that \\"the plot was predictable and the final confrontation with Cooper disappointing\\". He did welcome the number of DC Comics cameos in the episode. Writing for Den of Geek, Mike Cecchini awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 and also noted the number of DC-related Easter eggs present throughout. Whilst he felt that the episode could have gone wrong, he concluded that it successfully delivered on its promise. Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush observed that both Felicity's \\"cartoonishly attractive mother\\" and Felicity's \\"stock \\"goth hacker\\" past at MIT\\" could have fallen short, but that they \\"end up much better in their execution than they might look on paper\\", although felt that the \\"villainy fell somewhat short\\". In particular he praised Charlotte Ross for the \\"surprising amount of depth\\" she bought to the character of Donna, and Rickards who he felt \\"gave just the right amount of vulnerability and determination in having both family and past sins pulling from either direction.\\" He also noted that it was nice to \\"see that the character always had something of a heroically badass streak\\". Writing for Bustle, Kelly Schremph echoed similar sentiments, noting how it was \\"nice to see yet another one of Arrows female characters really come into her own and take control of her life rather than letting a man do it for her\\" and to see the character of Felicity proving \\"that she's way more than just a genius hacker. She's also a hero.\\" Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey praised Rickards' performance and described the episode as \\"a thank you from the Arrow writing staff to Rickards for everything that she's gifted this show\\". Whilst he felt that the episode was weak on plot, he praised writers Sokolowski and Ford Sullivan for the effective character development in their script. Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx also considered the plot's twists \\"well telegraphed\\", as well as noting that the action sequence was one of the weaker of the series, but felt overall that the episode was \\"so satisfying despite that because of the character work promised by that title.\\" He also praised Rickards performance, noting that the episode was recognition of \\"how talented and appealing Emily Bett Rickards is\\". Writing for Paste Magazine, Mark Rozeman felt that elements of the plot were formulaic, but that Felicity's relationships \\"as trope-heavy as they may be, make for a fun, breezy hour of TV\\". He praised the writers for making \\"a Felicity-heavy installment without it feeling like blatant fan pandering\\", and stated that \\"overall the episode does succeed at touching upon multiple layers to the character\\", calling Felicity \\"one of the best characters on TV\\". Carissa Pavlica of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.7 out of 5. She welcomed the opportunity to reveal Felicity's backstory, and in particular praised both the character of Donna and Ross's performance, but felt that overall it failed to deliver on the anticipation inspired by the title, and that Felicity's story in the episode was overshadowed by the final reveal. In his recap for Collider, David Trumbore awarded the episode a B rating, describing it as \\"a nice, fun, diversionary episode\\", and praising the deepening of the performance of Stephen Amell. Recapping the episode, for Entertainment Weekly Chancellor Agard described Rickards as \\"absolutely killing it\\". He also included the episode in his list of Rickards \\"10 Best Episodes\\" across the series as a whole, describing it as one of her best performances, and praising her \\"comically exasperated performance\\" in response to Charlotte Ross' Donna.

It is the principal place of marian cult in the area of Magentino. The miraculous image revered in it, known as Madonna di Corbetta, has been declared patron saint of the area in 1955 by the then Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Battista Montini (future pope Paul VI).  History  The miraculous image of the Madonna di Corbetta. The history and artistic evolution of the sanctuary of the Madonna dei Miracoli, the most important corbettese cult building, are inextricably linked to the miraculous appearance of 17 April 1555. On that day, in fact, on the first Thursday after Easter, in the small square in front of the small church of San Nicolao (today located in the lower part of the sanctuary) three children, Cesare della Stampino, Antonio della Torre and his brother Giovanni Angelo (called Novello), deaf-mute from birth, were playing at bowls under the portrait of the Madonna with the Child frescoed on the facade of the church. Suddenly the little John, reacquiring hearing and speech, indicated to his companions the celestial vision of the Child who, detached from the painting, had descended to join the game. The Madonna then descended to re-take his Son and returned to the painting.Santino Lang√©, Corbetta - cenni illustrativi op. cit. Other miracles followed that first miracle; in fact, the numerous graces received, in addition to being documented and kept in the archives of the sanctuary, are displayed inside the Cappella delle Benedizioni (chapel of the blessings), a place where more than two hundred votive offerings can be admired, a traditional form of recognition and popular devotion. The apparition and numerous pilgrimages, were followed by a powerful enlargement of the church that was enlarged and embellished by brilliant names of Italian painting and architecture such as Francesco Croce, Fabio Mangone, Vincenzo Seregni, Francesco Pessina, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Giovan Battista Discepoli Communion of Saint Luigi Gonzaga , 1649 , Commendation of St. John the Baptist , 1649, San Gottardo , 1663., Mos√© Bianchi, Luigi Pellegrini Scaramuccia. \\"Il santuario di Corbetta\\" di Maria Luisa Gatti Perer, testi di Giuseppe Moreno Vazzoler, Giuliana Algeri, Andrea Spiriti, Istituto di Storia dell'Arte in Lombardia, 1995. The miraculous image is found today in the upper sanctuary, an excellent example of Lombard baroque, enclosed in a glass case, still on the original wall where it was painted by Gregorio de' Zavattari in 1475. From 1913 the sanctuary was recognized \\"Building of national monumental interest\\". V. Decree of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and for the protection of the Italian artistic heritage, Marian shrines, 1913. Immediately after the aforementioned restoration work that took place between 1948 and 1955, during which ancient decorations and frescoes of the sixteenth century were brought to light, the idea of dedicating the sanctuary to the cult of God and the Virgin was revived, advanced previously by the cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster but temporarily put on hold following the death of the latter in 1954. When the new archbishop of Milan was appointed, the preparations were resumed and finally, on April 17, 1955, on the fourth centenary of the first miracle, Giovanni Battista Montini crowned the image of the Madonna di Corbetta proclaiming her \\"Blessed Virgin of the miracles venerated in the sanctuary of Corbetta, patron saint of the area\\". Also worthy of note is the sanctuary's museum, located in the upper rooms of the cloister adjacent to the church, which houses numerous works of art of great value, including the chamber called \\"di San Carlo\\" where Saint Charles Borromeo stayed in a visit to Corbetta at the end of 16th century. The room, consisting of a four-poster bed, some furniture and vestments belonging to the archbishop, was once in the Villa Frisiani Mereghetti where a memorial plaque is still displayed. At the time of the visit of cardinal Borromeo recall the chronicles, \\"... there was not a palace suitable to host such a great personality and as such the only one was found in the house of the Most Excellency Mr. Dom. Frisiani ... \\"Report of the visits of St. Charles Borromeo, Archivio Plebano di Corbetta The Confraternity of the Holy Rosary is linked to the archiepiscopal sanctuary of the Beata Vergine dei Miracoli. = The \\"Perdono of Corbetta\\" = Saint Charles Borromeo managed to intercede with his uncle Pius IV for the concession of Corbetta's forgiveness papal bull The tradition report that the day when the miracle happened in Corbetta, was the first Thursday after Easter and this date remained linked to the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Corbetta. It was Pope Pius IV who, on the intercession of his nephew, archbishop of Milan, Saint Charles Borromeo, with the bull Unigeniti Filii Dei of 31 August 1562 granted the extraordinary plenary indulgence in jubilee form to all those faithful who, spiritually disposed, were bound to visit the sacred image preserved in Corbetta. This exclusive privilege, of course, did nothing but increase the number of faithful who flocked to the sacred temple, catalysing the population of Milan and Novara. Charles Borromeo himself will renew his devotion to the Corbettese Madonna, stopping here in prayer during his pilgrimage to Turin on a visit to the Shroud and other pastoral visits that he made to Corbetta.  The architecture  = The church before the miracle = The dome of the lower sanctuary What today is known as the complex of the archiepiscopal sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of the Miracles, we know that in ancient times it corresponded to a more modest structure, dedicated to St. Nicholas since the mid-thirteenth century. The primitive oratory was completely rebuilt around the middle of the fifteenth century in Renaissance style, being completed with an ambitious octagonal drum dome that remains since today. The style of the fa√ßade was still of Romanesque inspiration and it was on this same facade that Gregorio Zavattari frescoed a Madonna with Child in 1475, a work of considerable importance, attributable stylistically to those models of madonnas of Tuscan painting that have brought this painter closer to the Sienese school Simone Martini. The church is known to have been located on the outskirts of the town and more precisely it was located just outside the fortified walls of the city of Corbetta, in an area surrounded by woods, and had a parvis dirt. = The primitive upper sanctuary = After the miraculous event that in 1555 had interested precisely the church of Saint Nicholas, an administrative committee was set up with the purpose of protecting the sanctuary, which in a very short time became a place of worship and pilgrimage. This first chapter consisted essentially of the nobles of the village and was governed on behalf of the collegiate Corbetta by the canon Ambrogio Spanzotta who in 1556, for fear that the painting of the miracle could be damaged over time (given also the position in which found, exposed to the elements and negligence of the weather), he first proposed to remove the fresco to bring it inside the church, on the main altar. However, since this operation was cumbersome and problematic for the protection of the painting itself, it was concluded that a chapel should be built for a new sanctuary, which would rest directly on the fa√ßade of the church. For the realization of this project it became necessary the erection of a portico in the lower part of the church that served as an atrium to the already existing one, and in the upper part it became obvious the construction of a small chapel that appeared very small (about 6 x 4, 80 meters), whose vault was decorated with frescoes executed by Francesco Pessina. It was possible to access it through a small staircase built inside the lower church of Saint Nicholas (where today the chapel of the Crucifix is located). Judged unsuitable to contain the ever- increasing number of believers who came to visit the sacred image, in 1574 it was agreed on the need to expand this same chapel on the design of the architect Vincenzo Seregni, who also added a ladder to the north to facilitate the descent of visitors. = Extension works of the church of Saint Nicholas = In 1556, just one year after the miracle, it was decided to expand the already existing structure in order to better accommodate the functions and the ever increasing number of faithful who were presenting themselves to Corbetta. It was thus that the already described chapter, thanks to his own contributions and to the offers received from the faithful, decided to buy the land behind the apse of the church, so as to build a choir, moving the high altar in a more retreated position from the moment that previously this stood under the dome. These works are still remembered today by a plaque epigraph found in the choir of the church itself. = Extensions of the seventeenth century = Other works of expansion and modification of the structure as a whole took place at the beginning of the seventeenth century: outside the walls were covered with marble dust, in addition to the construction of a larger wooden staircase to allow access to the upper part of the sanctuary. Inside, the flooring is made by Cristoforo Alemani who also decides to raise the main altar through marble decorations still visible today and the realization of the inlaid works that represent the coat of arms of Pius IV (which granted the Bolla del Perdono to the Corbettese sanctuary) and that of Saint Charles Borromeo in perpendicular to the dome. At this time the high altar was made of wood, carved by Giulio Mangone and gilded by a certain \\"mastro Celidonio Aquino\\"; today there are only two praying angels of this work that are found at one time on the sides of the main altar where there is still an anc√≥na representing St. Nicholas and dates back to 1616. In those same years Fabio Mangone, architect of the Milan's cathedral, was called to direct the works that were to ensure solidity to the dome that threatened to collapse, while also executing drawings for the execution of the balustrade marble that still precedes the access to the main altar, which was built in 1620 by the sculptors Giovanni Domenico Vigna and Giovanni Morelli. Furthermore, Mangone was also responsible for designing the fa√ßade of the sanctuary, which however the plague of 1630 and the poor economic conditions of the time set aside, leaving a single testimony to the project presented to the parish and kept in the Archives of the Sanctuary. It was also in those years that an imposing marble staircase was erected. The latter, built in 1690, from the square in front of the church (where the cemetery was once located), reached the upper chapel from the outside, along the side of the building, also occupying the current square Pio IV. On the upper chapel of this era, it is known that it had light from a large window in the shape of a niche at the center of the fa√ßade, right in front of the fresco of the Madonna which was initially protected by a curtain and then by a reliquary crystal (1706). = The eighteenth-century fervor: works at the upper sanctuary (1743-1750) = The eighteenth-century rococo altar of the upper sanctuary with the miraculous image painted by Gregorio Zavattari in 1475. The eighteenth century was the century that no doubt gave greater fervor to the work done in the sanctuary to Corbetta. In 1733 it was planned the rebuilding of the upper chapel, larger in accordance with a project already drawn up, but took place thanks to a delegation only in 1736 thanks to the influence of local nobles Filippo Archinto, Francesco Maria del Maino and Giuseppe Brentano. It will be the latter that will propose to contact for the works the famous architect Francesco Croce who was already working at his palace (Palazzo Brentano) in Corbetta. It will be Croce who proposes to move the fresco headquarters and to design a new high altar to welcome painting, but fortunately in 1740 the same chapter, not very convinced, decided to call the architect Donnino Riccardi who proposed to leave the fresco in its original position, raising it only slightly to place it in the center of the new upper sanctuary. The Croce will instead take care of the realization of the two side staircases that still allow the entrance to the upper part of the sanctuary, adding also new marble decorations then executed by the sculptor Carlo Nava, in addition to the elaborate rococo altar realized in black marble and golden bronze from Carlo Antonio Pozzi. The fa√ßade was entirely redesigned by Croce and is up to the second order as it was conceived in the eighteenth century, or with a central statue depicting the Madonna with Child made by Angelo Maria Beretta around 1750 and transported from the construction site through the Naviglio Grande up to Robecco sul Naviglio and then from there to Corbetta by means of a cart. Also from Croce, the balustrade of the main altar is rebuilt, which is entirely offered by Carlo Brentano, son of the late count Giuseppe, who will also pay the square of the small square in front of the church. In 1775 frescoes were begun inside the structure of the sanctuary which was commissioned by the painters Giuseppe Reina (who took care of the illusory architectural structures) and Giovanni Battista Perab√≤ (who realized frescoes on subject). Triumphant, in the center of the dome of the new upper chapel, the fresco depicting the Assumption of the Virgin, together with the Four primary virtues of Mary in the corners, in addition to the Eight main mysteries of the life of the Madonna in the lateral areas of the intercolumni, monochrome paintings. Other niches of fake architecture include four painted statues depicting Isaiah, David, Judith and Ester announcing the coming of the Messiah, as well as numerous Marian symbols. Perab√≤ also painted the very famous fresco in front of the one depicting the miraculous event, while the mosaic floor was made in 1868 by Davide Macchi. = Works of the nineteenth century = In the nineteenth century the attention moved again to the lower church of San Nicola where the seventeenth-century altar was replaced with a new project dating back to 1820-1822 by Luigi Tantardini and Gioachino Cenchione based on drawings by Luigi Rovida. As for the dome, it had been whitewashed already in the seventeenth century by a cholera epidemic, and was redecorated entirely in 1874 by Mos√© Bianchi with the figures of the four evangelists and the eternal father above the altar, torn from their headquarters after the restoration of 1950 brought to light the underlying renaissance frescoes.

Hedwig Bollhagen remained Artistic Director until shortly before her death in 2001. The HB Workshops produce hand-crafted tableware and sophisticated building ceramics in the former cocklestove factory in Marwitz which is protected as a listed building.List of historical monuments in Brandenburg The building ceramics produced by the workshops are used in areas such as the preservation of historical monuments and in restoration work. Shaped bricks are produced by hand as one-off products or in short series production, in various different formats and profiles. These have been used, for example, in the Friedrichswerder Church and the Rotes Rathaus in Berlin, as well as in the Chorin Abbey and in the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam.  History  Following up a suggestion from her friend Nora Herz, Hedwig Bollhagen was able to restart production at the closed-down Ha√´l Workshops for Artistic Ceramics, which had been founded by Margarete Heymann and Gustav Loebenstein, with the opening of the HB Workshops in 1934.Astrid von Pufendorf: Erzwungenes Nomadentum. in: die tageszeitung ‚Äì taz, Berlin, November 18, 2000 The new limited company made it possible to gradually re-employ the former employees of the workshops and to introduce a new product line ‚Äì HB Ceramics ‚Äì by taking on the employees (including Theodor Bogler and Werner Burri) of the Velten- Vordamm stoneware factory which had closed in 1931.Jasmin Jouhar: Ton, Stein, Erbe. in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Magazin, Frankfurt am Main, December 12, 2017 As had been the case for Margarete Heymann and the two employees mentioned above, the master craftswoman ceramicist Thoma Gr√§fin Grote, who was a developer and commercial assistant in the company from 1934/1935 onwards, had been trained by Gerhard Marcks in the ceramics workshop of the state-run Bauhaus on the Dornburg. The painter Charles Crodel (1894‚Äì1973), who was a friend of Gerhard Marcks, gave his support to the company from 1935 onwards.Cornelius Steckner: Hedwig Bollhagen - Charles Crodel. Letters and paintings, Mueller Baerbel Verlag . He opened up the field of building ceramics and at the same time brought with him industrial experience in the development of decoration which he had gained at the United Lausitz Glassworks (Wilhelm Wagenfeld). After the war, Heinrich Schild, who was a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, fled to West Germany. Hedwig Bollhagen took on responsibility for running the business alone. In 1972 the workshops were nationalised, but Hedwig Bollhagen stayed on as Artistic Director. In 1992, the business was finally reprivatised. After Hedwig Bollhagen's death, the artist Heidi Manthey took on the role of Artistic Director.

Background Born in Vienna on August 17, 1922, Jakob Knoblauch, was credited in at least one publication as the ‚Äúdesigner of the first bubble car‚Äù although this is otherwise unsubstantiated. In England, he adopted the name York Noble and formed the company Noble Motors, Ltd., in May 1956, as UK concessionaires for the Heinkel bubble car, until its manufacture was transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Company, in Dundalk during 1958. In December 1957, Noble set up another company, York Noble Industries Ltd, and in June 1958, it was announced that the company would be introducing two cars. The Nobel 200 limousine, a hard-top saloon, and the Nobel 200 ‚ÄòVicky‚Äô, described as van or pick-up with detachable canvas top and side panels. Both vehicles would be available either as do-it-yourself kits or as ready to drive vehicles. The cars were described as re-designed versions of the German Fuldamobil, which with the exception of the Sachs engine, would be entirely built in Britain. Shortly before York Noble made his announcement, a team had been sent on behalf of Short Brothers aircraft company by Sir Matthew Slattery to examine whether it would be viable for Shorts to build the Fuldamobil under licence. Further details emerged in September 1958, when Cyril Lord, named as chairman of York Noble Industries, announced that manufacture would take place in Northern Ireland. Initial prototypes Formula One World Champion Mike Hawthorn became associated with the marque towards the end of 1958, flagging away two Nobels amongst a host of other bubble cars at a promotional event in September, before appearing on the Nobel stand at the Paris Motor show the following month. At the show, it was announced that Hawthorn had accepted the role of Technical Director for York Noble industries. ‚ÄúCall me the outfit‚Äôs tea-boy‚Äù was his jovial riposte to the press. Two Nobel saloons were on display at the Paris show, both differed from later production cars, with different side trim and a different two-tone colour scheme. At least one car was fitted with a sun-roof, and also had its fuel cap on the left at the rear rather than in the usual central position. Both cars were left-hand drive and were fitted with four wheels. It was confirmed at the show that the car would be assembled by Short Brothers & Harland Ltd at their Glen Works in Newtownards, Northern Ireland, although about 90% of the manufacture of parts was done elsewhere. The chassis was made by Rubery Owen. Production of the fibreglass body shell was subcontracted to the Bristol Aeroplane Company, with regular shipments of the bodies between Bristol and Larne Harbour. Production The Nobel used mainly rectangular box-section steel tube for its chassis. Although this, like much of the car, was almost identical to the initial Fuldamobil S7 design, there were many minor differences and the overall dry weight of the Nobel was slightly heavier. The original Fuldamobil front brake arrangement proved liable to faults and rectifying this held up production for several months. The Bristol Aeroplane Company made the bodies at their factory at Coalpit Heath near Bristol. The intention was to produce these using new injection moulding techniques they had developed, with the fibreglass injected at high pressure between male and female moulds. This had been successful on small mouldings, but proved to be unreliable on the larger car bodies and eventually normal fibreglass lay-up techniques were adopted. Official production of fully assembled saloon cars commenced in February 1959, with a provisional retail price in the UK of ¬£317 before Purchase Tax. With the exception of the four- seater Reliant Regal, this made it the most expensive three-wheeled car on the market in the UK at the time. Four-wheeled versions of the saloon were available as an option, or for export markets. The rear axle on these were fitted without any differential and with a very narrow track between the rear wheels. All production cars were painted white, with peacock blue lower sections. Self-coloured bodies made using pigments mixed into the gelcoat were experimented with, but this idea was abandoned when the overall finish proved unacceptable. In the UK, the intention to produce the cars in kit form had been in the anticipation that this would enable buyers to benefit from a significant reduction in the total amount of tax payable, but this does not appear to have been secured. One car was shipped in kit form to New York in April 1959, but in May 1959 it was stated that kits would not be available for sale at least another six months, and it is unclear if any cars were ever sold in kit form. A production capability of a 250 cars per week was often mentioned with regard to the Shorts factory, but despite extensive publicity, with the car appearing in London, and at major car shows in Paris, Geneva, and New York, where it was hoped that many four-wheel versions would be sold, and despite reports of large orders appearing in the press, chassis numbers indicate only about 400 of the cars had actually been produced by January 1960. The appearance of the car at the 1959 New York International Automobile Show drew particularly positive reports and it was stated that almost 1500 Nobels had been sold,(GDT 15/07/59) with the car making ‚Äúa million dollars for Britain‚Äù. Despite such extravagant claims, there is no record to indicate that any cars were ever exported to the USA. For the home market at least, it appeared that the retail price was too high, but it was also clear that with the production arrangements as they stood, there was very little scope to reduce it. In fact the Bristol Aeroplane company had attempted to increase the contract price for the bodies and in response, Shorts decided to transfer manufacture to their own factory at Queen‚Äôs Island in Belfast after autumn 1959. The additional overheads from transporting significant components such as the engines and chassis to Northern Ireland in addition to the subsequent cost of shipping completed cars back to the mainland made long-term production in Northern Ireland commercially untenable, and on 4 August 1959 it was announced that production by Shorts would cease after the first 1500 cars had been produced. Days after this announcement, a major strike by employees at Short Brothers and Harland began in protest at proposed redundancies. Though the specific issue of Nobel production was not the major trigger for the strike, it was felt to be a contributory factor, and the issue was raised by the Northern Ireland Labour Party when it called for the Northern Ireland Parliament to be recalled and steps taken to retain production of the Nobel. The strike was resolved after a few weeks, but it was without any deference or solution to the problem of the production costs of the Nobel saloon. At the same time as he announced that production of Nobel saloons at Shorts in Northern Ireland would end, Lord stated that he was negotiating with several companies in England to take over their work. He also announced that the Fairey Aviation Company at Heaton Chapel, Stockport would manufacture two new models, a Nobel ‚Äúutility‚Äù car and a sports convertible, although they would not be producing the saloon.

Biography =Early life= Marushevsky was born on July 12, 1874 in Saint Petersburg, into a noble family originated from the Saint Petersburg Government. In 1893 and 1896, he graduated from the Sixth Cadet Corps and the Mykolaiv Engineering School respectively. After graduating, he served in several minor battalions. During this time, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1898, and staff captain in 1902.  World War I  In the first world war he commanded the 3rd Special Infantry Brigade of the Russian Expeditionary Force in France between July 1916 and May 1917. Between 26 September and 23 November 1917, he was the last Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Empire. He was briefly arrested in November 1917, by order of the Council of People's Commissars on charges of negotiations against the Soviet government (the same charge was brought against Nikolay Dukhonin, who was killed by soldiers at Stavka), and the sabotage of the armistice with Germany. Together with Marushevsky, General Alexey Manikovsky, who carried out the technical management of the military department, was arrested and sent to Kresty Prison. On December 1, 1917 he was released on parole, after which he fled to Finland and Sweden.  Russian Civil War  On November 19, 1918 at the invitation of the British and French military missions he came to Arkhangelsk, where he was appointed commander of the Northern Region. At the same time he was a member of the Provisional Government of the Northern Region as Governor-General and the head of the departments of internal affairs, communications, posts and telegraphs. He led the formation of the ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù Northern Army of about 20,000 soldiers. It relied in its activities heavily on the British military contingent, which took part in the Allied military intervention in the north of Russia and led military operations against units of the Red Army. On January 13, 1919, he transferred the duties of the Governor-General to General Yevgeny Miller, remaining commander of the Army (but actually served as Miller's assistant). From May 1919 he was Lieutenant General. In the summer of 1919, he negotiated with Mannerheim about military cooperation between Finland and the Russian Northern Region. On August 19, 1919, he resigned from the post of commander of the Northern Army and on September 5, 1919, he went to Sweden. He went into exile in Yugoslavia, and died in Zagreb in 1951.

Old Tup, sometimes termed the Derby Tup or the Derby Ram, is a folk custom found in an area of north-eastern England. Geographically, the custom was found on the borders of Derbyshire and Yorkshire and stretched into part of Nottinghamshire. The tradition entails the use of a hobby horse with a goat's head that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles. In geographical location and style it displays strong similarities with the Old Horse custom, but in the latter the hobby horse was presented as a horse rather than a goat. As recorded from the mid-nineteenth through to the early twentieth centuries, Old Tup was a tradition performed at Christmas time. Men would form into teams to accompany Old Tup on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual identified as a butcher, a transvestite, and Beelzebub. The team would carry Old Tup to local houses, where they would expect payment for their appearance. In some of these performances, the butcher would mime the killing of Old Tup, who would then fall to the floor. The earliest record of the Old Tub custom comes from circa 1845. Various other records of it come from the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Unlike other hooded animal traditions found elsewhere in Britain, the Old Tup custom does not appear to have died out at this point, and continued to be practiced in the local area throughout the century. Description Old Tup's head was described as being that of a sheep, and was often carved out of wood. In some instances, the wooden tongue of Old Tup was reported as having been painted red. In other instances, there were reports of a real sheep's head, as opposed to a wooden one, being used; these reports include complaints as to the smell of the head. In others, a combination of wooden and real elements were included, with a wooden frame covered by the horns and/or skin from a sheep's head. When the custom was carried out by children, sometimes simpler variants were used. At Pitsmoor, for example, there was an account produced of a child who had a sack placed over his head and whom was called \\"topsy\\". At Upperthorpe there was an account of a sack having its corners tied to resemble a sheep's horns. The tradition generally took place at Christmas time. Sometimes, it was recorded as taking place on a specific day during this period, such as Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, or Boxing Day. In some recorded instances, particularly in Derbyshire, it took place on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day. The troupe was made up of between four and six men and boys. Each took on a different character or role, and usually blackened their faces. The most common character in the troupe was the butcher, who wore a leather apron, knife, and steel. Other recurring characters were the old man and the old woman‚Äîthe latter played by a man in women's clothing, sometimes carrying a broom‚Äîand figures referred to as Beelzebub and Little Devil Doubt. These were characters likely adopted from established Mummers plays. Some troupes included a boy or old man who carried a bowl in which to mime the catching of Old Tup's blood. Occasional characters that were sometimes included were the butcher's brother, the collector, and a leader for Old Tup. Some recorded instances also featured a blacksmith and his brother; these were stock characters in the Old Horse tradition which geographically overlapped that of Old Tup, and may be an element borrowed from the former by performers of the latter. This troupe would travel around the settlement, knocking on doors and requesting admission. Once they had been admitted, Old Tup would either try to escape or would attack the assembled audience, while the troupe would since a song known as \\"The Derby Tup\\". In some instances, the troupe would then receive money and leave. However, in about half of recorded instances, the troupe performed another act, in which the butcher mimed the killing of Old Tup‚Äîsometimes with one member miming the collecting of Old Tup's blood in a bowl‚Äîand Old Tup would fall to the ground. They would then get back up, and the group would leave. =\\"The Derby Tup\\" song= The lyrics to \\"The Derby Tup\\" song varied between performers. Regional restrictions The Old Tup tradition was recorded as being extant in an area of north-eastern England that was twenty miles across. This area straddles the border between Derbyshire and Yorkshire and also extends partly into Nottinghamshire. The city of Sheffield was in the centre of the area in which the tradition was recorded. The area of the tradition was bordered to the west by the moorland of the Peak District. 37 teams were recorded as existing in this area, averaging at one group every three miles. The tradition is much more sparsely recorded in the north of this area, perhaps suggesting that it was less prevalent in this region. The folklorist E. C. Cawte suggested that the northernmost account of the Old Tup tradition, in the city of Leeds, is unreliable. He noted that this account was describing a tradition that took place seventy years before, and may not have taken place in Leeds at all. Old Tup was part of a wider \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. In South Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions ‚Äî the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse ‚Äî which take place not at Christmas time but on May Day. History Although the origins of Britain's hooded animal traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \\"nation-wide craze\\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \\"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\\". The age of the tradition is not known. The earliest recorded example of the tradition came from Hemsworth circa 1845. \\"The Derby Tup\\" song is known from older period, with a sailor from New England having learned a version of it during the War of 1812. Unlike other hooded animal traditions, the performance of the Old Tup custom did not die out during the twentieth century. By the 1970s, it was still recorded as a working-class tradition by which adolescents could earn extra money. In the 1970s, there were forty-one Old Tup troupes recorded as being active in north-east Derbyshire. These were rooted largely in certain families and performed their act in pubs and clubs. By this point, it had undergone some changes, with women now taking part. The historian Ronald Hutton described it as \\"the most noteworthy example of continuously performed regional 'folk-drama' in Britain\\".

Having been formed in Gibraltar early in the war, it moved to Malta where it defended the island during the Siege of 1940‚Äì43. Defence of Gibraltar Before the war there had been only one anti-aircraft (AA) battery of the Royal Artillery (RA) stationed in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty (originally 29 Heavy Bty), under the command of 3rd Heavy Regiment, RA. This was joined by 9 AA Bty from Hong Kong in the summer of 1939, so that on the outbreak of war in September 1939 there were two batteries of gunners manning the totally inadequate AA defences of the fortress. These consisted of four old 3-inch guns and four new 3.7-inch guns, spread in two-gun sections to give the widest possible coverage, and two of the new Bofors 40 mm guns, which protected the Royal Navy Dockyard, with the assistance of Royal Navy (RN) 2-pounder pom-pom guns.Frederick, pp. 754, 766.Routledge, Table XI, p. 68; Table XIII, p. 69.Monthly Army List, various dates.Routledge, pp. 201‚Äì4.3 Hvy Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. The Royal Artillery-trained Gibraltar Defence Force man a 3.7-inch gun during World War II. A regimental headquarters (RHQ) was formed (as 10th Anti- Aircraft Regiment) in December 1939 to take over 9 and 19 AA Batteries. They were also engaged in training the AA Section of the new Gibraltar Defence Force, which initially manned two of the 3-inch guns. Apart from occasional shots fired at unidentified aircraft penetrating Gibraltar's airspace, there were no attacks on the fortress during the 'Phoney war' period.Farndale, Annex M.Rankin, p. 153. The organisation of the regiment upon formation was: * Regimental Headquarters * 9th HAA Bty (from Hong Kong) * 19th HAA Bty (from 3rd Heavy Regt, RA) * 3rd S/L Bty After the Fall of France, a group of AA detachments under 53rd (City of London) AA Rgt escaped from Marseilles aboard the SS Alma Dawson. A French dockyard strike prevented them from loading any of their 3-inch guns or vehicles, but they mounted Bofors guns on the ship's deck and put to sea on 18 June. On arrival in Gibraltar they reinforced 10th AA Rgt. On 27 June, 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment arrived from England on the SS City of Cairo, and once they had unloaded their guns and equipment (16 x 3.7-inch, 8 x Bofors and GL Mk I gun-laying radar), 53rd AA Rgt re-embarked for home.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2343. These reinforcements led to reorganisation of the AA units in Gibraltar: 19 AA Bty joined 82nd AA Rgt, while 9 AA Bty took over all the Bofors guns. A searchlight battery (3 S/L Bty) arrived, and an AA Operations Room (AAOR) was established to control all the gunsites and to coordinate with AA-equipped ships in the harbour. From June 1940, those AA units equipped with 3-inch or 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed with Bofors guns. The first serious air raid on Gibraltar came at 02.00 on 18 July, when two unidentified aircraft bombed the slopes of the Rock, causing some fatalities. The attack was thought to be by the Vichy French Air Force in retaliation for the British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir on 3 July (Operation Catapult), which had been carried out by Force H from Gibraltar.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 130‚Äì37, 142.Rankin, pp. 1‚Äì7.Smith, pp. 57‚Äì88. On 21 August the AA defences brought down a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber during a raid by the Italian Regia Aeronautica. On 24 and 25 September Vichy bombers attacked Gibraltar again in retaliation for the British and Free French attack on Dakar (Operation Menace), and caused considerable damage. Several of these bombers were shot down by the combined AA fire. In July 1940, 10th HAA Rgt HQ had been ordered to be transferred to Malta, but this did not occur until November when, as part of Operation Coat, a reinforcement convoy for Malta put in at Gibraltar. This included two independent HAA batteries: 191 (formerly of 69th (Warwickshire) HAA Rgt) and 222 (Derby) HAA Bty (formerly of 68th (North Midland) HAA Rgt), together with spare AA guns and barrels. The convoy picked up RHQ of 10th HAA Rgt and sailed on from Gibraltar on 7 November. The troops disembarked in Malta on 10 November where they joined the garrison and 10th HAA Rgt took over command of 191 and 222 HAA Btys. It was later joined by 190 HAA Bty (also from 69th (Warwickshire) HAA Rgt) which reached Malta in January.Anon, pp. 4‚Äì5.Litchfield, p. 39.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 119, 219, 241.Rollo, pp. 205, 280.Rollo, Annex A.Routledge, p. 167.69 HAA Rgt War Diary 1939‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/2360. A new 13th HAA Rgt was later formed in Gibraltar to replace the absent 10th.Frederick, p. 767. Siege of Malta HMS Illustrious (right of crane) under attack. Malta had been under air attack since the day Italy entered the war (11 June 1940) and urgently needed AA reinforcements. In January 1941, the German Luftwaffe joined the Regia Aeronautica in attacks on Malta.Playfair, Vol II, p. 44. On 11 January the damaged aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious came into Grand Harbour for repairs. The Luftwaffe laid on a major air raid (possibly 50 Junkers Ju 88 and 20 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka 's) on 16 January to finish off the carrier, but the AA guns on the island had been re-sited to defend the ship alongside Parlotorio Wharf with a box barrage, and the raiders suffered heavily. A second raid made two days later was also disrupted by the defences. Only one bomb hit the ship, but the adjacent towns were badly hit, and nearby ships and AA positions suffered casualties. On 19 January the Luftwaffe tried again, with a diversionary raid on Luqa airfield, but Illustrious made her way to Alexandria under her own steam on 23 January.Anon, pp. 6‚Äì7.Farndale, p. 169.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 319‚Äì23.Playfair, Vol II, p. 46. In February the Luftwaffe 's Fliegerkorps X was ordered to neutralise Malta, and it began a series of heavy bombing raids, mainly at night, accompanied by mine-dropping in and around the harbour, and daylight sweeps by Messerschmitt Bf 109 single- engined fighters. In March there was dive-bombing against the RAF airfields, and attacks on a supply convoy on 23 March. The HAA guns were engaged almost every day, taking a steady toll of the bombers. By the beginning of June the depleted Fliegerkorps X handed responsibility back to the Italians.Anon, pp. 7‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 47‚Äì51. Service personnel and civilians clear up debris on a heavily bomb-damaged street in Valletta, Malta, on 1 May 1942. From April 1941, the regiment, together with 7th HAA Rgt and the Royal Malta Artillery HAA units, came under 7 AA Brigade covering the south half of the island, while 10 AA Brigade took the north. This arrangement was found not to work, and soon 7 AA Bde took over all the LAA and S/L defences while 10 AA Bde commanded the HAA guns, including 10th HAA Rgt, which defended the RAF airfields. New guns and GL Mk. I radar also arrived on the island.Anon, p. 8.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex F.Rollo, Annex C.Rollo, Annex E.Playfair, Vol III, p. 179.Routledge, p. 168. Malta was largely left alone during the summer of 1941, but attacks resumed in November 1941 after Fliegerkorps II arrived in Sicily. Air raids were increasingly common during November and December, and rations and supplies began to run short.Anon, pp. 9‚Äì11.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 108, 118, 174.Routledge, p. 169. At the turn of the year 10 HAA Bde instituted a policy of rotating its units to maintain freshness. 10th HAA Regiment exchanged with 7th HAA Rgt and took responsibility for defending Fort Manoel and Grand Harbour. At this point it manned 4 x 4.5-inch, 16 x 3.7-inch and 4 x 3-inch guns.Anon, pp. 10‚Äì11.Routledge, Table XXVII, p. 174; Map 7. Tracer fire and shellbursts over Grand Harbour during a night air raid. The Luftwaffe continued to pound the island, concentrating on the harbour and airfields, usually with raids of 15 Ju 88s escorted by 50 or more fighters. By now the RAF fighter strength had been reduced to a handful of aircraft, and the AA guns were the main defence. March and April 1942 were the period of the heaviest air raids on Malta, with well over 250 sorties a day on occasions. In April 1942 the Luftwaffe switched tactics to Flak suppression, with particular attention being paid to the HAA gunsites.Anon, pp. 12‚Äì6.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 158, 162, 170‚Äì1, 178‚Äì9. On the last day of April the Regia Aeronautica rejoined the attack ‚Äì which the AA gunners took as a sign that the Luftwaffe was suffering badly. By now each HAA regiment on Malta was rationed to 300 rounds per day and replacement gun barrels were scarce. When the fast minelayer HMS Welshman ran in ammunition supplies on 10 May (part of Operation Bowery), the most intense AA barrage yet fired was provided to protect her while unloading. After that, Axis air raids tailed off during the summer, apart from a flare-up in July.Anon, pp. 22‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 187‚Äì8, 193‚Äì4, 314. The regimental war diary described the summer night raids as 'half-hearted', with most of the bombs dropping harmlessly at sea well clear of the island. Only gunsite XHE25, equipped with GL Mk II Radar, saw much action against the elusive 'tip and run' raiders, while i daylight the guns were reduced to firing a few 'pointer' rounds to direct the RAF fighters. The regiment took to opportunity to undertake more training.10 HAA Rgt War Diary, July‚ÄìDecember 1942, TNA file WO 169/7412. By October the Luftwaffe had reinforced Fliegerkorps II, and a new round of heavy raids began, using new low-level or shallow dive-bombing tactics, mainly against the airfields and the RN submarine base. These used Ju88s escorted by a variety of German and Italian fighters, with Bf 109s, Macchi C.202 Folgores and Fiat CR.42 Falco biplanes operating as Fighter-bombers. However, these attacks also lost heavily to the AA guns and RAF fighters, despite the increasing shortages of food and supplies on the island. At last, in November Welshman and her sister ship HMS Manxman appeared, followed by a supply convoy. With the Axis defeat at Alamein and the Allied North Africa landings the same month, the siege of Malta was ended. The only enemy air activity for the rest of the year was occasional high-flying reconnaissances and one raid on Luqa in December. On 18 November the commanding officer, Lt-Col J.E.C. Blunt, moved to 4th HAA Rgt and Maj G.J. Bell was promoted from commanding 12 AA Gun Operation Room to replace him.Anon, pp. 26‚Äì7.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 194‚Äì200. Leslie Cole; depicting an AA gun (in the centre of the composition) firing during a night air raid. By June/July 1943 the regiment was manning 15 x 3.7-inch and 6 x 4.5-inch guns and formed part of a large AA concentration protecting the build-up of forces in Malta for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky):10 HAA Rgt War Diary, January‚ÄìMay 1942, TNA file WO 169/14568.Rollo, pp. 282‚Äì5.Routledge, Table XXIX, p. 175. * 190 HAA Bty  XHE25 (Fleur-de-Lys or 'Flurry') ‚Äì 3 x static 4.5-inch Mk I, GL Mk II radar  XHE26 (Tal-Qroqq) -‚Äì 4 x static 3.7-inch Mk II * 191 HAA Bty  XHD17M (Ta ƒ†iorni, St Julian's) ‚Äì 3 x static 3.7-inch Mk II  XHE28 (Spinola Battery) ‚Äì 3 x static 4.5-inch Mk I, GL Mk I radar * 222 HAA Bty:  XHE27 (Naxxar) ‚Äì 4 x static 3.7-inch Mk II  XHE33 (Tal-Balal) ‚Äì 4 x mobile 3.7-inch Mk IA, GL Mk II radar Disbandment The Regimental HQ of 68th (North Midland) HAA Rgt had been captured at the fall of Tobruk on 21 June 1942.List of units captured in Tobruk 21 June 1942, TNA file WO 201/690.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 273‚Äì4. The remaining batteries were caught up in the rearguard actions during the Eighth Army's subsequent retreat and the remnants of the regiment were officially reduced to a cadre in September.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 288‚Äì97.Routledge, pp. 137‚Äì40. After the Tobruk disaster, 222 HAA Bty stationed on Malta as part of 10th HAA Rgt was deemed 'to carry on the honour title, traditions and plate' of 68th HAA Rgt. On 1 June 1943, RHQ 10th HAA Rgt was officially disbanded and reformed as RHQ 68th (North Midland) HAA Regiment, with the same batteries: 222 from Derby, 190 and 191 from Birmingham.Frederick, p. 772.Rollo, p. 280.Joslen, pp. 464, 485. Although the AA defences of Malta were progressively run down as units returned home or joined the campaigns in Sicily and later in mainland Italy,Anon, pp. 30‚Äì1.Rollo, p. 287. 68th HAA Rgt remained part of the permanent garrison of the island until the end of the war and beyond. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in Malta in December 1946 so that it could be officially reformed in the Territorial Army in the UK on 1 January 1947. The personnel remaining in Malta then became 36 Coast Artillery/AA Rgt in the postwar Regular RA.Frederick, p. 949.36 HAA Rgt at British Army 1945 on.

The Republic of Maldives is a South Asian country geographically located in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Maldivians have historically emigrated from the Maldives for numerous reasons including low economic opportunity, political repression, environmental instability, and education. India and Sri Lanka currently host the most Maldivians living outside of the Maldives, but other diaspora communities can be found in Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, and Australia. Background The Maldivian diaspora can be divided into two major subcategories: Maldivian citizens living abroad and Dhivehi speaking communities with no legal connection to the Maldivian state. The 2014 census found a total of 5,589 Maldivian citizens living abroad. However, there is little information on the exact size of the non-citizen Dhivehi speaking diaspora. While a 2011 UNESCO report found that the majority of Maldivian citizens living outside of the Maldives were sailors operating foreign commercial vessels, Maldivians have also left their country for political, economic, and academic reasons. Maldivians in South Asia The majority of Maldivian speakers living abroad can currently be found in India and Sri Lanka. Maldivians in India, the largest community of Maldivians abroad, are predominantly found in the union territory of Lakshadweep that lies off the coast of the Indian mainland. Ethnic Maldivians living in Lakshadweep are concentrated on the island of Minicoy, an Indian territory of the Maldive Islands. These Maldivians are known as the Mahl people. The first Maldivians in Sri Lanka are thought to have migrated to the island nation centuries ago, but many still maintain their cultural ties to the greater Maldivian community. While the largest Maldivian communities outside of the Maldives can be found in India and Sri Lanka, there are currently numerous Maldivians in Pakistan as well. These Maldivians are largely students who travel to Pakistan to study in madrassas across the country. Some of these students remain abroad after their studies in order to fight for various Islamist organizations based outside of the Maldives. Politics Political repression is one reason many Maldivians have chosen to emigrate. Many journalists have been arrested after expressing anti-government views, and some have disappeared entirely under suspicious circumstances. Journalists have even been sentenced to death for their reporting, at least five of whom were below the age of 18. In 2017, four independent Maldivian journalists living abroad were threatened with arrest for espousing pro-democratic and openly secular viewpoints on their respective blogs. Human rights observers such as Amnesty International have noted that the criminal justice system has been used to silence political opponents as well as the free press. Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, has also found himself living in exile in the United Kingdom after being charged with terrorism in a 2015 trial many outside observers perceived as being politically motivated. After the charges were cleared by the Maldives' Supreme Court in 2018, Nasheed announced that he would run against the previously unopposed President Abdulla Yameen in the upcoming 2018 presidential election. Nasheed's presidential campaign has included numerous trips to Maldivian communities living outside of the Maldives, such as the sizable Maldivian community in Sri Lanka. However, it remains unclear whether the Yameen administration will bow to U.N. pressure and allow Mohamed Nasheed to run as a candidate in the 2018 election. Maldivians have also left the country in order to fight for various insurgent groups such as the Islamic State. In fact, a 2015 study by The Soufan Group found the Maldives to be the world's greatest supplier per-capita of independent foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria. Many of these insurgent fighters have been known to bring their families with them, either immediately or a few months after becoming established in their new location. Maldivian foreign fighters have become radicalized in both Mal√© and the Maldives' many smaller island communities. Some have attributed the proportionally high number of radicalized individuals leaving the Maldives to fight in conflicts abroad to the growing strength of the Islamist movement in the country and the Yameen administration's newfound support for its proponents. Education A significant percentage of Maldivians living abroad are students pursuing an education at various foreign universities. Maldivian students go abroad for both secular and religious educations and often find themselves studying in universities and madrassas in Malaysia, Australia, the United Kingdom, India, Sri Lanka, and other countries. A 2011 UNESCO report found that approximately 1,200 Maldivian students were studying abroad in 2007. This student diaspora can in large part be attributed to the lack of educational facilities on most of the Maldives' islands. Until recently, the only secondary education provider was located in Mal√©. Some wealthy Maldivians have also chosen to migrate in order to ensure that their children will have access to superior primary, secondary, and tertiary educational facilities. Economy Youth unemployment is a growing social issue in the Maldives. 45% of the population was under 24 years of age as of 2014, and the competition for work among young Maldivians remains severe. A 2010 study found that the unemployment rate in the Maldives was 25% for those between 15 and 24. Youth unemployment has become a major reason for emigration from the Maldives.Bank, The. 2018. \\"Maldives - Country Partnership Framework For The Period FY16-19\\". Documents.Worldbank.Org Maldivians often consider migrating in order to improve their access to financial resources, especially the wealth of job opportunities that exist in foreign countries. In fact, Maldivians‚Äô primary migration-related interests remain jobs. When young Maldivians move abroad for work, older members of their families sometimes join them as migrants in order to continue living alongside their children and grandchildren. This pattern of migration can also be seen in Maldivians moving from the outlying islands to Mal√©. Maldivians also choose to move abroad because the cost of living in Mal√© is higher than most places in Sri Lanka and India. Some also attribute this migration to a lack of housing and overcrowding around the Maldivian capital, a problem which has grown increasingly pressing as Maldivians continue to migrate from the outer islands to the capital. Healthcare The government of the Maldives has recently made efforts to deepen its relationship with Maldivians living abroad. In 2013, the government expanded the Maldives' universal health insurance, Aasandha, to Maldivians living abroad in Sri Lanka and India provided they visit a select few \\"empanelled\\" hospitals. This expansion of health insurance to Maldivians living abroad has come under criticism given the poor state of the Maldivian healthcare system and the difficulty many Maldivians currently face finding adequate healthcare services in their home country. Climate The Maldives has, in recent years, become one of the epicenters of the climate refugee debate. The Maldives has an average estimated elevation of 1.5 meters above sea-level, with 80 percent of its islands currently resting less than 1 meter above sea-level. The total landmass of the islands is continuously decreasing due to rising sea-levels, and many of the smaller islands are thought to be years away from becoming completely submerged. Climate change has recently become a long-term security issue for the Maldives which, according to numerous climate scientists, could disappear entirely within one or two centuries. Rising ocean temperatures are also a major environmental challenge facing the Maldives. Rising sea surface temperatures cause significant damage to coral reefs, which serve as natural breakwaters. The death of the coral reefs surrounding the Maldives could lead to the loss of the natural protection those reefs provide from waves and currents, in turn increasing the likelihood of beach erosion. The rise in sea surface temperatures also leads to coral bleaching. A significant increase in the water temperature causes coral to expel the zooxanthellae which live in the tissue of the coral, making the coral turn white in color. Since the devastating El Ni√±o of 1998, marine biologists in the Maldives have been particularly concerned about the impact on the local marine environment. Since 2015 was the warmest year on record, by September 2015, many coral reefs in the Maldives had become severely bleached. The rapid degradation of the coral reefs around the Maldives could negatively influences the country's tourism industry, which currently makes up 34% of the Maldives's GDP. Fishing, the country's second largest industry, could also be affected by climate change. Fish might migrate to other ocean areas if the sea temperatures around the Maldives continue to increase, which could lead to a decrease in the country's GDP as high as 7%. Several kinds of natural disasters affect the Maldives, including tsunamis, cyclones, earthquakes, thunderstorms, and flash floods caused by heavy rains and swell waves. The threats posed by many of these environmental hazards have been amplified by climate changes in recent decades. Rainfall has been erratic and drought patterns have changed, causing prolonged dry seasons and unusual monsoon patterns. This directly affects the Maldives‚Äô agriculture, causing the already limited farmland to shrink continuously. As a consequence, the country has had to depend on imported goods for a steadily increasing percentage of its food supply. For the same reason, communities have had to manage increasingly saline groundwater. The majority of islands in the Maldives do not have a secure supply of fresh water or distribution networks that can ensure sufficient safe freshwater during dry periods. It is also due to these prolonged dry periods that many islands have experienced severe shortages of drinking water, often necessitating emergency water supply initiatives on the part of the government. Freshwater security is currently a pressing issue in the Maldives. Many climate related diseases, such as dengue and scrub typhus, have also become more common. The incidence of these vector-borne diseases in the Maldives are expected to steadily increase over the next few decades. In December 2006, the country had its first outbreak of Chikungunya, another climate related vector-borne disease. While many Maldivians are expected to become either climate refugees or internally displaced due to rising sea levels, the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees does not recognize climate change as a valid reason for refugee status.Harman, Greg. 2018. \\"Has The Great Climate Change Migration Already Begun?\\". The Guardian. While the ongoing environmental changes have affected housing, freshwater access, food production, and fisheries, Maldivians are currently more likely to consider leaving their homeland in order to improve their financial education or to receive a tertiary education. In fact, migration is only one of the strategies being considered by the government of the Maldives for dealing with the threat posed by climate change. Government response In 2008, the government of Mohamed Nasheed began to spend a portion of its annual tourist revenue on the search for a new homeland. Nasheed argued that \\"We can do nothing to stop climate change on our own and so we have to buy land elsewhere. It's an insurance policy for the worst possible outcome. After all, the Israelis [began by buying] land in Palestine.\\" Before his ouster in 2012, Nasheed launched numerous initiatives and publicity stunts in order to raise global awareness about the threat posed by rising sea levels to the Maldives. One of the most famous of which was an underwater cabinet meeting in which he and his cabinet donned scuba gear in order to discuss state environmental policies at the bottom of the Indian Ocean in 2009.https://www.reuters.com/article/us- maldives-environment/maldives-sends-climate-sos-with-undersea-cabinet- idUSTRE59G0P120091017 In 2012, the Nasheed administration set aside a sovereign savings account with which to buy land in Australia in preparation for the eventual evacuation of the citizens of the Maldives from their country. However, the Nasheed administration also considered moving the country's population to India or Sri Lanka as well. After Nasheed's close defeat in the contested elections that proceeded his ouster, he was replaced by Abdulla Yameen. The Yameen administration has been less concerned with the environmental threat to the Maldives and reemphasized the need to focus on development and foreign investment. This move has been criticized by Nasheed and his supporters as politically motivated and a Chinese bid for influence over the islands. However, the Yameen administration has touted Chinese investment as a critical factor in the land restoration projects being pursued by his administration in order to preserve the islands. Numerous policy analysts have pointed to the conflict between proponents of land restoration and proponents of relocation in the Maldives as part of the greater struggle between China and India for influence in South Asia. Both the Maldivian government and a number of external research agencies have considered numerous methods for adapting to and overcoming the environmental problems currently facing the Maldives. Their proposals include sea walls, land reclamation, expansion of beach vegetation, population relocation, flood warning systems, and large-scale island expansion and reconstruction. The Maldivian government has put some of these suggestions into practice, but there are still major uncertainties regarding future climate change and its impact.Stojanov, Robert, Ilan Kelman, David Prochazka, Daniel Nemec, and Barbora Duzi. 2018. \\"Climate Change And Migration In Maldives\\". Georgetown Journal Of International Affairs. While the current policies of the Yameen administration indicate that the mass migration of the Maldives' residents to Australia or Sri Lanka is no longer the government's primary strategy for dealing with rising sea levels, it remains to be seen how future administrations will deal with this problem.  International assistance  International organizations such as the World Bank have provided assistance to the Maldives in order to help it mitigate the environmental and socio-economic problems which have led to emigration from the country. This assistance has taken the form of improving the economic opportunities available to the local population both in the island nation's traditional economic areas such as tourism and fishing as well as entirely new industries. Such assistance has also strengthened the Maldives' capacity for natural resource management and climate resilience, as well as enhanced its ability to manage its public finances efficiently. The World Bank Group also provides consultation in policy-making. The Maldives also regularly receives economic aid from countries such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. Between 1987 and 2002, Japan helped construct six kilometers of coastal protection works around the city of Mal√© in order to protect the capital from major storms, tsunamis, and the constant threat of sea level rise. After the completion of these coastal barriers, Japan has continued to be a major supplier of economic aid and other forms of non-monetary assistance to the Maldives.  Criticism of the term \\"climate migrants\\"  Phrases such as \\"climate refugees\\" and \\"climate migrants\\" have come under an increasing amount of scrutiny by various political analysts and researchers.Hartmann, Betsy. 2010. \\"Rethinking Climate Refugees And Climate Conflict: Rhetoric, Reality And The Politics Of Policy Discourse\\". Journal Of International Development 22 (2): 233-246. doi:10.1002/jid.1676. Some analysts, such as Robert Stojanov and Ilan Kelman, have suggested the Maldivian government should, instead of simply responding to climate change in a vacuum, place climate change within wider development contexts, such as employment, education, health care, public services and the livelihoods of Maldivian citizens. They argue that climate change must always be considered in relation to other social and environmental issues, especially considering the fact that climate change is currently far from the dominant reason behind emigration from the Maldives. These critics believe that a more nuanced analysis of Maldivian social and environmental conditions would allow the government to make migration-related policies based on more than assumptions about climate change.

In 1934 he published Veltro (named after an Italian dog similar to the greyhound), an expressive, monolinear script typeface that became very popular in Italy among printers that couldn't afford to hire lettering artists for every titling design job. In 1933, he was invested as the director of the art department of the Nebiolo type foundry. In 1935 he created the Neon and Razionale geometric typefaces for that same company. Neon's strokes were always the same width, and the uppercase and lowercase letters have exactly the same height. Each body size had a different height-width proportion, and there were three possible weight series: chiara (light), nera (black) and ombrata (shadowed, letters featured a shadow effect). Razionale was designed as a grid-like counter, so the printed elements were actually the spaces between the letters. Other quadrangular printing blocks could be added to complete the designs, change the spacing and create geometric shapes. In 1936, Giulio da Milano was succeeded in the direction of Nebiolo by designer and collaborator Alessandro Butti.  Legacy  In 2004, Rebecca Alaccari (also known as Canada Type) published Gala, a modern take on the design of the Neon typeface, at the Lineto Swiss type foundry.

He has produced a number of records of his own music. His self-published photo-books include the trilogy i (2014), ON (2015) and End (2016), set in Dublin where he lives. He founded and ran the Dublin Electronic Arts Festival from 2001 to 2009. Ian Maleney wrote in The Irish Times in 2015 that \\"D1 is considered one of the most important chapters in recent Irish music history\\". Martin Parr declared i \\"the best street photobook in a decade\\". Early life and education Doyle was born in Dublin. He studied commercial photography in D√∫n Laoghaire College of Art and Design (1988‚Äì1991). Music Doyle worked in the independent music business for 15 years. Around 1993 he and others set up a recording studio in the basement of the building he lived in at 147 Parnell Street in Dublin's north inner city. Some of that music was released on the Dead Elvis indie record label he co-founded and ran. Doyle became a DJ, then founded the techno record label D1 Recordings (named after the postcode it was located in) in 1994 which released music by artists from Dublin and elsewhere. D1 Recordings also ran a recording studio (d1), record shop and, eventually, a distribution company (Dublin Distribution) all in the same Parnell Street building. D1 also ran a weekly club night on Saturday nights for over a decade. The label resurfaced in 2018 in preparation for their 25th anniversary vinyl boxset release. Ian Maleney wrote in The Irish Times in 2015 that \\"D1 is considered one of the most important chapters in recent Irish music history\\". Doyle also set up two subsidiary labels called D1aspora [Distributed via Submerge in Detroit] and DublinLondon with UK electronic music producer Mark Broom. Doyle produces and releases his own music through D1 Recordings and various other labels on 12\\" records and for download. He also produces music with Scott Logan as Active Service Unit. D1 Recordings logo Dublin Electronic Arts Festival Doyle founded the Dublin Electronic Arts Festival (DEAF) in 2001 which he ran until 2009. The annual festival would take place over the course of nearly a week with events in venues across the city. DEAF closed when both Arts Council funding and sponsorship money stopped due to the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. Photography Doyle returned to photography in 2008, making street photographs of people on Parnell Street and O'Connell Street. He produced a trilogy of self-published photo-books on Dublin that were well received. i (2014) was inspired by Samuel Beckett. Doyle's subjects were elderly working class people photographed \\"from above, as if looming over them while they went about their daily business.\\" Martin Parr declared it \\"the best street photobook in a decade\\". In ON (2015) \\"the location remains the same ‚Äì Parnell Street and O‚ÄôConnell Street in Dublin ‚Äì but, this time, the subjects are younger and more varied in terms of ethnicity. Whereas i evoked an almost timeless Dublin, On shows a markedly contemporary city, where people stride purposefully onward, intent on their destination rather than their journey.\\" End (2016) concluded the trilogy.

Background  Hispanic period Before and after 1810, until the initiation of the codification of criminal law with the Tejedor Project, the exclusive source of the repressive legislation in force in the territory of the R√≠o de la Plata, which for the most part became the United Provinces and then that of the Argentine Republic, were the Spanish penal laws prior to the Penal Code of 1822. The new Compilation, the Laws of the Indies, The Parties, the Jurisdiction, the Laws of Bull and the Newly Compiled1, which constitute that source, reflected the reception of Roman and canon law. May revolution As of 1810, together with the Spanish laws that subsisted as common repressive legislation, special laws governed, mostly with local validity in the different provinces. The most important law of national scope was n¬∫ 49 (14-09-1863) that designated the crimes whose judgment competed with the national courts and established its penalty. This law, recognizing the power of the provinces to dictate their own penal codes, declared them to be supplementary in respect of crimes against the Nation not foreseen in it and common crimes committed in the places subject to their jurisdiction (Article 93). He thus acknowledged, in an express way, the double source of common criminal law existing at that time in the country. The Project of Carlos Tejedor First attempt of general criminal codification, was written by commission of the National Executive Power (05-12-1864), by Carlos Tejedor, professor of the University of Buenos Aires. In the general provisions of its General Part, the Project follows, to a great extent, the Bavarian Penal Code of 1813, the work of Paul Johann Anselm Von Feuerbach. To a lesser extent he received the contribution of the Spanish doctrine through Joaqu√≠n Francisco Pacheco, commentator of the Spanish Code of 1848/50 and of the French doctrine through Chauveau. In Part Two, the Peruvian code of 1862 and the aforementioned Spanish predominate as immediate sources. The Tejedor Project was not sanctioned as a national code, but by virtue of the authorization granted by art. 108 of the National Constitution, was adopted as a criminal code by eleven provinces, with some modifications made in Buenos Aires. It represents, through the 1886 code, an important precedent of many provisions of the current code. The project of 1881 In the Project of 1881 (03-01-1880), written by Sixto Villegas, Andr√©s Ugarriza and Juan A. Garc√≠a, in charge of examining the Tejedor Project by the National Executive Power, the influence of the Spanish Code of 1870 predominates. C√≥rdoba adopted it as a penal code, with some modifications (14-08-1882). Presented this project to the Chamber of Deputies (11-05-1881) was not accepted.  The Code of 1886  The first Penal Code for the Nation (Law 1920 - 07-12-1886) was sanctioned by Congress on the basis of the Tejedor project and came into force on February 1, 1887. It does not include criminal legislation in its entirety, but rather that leaves to the margin, contained in the Law n¬∫ 49, the federal legislation on crimes and crimes against the Nation. The reform of 1890 On June 7, 1890, the National Executive Power commissioned Norberto Pi√±ero, Rodolfo Rivarola and Jos√© Nicol√°s Matienzo to plan the reform of the Code. The Project, presented in June 1891, legislated on national crimes and misdemeanors, unified the common criminal legislation. In addition to reviewing the list of crimes of the 1886 Code, it filled its gaps regarding the application of criminal law in space. He kept the sources of Spanish origin. This Project presented the preponderant contribution of the Italian codes of 1889, Hungarian of 1878, Dutch of 1881 and Belgian of 1867, which contained the latest and best criminal legislation. Your text is a valuable precedent for interpreting the original text of the current code. The 1891 Project, which only obtained a favorable opinion from the Committee of Deputies, served as the basis for the reforms introduced in the 1886 Code by Law 4,189 (09/21/1903). Opinion, especially from the positivists, was adverse to the reform. 1906 reform project Faced with the situation described above, the Executive Power ordered the revision of the 1886 Code by a commission formed, in addition to Pi√±ero and Rivarola, drafters of the 1891 Project, by F. Beagley, D. Saavedra, Moyano Gacit√∫a and Ramos Mej√≠a (09 -12-1904). The Project that is denominated of 1906, and was presented to the National Executive Power, on March 10 of that year and sent to the Congress on September 1, follows the orientation of 1891. The Deputy Rodolfo Moreno (h) was the one who gave the last impulse to the long reform process of the 1886 Code. With some modifications. He presented the reform project of 1906, on which a commission of deputies, headed by Moreno, drafted the 1917 Project. It only legislated on crimes. It was criticized by the positivist sector, \\"because it makes a clean slate of the crimes of the advances produced in criminal law during the twentieth century.  The code of 1921  The 1917 Project, which was subject to reforms in the Senate that did not alter its structure, was sanctioned as a Criminal Code on September 30, 1921. It was promulgated as Law 11,179 on October 29 of the same year and entered into force as of April 30, 1922. This Code, born in full swing of the Positive School in the country, in its first quarter of the century was the subject of more critical consideration than a positive interpretation. Incorporated into positive law institutions such as: probation and conditional condemnation, the measures applicable to those charged, minors and recidivists, as well as the extenuating and aggravating of the penalty. Reform projects after 1921 There have been numerous projects of reforms to the Code among others, the partial ones on the dangerous state of 1924, 1926, 1928 and 1932 and the one of the senate of 1933 and those of total reform of Coll - Gomez (1936), of positivist orientation; de Peco (1941), neo - positivist and with an important Statement of Motives; 1951, authoritarian and positivist; and that of 1960, written by Soler and reviewed by an advisory commission. After the Project of 1960, came the one of 1963, drafted by a commission appointed by the Executive Power; the 1973 draft, prepared by the commission designated by ministerial resolution of 19-12-2000, adopted by a subcommission, which in general departs less from the Criminal Code than the two previous ones. Finally there are the Soler Project of 1979 (Soler - Aguirre Cabral and Rizzi) and the one that in 1994 propitiated the Executive Power, on the basis of the innovations suggested by Professor Eugenio Ra√∫l Zaffaroni in his preliminary draft of reforms submitted to the Ministry of Justice of the Nation on August 15, 1991. As of that year, the Penal Code, although it has resisted the multiple attempts of general reform, has suffered them to a great extent, through laws, decrees - laws and the so-called laws . Law 17,567 (of January 12, 1968) reformed the Penal Code, inspired by the Soler Project. Law 21,338 (of June 25, 1976) restored all the reforms that Law 17,567 made to the Penal Code in 1967. Finally, the National Congress, through Law 23,077, of August 27, 1984, restored the most of the texts of Law 11,179.  Systematization  The Criminal Code consists of two books: Book one, general provisions It is the general part of the code and it describes the legal principles that will govern, consists of 13 titles that deal with: TITLE I Application of criminal law Arts.1 to 4 TITLE II Of the penalties Arts. 5 to 25 TITLE III Conditional condemnation Arts. 26 to 29 TITLE IV Repair of damages Arts. 30 to 33 TITLE V Imputability Arts. 34 to 41 TITLE VI Arts Attempt 42 to 44 TITLE VII Criminal participation Arts. 45 to 49 TITLE VIII Recidivism Arts. 50 to 53 TITLE IX Arts Crimes Contest. 54 to 58 TITLE X Extinction of actions and penalties Arts. 59 to 70 TITLE XI Of the exercise of the actions Arts. 71 to 76 TITLE XII From the suspension of the trial to trial Arts. 76 bis to 76 quater TITLE XIII Significance of the concepts used in the Arts code. 77 to 78 bis Book two, of crimes It is the special part of the code and it describes all the crimes in their different modalities and the corresponding criminal graduation, consists of 13 titles and a section of complementary provisions that deal with: TITLE I Crimes against people Arts. 79 to 108 TITLE II Crimes against honor Arts. 109 a 117 bis TITLE III Crimes against sexual integrity Arts. 118 to 133 TITLE IV Crimes against civil status Arts. 134 a 139 bis TITLE V Crimes against freedom Arts. 140 to 161 TITLE VI Crimes against property Arts. 162 to 185 TITLE VII Crimes against public safety Arts. 186 to 208 TITLE VIII Crimes against public order Arts. 209 to 213 bis TITLE IX Crimes against the security of the Nation Arts. 214 to 225 TITLE X Crimes against the public powers and the constitutional order Arts. 226 to 236 TITLE XI Crimes against public administration Arts. 237 a 281 bis TITLE XII Crimes against the public faith Arts. 282 to 302 TITLE XIII Crimes against the economic and financial order Art. 303 to 313 COMPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS Arts. 303 to 305  External links  * Penal Code of Argentina Category:Law enforcement in Argentina Penal ","title":"Penal Code of Argentina"},{"id":"57302898","text":"Zahidullah Salmi, also known as Zahid, (born 3 April 2002) is an Afghan cricketer.

It was first published in 1839 by W. H. Allen & Co. roughly a year after the it was commenced in February 1838. The book was published in Royal Octavo (10\\" by 6¬º\\") and contains roughly 1000 pages, arranged in double columns. In 1839, the book costed ¬£2. 2s. which is approximately ¬£233 in 2018.  Background  Featured in the preface of the book, it is reported that in 1836-7, the Committee of the House of Commons wanted to know about the financial conditions of the colonies and thus wanted to compile the colonial Blue Book into a form suitable for publication. Due to time and expenditure (it was estimated to cost about ¬£10,000) the initiative was abandoned by the British Empire. Martin, who at that time was a founding member of the Statistical Society of London (1834), decided to take it upon himself to compile the blue books from all the British Colonies of the time. The Blue books consist of three blank books that were sent to the colonies each year so to be filled in where two of them were returned to Downing Street and another remained in the possession of the colony's Governor. In order to do that he wrote a letter to Sir George Grey who was at the time the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, stating his request to access the blue books for this project which he completed using his own expenses and without official assistance. Martin received permission from Lord Glenelg, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time, to access the blue books and other statistical information regarding the colonies. He was then given his own office in Downing Street to complete the book with his assistant, Frederick Medley. Around 250 volumes of the blue books and a number of various documents were examined and sorted out into a book fit for publication, a which that took him roughly a year to finish. Stated in the preface, his motivation for compiling the blue books was not only to help measure the decline or progress of the colonies but to also compile it in a way that would bring about the feeling of pride amongst the citizens of Britain. This was in line with Martin's interest which was colonialism as can be seen in his other publications that mostly touched on the topic of the British Colonies. In 1840, he founded and became the editor of the Colonial Magazine and Commercial Maritime Journal.  Content  = Front page and Introduction = The front page of the book started off with a Map of the Colonial Possessions of Great Britain, dated in 1838. Areas within the British Empire were coloured in pink. Martin claimed in the preface report that the map was attached by Mr. Wyld, the Queen‚Äôs geographer. In the next section is an overview of the statistics of the colonies, followed by the preface which was named ‚ÄúReport‚Äù as well as the index. Next comes the seals of the colonies of the British Empire, designed by Mr. Wyon, the chief engraver of the Royal Mint. Stated in the preface, Martin claimed that it was the first time that the seals were shown to the public. His 1843 reprint of History of the Colonies of the British Empire contained exactly the same front page and introduction, claiming that it was the first time that the seals were publicly shown even though they had been shown before in 1838. The book was also printed by the same publisher, W. H. Allen & Co. = Structure = The book is arranged into chapters geographically where one colony refers to one chapter. The chapters are further divided into numbered sections according to the general structure of general information, economics, and culture. The different categories in the sections include area, population, commerce, education, religion, etc. The seven chapters that comprised half of the book is arranged as follows: * Book 1: West Indies * Book 2: South America * Book 3: North America * Book 4: Asia * Book 5: Austral-Asia * Book 6: Africa * Book 7: Europe The other half of the book houses the appendix which is also separated by colonies beginning with the West Indies and ending with Europe. The appendix consists of statistics what supports Martin's claims and descriptions made in the corresponding sections. The information presented in the appendix differs geographically. The West Indies appendix features the general trade of each islands including exports to England and duties on sugar, coffee, and rum, and the prices of tropical produce. There are also reports in regards to population and culture such as the report of disease and death rate of the West Indies as well as the education status amongst emancipated African slaves whose children were given education through schools established by the missionaries. In the North America appendix there are several important statements in relation to the land acquired in Canada after the British gained a vast amount of land in Eastern Canada from France via the Treaty of Paris (1763).  Other editions  The Statistics is not one of a kind but rather was derived from other books that was also written by Martin. In the early 1830s, Martin took it upon himself to write and stress on the importance and value of the British colonies to the public. In 1834, the published the book History of the British Colonies in 5 volumes. While the book was well received, Martin was faced with a complaint that it was expensive. He condensed the 5-volume books into one volume and published it under the name British Colonial Library. The new version contained the same material with a few statistical pages omitted. It was also cheaper and more suited for the masses. The Statistics contains similar textual information as the aforementioned two books but is more statistically dense.

The term was coined by Tibetologist Donald S. Lopez Jr., who specializes in Western discourse on Tibet. Orientalism and Tibet Lopez studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing. He found that before the New Age movement, depictions of Tibet were often cynical and derogatory. Orientalism's patronizing characterized portrayals of Tibet before the emergence of New Age Orientalism. = Self-aggrandizement = Western academics emphasized their superiority (particularly in academic ability), patronizing the Orient. With the modern era came colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world encouraged Western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions (despite scant, incomplete understanding of them). The Western world, most of which was engaged in colonialism, considered the Eastern world incapable of representing itself due to its non-Western knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led Western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized, valuable means of expression. They took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet's, from their perspective. Often described as \\"backward\\" or \\"incapable\\" (particularly in self-governance), such portrayals helped to fuel racist, white-supremacist beliefs about Asian peoples across the West. = Justification of authority = Manifest destiny and the broader ideologies of racism and white supremacy were used to justify imperialism and colonialism. Western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, however, despite British and Russian military efforts. In Western eyes Tibet never modernized, refusing to adopt European educational systems or norms. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers and was portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized. New Age Orientalism and Tibet Embedded in the New Age movement, New Age Orientalism describes a positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the 1950 Chinese invasion and the 1959 diaspora). This portrayal of Tibet in modern Western society has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting its negative aspects, such as its violence and clerical, feudal structure. It is seen as a Western fantasy, rather than a depiction of reality. New Age Orientalism is an orientalist perception of Tibet in which Tibet is not depreciated, but romanticized. It is based on Romantic Orientalism, \\"in which the 'West' perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the 'East. In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variations; the logic of opposites now relates to old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated \\"oriental despotism,\\" but as a Shangri-La: positive, holy, and pristine. It is seen as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute its opposite as the evil, subhuman force invading a land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. Old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history. This allows the West to aggrandize itself as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, whereas, depicting Tibetans as helpless and voiceless; the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture. = In popular culture = A romanticized picture of Tibet has been partially constructed and reflected by popular culture. Hollywood films such as Seven Years in Tibet, Kundun, and Little Buddha were found to paint a romanticized picture of Tibet and uphold the Western rescue paradigm in line with the play of opposites between China and Tibet. Publications surrounding the Free Tibet movement have been viewed as New Age Orientalism. The constructed fantasy of a Shangri-La Tibet reflects on the Western struggle within its national identities and the pitfalls of globalization. Expansion The concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions (such as Hinduism) in academic literature. The discourse on and perception of Ayurveda, for example, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism. Criticism Lopez's New Age Orientalism has been criticized for placing undue weight on the impact and power of Orientalism and viewing Tibet as a closed totality removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered. The concept has also been criticized for neglecting the Tibetan struggle under Chinese occupation and negative Oriental views of Old Tibet as feudal and antiquated.

The book was translated into English by James Redhouse in 1874. It is the first of three diaries written by Naser al-Din Shah, who was King of Persia from 1848 until 1896, corresponding to his three tours through Europe respectively in 1873, 1878 and 1889. In the 1873 diary, Naser al-Din Shah relates his travel departing from Tehran and he describes his travel through the countries of Russia, Prussia, Germany, Belgium, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Turkey and Georgia. The book has been criticized for its long and very detailed descriptions.  Bibliographic information and context  The Diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia during his tour through Europe in A.D. 1873 was published in Persia in 1874 under its original Farsi name Ruznamaj-i safari-i Farangistan. After the Persian publication of the diary, the Shah sent the book to the European kings and ambassadors. The British government directly decided to translate it into English by Sir James Redhouse, a renowned British linguist (in 1874). Abbreviated version of the English translations of the diary have also been published. Besides, the diary has been translated in German in 1874, and later, in 1998, in French. The diary thus became well-known in Britain and abroad. However, the German translation proved to be a fake one, written by the German novelist Michael Klapp. In the translation preface of the English translation, Sir James Redhouse states that ‚ÄúOn the whole, a more interesting book of the kind can hardly be imagined‚Äù. The diary is indeed a significant publication, relating the travel of the first Persian monarch who ever traveled to Europe. Besides, at that time, it was relatively uncommon that a king directly addressed his subjects in a personal account of his travel and that he described how he had been received by foreign monarchs. The fact that the diary has been communicated verbatim before the European countries which had lately received the Shah, was also rather unusual. Accordingly, the Diary of H.M the Shah of Persia is a substantial and compelling piece of work.  The author  Naser al Din Shah portraitNaser al-Din Shah is the first Persian monarch who ever formally visited Europe. None of his predecessors had ever traveled there prior to his journey. Before undertaking his European tour, Naser al-Din Shah had already traveled a lot. He loved travelling and he was eager to learn about new landscapes, monuments, and people. This love of travel might be explained by his education; the Shah had learned French and English. Besides, he has been widely introduced to history and geography, and throughout his life, a great portion of his pastime activities has been filled by his strong interest in those fields. By 1887, the Shah had undertaken twenty-four official trips. Before going to Europe, he had already visited his own dominions extensively. In 1850, 1851, and 1867, he went to the city of Qum. On April 1867, the Shah visited the province of Khorasan and in January 1870, he visited the province of Gilan. After his long travel to Europe in 1873, he did not stop travelling; he went to the province of Mazandarin in 1875, and to the central provinces of Persia in 1982. The Shah also traveled within the region around Persia. In 1870, he went to Ottoman provinces and to Najaf and to Karbala in Iraq. However, never had he ever put a foot in Europe before 1873. His 1873‚Äôs travel through Europe has been followed by two other European tours in 1878 and in 1889, and by two other diaries. His tour started on the 19th of April 1873 in Tehran and came to an end on the 7th of September 1873. The Shah had been greatly encouraged for many years by Mirza Hussein Khan, his prime minister, for undertaking this European travel. He went there escorted by nearly his entire government, and notably by his favorite wife Anis ud-Dwala during a short part of the journey. While away, the Shah assigned Kamran Mirza, one of his favorite sons, as head of the state, and he bestowed the full powers to his uncle Farhad Mirza.  The book  The diary is written in the first person; the Shah is directly communicating with his readers. He uses a relatively dry style of writing. Indeed, while oriental works of literature are usually written with numerous ornamentations of diction, the diary of the Shah is written in a very simplistic style. Preview of the Diary of the Shah The diary is full of passionate and enthusiastic phrases that Naser al-Din Shah uses to express the various feelings that he had when discovering the novelty of European lands. He paid constant attention to the natural scenery, but also to the development of agriculture, commerce or industry and to European mechanical skills. He visited numerous museums, zoos and botanical collections, and he made extensive comments on them in his diary. He also visited many factories, public establishments, hospitals, and schools. He regularly went to the theatre and to the opera. Besides, the Shah notably attended the 1873 World's fair in Vienna, where Persia had a pavilion of which the Shah was very proud. On his tour, Naser al-Din Shah met a great number of important officials, monarchs, aristocrats, dignitaries, princes, and notably Queen Victoria and Tsar Nicholas II. Along the diary, he emphasizes the cordiality by which the European monarchs have welcomed him. Private meetings, excursions, balls, and official receptions were indeed organized for him. The Shah thus carefully relates in his diary the numerous parties and sumptuous ceremonies to which he has been formally conveyed and which have been held in his honor. Illustrated London News - 28 June 1873. The Shah at the Italian Royal OperaThe book has been criticized for its extremely lengthy and repetitive descriptions. The diary indeed includes long descriptions of the physiognomy of Europeans and of the background, genealogy or status of the people that the Shah met. The book also contains highly detailed accounts of the cities and of the European landscape. The Shah puts considerable emphasis on the distances between the towns and cities, on the road and on lodging. The book has also been dismissed for its extremely long descriptions of theater, operas, parties, or train travels. In contrast, the diary is entirely void of descriptions of the European economic or political structures. There are only vague and random allusions to diplomatic discussions, and the Shah makes no analyses or introspections. As a consequence, the diary has been considered as being of ‚Äúlittle literary value‚Äù. Some authors have even asserted that the diary was pointless as a historical document. The translation of the book by James Redhouse is based on a highly censored version of the diary of the Shah. Less censored versions have been published in the 1990s in Persia. However, these versions have not been translated into English or any European language. These uncensored versions contain many passages that are not part of the book published by the Qajar court in 1874, such as very personal or critical comments about European royalty, descriptions of women, sexual encounters, etc.  Goal of travel  Naser al Din Shah undertook his European travel for several reasons. Firstly, the Shah went to Europe in order to counteract European countries at the zenith of European imperialism. Indeed, Persians were worried about the potential intervention of the great powers, and notably of Russia with which they nurtured a fragile peace. Indeed, after two Russo- Persian wars, Persia had lost its Caucasian provinces and they were still concerned by Russian intentions towards them. Besides, they had to counteract Russian political influence and balance it with British political influence. The Shah thus traveled through Europe in order to establish ties with the European powers, and especially with Britain and Russia so that they would not impose more political influence on them. He intended to maintain the balance of power and to improve the nature of his relations with the great powers by establishing closer ties with European royal monarchs. Next to political influence, European colonialism also imposed their institutional infrastructures on the non-European countries. Indeed, Europeans considered themselves superior concerning the development of their civilization. Accordingly, they intended to ‚Äúbring‚Äù civilization to the countries that they considered underdeveloped, namely to all the non-European countries. In order to protect the ‚Äúbringers‚Äù of civilization, Europeans developed extraterritoriality, an arrangement which imposed that Europeans be subjected to European laws even outside of Europe. This system obviously breaches the sovereignty of non-European states. The undertaking of the Shah has to be explained in that context; Persia desired to stop this violation. By going to Europe, the Shah intended to discuss with European monarchs and to use diplomacy in order to put an end to extraterritoriality. Accordingly, the travel of the Shah should be understood in the context of self-protection. Besides, to preserve a territorial integrity, the Shah knew that he had to be part of the group of ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù states. To that aim, he needed to persuade European states that Persia was a modern state, that he had made many reforms, and that his state had thus arrived or nearly arrived at the same level of civilization than Europeans. He intended to showcase Persia‚Äôs accomplishments and its planned projects to coincide with European model of civilization. His aim was thus representational; the Shah needed to present his country positively, and as equally civilized as Europe. The travel of the Shah indeed marked a breakthrough in the relation between Persia and Europe. However, the goal of the Shah has been partially been accomplished since extraterritoriality has not been abolished. By going to Europe, Naser al-Din Shah also intended to pay attention to the specificities of European civilization and to the factors contributing to their success and superiority. He would then be able to inform the Persian audience and to apply some models and ideas to his country. In an announcement, the Shah expressively asserted that one of the main goal for travelling to Europe was to collect \\"all information and gathering experiences, which can be valuable for the Persian government and nation\\". Back home, the Shah indeed tried to improve Persia‚Äôs railway and telegraph by taking European railways and telegraph infrastructures as a model. He also initiated several reforms by adapting himself on the model of the modern capitals that he had just visited. Besides, another of the Shah‚Äôs major motive for going to Europe was to enlarge the support of European powers for the Reuter concession of 1872, which was an attempt to buy Western material progress. However, this initiative has been met negatively by European powers, and especially by Russia. The expected results of the tour are to be differentiated from the motives for publishing the diary. It has been advanced that by making his journey readable and by directly communicating with his reader, the Shah intended to strengthen the relationship that he had built with his subjects. Besides, publishing the Shah's travel narrative would also allow him to shape public opinion and the public interpretation of his travel. Nevertheless, it is a topic that lacks academic research. Many researchers have focused on the descriptions of the destinations of the diary while leaving out the reasons that pushed the Shah to publish the accounts of his travel. Naser Al-Din Shah traveled extensively, but he did not publish all his travel accounts. Indeed, while some of his travels have not been published The Diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia contains 427 pages. The reasons that pushed the Shah to publish such a detailed account of his journey is an understudied field. Sohrabi is one of the sole author who has tried to address this issue. He has argued that the three diaries of Naser Al-Din Shah should be considered as state propaganda and diplomacy tools aimed at both the Persian and European public. Nevertheless, specific analyses of the 1873‚Äôs diary are lacking.  Itinerary  The diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter corresponds to a part of the Shah's journey. Most of the travel has been made by train or by boat. When the Shah was away, the contents of the diary were transmitted to the Persian public via the Tehran Gazette. Travel of Naser al Din Shah - Made by Hanna Schevenels In the first chapter, the Shah describes his travel from Tehran to Astrakhan. He departed from Tehran and then traveled to Qazwin, to Rasht, and to the port of Enzeli. From there, he embarked for Astrakhan. It took him 26 days. In the second chapter, the Shah describes his stay in Russia. He stayed there 14 days. He visited Astrakhan and then left by water for Tsaritsin. From there, he went to Moscow. His last step was St. Petersburgh. With Britain, Russia was one of the two main destination of Naser al Din Shah's tour. Indeed, due to the Reuter concession of 1872 which had affected the Anglo- Russian balance in Persia, Russia needed to be appeased. The third chapter concerns Prussia, Germany, and Belgium, where the Shah stayed 20 days. The Shah left for Prussia and then reached Berlin. From there, he went to the Rhine Country, and notably to Cologne and Aix-la Chapelle. Germany was an important step considering the military might of the country. The next step was Belgium, in which the Shah visited Spa, Li√®ge and Brussels. Chapter four is devoted to England, where the Shah stayed during 18 days. There, the Shah notably visited London, Liverpool, Manchester, Richmond, and Westminster. Then, he reached Portsmouth from where he embarked on \\"Rapide\\", a French boat which conducted him to French lands. Britain, on the same level than Russia, was an important destination for the Shah who sought for more governmental support for the Reuter Concession. Besides, the technological and military superiority of Britain also notably appealed to the Shah. Incidentally, The Illustrated London News and The Times related extensive descriptions of the Shah's journey as well as basic information about Persia. They also contained illustrations of the tour of Naser al Din Shah. Chapter five concerns France and Switzerland, where the Shah stayed 19 days. He visited many French cities such as Cherbourg, Caen, Paris, Versailles, and Dijon. Then, he traveled to Switzerland and visited Geneva and Vevay. After that, the Shah went to France again, and he visited Aix-les-Bains, Chambery, and Modane. Chapter six relates the travel of the Shah in Italy and in Austria during 19 days. In Italy, the Shah visited Turin, Milan, Peschiera, Verona and Ala. In Austria, he went to Franzansvest, Rosenheim, Trautenstein, Saltzburg, Laxenburg, Vienna, Innsbruck, Schelleberg and Gossensasse. Then, the Shah went to Italy again, through the cities of Ala, Verona, Bologna, Rimini, Ancona. After that, he passed next to Greek islands such as Corfu, Cephanlonia, Zante, Navarino, Cerigo, Negropont, Andros, Psara, and Scio. Chapter seven is about Turkey. The Shah stayed there 11 days and he passed through Dardanelles, Gallipoli, Istanbul, and Trebizond. In Chapter eight, the Shah relates his return travel from Georgia until Enzeli. He went through the cities of Poti, Kuta√Øs, Tiflis, Baku, Ganja, Shamakhi, and then finally arrived at Enzeli, in Persia.

The original Latin title was: ‚ÄùAthanasii Kircheri e Soc. Jesu China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis Naturae et artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata, auspiciis Leopoldi primi, Roman. Imper. Semper augusti Munificentissimi Mecaenatis‚Äú.  Author and publisher  Athanasius Kircher was a polymath who published around 40 major works in the field of both the humanities and the sciences. He was based at the Jesuits' College in Rome, where he had access to many reports that Chinese-based missionaries sent back to the Jesuits' administrative offices. The accessibility to essential material, as well as Kircher's vast interest in Chinese language and culture, gave the impulse to present the unknown East in one comprehensive volume of 237 pages. The scholar was therefore considered an expert on China, although he had never visited the country. Kircher's regular publisher, a printing house in Amsterdam run by Janssonius van Waesberge and Elizer Weyerstraten, produced the first copy of his work. In the same year another publisher named Jacob van Meurs brought out a copy of the text. Both editions are almost identical with the same content, pagination, and illustrations.  Reception and significance  Illustration of turtles (China Illustrata, 1667, p.196) Kircher himself had never been to China, but compiled the oral and written reports of former Jesuit missionaries to publish a summary of the knowledge on China and Tibet collected by Europeans in the 17th century. At that time China Illustrata was successful and got translated into Dutch (1668), English (1669) and French (1670) shortly after the Latin original had been published in 1667. The English version awakened great interest in China and inspired numerous further English publications on far Eastern travels and discoveries. However, China Illustrata was also criticized. Gottfried Leibniz described the book as a work of entertainment rather than serious scholarship. Egyptologist Adolf Erman agreed that Kircher had written a book for the public at large rather than for scholars. But others argue that China Illustrata was the first and most important writing to shape Western understanding and knowledge of China for over two hundred years. Indeed, it became one of the most influential and popular books of the 17th century and is even today considered \\"an important source of information on the beginnings of western sinology and sinophilism in Europe\\".  Content  Kircher's work is an encyclopedia about the Chinese empire containing accurate cartography and illustrations that elucidate the vivid descriptions found in the text. The volume is a cultural account of China ranging from religious practices and social customs over languages to China's natural wonders, such as exotic plants and animals. By collecting and compiling information taken from fellow Jesuits including Matteo Ricci, Martino Martini, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Johann Grueber and Heinrich Roth, Kircher achieves to create an authentic secondary study on Chinese people, nature and mythology. Dragon and Tiger mountain of Ki'amsi, combines topography with mythology, (China Illustrata, 1667, p.171) There were several reasons for Kircher to write China Illustrata. First, he wanted to promote the missionaries' work and tell about the great journeys of Europeans in China. Second, he was also driven by his strong personal interest in Chinese language and culture. He collected Chinese objects for display in his museum, a chamber of curiosity in Rome established in 1651 and named Musaeum Kircherianum after Kircher himself. Apart from describing and illustrating foreign objects and exotic creatures, the book also dwells on relations between China and the West. Kircher connects Western, Indian, Chinese and Japanese Idolatry and tries to prove the evidence of early Christianity in China. His work emphasises Christian elements in Chinese history, starting with the presence of Nestorians in the city of Xi‚Äôan. Kircher bases this assumption on the Sino-Syrian monument that was found there in the 8th century. In his interpretation the inscription on the monument is a proof of the first declaration of the Gospel in China. Kircher also declared that the Chinese script originated from the Egyptian hieroglyphs, since both writing systems were designed on pictorial principles. =Illustrations = The most important and interesting features of Kircher's book ‚Äì especially at that time ‚Äì are numerous illustrations of nature, rare portraits of emperors and Jesuits, and accurate maps of China that are from high cartographical quality. The illustrations of plants and animals are based on Michel Boym's Flora Sinensis and some of the images are derived from Chinese originals. Illustrations play an important role in most of Kircher's works and they \\"have a quality of ingenuity and strangeness that are particular to his century\\". China Illustrata contains a number of realistic depictions of Chinese plants and animals, but also fictitious images, such as the \\"Dragon and Tiger mountain\\" (China Illustrata, p. 171) said to be existent in the Orient. Although Kircher himself did not create most of the images, he chose them wisely in order to elucidate the descriptions found in the text.

It was written after the return to England by the Secretary to the mission Sir George Leonard Staunton, 1st Baronet (1737-1801), based on his own observations and notes from other crewmembers, including his twelve-year-old son Sir George Thomas Staunton, 2nd Baronet. The official publisher to King George III, W.Bulmer & Co. for George Nicol published the account in 1797. The account offers rich insights into the beginnings of British Imperialism in China and thus makes it an important primary source for the historiography of Sino-Western relations. There is an academic dispute whether the account marks a sudden turning point in British- Chinese dynamics or reflects a slow and complex divergence. While the political and economic ambitions of the embassy failed, the account by Staunton brought back detailed descriptions of and observations on the Chinese culture that were received with curiosity in the West and led to the commercial success of the book and the publication of several translations and subsequent writings on the Macartney Mission.  Contents  In the title of the account, the King of Great Britain is presented in superiority to the Emperor of China, King George III's name being printed in a dominating spaced type. Engravings printed next to the title pages of volumes 1 and 2 show the Qianlong Emperor and George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney, respectively. Engraving of Lord Macartney, Volume Two An Authentic Account (1797) The general structure of the account follows the route of the mission and describes in a manner of neutral curiosity the experiences of the mission. The first two chapters of volume one cover the occasion of and the preparations for the embassy. The following eight chapters cover the passage to Madeira, Tenerife, St Jago, Rio de Janeiro, Java, Cochin-China, Ladrone Islands and through the Yellow Sea towards the river leading to Tien-Sing. The second volume follows the embassy within China along the River Pei-Ho, Tong-Choo-Foo, Peking, Great Wall of China, Chinese Tartary, Han-Choo-Foo, Canton and Macao. The final audience of the Macartney Embassy in front of the Qianlong Emperor, and the dispute over the kowtow request are described in Chapter Two of the Second Volume. One of the most frequently quoted passages from the account, the kowtow incident gave rise to debate. When asked to kowtow to the Chinese Emperor, Lord Macartney requested that a Chinese man of similar status to himself should perform the traditional British courtesy to a painting of King George III. After the incident Staunton continues to describe the Embassy¬¥s experiences as positive throughout the entire account and concludes his account with an appreciative note: > The Embassador and other passengers landed, after an absence of near two > years; during which time the former had the satisfaction of serving his > country, in a situation both of much novelty and delicacy. The scenes and > objects which the rest had an opportunity of observing, left a gratifying > and durable impression upon the minds of many of them, beyond all the events > of the former period of their lives.  Publication history and translations  The account of 1797 consists of two quarto volumes containing text written by Staunton. The third, atlas, volume, printed in 1796 but not issued until 1798, has 28 engravings made by Painter William Alexander, based on his own first-hand observations during the mission and sketches made by Lieutenant Henry William Parish, as well as 16 maps and plans. * 1st volume 1797, see also: 2nd copy in Internet Archive and copy in Google Books. * id, volume 2 * id, volume 3 The atlas' plates were selected and arranged by the English botanist Joseph Banks who did not accompany the embassy. Thomas Medland later produced some figures for the folio volume after Alexander's examples. A corrected 2nd edition was printed in 1798 for George Nicol in two volumes. The American edition was published in two volumes in 1799 in Philadelphia by John Bioren for Robert Campbell. The English text was soon after its publication translated into various languages. The German version Reise der englischen Gesandtschaft an den Kaiser von China in den Jahren 1792 und 1793 was published in two volumes in Z√ºrich by Ge√üner 1798‚Äì1799, translated by Johann Christian H√ºttner. The translation holds no illustrations due to its small size and is the only version that admits being freely translated. The Dutch translation Reis van lord Macartneij, naar China was published in Amsterdam by J. Allart 1798‚Äì1801 in seven volumes. The French version Voyage dans l‚Äôint√©rieur de la Chine et en Tartarie fait dans les ann√©es 1792, 1793 et 1794 par lord Macartney. was published in Paris by F. Buisson in 1804 in five volumes, including 37 plates and 4 engravings. It was translated by Jean Henri Cast√©ra.  Critical reception  = Contemporary reactions = An Authentic Account was well received in an England whose great interest in China had been persisted since Jesuit travel writings. The Illustrator William Alexander published several books on the customs and dress of the Chinese based on the commercial success of his illustrations of the Macartney Mission. With the increasing demand for tea in Britain, pressures on trade and prosperity grew, causing British accounts on China to turn critical. Fellow crewmembers on the Macartney Mission, such as Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet, published later reports describing the same Embassy in a negative light. This can be explained, in part, as a reaction to growing British frustrations over trade. In the same year as publication of the Authentic Account, W. Bulmer & Co. also published an account by Serjeant-Major Samuel Holmes, under the title Holmes: The Journal of Mr Samuel Holmes, Searjeant- Major of the XIth Light Dragoons, During his Attendance, As one of the Guard on Lord Macartney¬¥s Embassy to china and Tartary.  Modern debate  Interpretation of the Macartney Mission has conventionally pointed to a clash of civilisations and identifies the kowtow refusal by Macartney as a breaking point in Chinese-British relations. Influential historians favouring this interpretation are Alain Peyrefitte and J.L. Cranmer-Byng. > An apparently trivial incident that symbolized Macartney's failure: he > refused to kowtow to the emperor...the ensuing conflict ignited a tragic > chain reaction: the clash of two nations, the collapse of China, British > domination of Southeast Asia in the nineteenth century, malevolent > misunderstanding between the West and the Third World in the twentieth. Other historians such as Joanna Waley-Cohen and Benjamin A. Elman argue for a more complex dynamic between England and China well into the 19th century. Kenneth Pomeranz refers to Staunton's account to highlight the economic similarities between China and the West and argues that the Chinese disadvantage of energy-generating resources and the European access to the New World caused the divergence between East and West rather than cultural miscommunication.

The screenplay concerns a dueling high school debate champion duo who are trying to realize their plans to get into the colleges of their dreams. The film was released on April 27, 2018 on Netflix.Official Trailer for High School Debate Team Indie Comedy 'Candy Jar' Plot In the principal's office of Hemlock Prep Academy, Lona Skinner internally monologues about her hate towards Bennet Russell, her fellow debate club member. They both want to be president of their two-person club as it would look good on their college applications; Lona wants to go to Harvard and Bennet to Yale. Ultimately, the principal declares them both co-presidents, despite both their arguments. At the debate tournament, Lona's mother, Amy and Bennet's mother, Julia, act passive aggressive towards each other. Both Bennet and Lona make it to finals, and are declared as co-champions, as they can't compete against each other because they are from the same school. The next day, Lona and Bennet send in their respective applications. Despite Lona's protests, Amy makes Lona dress up to go to homecoming. Lona leaves the house, promising to go to the dance, but instead walks to the movies. Once there, Lona eventually bumps into Bennet, who is also dressed for Homecoming and alone. They avoid one another, but after the movie ends, Bennet offers Lona a ride home, which she accepts. They stop to buy shakes and fries, then eat outside by a waterfront. The next day at the regional qualifying tournament, Amy and Julia are once again passive aggressive towards each other as the debate progresses. Before the four qualifiers are announced, Julia is introduced as a guest speaker. As she talks, Amy mocks her to the crowd, who laugh in agreement. Lona attempts to get her to stop, but fails. Amy then takes it a step further and raises her hand to ask a mock question. Julia attempts to embarrass Amy, only to have Amy mock her again. Lona and Bennet both complain to Kathy, the school guidance counselor and their confidant, that their mothers are the reason they didn't qualify to the state championship. Kathy instead tells them that maybe they just lost, but Bennet explains that the same thing happened in middle school twice. Kathy tries to get Lona and Bennet to work together as a team to try and qualify in another round of state regionals, but neither wants to do it. Bennet eventually tricks Lona into agreeing to debate together, and the two begin to study together, though dysfunctionally. Together, they qualify for the state championship, but they are both still worried about their college applications. Kathy makes them promise to have fun, no matter where they end up. The results come in later that night, and it is revealed that neither one of them got into their dream school. Julia tries to use her influence to get Bennet into Yale, only to infuriate Bennet. The next day as both Lona and Bennet wait outside Kathy's office to talk to her, the principal approaches them and informs them that Kathy died in a car crash. Bennet and Lona bond at Kathy's funeral and go out for shakes and fries, where Bennet talks about how neither he nor Lona were ever really high schoolers because they were so busy with homework, tests, and debate. Neither Lona nor Bennet want to continue towards the state championship, but after a talk with Mr. Johnson, their debate sponsor, both agree to continue working together. This time, the two work cohesively and begin to bond and become friends. Two days before the state tournament, the two kiss, before Lona pulls away, leaving Bennet confused. Meanwhile, Julia tries to make peace with Amy. The next day, Lona does not go to school, so Bennet goes over at night, and tries to talk about the kiss only to be shut down by Lona, who explains that she does not know how to handle what they're becoming. The following day at the state championship, Bennet and Lona make it to finals, and have to compete with a team whose debate style differs from theirs. Lona begins to stutter during her speech, but recovers after she sees a note from Bennet that reminds her of Kathy. She and Bennet decide to agree with the other team and lose the state championship but become a couple. It's prom night and both Julia and Amy prepare their children for the dance. It is revealed that Lona got accepted into Yale, and Bennet into Harvard. They decide to skip the dance and instead go to the movies, where Lona internally monologues in a way that is similar to the beginning of the movie, only this time, she talks about how much she likes him.

Speaking of her brother and the role, Gayle said:  Reception  Glenn Kenny of The New York Times praised the film as \\"fleet, sweet and often genuinely funny.\\" Kenny wrote Candy Jar \\"honors young people of intellectual achievement while also making sharp points about class and educational standards. The two young leads, Jacob Latimore and Sami Gayle, are deft at playing brainy, and Helen Hunt, Christina Hendricks and Uzo Aduba offer solid adult support; Ms. Hunt is particularly effective as a sympathetic guidance counselor.\\" Jeffrey Lyles of Lyles Movie FilesDirector gave praise, saying \\"Ben Shelton does a terrific job of making something so potentially routine and boring as debate clubs interesting. Shelton has a clear understanding of the genre and liberally tosses in some fun split screens, close-ups and dynamic presentations of the debates to make them more exciting.\\" Joe Reid of Decider.com also gave a positive review, saying \\"between Hunt, Aduba, and Hendricks, the acting level for a movie of this caliber is uncommonly high.

He was appointed governor of the island for the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique in 1636, a year after the first French settlement had been established. In 1650 he purchased Martinique, Grenada and Saint Lucia. He did much to develop Martinique as a colony, including introduction of sugarcane. Early years (1606‚Äì36) Jacques Dyel du Parquet was born in 1606 in Cailleville, Normandy. An act recording a 1657 ceremony to bless his wedding names him as \\"Jacques Dyel, squire, sieur Du Parquet, governor of this island, son of Pierre Dyel, squire, lord of Vaudroques and of Adrienne de Blain, native of Calville\\". His parents had married on 11 January 1589. Du Parquet's uncle was Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, the French King's Governor and Lieutenant General of the Isles of America. On 26 October 1626 a deed of agreement was signed to send French colonists under captains d'Esnambuc and du Rossey to settle in Saint Kitts (Saint Christophe) and other unoccupied islands. The expedition of about 530 men in three ships sailed on 22 February 1627. After landing on Saint Kitts the French signed a Treaty of Agreement with the English on 13 May 1627 under which they divided the island. In 1629 a large Spanish war fleet under Fadrique de Toledo anchored off Saint Kitts and sent troops ashore who entrenched near the French settlement. The French and English united against the Spanish. Du Parquet's brother commanded 120 men. When the English took flight he was given permission to attack the Spanish. The attack failed with many casualties. Du Parquet's brother was captured and later died of his wounds. Du Rossey returned to France where he was imprisoned in the Bastille, while d'Esnambuc sailed with most of the French colonists for Antigua. D'Esnambuc rallied his forces, and returned to Saint Kitts three months later, where the small French colony of 360 men began to prosper. In mid-1635 d'Esnambuc led an expedition of 100 men to Martinique under an officer named Dupont and founded the town of Saint-Pierre. Governor of Martinique (1636‚Äì50) Dupont was returning to Saint Christophe when he was captured by the Spanish, and du Parquet was sent to replace him. The Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique (Company of the Islands of America), whose administration included Martinique, confirmed du Parquet as governor. Du Parquet was officially named Governor in 1637. He first settled at Saint-Pierre, then built a military camp that would become Fort-de-France on a strategically placed rocky outcrop in what is now Lamentin Bay. 240px In 1637 du Parquet concluded a truce with the Island Caribs under which the French would hold the leeward coast and the Caribs the remainder of the island. Tensions rose in 1639 when du Parquet arrested the Carib chief Kayerman. The chief escaped but died from a viper bite. Relations gradually improved, with the Caribs often visiting the French to trade and accept small gifts. Du Parquet would dress as a native when visiting the Caribs, but always remained armed. Du Parquet gained a reputation as a fair and generous governor as well as a brave leader of the militia. He was capable and popular. By 1639 the colony had 700 men, and this had grown to 1,000 by 1640. Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy was appointed Lieutenant General of the French islands from 1638 onward, and had nothing but praise for du Parquet. Later the two men became enemies. No√´l Patrocle de Thoisy was appointed to replace Poincy on 20 February 1645 on the recommendation of the French regent, Anne of Austria. Poincy refused to accept his dismissal. Thoisy left Le Havre on 2 September 1645 but was not allowed to enter the port of Saint-Christophe and had to take refuge in Guadeloupe. Du Parquet met him there and on his advice Poincy's two nephews were seized for use as blackmail. However, du Parquet was himself betrayed and taken captive by Poincy. At the end of January 1647 Thoisy was turned over to Poincy, who forced him to return to France on a ship bound for Saint-Malo. On 21 November 1645 by the Jesuit Charles Hempteau married Dyel du Parquet to Marie Bonnard of Paris. His wife's marriage to an important company official had been annulled and she apparently married du Parquet secretly. During the Thoisy affair his wife led a group in Martinique that demanded the exchange of Poincy's captured nephews for her husband. After his release and return to Martinique du Parquet publicly acknowledged the marriage. The Jesuit Jean Tehenel blessed the wedding on 30 April 1647 in Saint-Jacques chapel, Martinique, in the presence of several witnesses. Their children were Jean Jacques Dyel, Louis Dyel, Seigneur du Parquet; Fran√ßoise and Marie. Grenada and Saint Lucia On 17 March 1649 a French expedition of 203 men from Martinique led by Jacques Dyel du Parquet landed at St. Georges Harbour, Grenada and built a fortified settlement, which they named Fort Annunciation. A treaty was swiftly agreed between du Parquet and the indigenous Chief Kairouane to peacefully partition the island between the two communities. Du Parquet returned to Martinique leaving his cousin Jean Le Comte as Governor of Grenada. Conflict broke out between the French and the indigenous islanders in November 1649 and fighting lasted for five years until 1654, when the last opposition to the French on Grenada was crushed. In 1650 de Parquet also sent between thirty five and forty men to found a colony in Saincte Alouzie (Saint Lucia) led by an officer named de Rousselan. The English had abandoned the island since being driven out by the Caribs in 1640. Governor and proprietor of Martinique (1650‚Äì58) The Martinique settlers revolted against the Compagnie des √Æles d'Am√©rique in 1646. The directors liquidated the company, and in 1649 proposed that du Parquet should buy Martinique and the neighbouring islands. On 18 May 1650 a procuration was drawn up in Martinique before a Notary Royal to purchase Martinique, Grenada, Saint Lucia and the Grenadines from the company. Du Parquet appointed Charles de la Forge of Pleine-S√®ve, near Dieppe, to act as his agent. The purchase contract was drawn up before Notaries Royal at Paris on 27 September 1650. Du Parquet became sole owner of the islands to enjoy and dispose of them as he chose, subject only to the King's charges and conditions that the company had accepted in 1642. The price was 41,500 livres, made up of a bill of exchange for 4,000 livres followed by instalment payments to be completed by 30 November 1653. Du Parquet instituted a citizen's militia to guard against invasion by Indians or Spanish. He tried to improve agriculture. The main export of the island was p√©tun (tobacco), which was easy to grow and harvest, but prices in Europe were falling. Attempts had been made to raise sugarcane, but the islanders were unable to master the technique of extracting the sugar. He issued an ordinance that slave owners had to give their slaves \\"at least two pounds of meat per head in the late season, and three when the ships arrive.\\" On 13 March 1651 he formally named his oldest son, Dyel d'Esnambuc, his lieutenant-general. The Sieur de Saint-Aubin was to undertake the duties of this office while his son was under age. At the start of 1651 du Parquet returned to France. His purchase was given royal ratification in August 1651. On 22 October 1651 the King appointed du Parquet Governor and Lieutenant General over the islands he had bought. At the end of 1652 du Parquet again returned to France for health reasons. He left M√©d√©ric Rools de Gourselas in charge as Major during the minority of his son. In 1653 a series of attacks and reprisals began between the Caribs who occupied some parts of Saint Vincent in the Grenadines, Dominica and Antigua, and the English and French who occupied the other parts. In 1654 Martinique was invaded by these Caribs, who were joined by the local Caribs in revolt against the French. The colonists' problems were compounded by an uprising of the slaves. Du Parquet's fort, \\"La Montagne\\", was besieged and was on the point of falling when four Dutch ships arrived from Brazil and saved the situation by disembarking 300 well-armed soldiers. The Dutch ships carried a group of Portuguese Jews who were skilled in processing sugar, had been expelled from Brazil, and had brought their material, technicians and slaves. Du Parquet granted them land and they installed the first sugar refineries, the start of an economic revolution on the island. The Governor was required by the terms of sale to uphold the Catholic religion, but in practice economic development was a more important consideration. The Jesuit superior later forced du Parquet to expel a band of Dutch Calvinists led by the sugar merchant Trezel. Their refinery may have been failing anyway. They settled in Guadeloupe and played an important role in the sugar industry there. In 1655 du Parquet sold Grenada to Jean Faudoas, count of Serillac. The price was the equivalent of ¬£1890. 240px In 1656 Martinique was struck by a violent earthquake. Later that year the slaves again revolted, with the support of the Caribs. In 1656 a ship outbound from Nantes stopped at Martinique, carrying an expedition to the coast of Guiana under the sieur De la Vigne. Du Parquet was hostile at first, then relented and provided supplies. The initial reluctance to help may be explained by the fact that the colonists in Martinique were engaged in a desperate struggle with the Caribs. His change of position may have been caused by his learning the identify of the expedition's powerful backers, who seem to have been the Queen and Cardinal Mazarin. After a long war du Parquet finally managed to restore order in his islands and concluded peace with the Caribs on 18 October 1657. Death and legacy Du Parquet died in Saint-Pierre on 3 January 1658 aged 52. After his death his wife took charge of the island as regent in the name of her oldest son, Louis Dyel d'Esnambuc. On 15 September 1658 the King appointed his son Governor and Lieutenant General of Martinique and Saint Lucia, with du Parquet's brother Adrien Dyel de Vaudroques to act in his place until he reached the age of 20. Vauderoque died in 1663 and the king appointed another family member (Jean Dyel de Clermont) in his place. On 14 April 1664 the King revoked all grants to the Compagnie des Isles de l'Amerique and all sales and transfers it had made to private parties, and on 28 May 1664 the Compagnie des Indes Occidentales was established by royal decree in its place. Du Parquet's heirs were forced to sell Martinique and Saint Lucia to the new company on 14 August 1665.

According to his family, he was a good husband and caring father of three children. In 1993, the Provincial Court of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski sentenced Henryk Moru≈õ for four murders to the death penalty with indefinite deprivation of public rights, and for three other murders and three offenses (theft, illegal alcohol and illegal possession of a firearm without a permit) to 25 years imprisonment.  Appeals  On December 3, 1993, in the proceedings before the second instance at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Court of Appeal, the sentence was lifted, returning the case for re- examination, stating that the ruling of the Piotrk√≥w court was affected by significant deficiencies. The court came to the decision that only Andrzej K≈Çosi≈Ñski's murder could be proven at first, which was helped by admission of Moru≈õ, who initially denied any involvement before the court. It has also not been determined whether one or more people participated in the murder, as three witnesses gave different stories. The court re-imposed the same penalty in 1995. Two separate appeals lodged by the defenders accused the court of many contradictions contained in the court's assessment and questioned the death penalty in the current moratorium on its execution. The court of appeal, which considered defense applications, supplemented (as a rarity) evidence of new expert opinions. Ultimately, however, the lower sentence was upheld. The accused's last words were that he had not killed anyone, and that the sentence was given coldly. In the justification, the court stressed the causal relationship between the evidence and the assessment of the first sentence. The court also issued a verdict that the death penalty does not contradict Art. 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because (according to the law), it allows for it under Polish law, and the moratorium only concerns the periodic execution of the death penalty. Defending attorney Wiktor Celler announced that he would appeal for cassation. Finally, after the abolition of the death penalty in Poland with the enforcing of the Penal Code in 1998, it was turned into a life sentence for Henryk Moru≈õ.  Punishment and application for pardon  He was detained in a prison for recidivists in a seven-person cell in the Wo≈Ç√≥w Prison. His behaviour in penitentiary services was so good that he used the right to work, sewing leather balls in the sewing room. In 2008, he applied for a pardon to president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. He emphasized that the punishment changed his life a lot, he regrets what he did, he became a Jehovah's witness in prison and would like to spend the rest of his life there. The ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Court of Appeal issued a negative opinion on the pardon application, just the like the District Court in Piotrk√≥w - it was decided to leave the request without further progress. In November 2009, Moru≈õ was moved due to health complications from Wo≈Ç√≥w to Wroc≈Çaw.  Death  Moru≈õ died on August 18, 2013 in the prison hospital of Czarne. He was 70 years old. The most probable cause of death was atherosclerosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. The family did not pick up his corpse, so his burial was organised by the prison. Henryk Moru≈õ was buried in the municipal cemetery at Sienkiewicz Street in Cz≈Çuch√≥w.Marek Obszarny: Henryk Moru≈õ, the murderer of seven people, has died in prison. \\"Dziennik ≈Å√≥dzki\\", 7‚Äì8 September 2013  References  Category:Polish prisoners sentenced to death Category:Polish serial killers Category:1943 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:Serial killers who died in prison custody Category:1986 crimes in Poland Category:1986 murders in Europe Category:1980s murders in Poland Category:1992 crimes in Poland Category:1992 murders in Europe Category:1990s murders in Poland Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Poland ","title":"Henryk Moru≈õ"},{"id":"57303273","text":"Alice Cambridge (1 January 1762 ‚Äì 1 January 1829) was an early Irish Methodist preacher. Life Cambridge was born in Bandon in County Cork on New Years Day 1762. Her mother was a Presbyterian and her father was a member of the Church of Ireland. Cambridge was taken to her mother's church but resolved as she became older to join the Methodists in Bandon. She wanted to be a preacher and she abandoned a boyfriend to concentrate on evangelism. It was a novelty to hear a woman preaching, although Agnes Smyth had already done some Methodist preaching in Ireland. Cambridge still attracted interest as she visited towns in the county of Munster. Some thought women preaching was against scripture and in 1791 she wrote to John Wesley. Wesley reassured her that she should follow her heart if she was inclined to preach, but she should not preach near a male preacher as she may take some of his audience. After Wesley died, the Methodist church decided that it did not support women preaching. In July 1802 the Methodist conference passed a resolution that any women preaching or merely exhort should be ejected from the church. Her supporters suggested that she found her own church but she kept faith with the Methodists despite being excluded from any Methodist building. In 1811 the conference decided to readmit her to the Methodists even though she had never ceased preaching. She had worked in shops in Dublin and Cork, but in 1813 she decided to preach full-time. She toured the country and occasionally spoke to thousands as in Lurgan in 1816. By 1827 she was exhausted by preaching and stopped travelling. She died on her birthday in Nenagh and was buried there in 1829.

He helped found the territorial capital of Lecompton and played a prominent role in the \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" conflict. In 1858, he moved to La Mesilla, New Mexico Territory. In September of that year, he was appointed the collector of customs at El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju√°rez). In New Mexico, he was involved with the promotion of Mowry City. When that settlement's prospects collapsed, he bought a ranch near La Mesilla and died there in 1883. His tombstone was later returned to Lecompton in 2013. Biography =Move to Kansas= Constitution Hall in Lecompton, Kansas, which he rented out to the local pro-slavery government. Jones was a native of the state of Virginia. He served Westport, Missouri, as a postmaster before moving with his family to the newly-opened Kansas Territory in about 1854.Litteer (1987), p. 7. There, he befriended many pro-slavery settlers, and on March 30, 1855, he had a hand in disrupting elections in Bloomington, Kansas. On August 27, 1855, acting territorial governor of the Kansas Territory Daniel Woodson appointed Jones as the first sheriff of Douglas County. Jones journeyed to the territorial capital of Lecompton and erected Constitution Hall, which he rented out to the local pro-slavery government. =The Wakarusa War= On November 21, 1855, after the pro-slavery settler Franklin Coleman shot and killed the Free Stater Charles Dow at Hickory Point (about south of Lawrence) because of a land claim; Jones later arrested Dow's affiliate, Jacob Branson, for disturbing the peace. Branson, however, was eventually rescued by free-staters, causing the pro-slavery faction to seethe with anger. Within a matter of days, the governor of the Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called for the Kansas militia to settle the issue. Understandably, Shannon had intended for the militia to be composed of Kansans, but Jones mustered a small army of 1,500 pro-slavery men, most of whom were from Missouri.Litteer (1987), pp. 1314. The group, led by Jones, made their way to Lawrence with the intention of eradicating the free-staters. Meanwhile, the citizens of Lawrence, bracing for the impending battle, raised up a militia of 800 men. But despite the mustering of armies, the Missourians never attacked, and the pro- and anti-slavery factions were encouraged by the governor to make peace in December 1855. Soon thereafter, the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.Blackmar (1912), pp. 855‚Äì57. =Sacking of Lawrence= On April 23, 1856, Sheriff Jones entered into Lawrence and attempted to arrest members of the extralegal Free-State legislature. Jones's presence in the city caused emotions to flare, and soon, violence erupted; according to author Duane Schutlz, \\"One man grabbed [Jones] by the collar; another punched him in the face.\\" Jones retreated, but returned later with a small group of soldiers serving as back-up. Their presence did little to quell the citizens of the town, who quickly grabbed their guns and began to fire at the sheriff. A bullet eventually struck Jones, which rendered him for a time partially paralyzed, and although he survived the assassination attempt, rumors quickly spread that he had been killed.Schultz (1997), p. 32.Litteer (1987), p. 32. After the shoot-out, Federal Marshal J. B. Donaldson proclaimed on May 11 that the act had interfered with the execution of warrants.Durwood (2001), p. 174. This led to a grand jury declaring that Lawrence's Free State Hotel was actually built to use as a fort. Consequently, Sheriff Joneswho, in addition to his desire to uphold the pro-slavery laws, had an ax to grind with the free-statersassembled an army of about 800 southern settlers to enter Lawrence, disarm the citizens, destroy the anti-slavery presses, and dismantle the Free State Hotel.Whitfield (2014), p. 14.Durwood (2001), p. 175.Monaghan (1984), p. 57. This occurred on May 21, when Sheriff Jones and a gang of Southern sympathizers sacked Lawrence. Dr. Robinson‚Äôs house on Mount Oread was taken by the federal marshal as headquarters (before being razed), the newspaper printing presses were destroyed, the Free State Hotel was burned down, and the town was looted. On January 7, 1857, Jones resigned as sheriff of Douglas County \\"because [territorial governor John W. Geary] would not furnish him with balls and chains for certain free-state prisoners.\\"Connelley (1912), p. 37. He soon thereafter left Kansas Territory altogether. = New Mexico Territory = Jones moved to La Mesilla, New Mexico Territory in 1858. In September of that year, he was appointed the collector of customs at Paso del Norte. In 1859, Jones and two partners, Lewis S. Owings and Robert P. Kelley, owned a number of businesses in the town and also had interests in mining properties. They realized that the existing population base was too small for them to attain the prosperity they desired, so they concocted a scheme to establish a town site and promote it, to draw settlers into the area. Trading on the fame and name recognition among eastern investors of Sylvester Mowry, these promoters chose \\"Mowry City\\" as the name for their new town.Mayo (2015), pp. 21617. The three collaborated on a misleading pamphlet entitled \\"Report of the Mowry City Association, Territory of Arizona, for 1859\\", which exaggerated Mowry City's mineral resources and claimed that it would be the future site of the territorial capital of Arizona Territory (at that time, the name \\"Arizona\\" was applied to the southern half of New Mexico Territory, from the Staked Plains of Texas to the Colorado River border of California).Finch (1990), pp. 5, 8-14, 19-20.Palmquist & Kailbourn (2005), p. 369. After gold was discovered in 1860 near Pinos Altos, Mowry City started to grow, but the Bascom Affair and the outbreak of the American Civil War led to nearby Apache peoples attacking all white settlers, including those in Mowry City. This led to the end of the settlement. Around this time, Jones bought a ranch near La Mesilla. In the summer of 1879, he suffered a stroke and died some time after, according to William A. Phillips. Post-mortem The La Mesilla cemetery in which Jones's body had been buried closed in 1930, and his corpse was carted off to the Odd Fellow Cemetery in Las Cruces, New Mexico. However, his La Mesilla tombstone was left in place, and over the years, fell into disrepair. In 2013, the genealogist Shirley Funk discovered the location of Jones's long-lost burial marker and arranged for it to be transported to Lecompton. Over the years, it had been broken to pieces, necessitating that it be reconstructed. The stone now lies near Constitution Hall in Lecompton.

Life  He was born in 1913, conceived as a result of rape - his mother was raped by a Russian soldier. When he was still young, his mother gave him to an orphanage in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he also graduated from 3rd grade elementary school.

PIN was a magnetic stripe card, which never migrated to the EMV chip. It was therefore discontinued in 2012, after the switch-over from magnetic stripe authentication to EMV chip authentication in the Netherlands was completed. PIN was replaced by Maestro and V Pay debit cards, but as most PIN cards were already co-branded with Maestro long before 2012, consumers noticed little of the change. Like in many neighbouring countries, the PIN debit card often doubled as a cheque guarantee card for Eurocheque until those cheques were abolished on 1 January 2002. In contrast to its neighbouring countries (e.g. Belgium's Bancontact and Germany's Girocard), the Netherlands has not operated a national debit card network since 2012.  History  In 1987, the Dutch Central Bank investigated the possibility of merging the individual debit card schemes of the various banks in the Netherlands into a single system. This led in 1988 to the foundation of BeaNet, which provided a single network for all electronic payments and cash withdrawals in the Netherlands. Beginning in May 1990, merchants were provided with payment terminals linked to BeaNet, and in the autumn of 1990, BeaNet launched the PIN brand as the singular brand name for electronic payments in the Netherlands. In 1994, BeaNet merged with Eurocard Netherlands and Bankgirocentrale into Interpay, which later became Equens. Because of increasingly stringent laws and regulations in the areas of competition and transparency, Interpay decided in 2004 to move all its payment systems into a separate company called Currence. Currence took over PIN in May 2005. In the early 2000s, Currence aligned PIN with the regulations of the SEPA Cards Framework (SCF). A few years later, Currence decided not to move PIN to the EMV chip. As a consequence, PIN disappeared as a product on 1 January 2012, when the infrastructure for magnetic stripe cards was shut down in the Netherlands.  In popular culture  After a successful advertisement campaign in late 1990, PIN quickly became synonymous with debit card payments in the Netherlands.

As an employee at the depot of a railroad junction she was able to help partisans sabotage much- needed equipment for the Germans. On 8 May 1965 she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, over twenty years after she was executed in the Zapolyansky death camp.  Pre-war life  Anastasiya Biseniek was born in 1899 in the city of Dno, then part of the Russian Empire to a large Russian family; she had four brothers and three sisters. Her father, Aleksander Pavelovich Finogenov, worked at the Dno-1 Railway Station. In 1914 he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army but was soon demobilized after he was injured during the Russian Civil War, after which he worked as a master shoemaker and repaired boots. After completing primary school Anastasiya worked at the rail station until 1914 when her father left for the army and arranged for her to move to Petrograd to work at a clothing factory. In 1917, just several days before the October Revolution, her lover who she had met while working in Petrograd was killed during a night patrol; he was a Bolshevik. In 1919 Anastasiya returned to Dno and got a job working at a boarding school, and in 1921 married a Latvian refugee Fyodor Biseniek. She took on his surname and the couple soon had their first child, Yura. In 1922 Fyodor was granted permission to return to Latvia, and he immediately left for Latvia to visit his family without telling Anastasiya. In search for her husband she illegally left the Soviet Union for Latvia, where they reconnected and Anastasiya eventually birthed a son Konstantine ten years later. Through personal connections to high-ranking officials such as Mikhail Kalinin she managed to return to Dno, where she found employment working at a freight station and later as a rail conductor. In 1937 she was arrested by the NKVD during the Great Purge for having left the Soviet Union, but was released until 6 June 1938 when she was arrested again and sentenced to ten years in prison on 27 October for violating Article 58. On 18 September 1939 the case was dismissed and the ruling was revoked. After she was released she met Vasily Zinovev, who later became the commander of her partisan unit. Partisan activities = Partisan activities in the Dno area = On 18 July 1941, when the district committee of the Communist Party worried about the possibility of the 22nd Rifle Corps retreating from the ongoing German offensive, the party formed a partisan detachment. Zinovev was eventually appointed commander of the unit, a party member named Timokin became the commissar, and Anastasiya's oldest son Yura became a guerilla in the unit. Before the unit left the city of Dno to fight approaching Germans the leadership of the unit contacted Anastasiya, asking her to serve as leader of the part of the unit that stayed in Dno. Her job would be to organize observation of the situation in the city and at the railway station, pass information on to partisans who had occasionally left the forest, hold meetings in her apartment, and disrupt German communication and transportation equipment in order to hinder the German advance on Leningrad. Sympathetic to the efforts to resist the Leningrad blockade, Anastasiya was happy to facilitate the resistance. To do so she would have to remain in the city, and when she was given an opportunity to evacuate the city with her young son she refused; just one day later on 19 July the city was taken over by German troops. On her first trip to the locomotive depot after the German occupation of the city she met up with a former soldier of the White Army who fought in the Russian civil war, and was already collaborating with the Germans. Knowing that Anastasiya had been previously arrested by the NKVD, he wrongfully assumed that Anastasiya would happily collaborate with the Nazis and invited her to join the new German administration. Seeing an opportunity to collect more information, she pretended to agree with the plan. After the German administration permitted bazaars to be set up every Sunday. On one of the first days the market was open Anastasiya's sister Yevgenia, who was a schoolteacher in the city of Lukomo, brought pamphlets to the apartment. At the request of Anastasiya she kept an eye on the movements of German troops and reported the information back to Anastasiya; she also distributed Soviet pamphlets to mechanics at the village locomotive depot who were forced to repair vehicles for the Germans. On every visit to Anastasiya Yevgenia Anastasiya distributed the leaflets at the station where she worked and wrote for an underground newspaper circulated locally, titled \\"Dnovets\\". Anastasia recruited and trained two young Komsomol members to the partisan unit, Zinaida Egorova and Nina Karabanova. Zina Egorova had worked as a telephone operator at a military base before the war, and later as a waitress in a mess hall at a German airfield, where she communicated with pilots and technical personnel. She had complied document of the information she collected, and later sent it to the intelligence service of the Red Army. The information helped the Red Army attack the headquarters of the airfield. Nina Karabanova, who was in secondary school at the time, worked as a job as a janitor at a German military base. Later she made contact with Soviet prisoners of war and provided them with food, civilian clothes, medicine, and Soviet leaflets; When one of the prisoners of war asked Anastasiya for help she had Nina provide him with a map and compass, which was used by a group of prisoners of war to escape. Subsequently, Nina contacted underground resistance members in the village of Skugra, where escape of prisoners of war and their transfer to a partisan detachment was organized. Through communications with schoolteacher E. Ivanov, Biseniek established connections with the partisan-controlled village of Botanog. In 1942, partisan intelligence agent Dmitri Yakovlev, who worked as a machinist before the war and escaped from German captivity traveled to Biseniek's apartment to meet his parents; but he did not carry any required identification documents with him. When a group of German police officers approached him and asked to see his papers, one of the policemen realized he was a fugitive and arrested him. Yakovlev's arrest alarmed Anastasia, and after his arrest Yevgenia asked Anastasiya to leave the city of Dno for her own safety but she refused, realizing that if she did leave the Nazis would arrest all of her relatives and anyone she a previously spoken to. Not long after Yakovlev's arrest, Anastasiya and Yevgenia were summoned by the Germans for interrogation and then shown to the beaten Yakovlev to see if Yakovlev might recognize them. However, Yakovlev denied any acquaintance with the two. Anastasiya and her sister were permitted to leave but after leaving Yakolev was shot. On 4 January 1943 Anastasiya had her youngest son Konstantin go skiing near the railway bridge several kilometers from the city to find out the positions of Germans defenses on the bridge and their numbers. While skiing he was seen by a German soldier whole opened fire on him with an automatic rifle, but Konstantin was not hurt in the incident even after one of the bullets fired at him split his ski in half. Several days later paratroopers destroyed the German guns mounted to the bridge, but Anastasiya did not let Konstantin go on any more scouting missions after she suspected her eldest son Yura was killed in combat. = Connections with the Zinoviev detachment = She later established connections with the partisan unit named after V. I. Zinoviev through her son Yura, who had provided her with information about the detachment, which was located on the outskirts of the city near lake Beli at the time. Anastasiya then told her son about the state of affairs in the area, specifically the locations of the commandant's office, the security company, and the improvised airfield with camouflaged anti- aircraft guns protecting a depot as well as names of local villagers who collaborated with the Nazis. Soviet bombers took out the anti-aircraft guns a few days later. Later the partisan detachment under the command of Vasilyev left the area after sabotaging roads and communicating with Anastasiya. On 2 October the Zinoviev detachment organized a large diversion on the Vyaz'ye- Bakach line in Novosokolniki-Bokach, south of the Dno station. Anastasiya acted as the liaison officer, supplying information on the movement of German troops to Zinoyev after she received information from an anonymous informant. The partisans destroyed two locomotives, tanks, and guns, slowing down equipment shipments. In early November Anastasiya informed Zinoviev about a large quantity of heavily guarded military equipment that was about to be shipped out. A group of five partisans, one of whom was her son Yura, launched a nighttime raid on the station and sabotaged the equipment. In the winter of 1941 to 1942, German authorities increased security at the train station as well as at military bases and factories, reducing the number of sabotage operations the partisans could safely execute. In January 1942 the Druzhny partisan unit that Anastasiya had maintained contact with informed her that during a battle in Kholm village the 2nd Leningrad Partisan Brigade worked with the 3rd Shock Army to expel German forces. During the operation the detachment commander Zinoviev was killed in action and her son Yura was injured by shelling but taken off the battlefield by another partisan. Zinoviev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and Yura was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\". = Railroad sabotage operations = In December 1941, three partisans who participated in battle as part of the 95th Detachment, returned Dno and put Anastasiya in charge of overseeing the railroad attack. A partisan asked Anastasiya to provide the explosives needed for the mission, which she handed to him concealed in a sack of potatoes. In January the explosives were placed inside the engine of a train used by the German military, causing a huge wreckage. The partisans launched a second attack on a train but were arrested the next day and shot in February. Anastasiya took the deaths of her fellow partisans very personally and felt that their deaths were her fault. After the group of partisans that attacked the train were shot, attacked on the railway were paused, and all depot employees that the Germans perceived as suspicious were laid off from the depot. Anastasiya convinced the German occupiers to hire an elderly machinist by the name of Filyukhin; Filyukhin gained the trust of the Germans and was given free rein at the station so he could plant explosives given to him by Anastasiya at the depot. On 23 February he planted an explosive at the depot, concealed in a beer bottle inside a boot. On 25 February he exploded a locomotive that had just undergone repairs, destroying military equipment it was carrying. The next week he organized several attacks on German-controlled portions of the railroad, handing out anti-train mines to other machinists, telling them to plant them as far outside the city as they could and then stay off the radar.  Arrest and death  = First arrest = In the summer of 1943, Anastasiya was arrested by the Geheime Feldpolizei. While the police had no evidence against her, an investigator tried to persuade her to work for the German counterintelligence agency. Anastasiya refused to do so, claiming she was busy taking care of her sick parents. The investigator stopped trying to recruit her but left her in the prison for a month before she was released. It turned out that she was released so that surveillance could be done to see who she was in contact with. While Anastasiya was aware she was being watched she met with Filyukhin, told her he was also under surveillance. Two months later Filyukhin was arrested and sent to a concentration camp without being informed of any evidence against him. When Anastasiya went back to her apartment her father told her about recent mass arrests of partisans and scouts who had attempted a rescue operation of prisoners-of-war held by the Germans after one of the agents involved in the operation was captured revealed the names of numerous partisans. The partisans he named were all shot except for one who was sent to the Zapolyansky death camp. = Second arrest = After Anastasiya realized she would likely be arrested again soon she decided to hand over all the supplies she had accumulated to partisans in Leningrad who were still running sabotage campaigns. Anastasiya helped the remaining partisans in the city left in the middle of the night to nearby rural villages, finding safehouses for them over a period of three days. When she returned to Dno she learned that her son Konstantin had been arrested. Suspecting that her eldest son Yura had been killed and worried about the safety of her younger son, she did not go into hiding but returned to her apartment where she waited for the German police to arrest her. She was arrested almost immediately and the police then released her parents and son Konstantin from their custody. However, her father died not long after his release. In August 1943, Anastasia was sent to Porkhov, where German agents tried to persuade her to cooperate and name the remaining underground resistance members. Anastasiya was subjected to electric shock, causing her to lose consciousness several times, but she still would not name her contacts. After a while, her captors employed psychological torture by showing her the outside world for brief moments, transporting her to the outskirts of Porkhov to the ruins of an ancient fortress and permitted her to walk along a riverbank; she still refused to make any confessions or name any resistance members.  Captivity in the Zapolyansky death camp  After Anastasiya refused to cooperate with the Germans she was sent to the Zapolyansky death camp, which was in close proximity to Porkhov. In the Zapolyansky camp, where resistance members, partisans, and prisoners of war who refused to cooperate with the German authorities were detained and tortured. In the 10 months of the camp's existence, more than three thousand people were killed. During her captivity, Anastasia tried to help other prisoners and gained their respect. Anastasiya's son Konstantin learned about the whereabouts of his mother and visited her several times, traveling from Dno and getting permission to speak to her through the fence. He made his last visit on 18 September 1943, after she told him not to come anymore after realizing that she would soon be executed and feared that he would be arrested and executed too. She told him not to stay in the city but live in the forest with the partisans. Konstantin considered trying to save her, but he realized that he and his several comrades didn't have enough resources to do it. Konstantin left the city of Dno with a friend to join the partisans in the forest, and her later became a soldier in the Red Army. After he was demobilized he worked as an engineer in Nizhny Tagil and Novgorod. On 13 October 1943 Anastasiya was shot on the orders of the camp commandant. In November 1943 the camp was dismantled and all remains of the prisoners killed in the camp's ten months of existence were burned in preparation for the advancing Soviet military. Just three months later the 2nd Baltic and Leningrad fronts of Red Army retook the Dno railroad junction and the surrounding area.  Recognition  On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the defeat of the Germans in the Second World War Anastasiya and nine other partisans in the Pskov region were declared Heroes of the Soviet Union by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, with eight of the nine people awards being posthumous. A large granite memorial plaque inscribed with \\"Here, at the station Dno, during the temporary German-Fascist occupation of the city, Hero of the Soviet Union Biseniek Anastasia Alexandrovna participated in the underground resistance. The courageous patriot was brutally tortured and executed by the fascists in October 1943. Eternal glory to the heroes who gave their lives for the freedom and independence of our Motherland\\" was placed at the train station in Dno where she worked. The depot in Dno contains a small museum dedicated to the history of the town during German occupation and a central street in Dno was named in her honor. In the 1980s historian Nikolai Vassarionovich Masolov compiled her complete biography after speaking with her relatives and surviving members of her partisan detachment.

He left St. Croix for Copenhagen and was granted Danish citizenship in 1776. His wife died on 7 December that same year and was buried from Trinitatis Church. MacEvoy purchased the country house Christiansholm in Klampenborg north of Copenhagen in circa 1777. Back on St. Croix, in 1778, he married Jenny Marie Low (-1812 ).

Gameplay Black Butterfly and Ashen Hawk are visual novels in which the player reads through the story and makes choices such as what the player characters should say, affecting the direction of the plot and which of the games' endings the player ends up at. The games include an interactive flowchart, which the player can use to go back and try alternative choices and keep track of what they have done in the games. In addition to the main scenarios, there are side stories where the player learns more about the characters. Plot Black Butterfly follows an amnesiac woman who wakes up in a Western house and is attacked by monsters. She meets men in the house who similarly cannot remember their pasts, and the group is forced to partake in the black butterfly hunt to gather the kaleidoscope fragments the monsters possess.

Its first edition was held from 21‚Äì25 September 2018. The festival was established by Al Jazeera Balkans in cooperation with the Al Jazeera Media Network and the Doha-based Al Jazeera Media Institute. Al Jazeera Balkans is currently the biggest buyer of television format documentaries in the Former Yugoslavia and annually acquires rights for most of the regional documentary films that are screened during the Sarajevo Film Festival. AJB DOC directly lent its concept from the Aljazeera International Documentary Film Festival, which was founded in 2005 by Jordanian film director and writer, Abbas Arnaout. History On 22 September 2010, after months of speculation, the Qatari government-owned Al Jazeera Media Network announced the US$1.56 million purchase of NTV 99, a local channel based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.BBC News Europe, 11 November 2011 - Al Jazeera launches Balkans television channel Named Al Jazeera Balkans (AJB), the project was envisioned as \\"a leader in providing high quality news and current affairs in the region [of former Yugoslavia]\\" with planned offices throughout the Balkans and bureaus in key locations worldwide. With ‚Ç¨15 million reportedly invested in the project (according to general director ƒêoƒëiƒá), Al Jazeera Balkans began broadcasting on 11 November 2011, launching their website on the same day. The network's visual appearance is mainly based on that of its English-language counterpart. It broadcasts from the Eutelsat W3C satellite and also offers a live web stream just like its Arabic and English counterparts do. The network has subsequently become one of the leading news outlets in the Former Yugoslavia. On 13 February 2018 Al Jazeera Balkans confirmed the establishment of the AJB DOC Festival which will be held from 21‚Äì25 September 2018. Sarajevo was chosen as the venue because it already hosts the premier and largest film festival in Southeast Europe, the Sarajevo Film Festival. On 21 September 2018 the first edition of the AJB DOC Festival was opened in Cinema City Sarajevo with the screening of S√∏ren Steen Jespersen's documentary, Lost Warrior. The 2018 edition's jury consisted of American actress, Karen Hayes, British media consultant, Ingrid Falk, Palestinian-Jordanian filmmaker and journalist, Montaser Marai, Croatian sociologist, Robert Tomiƒá Zuber and Bosnian producer, Zoran Galiƒá. Format The official objective of the AJB DOC Festival, outlined by the Al Jazeera Media Network, is to \\"promote authors and documentaries addressing social phenomena with a focus on universal human values such as courage, truth, justice, tolerance and cosmopolitism.\\" The festival's official competition selection for the 2018 edition consisted of 15 international documentaries adapted for TV broadcasting. The non-competition selection, known as Last Minute Cinema, consisted of five acclaimed international documentaries. All selected films are considered for acquisition by Al Jazeera Balkans and its sister channel, Al Jazeera English, and will subsequently be screened on television. The selections will be finalized in June. The AJB DOC Festival, in cooperation with the Al Jazeera Media Network, holds a multi-day documentary workshop for authors, independent productions and film students from the Former Yugoslavia. In addition to film screenings, the first edition of AJB DOC Festival hosted post-screening Q&A; sessions, social events, exhibitions and other content with the desire to create an atmosphere of artistic exchange and professional networking.

It was within the Cambridge Custody.A.G. Little, Studies in English Franciscan History, Ford Lectures 1916 (Manchester University Press/Longmans, Green & Co., London 1917), pp. 235-36. It remained active until dissolved in the late 1530s. Ipswich Greyfriars (T), shown on John Speed's map of Ipswich, 1610, in relation to St Nicholas (L), St Peter's (M), and Stoke Bridge Although some of the conventual buildings appear to have survived into the 17th century, by the early 19th century very little remained, and almost nothing is now visible, the few fragments being incorporated into a multi- storey development. It formerly stood in the neighbourhood of St Nicholas's church, Prince's Street and Franciscan Way, on a site opposite the Willis Faber building, with a frontage towards the River Gipping near its outflow into the River Orwell. Less well-documented than the Ipswich Blackfriars (Dominicans) and the Ipswich Whitefriars (Carmelites), very few records concerning the Greyfriars survive. However its importance among the several religious houses of mediaeval Ipswich can be traced through its association with the Barons Tibetot, a title active from 1308 to 1372, immediate descendants of the supposed founder, as the place of burial for various members of the Tiptoft family and of other noble or titled persons associated with them.B.P. Grimsey, 'The Grey-friars Monastery, Ipswich', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and Natural History Vol. IX Part 3 (1897), pp. 372-78 (Suffolk Institute).

Weever, Ancient Fvnerall Monvments Within The Vnited Monarchie Of Great Britain (Thomas Harper for Laurence Sadler, London 1631), p. 751 (as p. 750) (Google). The son of Henry de Tibetot, Sir Robert de Tibetot, of a family anciently associated with Bramford near Ipswich, had livery of his lands in 1250,H.E.

Farrer and C.T. Clay (eds), Early Yorkshire Charters, 6: The Paynel Fee (Yorkshire Archaeological Society 1939), pp. 53-54 (Google).). Eva's brother Patrick de Chaworth was father of the younger Patrick, who succeeded him as Lord of Kidwelly and was the first husband of Isabella de Beauchamp, daughter of the 9th Earl of Warwick, and afterwards wife of Hugh le Despencer, 1st Earl of Winchester.'Chaworth', in W. Dugdale, The baronage of England 2 vols (Tho. Newcomb, for Abel Roper, Iohn Martin, and Henry Herringman, London 1676), I, pp. 517-18 ‚Äì with sources there cited. These kinships exercised a strong influence over the future alliances of the patron family of Greyfriars. Sir Robert was appointed governor of Portchester Castle in 1266 by King Henry III: he became a trusted servant to Prince Edward and accompanied him on the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land, receiving a grant from the King in 1270 that if he failed to return his executors should have the wardship and marriage of his heir, Payn de Tibetot. Edward I made him governor of Nottingham Castle (1275), and in 1277 he was among the King's Commissioners to make peace with Owain Goch ap Gruffydd. Again governor of Nottingham in 1280, in the following year he was Justice of South Wales, and governor of Carmarthen and Cardigan Castles. Granted wardship of the lands of William de Braose (of Gower) in 1291, he defeated the revolt of Rhys ap Maredudd (allegedly prompted by Tibetot's governance) and took its leader prisoner. Soon afterwards he was in the King's expedition to Gascony, where he assisted John of Brittany, Lieutenant of Aquitaine, in concluding friendly relations with the King of Castile; but upon being besieged by a French army, he had not the strength to withstand them, and withdrew. In 1297 he fought in Scotland, and died the following year, leaving extensive estates in various parts of England to his son and two daughters.'Tibetot', in Dugdale, The Baronage of England, II, pp. 38-39 (Umich/eebo). = From Tibetot to Wentworth = A sequel is found in Weever's record that the heart of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford (who died in 1296, his body buried at Earl's Colne) was also buried there: and that the tomb of Margaret (Mortimer), daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore and wife of the younger Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford (1257‚Äì1331), was in the same church.Weever, Ancient Fvnerall Monvments, p. 751 (as p. 750). Payn de Tibetot, aged 19 at his father's death, married Agnes, daughter of William de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros of Helmsley: after taking part in several military expeditions, mainly in Scotland, he was summoned to Parliament among the Barons between 1307 and 1314, when he lost his life at the Battle of Bannockburn. His widow then married Thomas de Vere, who thus became stepfather to Payn's son and heir John Tibetot (1313‚Äì1367), aged only one. John succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Tibetot when he came of age. John married Margaret (youngest daughter of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere), whose elder sister Maud de Badlesmere was Countess to John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford.'Badlesmere', in Dugdale, Baronage of England, II, pp. 57-60 (Umich/eebo). The De Vere burials at Greyfriars reflect this phase of alliance with the Tibetot patrons, following the death of the 1st Baron. Weever recorded that Margaret (Badlesmere), wife of Sir John Tibetot, was also entombed there; and there were graves of Sir Thomas Tibetot the younger, and Robert Tibetot, Esquire, unidentified. In 1319 Robert of Fornham left two tenements to the Greyfriars in his will, which, however, was neither signed nor witnessed. The executors brought this before the bailiffs and coroner of Ipswich, who granted probate when two of the grey friars themselves were brought in to witness that the testator had been of sound mind. King Edward III granted protection to the Warden and Friars Minor of Ipswich in September 1328 and February 1331. Sir Nicholas Fraunceys (manorial lord at East BergholtW.A.

One of these was from Sir William de Cleydon, knight: Weever recorded the monument of John, son of William Cleydon, in the Greyfriars church, who died in 1333 holding the manors of Claydon with Thurleston (Mortimer), Farnham (Montagu),W.A.

Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick and wife of Sir Thomas Ufford (K.G.), was buried here: both died shortly before 1369. (Sir Thomas was the brother of William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth was sister of his Countess, Isabella.R.E.C. Waters, Genealogical Memoirs of the Extinct Family of Chester of Chicheley, 2 Vols. (Robson & Sons, London 1878), I, pp. 322-42 (Hathi Trust).) Weever also reports the burials of Dame Margery (aunt of Sir Robert Ufford), Elizabeth Ufford, and the heart of Petronilla Ufford. The Ufford family connection arose through Maud de Chaworth (daughter and sole heir of the younger Patrick de Chaworth and Isabella de Beauchamp) who married Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. Their daughter Maud of Lancaster, Countess of Ulster by 1343 married Sir Ralph de Ufford, Justiciar of Ireland, brother of Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk (created 1337). Upon Sir Ralph's death in 1346 Maud buried him and established a chantry at the de Ufford house of Campsey Priory and retired into that convent. Soon afterwards her daughter Maud de Ufford was married to Thomas de Vere, 8th Earl of Oxford (died 1371), reconnecting with his Tibetot and Badlesmere descent. The Countess Maud in 1356 expressed special love for the friars minor and provided for alms to be given to the Ipswich Greyfriars whenever one of her chaplains died.D. Allen, 'A newly-discovered survival from the muniments of Maud of Lancaster's Chantry', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History XLI Part 2 (2006), pp. 151-74, at pp. 162-63 and p. 170 (Suffolk Institute pdf). She remained at Campsey until 1364, then establishing and joining the Poor Clares at Bruisyard Abbey. Robert Earl of Suffolk (d. 1369) and his son William the 2nd Earl (d. 1382), maintaining patronage of Butley Priory and Leiston Abbey, made Campsey Priory church their dynastic mausoleum. The Tibetot memorials continued in the monument to Elizabeth, Lady Despencer (daughter of Sir Robert Tiptoft, the 3rd Baron and his wife Margaret Deincourt,The first Sir Robert and his wife had received a grant of the homage of Edmund Deincourt and his heirs (among others) in c. 1285, see Dugdale, Baronage of England, II, pp. 38-39. and granddaughter of Sir John), wife of Philip le Despencer the younger of Nettlestead (1365‚Äì1424), with three of their children. Their daughter and heiress Margery le Despencer (born c. 1397), in her own right 3rd Baroness le Despenser, married (first) John de Ros, 7th Baron de Ros, who died without heir, and secondly Roger Wentworth of Nettlestead, Esq. (d.1452), son of John Wentworth of North Elmsall. Roger and Margery were the parents of Sir Philip Wentworth of Nettlestead. By this means the hereditary patron interest in the Greyfriars at Ipswich diverged from the Tiptoft family name (which continued in the Tiptoft Barons (1426), descendants of the younger Sir Payn Tiptoft (died c. 1413) and Agnes Wroth), and instead descended to Sir Philip's great-grandson Thomas Wentworth, created 1st Baron Wentworth in 1529, who had dealings with Thomas Cromwell in 1538 concerning the condition of the friary and its future.Page, VCH Suffolk II, pp. 126-27.M.K.

Their tombs therefore belong to the same period as Sir Robert de Tibetot's. The family of Sir Gilbert Pecche were patrons and benefactors of Leiston Abbey and Butley Priory in the same period. The tomb of Dame Alice de Holebrok (whom Weever calls widow of Sir John de Holebrok) may refer to John de Holebrok (inquisition post mortem 1311) and his wife Alicia (i.p.m. 1309), who died possessed of very extensive Suffolk estates within the sphere of Ipswich,'51.

The last years  = Lord Curson's monument = The last important burial at Greyfriars was that of the soldier and courtier Sir Robert, Lord Curson (c.1460-1535), a very prominent figure in early Tudor Ipswich. Curson was knighted in 1489 and took part in the tournaments of 1494, and was Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1496‚Äì97. Having married the widow of Sir George Hopton in 1498, he joined the Emperor Maximilian I to fight against the Turks in 1499 while in tenure of the post of captain of Hammes Castle in the approaches to Calais, taking time to visit Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, at Gu√Ænes. It was reported that he had attempted to enlist the Emperor's support for a Yorkist attempt against King Henry VII, and he was proclaimed a traitor in 1501, but escaped the condemnation which led to the executions of Sir James Tyrrell and Sir John Wyndham in 1502, and was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire for his exploits against the Turks. He built the large double courtyard mansion which stood on the corner of St Peter's Street and Silent Street, of which the retinue guesthouse survives on the opposite side of Silent Street. Conservative in his religious views, he fed the flames at the martyrdom of the Lollard Nicholas Peke at the Ipswich Cornhill in 1515, and wrote the account of the \\"Ipswich Miracle\\"J. Blatchly and D. MacCulloch, Miracles in Lady Lane: The Ipswich Shrine at the Westgate (D.K. and M.N. Sanford, Ipswich 2013). which brought Katherine of Aragon and later King Henry to Ipswich where they resided in his house.J.M. Blatchly and W. Haward, 'Sir Robert Curson, Soldier, Courtier and Spy, and his Ipswich Mansion', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History Vol. XLI Part 2 (2007), pp. 335-49, at pp. 335-38 (Suffolk Institute). Curson's mansion stood very close to the house of Thomas Wolsey's father, and adjacent to the Priory of St Peter and St Paul, the site of which, with its church, was utilized by Wolsey for the building of his Collegiate School of St Mary at Ipswich. This overlooked the river frontage just below Stoke Bridge, as the Greyfriars had the frontage above the bridge, where a channel of the Gipping flowed towards the tidal water. Curson requested burial at the Greyfriars in his will, and although not listed by Weever his monument is shown to have existed by a reference in the friary's Dissolution Inventory to silk pillows of Lady Curson, and \\"a feyn herse clothe yt ley upon the lorde Cursons herse\\" (the \\"hearse\\" being a metal superstructure over the figures of the tomb).J. Wodderspoon, Memorials of the Ancient Town of Ipswich (Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, London 1850), p. 317 (Internet archive). The will of Curson's second wife, Margaret,Will of Lady Margaret Curson, Widow of Halsted, Essex (P.C.C. 1577, Daughtry quire). shows that the tomb was removed after the closure of the Greyfriars to St Peter's church (the former priory church), which, following the fall of Wolsey reverted to use as a parish church.Blatchly and Haward, 'Sir Robert Curson', p. 338. Hence it was not seen by Weever at Greyfriars. = Lord Wentworth's interest = On 1 April 1538 Lord Wentworth wrote to Thomas Cromwell concerning the Greyfriars, which still had inmates but was in dire financial straits. Describing himself as the \\"founder in blood\\" (referring to his hereditary patronage), he explains that the people of Ipswich have been giving their charity to better causes than to this \\"nest of drones\\". The Warden had informed him that they had been compelled to sell their plate and jewellery to obtain a subsistence, and it was found that Archdeacon Thomas Sillesden had been buying it. Wentworth states that he has purchased the house for himself and his heirs, consisting of the site merely, with enclosed gardens, holding the Franciscan order not to be a divinely-planted stock but a hypocritical weed planted by the Bishop of Rome. He now begged for the grant of the house.(Item 651) : 'Henry VIII: April 1538, 1-5', in J. Gairdner (ed.), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 13 Part 1, January-July 1538 (HMSO, London 1892), p. 250 (British History Online, accessed 4 May 2018). A week later Richard Yngworth, Visitor for the friaries at the suppression, made an inventory of the goods, most of which were old, and removed all but the barest necessities to the Ipswich Blackfriars. He also recovered the church ornaments and utensils which had been sold, including a quantity of plate pledged to Lord Wentworth, to a total of nearly 260 ounces.(Item 699) : 'Henry VIII: April 1538, 6-10', in J.

The exact date of the closure is not known, but this marked the end of the friary.

Like other suburban malls at that time, it had an Eng Wah cinema, an NTUC FairPrice supermarket, a public library, the local post office, a Kopitiam food court and 93 specialty shops. Above Sun Plaza are two 7-storey tower blocks composed of 76 residential apartments, which were completed in 2001. In 2009, the cinema was closed due to low patronage and was subsequently left vacant. The mall also suffered declining patronage too, due to competitions from Causeway Point, Northpoint, the then newly reopened Sembawang Shopping Centre, and a lack of well known anchor tenants. As a result, some tenants started moving out, such as Popular bookstore being replaced by Gain City. The mall underwent refurbishment works in 2014, when it was reclad with a new yellow exterior facade and a change in interior layout, as well as installation of outdoor escalators and alfresco dining spots. The vacant cinema premises was converted to educational use, with Level 4 housing a bunch of tuition and enrichment centres and the entirety of Level 5 housing the new Sembawang Public Library, having relocated from its original premises at Level 3.

The house was built for Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers union, and his wife. They lived here from 1951 until their deaths in 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History In 1951, Walter and May Reuther located these lots, intending to develop them into a summer house for the family. They stayed in a small house on the site that summer, but by the end of the summer decided to stay here permanently. Reuther consulted with architect and family friend Oscar Stonorov, and the two men collaborated on a design for a ranch-style house on the property. It was soon built and the family moved in, settling permanently here in 1953. Reuther tinkered with the design of the house over the years, adding onto it., and later built a guest house to host visiting diplomats. The Reuthers lived in this house until their deaths in a plane crash, together with Oscar Stonorov, on May 9, 1970. The complex was sold by their heirs in 1973. Description The Walter P. and May Wolf Reuther House sits on three adjacent lots with the winding Paint Creek running through the property. The grounds contain three buildings: the modern wood-sided main house with stone chimneys near the creek, a soaring modern wood and glass-walled guest house also near the creek, and a modern ranch style guard house close to the road. The main house is located within a bow of Paint Creek, and is approached by narrow wooden walking bridges over the water. It is a one-story building, clad with vertical redwood planks painted dark brown and sitting on a concrete block foundation. A two-story addition is connected to the center of the building, under which is a small enclosed entry portico. Floor-to-ceiling windows look out over Paint Creek, and a large stone chimney extends to one side. The guest house is a two-story wooden modern style building with a low pitched sloping roof and a wooden deck that extends over Paint Creek.

The band formed in 2013 and currently comprises members Emma Kupa, Mark Boxall and Tom Barden. History Emma Kupa's previous band Standard Fare broke up in 2013 following an eight-year run, and Kupa soon moved from Sheffield to Cambridgeshire. Switching from bass (which she played in Standard Fare) to guitar and vocals, Kupa teamed up with bassist Mark Boxall and drummer Tom Barden to form the combo Mammoth Penguins. The new group's debut single, \\"When I Was Your Age\\", was released in June 2015, and their album, Hide and Seek, arrived a month later on the Fortuna Pop! label. The band returned in 2017 with the \\"A Simple Misunderstanding\\" single for Kingfisher Bluez; they went on to make a record that expanded from their earlier punk-pop sound. Under the name Mammoth Penguins & Friends, they recorded a concept album about a man who faked his own death, then returned ten years later. Titled John Doe, it featured contributions from Haiku Salut's Sophie Barkerwood (programming/samples), as well as Russell Lomas (violin), and Joe Bear (samples/synths). The record was released in late 2017 on Where It's At Is Where You Are (often shortened to WIAWIYA). They released their third album, There's No Fight We Can't Both Win, in 2019 on Fika Recordings.

Arizona Renewable Energy Standards Initiative The legislation is connected to a ballot initiative in Arizona. The ballot initiative, called the Arizona Renewable Energy Standards Initiative (or \\"Clean Energy for Healthy Arizona\\"), will likely appear on the Arizona general election ballot on November 6, 2018 as an initiated constitutional amendment. If passed, the initiative would require that electric utilities operating in Arizona acquire their electricity from a certain percentage of renewable resources per year. Examples of acceptable renewable resources include solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and landfill gas energies. Supporters of the ballot initiative have until July 5, 2018 to get at least 225,953 valid signatures on petitions to put the issue on the November ballot. The ballot initiative amends the Constitution of Arizona. It does this to prevent lawmakers from changing it after it is passed; in order to change it, Arizonans would have to take the issue back to voters. Under the ballot initiative, by 2020 Arizona electric utilities would have to use renewable resources for at least 12% of their electricity. That threshold would go up to 50% by the year 2030. House Bill 2005 The legislation would fine electric utilities that violate the initiatives renewable energy standards. Fines would be between $100 and $5000. The authors of the bill wrote the legislation in such a way that \\"any public service corporation that violates or fails to comply with the constitution . . . is subject to a penalty of not less than one hundred nor more than five thousand dollars for each offense.\\"https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2005/2018 The Arizona State Senate passed the bill by a vote of 16 to 12 on March 21, 2018. The following day, the Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 34 to 24. On March 23, Gov. Doug Ducey signed the bill. As the Arizona Capitol Times put it, the legislation is a way to \\"give utilities a way to avoid having to get half their electricity from renewable sources by 2030 even if voters mandate that they do so\\" [by passing the ballot initiative]. The Arizona Constitution gives authority to the Arizona Corporation Commission to set utility rates. Courts have decided that the commission is also allowed to decide what mix of energy sources utilities are required to use. Support and opposition The Sierra Club, which is opposed to the bill, argues that the bill merely makes violation of the ballot initiative have too low of a penalty. A lobbyist for the Sierra Club said, \\"Everyone knows that if the cost of noncompliance is cheaper than the cost of compliance, entities will serve their shareholders, not consumers, and take the low road and pay the fines.\\" In support of the bill are electric utilities who are opposed to how the initiative is being rolled out; it is being sponsored financially by a California billionaire. Utilities argue that the bill would protect the state's energy prices. Rod Ross, a lobbyist for the state's largest electric utility Arizona Public Service, said, \\"We feel like its important to protect the people of this state from an out-of-state initiative funded by a California billionaire that is attempting to raise our state's and our residents' energy prices, which is exactly what this initiative will do.\\" State Senator Juan Mendez (D-Tempe) asked Ross if it was the intent of the utility industry to ignore the mandate if it is enacted by voters, and simply pay the fine instead. Ross said that if utilities were mandated to increase their renewable energy, they would consult with Arizona lawmakers, regulators, and others to come to the best decision. Other supporters include Tucson Electric Power, UNS Energy, and other electric cooperatives. Laurie Roberts, an opinion columnist for The Arizona Republic, wrote on March 26, 2018, \\"Arizona‚Äôs leaders have shown once again that they have absolutely no faith in Arizona‚Äôs voters. ... The bill [HB 2005] would essentially nullify a vote of the people this fall, should the people decide to mandate that require more use of solar and other types of renewable energy in Arizona.\\" However, according to the Arizona Capitol Times, Arizona Republican legislators clarified that the intent of HB 2005 was to ensure that it would not matter if voters side with the initiative organizers. State Rep. Vince Leach (R-Tucson) said it is the responsibility of the legislature to protect Arizona residents from out-of-state interests.

As of 2018, TransitScreen has displays in more than 1,000 buildings in 30 cities, including Washington D.C., Boston, and Pittsburgh. TransitScreen is a SaaS platform, in which the property or business pays to access its software on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.  History  The company grew out of Arlington County's Mobility Lab, which measures the impacts of transportation demand management services, in 2011. It incorporated in 2013 as Multimodal Logic, Inc. In January 2015, the company closed its first round of seed funding of $600,000, which came from a number of investors, such as 1776 Ventures and Middle Bridge Partners. In late 2015, an additional $800,000 of seed money was raised. In April 2018, a new round of funding was announced and was closed in May 2019 from Vancouver-based TIMIA Capital. Shortly thereafter, the company announced that its product is available in South America and Western Europe. In August 2019, TransitScreen and New York-based commercial real estate digital media amenity company Captivate announced a partnership that will bring TransitScreen's real-time data to Captivate's network of multipurpose display screens.  Products  TransitScreen's displays show real-time arrival information for trains, subways, buses, streetcars, and ferries. They also show real-time availability of local bicycle-sharing systems, carsharing, and vehicle for hire companies. The displays are made to correspond to the specific address where the individual screen is located. In September 2017, TransitScreen released its MobilityScore rating, which uses historical data to determine how easy it is to get around a given location without a car. It is similar to Walk Score, but measures the mobility and transit accessibility of an address rather than proximity to amenities. In November 2018, TransitScreen released its mobile application, CityMotion. CityMotion is location-based and shows the user the real-time availability of mobility options nearby. Like TransitScreen, it is a B2B product and is not currently available for individual consumers.

Early life  Dyachenko was born on 2 April 1924 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Kumari. She did not complete secondary school while she was living in Lviv. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 her father, who had been the chairman of the district committee, was sent to the warfront while Darya and her mother moved to Novo-Andreyevka to live with her grandmother. She was a member of the Komsomol. Partisan activities When the Germans occupied her village, Dyachenko joined the resistance movement after meeting with Parfentiy Grechanyy, the leader of the Komosmol organization \\"Partisan spark\\". The partisan group was founded in 1941 by the principal of the secondary school in Krymka village. Each cell composed of five people, and after obtaining typewriters and radios they summarized Sovinformburo broadcasts on paper and spread out the messages via leaflets. They also collected leaflets airdropped by Soviet planes and distributed them among the village. The partisans collected armaments and trained in the use of grenades and rifles before they began engaging in sabotage. On one mission the cell led by Dyachenko derailed a train carrying German soldiers and their supplies. She was the organizer of a plot to help 200 Soviet prisoners of war escape from a camp. After befriending the group of Romanian prison guards Dyachenko and her comrades invited them to a party and got them drunk before releasing the prisoners of war.

Aftermath As a precautionary measure, the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossell√≥, ordered all WC-130 aircraft to remain grounded until the conclusion of the accident investigation. The governor also ordered an assessment of the WC-130 fleet in the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. Additionally, commanders of the active duty USAF were directed to observe a one-day pause in operations, to review and identify potential safety concerns that may lead to mishaps. A section of highway 21 at the impact site was closed immediately after the accident, and the Air National Guard provided funds to the United States Army Corps of Engineers for repairs and cleanup. Traffic was diverted around the crash site to adjacent road SR 307 through a temporary detour, until the completion of repairs. The closed section of highway 21 was reopened for public use on June 8, 2018. The aircraft‚Äôs wreckage was recovered and moved to a storage facility in Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina by mid-May. Investigation The investigation carried out by the USAF found the root cause of the crash to be pilots error following an engine malfunction. During the takeoff roll, engine number 1 (the left outboard engine) experienced performance fluctuations which went unnoticed until after takeoff. The engine power dropped from nearly to under 300, causing the aircraft to pull to the left, nearly departing the runway. The investigation found that the takeoff should have been aborted but was not. Furthermore, the investigation determined that the flight crew had failed to adequately prepare for emergency actions, and the maintenance technicians failed to properly diagnose and repair the malfunctioning engine before flight. After the flight crew retracted the landing gear, they identified that the engine No.1 was malfunctioning but did not perform the takeoff continued after engine failure procedure or follow the engine shutdown checklist, nor did they complete the after takeoff checklist. The flaps had been set to 50% for takeoff and were not retracted. The approved method of maneuvering a multi engine aircraft in such a situation is to bank the aircraft so that the malfunctioning engine is on the high-side wing. In this case, the pilot incorrectly applied both left bank and rudder, instead of banking to the right. At an air speed of 131 knots, these incorrect inputs ultimately led to a left wing stall resulting in a total loss of control. The maximum altitude was , which was insufficient to regain control of the aircraft.

Originating in 1937, the farming business at Tulleys was founded by Bernard Beare, and continues to be run by the Beare family to this day. Tulleys is best known for its seasonal attractions, most notably the annual Halloween festival held each October, entitled Shocktober Fest which has become the largest scream park in Europe. History Originally from Devon, Bernard Beare began farming in 1911 and gradually moved East over the subsequent 25 years. In 1937 he settled at Worth Hall Farm, working with his young family to turn an ordinary dairy farm into a successful farming enterprise. In addition to the original dairy herd, Bernard was able to produce salad crops for the London markets, vegetables for pickling firms such as Epicure and herbs like mint and parsley for contract. In the early 1970s, Bernard's son Denis saw the potential for pick-your-own and, with his wife Marion, pursued turning Tulleys Farm into one of the largest pick-your-own farms in the area. Growing over 40 different crops on 120 acres.

Early life and education Lundgren was born and raised in Lynden, Washington, where at a young age began recycling computers from a local bank.] He graduated with a bachelor of science in Entrepreneurial Studies from Babson College.Alumni US, Babson College, Greater Boston Area Career =Recycling companies= In 2002 Lundgren moved to Los Angeles, and started his first electronics recycling company, Environmental Computer Associates (ECA), where he worked with a number of large companies including American Airlines.] He served as the CEO of the company until 2010, before selling to Access Computer Products Inc. (acquired by Waste Management Inc.) In 2006 Lundgren traveled to China and lived there for five years learning about electronic recycling and finding ways to send cheap parts to America to prolong the lifecycle of electronics. Upon returning to the US, Lundgren founded IT Asset Partners, Inc. in late 2012. The company repurposes enterprise and consumer electronics, lithium-ion batteries, harvests generic parts and components, and recycles e-waste for bellwether technology companies. Lundgren said, \\"95 percent of a computer, such as the battery and the circuits, are generic and can be reused or repurposed.\\" He devoted much time to recovering discarded batteries, whether from electric cars or computers, and reusing them in wheelchairs, electronics, and various vehicles. In 2009, Lundgren founded Source Captain Inc. in order to help American buyers bypass the broker process to source direct certified factories on a global scale. Lundgren launched the first \\"electronic hybrid recycling\\" facility in the United States, which turns discarded cell phones and other electronics into functional devices, slowing the stream of harmful chemicals and metals into landfills and the environment. Lundgren in Ghana on clean up e-waste project =Ghana project= In 2015, Lundgren undertook a project to clean up e-waste in Ghana at the request of the country‚Äôs vice president. =Other projects= In 2016, IT Asset Partners, Inc. undertook an initiative where it repaired and donated more than 14,000 cellphones for ‚ÄúCellphones for Soldiers‚Äù, to benefit US soldiers deployed overseas. In 2017, Lundgren converted a salvaged BMW known as ‚ÄúThe Phoenix‚Äù to an electric vehicle, modifying it with 90% recycled parts to become the world's most efficient electric vehicle with a Guinness Book World Record distance of 999.5 miles on a single charge. The Phoenix has also surpassed Elon Musk & Tesla Model S P100D‚Äôs world record of 1083 km (673 miles) on a single charge by traveling 1,203 km (748 miles) on real California highways and streets at freeway speeds and in stop-and-go conditions, averaging 52 miles per hour. Legal issues While living in China from 2006 to 2011 one of his Source Captain projects was to manufacture replacement \\"restore disks\\". The restore discs are usually supplied by computer-makers as a way for users to reinstall Windows with preinstalled drivers to a hard drive if it crashes. The disks can be used only on a computer that already has a license for the Windows Operating System. As COO of IT Asset Partners, Inc., Lundgren produced and shipped 28,000 restore discs to a broker in Florida in 2012. Their plan was to provide the discs to used-computer buyers who wouldn't have to take the time to create the discs themselves. US Customs intercepted a shipment of the restore disks imported from China in 2012 and referred the case to federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors filed a 21 count indictment against Lundgren for copyright violations of the Microsoft operating system. Initially, federal prosecutors valued the discs at $299 each, or the cost of a brand new Windows operating system, and Lundgren‚Äôs indictment claimed he had cost Microsoft $8.3 million in lost sales. Lundgren and his defense team disagreed with the charges and stated he was providing replacement restore discs for convenience to people using recycled hardware that already had a license to use the Windows operating system. Lundgren also stated Microsoft gave away the restore disk for free so there was nothing to steal and there were no lost sales. Lundgren pled guilty to criminal trademark infringement and conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit Dell disks, and in May, a judge for the US District Court in the Southern District of Florida sentenced him to 15 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $50,000 fine. Following his sentencing, Lundgren stepped down as CEO of IT Asset Partners, Inc In June 2017. In April 2018, a federal appeals court in Miami rejected his claim that the \\"restore disks\\" he made to extend the lives of computers had no financial value, and instead ruled that he had infringed Microsoft's products, valuing the restore disks at $700,000 based on the $25 value Microsoft charged refurbishers for each disk. US Public Interest Research Group defended Lundgren, issuing a statement over his sentencing through its Right to Repair campaign. Lundgren was released after serving one year of his fifteen-month sentence for good behavior.

People with human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castelman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD) have enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions and often have flu-like symptoms, abnormal findings on blood tests, and dysfunction of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow. HHV-8-associated MCD is known to be caused by uncontrolled infection with the human herpesvirus 8 virus (HHV-8) and is most frequently diagnosed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HHV-8-associated MCD is treated with a variety of medications, including immunosuppressants, chemotherapy, and antivirals. Castleman disease is named after Dr. Benjamin Castleman, who first described the disease in 1956. The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network is the largest organization focused on the disease and is involved in research, awareness, and patient support.  Signs and symptoms  People with HHV-8-associated MCD may experience enlarged lymph nodes in multiple lymph node regions; systemic symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, and fatigue; rashes such as cherry hemangiomas or Kaposi sarcoma; enlargement of the liver and/or spleen; and extravascular fluid accumulation in the extremities (edema), abdomen (ascites), or lining of the lungs (pleural effusion). = Associated diseases = HHV-8-associated MCD is most commonly diagnosed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but can be seen in patients without HIV as well. Patients with HHV-8-associated MCD are often found to have Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer caused by the HHV-8 virus and most commonly seen in patients with HIV. Patients with HHV-8-associated MCD have been observed to be at greater risk of developing lymphoma.  Causes  HHV-8-associated MCD is known to be caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8. The HHV-8 virus is commonly found in healthy individuals showing no signs of disease, but it is also known to cause diseases such as Kaposi sarcoma and HHV-8-associated MCD. Diseases caused by HHV-8 are seen most frequently in the setting of immune dysfunction related to factors such as HIV infection or use of immunosuppressant medications; however, HHV-8-associated diseases, including HHV-8-associated MCD, have been reported in otherwise healthy individuals.  Mechanism  In HHV-8-associated MCD the HHV-8 virus infects B cells and plasmablasts in lymph nodes and causes infected cells to release proinflammatory cytokines, signaling molecules that increase the activity of immune cells. In particular, HHV-8 infection of immune cells leads to increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine known to play a role in other forms of Castleman disease. The HHV-8 virus contains a gene coding for a viral variant of the IL-6 molecule. Cells infected by HHV-8 produce the viral variant of IL-6 and normal human IL-6, both of which contribute to the increased B cell proliferation and clinical findings seen in HHV-8-associated MCD.  Diagnosis  HHV-8-associated MCD is diagnosed based on patient history, physical exam, laboratory testing, radiologic imaging, and microscopic analysis (histology) of biopsied tissue from an enlarged lymph node. Formal criteria for the diagnosis of HHV-8-associated MCD have not been published; however, diagnosis requires enlargement of lymph nodes in multiple lymph node regions (typically confirmed with radiologic imaging), histologic changes consistent with HHV-8-associated MCD on biopsy of an enlarged lymph node, and confirmation of HHV-8 infection by LANA-1 lymph node staining or peripheral blood polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8. HIV testing is useful for management, but a positive result is not necessary for to diagnose HHV-8-associated MCD. = Classification = Castleman disease describes a group of at least 3 distinct disorders‚Äîunicentric Castleman disease (UCD), human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD), and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). Identifying the correct subtype of the disease is important, as the three disorders vary significantly in symptoms, clinical findings, disease mechanism, treatment approach, and prognosis. * In Unicentric Castleman disease enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic microscopic findings are present in only a single lymph node region. * In the multicentric subtypes of Castleman disease, enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic findings are present in multiple lymph node regions. The multicentric variants of Castleman disease are further classified by known causes of the disease.  HHV-8-associated MCD is caused by uncontrolled infection with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma- associated herpesvirus).  In idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) the cause of the disease is unknown (idiopathic). Testing for HHV-8 must be negative to diagnose iMCD. = Laboratory testing = Laboratory testing may demonstrate low hemoglobin levels (anemia), abnormal platelet counts, low albumin levels, elevated inflammatory markers such as C-Reactive Protein, elevated creatinine (kidney dysfunction), increased levels of immunoglobulins, and elevation of molecules involved in inflammation (cytokines), such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). = Medical imaging = Radiologic imaging will demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions, which are typically 18F-fluorodoxyglucose (FDG) avid on positron-emission tomography (PET). = Pathology = Unlike the other subtypes of Castleman disease, UCD and iMCD, which can present with a spectrum of features on microscopic analysis (histology) of tissue biopsied from an enlarged lymph node, only a plasmablastic pattern of histologic features has been described in HHV-8-associated MCD. Plasmablastic features are similar to the plasmacytic features seen in iMCD and UCD, with both demonstrating increased plasma cells in interfollicular spaces. Plasmablastic features are differentiated from plasmacytic features by increased numbers of plasmablasts in follicular mantle zones. Staining with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1), a marker for HHV-8 infection, is typically positive.  Treatment  Data regarding treatment for HHV-8-associated MCD is limited and draws on a combination of observational case series and case reports. There have been no randomized controlled trials investigating treatment options for HHV-8-associated MCD. Surgical removal of enlarged lymph nodes, the standard treatment for UCD, is ineffective in HHV-8-associated MCD. Like iMCD, HHV-8-associated MCD is treated with medications. Factors influencing medication selection include disease severity, presence of HIV, presence of Kaposi sarcoma, and response to prior treatments. Rituximab, a drug that depletes B cells, is the first line agent for patients with HHV-8-associated MCD and is recommended in all patients with proven HHV-8-associated MCD unless they have a contraindication to the medication or have failed treatment with the medication in the past. For patients who present with severe organ dysfunction, develop worsening organ dysfunction despite treatment with Rituximab, or have concurrent Kaposi sarcoma, additional chemotherapeutic agents are added to Rituximab. All patients with HIV should continue or initiate treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Antiviral medications targeted at HHV-8, such as valganciclovir, may be used in patients with poorly controlled HIV or concurrent Kaposi sarcoma. Rituximab may be discontinued once clinical and laboratory evidence of active disease resolve or continued as maintenance therapy. Patients who responded to Rituximab but have recurrent HHV-8-associated MCD after discontinuing the medication typically respond to retreatment with Rituximab. = Follow-up = Patients with HHV-8-associated MCD are typically seen at routine intervals for assessment of treatment response and disease progression. Follow-up visits may include evaluation of symptoms, physical examination, laboratory testing, and radiologic imaging.  Prognosis  Outcomes in HHV-8-associated MCD have improved significantly since treatment with rituximab has become more common. In one published case series from an experienced center, observed survival in a cohort of HIV patients with HHV-8-associated MCD was 94% at 2 years and 90% at 5 years.  Epidemiology  No epidemiologic study has been published estimating the incidence for HHV-8-associated MCD in the general population. While rates of Kaposi sarcoma in HIV patients‚Äîwhich like HHV-8-associated MCD is caused by uncontrolled HHV-8 infection‚Äîdecreased as treatment with antiretroviral therapy became more common, rates of HHV-8-associated MCD increased over the same time period. There have been no published epidemiologic studies of Castleman disease outside of the United States; however, rates of HHV-8-associated MCD may vary in different populations based on the prevalence of HHV-8 infection.  History  Castleman disease was first described by Dr. Benjamin Castleman in 1956. In 1995, the association between HHV-8 and Castleman disease was described in patients with HIV. World Castleman Disease Day was established in 2018. Culture The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network was founded in 2012 and is the largest organization focused on Castleman disease. It is a global collaborative network involved in research, awareness, and patient support.

In 2010, restorations and added fine dining restaurant revived the hotel to its 1870s charm, making it again a focal point of the original downtown area. History The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Restaurant was originally built between 1827 and 1829 as a one floor Spanish colonial style home for cattle rancher Don Juan Bandini. In the 1850s Bandini sold his home, and by 1869 it was restored and extended with a second floor into a stagecoach stop and hotel under the direction of Albert Seeley. Seeley a stage master, converted the old adobe into an L-shaped Greek Revival hotel. He renovated the original first story, and added a wood framed second story and balconies. The hotel prospered as a stagecoach stop offering 20 rooms for a layover between Los Angeles and San Diego. By 1888, Seeley sold the hotel due to a major shift in railroad use and a rising downtown Gaslamp Quarter. In the following years it was used as an olive factory. =\\"The Miramar\\"= In 1928 Don Juan Bandini's Grandson, Cave J. Couts Jr., bought the property in order to restore it as a memorial to his mother Ysidora Bandini de Couts. Couts remodeled the residence in Steamboat Revival architecture style. By 1930 the building was wired for electricity, and gas. Cave J.

Found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, it is a parasite of flatfish such as the common sole. Description This small leech grows to a length of about when extended. It is roughly cylindrical, thicker in the middle and narrowing somewhat to a sucker at each end. Newly-hatched larvae are yellowish and transparent and have a pair of eyespots. As they grow they become opaque, with black speckles, and lose the eyespots; later they become beige or grey, and finally black. Distribution and habitat The range of Hemibdella soleae extends across the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Like the flatfish it parasitizes, it is benthic and demersal (living on and just above the seabed) and occurs at depths down to about . Ecology H. soleae is an ectoparasite of flatfish such as the common sole (Solea solea). Like other marine leeches, it feeds on its host's blood, but unlike most freshwater species, it does not drop off the fish after it has fed, instead remaining attached by its anterior sucker. In the juvenile leech, the remnants of each blood meal is visible through the transparent skin as a small red ball inside. In the northern part of its range, the common sole is the main host, but further south, other fish are also parasitized; these include the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), the wedge sole (Dicologlossa cuneata), the bastard sole (Microchirus azevia), the Klein's sole (Synapturichthys kleinii), the sand sole (Pegusa lascaris) and the Portuguese sole (Dagetichthys lusitanica). In the English Channel, small common sole may have one or two leeches on them while large fish may have forty or more of the parasites. Adult leeches attached to the underside of fish lay eggs on the seabed in locations where the fish like to semi-bury themselves in the sediment; the eggs have stalks and are anchored to grains of sand. The free-swimming larvae search out a host fish and attach to the anterior end of the dorsal surface, the only part of the fish not buried in sediment. After a short period of development, the larvae migrate to the ventral surface of the fish. Here they attach to the host with their front sucker oriented towards the front of the fish.

His father, Edward M'Evoy, was a gentleman farmer, whose ancestors had lost their property in the times when Roman Catholics found it difficult to maintain their position as landed proprietors. It is believed that their property was given in trust to Lord Sunderland, but it never again came into the possession of the M'Evoys. Edward M'Evoy married Anne Darcy, of Corbetstown. M'Evoy received his primary education at a small school near Corbetstown, and his professional training partly in Dublin, but chiefly at the University of Edinburgh. Career M'Evoy settled in Dublin, and in the year 1775 was appointed surgeon to the Charitable Infirmary, Inns Quay. Owing solely to his abilities, he soon acquired a very large practice, and realised a large fortune, with which he purchased landed property in the counties of Longford and Westmeath. He married Anne Fetherston-Haugh, of Bracklyn Castle, Co. Westmeath. The principal appointments held by M'Evoy were the surgeoncies of the Charitable Infirmary and the Lock Hospital. He was mainly instrumental in having the former removed from Inns Quay to Jervis Street. A marble bust of M'Evoy was placed in that institution as a memorial of his services to it. M'Evoy was very liberal to his patients when they came from Longford, and he made it a point never to accept a fee from a clergyman of any denomination. According to the author of the Metropolis he was a choleric man. As to his great professional skill, even his rivals never questioned it. His florid face and strict discipline led a pupil of the Lock Hospital to play a practical joke upon him. Being a clever artist he executed a highly-coloured picture of M'Evoy in his own prescription-book, of which he managed to gain possession. When M'Evoy opened this book in the presence of the class, he saw in it his portrait, with the words Fieri Facias in large letters written beneath it. Death M'Evoy lived for many years at 9 North Earl Street, and subsequently in Abbey Street, where he died. His grief at the untimely death of his only son Edward - a student in Trinity College - is believed to have hastened his end. He, his wife, and his son, are interred in the old churchyard at Killough, County Westmeath.

He was a minister under the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, dean of the Faculty of Law, and later rector of Diego Portales University. Biography The son of Francisco Javier Cuadra Cornejo ‚Äì lawyer of El Teniente mine ‚Äì and Mar√≠a Cristina Lizana Alvear, Francisco Javier Cuadra spent his childhood and adolescence in his hometown of Rancagua with his brothers Cristi√°n, Juan Pablo, Gonzalo, and Jos√© Miguel. There he studied at the Instituto O'Higgins and then went to university in Santiago: he first entered Adolfo Ib√°√±ez University, where he took five semesters of Commercial Engineering, but after the coup of 1973 he changed to Law at the Pontifical Catholic University, where he received a degree in that discipline. Recently graduated, he worked at the now-defunct Banco Continental, the only one to be the subject of an intervention by the at the time. One of the delegates of this era was , but on 31 January 1983, he was dismissed after a conflict related to the manner in which negotiations with the entity's workers were handled. Public life That same year Cuadra began to work in the Office of Special Affairs of Government ‚Äì which was in charge of relations with the Holy See and which provided political analysis to Pinochet ‚Äì led by Sergio Rill√≥n. To the latter, Pinochet offered the Ministry General Secretariat of Government in November 1984, a post that he refused, but for which he recommended Cuadra, his second-in-command. He thus obtained his first important position in the military dictatorship, which he held from 1984 to 1987. He was then ambassador of Chile to the Holy See until the end of the regime (1987‚Äì1990). After the return to democracy, he devoted himself mainly to the academic field and political analysis. In an interview with the magazine Qu√© Pasa, in its 13 January 1995 issue, Cuadra said that there were \\"parliamentarians and other people who exercise public functions who use drugs.\\" For this he was prosecuted under the , and was eventually sentenced to 540 days in prison. The incident led him to renounce National Renewal (RN), the party to which Andr√©s Allamand had brought him (and in doing so, he had appointed him director of the Liberty Institute). In 2004 Cuadra was appointed rector of Diego Portales University, where he had worked sporadically as a teacher since 1983, and where two of his eight children, Jos√© Francisco and Jos√© Antonio, had studied. On 14 November 2005, he was forced to resign that position due to pressures exerted by certain sectors of Chilean society, especially by the student community of that house of studies. His departure came after some statements Cuadra made to ', in which he claimed that under Pinochet, for whom he was minister, some people were detained - particularly Ricardo Lagos, after the ‚Äì to save them from falling into the hands of the feared Central Nacional de Informaciones (CNI, successor to the DINA). The statements that detentions were made under dictatorship to prevent other repressive agencies from eliminating opponents of the regime meant that those representatives, the authors of such preventive detentions, were aware of the human rights violations that were taking place at that time. Hence, Judge Hugo Dolmestch, who was in charge of the investigation into the killings of four leftist militants committed by the CNI, ordered the interrogation of several of the members of Pinochet's cabinet, including Cuadra. Cuadra was an advisor to Horacio Cartes, elected president of Paraguay in 2013, since he was a precandidate to lead the country for the Colorado Party.

Evenlode is bordered by the Gloucestershire parishes of Moreton-in-Marsh to the northwest, Longborough and Donnington to the west, Broadwell to the southwest, and Adlestrop to the southeast; and by the Oxfordshire parish of Chastleton to the east. Evenlode's northern tip is the Four shire stone, whose name predates the parish's 1931 transfer from Worcestershire; here at a point between Moreton-in-Marsh and Chastleton are the Warwickshire parishes of Little Compton and Great Wolford, as well as Batford in Gloucestershire. At its southern tip, between Broadwell and Adlestrop, Evenlode meets the parish of Oddington at a point. The parish was granted before the 10th century to Worcester Priory, latterly as part of the manor of Blockley; the priory's scattered lands formed many of the detached parts of the County of Worcester.

It was the most accurate large-area survey ever done prior to Global Positioning System surveys. TCT included over 2,700 survey stations, covered over 13,600 miles, and passed through 44 states.The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network, NOAA (page \\"the traverse\\") This nationwide survey increased the accuracy of the existing U.S. survey network. It was also fundamental to the sophisticated mathematical readjustment of the nation's survey network known as the North American Datum of 1983. It was the \\"end of an era\\" as the last conventional, purely terrestrial large scale survey. Forerunner surveys The first major transcontinental survey was the Transcontinental Arc of Triangulation, completed in 1896 along the 39th parallel north with coastal endpoints at Cape May, New Jersey, and Point Arena, California lighthouses. It established the Meades Ranch survey marker, also called the Geodetic Center of the United States.Milestones of the Survey, National Geodetic Survey, June 5, 2017 The Transcontinental Traverse, commonly known as the \\"TCT\\", grew out of smaller surveying projects that the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&GS;) conducted for the U.S. Air Force missile-tracking program in an area near Cape Canaveral, Florida, during the 1960s. C&GS; developed unique specifications for this work that resulted in one part in 1,000,000, exceeding Air Force requirements.Cape Canaveral Triangulation Survey Yields High-Precision Results, NOAA This led C&GS; officials to conclude that applying the same specifications to a nationwide traverse, a surveying method, would dramatically improve the scale of the entire U.S. survey network. Soon after completing its work for the Air Force in Florida in 1961, C&GS; embarked on the TCT. Route and history The Geodimeter electronic distance measurement device was rapidly tested and adopted by national agencies for long-distance mapping. The last base line to be measured with tape happened near Salmon, Idaho in 1958. The survey began in 1961 in Florida and ended in 1976 in Michigan. It crisscrossed North America along three east-west and five north-south corridors. A portion that had been planned to traverse the US-Canada border to Maine was canceled due to advances in satellite geodesy. Equipment and methods Two complete Bilby towers on Transcontinental Traverse The traverse made use of the geodimeter, a lightwave phase electronic distance measurement instrument that had just been invented when the traverse began.The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network, NOAA (page \\"improving distance measurement\\") The instruments were located atop Bilby towers many meters above ground level to avoid obscuring objects and to get a smoother air temperature profile for accuracy.

She was one of the most influential actresses in Chinese cinema, and was named as one of the four great actresses in Hong Kong in 1949. She received the official recognition as a \\"movie star of New China\\" in 1962 and two Lifetime Achievement Awards in 2013 and 2017. Over a career spanning more than four decades, she starred in more than 60 films. Career = Republican era = Wang in the film New Fisherman's Song (1942) Wang was born on 23 August 1924 in Shanghai. Her birth name was Wang Yufeng (). When she was a 16-year-old middle school student, she was discovered by the director, Zhu Shilin, and debuted in a supporting role in the 1941 film The Dragon Dungeon and Tiger's Den. Zhu then cast her as the leading actress in his 1942 film New Fisherman's Song, a remake of the silent classic, Song of the Fishermen, starring Wang Renmei. It was a great box- office success and launched Wang Danfeng to stardom. She appeared in two dozen films in the 1940s, and her typical roles were abused or persecuted women. One of her favourite roles was Xue Baochai in the 1944 film Dream of the Red Chamber, in which she co-starred with her idol, Zhou Xuan, and worked under the famous director Bu Wancang. The film greatly enhanced her self-esteem. In 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Wang moved to British Hong Kong at the invitation of the Great Wall Movie Enterprises and starred in six films with the studio. In July 1949, she was named by Hong Kong media as one of the four great actresses, together with Li Li-hua, Zhou Xuan, and Bai Guang. =People's Republic of China= Wang Danfeng After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, she returned to Shanghai in 1951 to marry her long-time fianc√©, Liu Heqing (Êü≥ÂíåÊ∏Ö). Their wedding was a media sensation in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 1952, the Communist government reorganized film companies in Shanghai into the state-owned Shanghai Film Studio, and Wang acted in ten films for the studio before the Cultural Revolution. One of her most celebrated roles was the young nurse in A Nurse's Diary. The scene of her humming the song, \\"The Little Swallow\\", to put a baby to sleep is widely remembered decades later. Roman Tam, the iconic Cantopop singer who called Wang his idol, said he watched the film three times and memorized the song. In 1963, she portrayed the patriotic courtesan Li Xiangjun in the film, The Peach Blossom Fan, which was directed by Sun Jing. It was soon denounced as a tribute to the \\"feudal\\" scholar and beauty genre, and Wang, Sun, and the lead actor Feng Zhe were all persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. She was sent to perform hard labour in the countryside, and was prevented from acting for 15 years. She survived the tumultuous period largely unscathed, however, partly because the film was not labelled a \\"giant poisonous weed\\". After the end of the Cultural Revolution, she made a comeback attempt and appeared in several films from 1978 to 1980, but they were mostly unsuccessful. She retired in 1980, after portraying a Japanese scientist in her last film, The Jade-Colored Butterfly. She was invited to, and attended, the second inauguration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1985. In 2013, the China Film Performance Art Academy awarded Wang the Golden Phoenix Lifetime Achievement Award. In June 2017, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 20th Shanghai International Film Festival. She was described as a \\"legendary\\" actress and \\"film icon\\" in official Chinese media.  Personal life  Wang in the 1940s Wang had a lifelong marriage with Liu Heqing, who was the son of Liu Zhongliang (Êü≥‰∏≠‰∫Æ), a co-founder of Shanghai's Cathay Film Company. They wedded on New Year's Day of 1951 and the marriage lasted for more than 65 years, until Liu's death on 4 February 2016 at age 90. They had four daughters. Wang and her husband moved to Hong Kong in the late 1980s and opened the vegetarian restaurant, Gong De Lin (also known as Godly). After they turned 80, they sold the successful business and returned to Shanghai. Death On the morning of 2 May 2018, Wang died at Huadong Hospital in Shanghai, aged 93 (94 by East Asian age reckoning).

Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court,. which held that the different treatment of men and women mandated by 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 402(f)(1)(D). constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees, and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case was brought by a widower who was denied survivor benefits on the grounds that he had not been receiving at least one-half support from his wife when she died. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court, ruling unconstitutional the provision of the Social Security Act which set forth a gender-based distinction between widows and widowers, whereby Social Security Act survivors benefits were payable to a widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from his late wife, while such benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband were payable to his widow regardless of dependency. The Court found that this distinction deprived female wage earners of the same protection that a similarly situated male worker would have received, violating due process and equal protection.  Background  Leon Goldfarb, a widower in the state of New York, applied for survivor benefits under the Social Security Act. Leon Goldfarb's late wife had worked as a secretary for New York City public schools for nearly twenty-five years and paid all of her social security taxes until her death in 1968. Upon his wife's death, Leon Goldfarb applied for survivor benefits but was denied. The relevant statute, 42 U.S.C ¬ß 402(f)(1)(D), mandated that surviving widowers must meet the burden of proving that they had been receiving over half of their financial support from their wives. The law made no such requirement for widows, who would be provided survivor benefits regardless of their dependency on their husbands. Goldfarb challenged the constitutionality of the statute in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He was represented by Nadine H. Taub, Rutgers Law School professor and attorney at the Women's Rights Litigation Clinic of Rutgers Law School- Newark and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. The lower court ruled in Goldfarb's favor, holding that the provision of the Social Security Act that denied benefits to widowers was unconstitutional as discriminating against widowers on the basis of sex. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. Goldfarb was represented by future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who at the time was co- founder and general counsel of the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. This case was one of several gender discrimination cases that Ginsburg successfully argued in front of the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976. Similar to her arguments in Frontiero v. Richardson, Ginsburg argued in her brief that a reliance on gender stereotypes which served to devalue women's roles as breadwinners constituted gender-based discrimination in violation of equal protection. She argued that the social security statute in question \\"assume[d] gainful employment as a domain in which men come first, women second,\\" and that the statute favored \\"one type of marital unit over another.\\"  Court Decision  In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court. Justice Brennan's opinion, which was joined by Justice White, Justice Marshall, and Justice Powell, determined that the gender-based distinction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court agreed with Ginsburg's arguments, noting that the distinction in the federal requirements \\"deprive[s] women of protection for their families which men receive as a result of their employment.\\" The Court based its decision on the precedent established in prior cases Frontiero and Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld: > Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, like the instant case, presented the question in > the context of the [Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance] program. > There the Court held unconstitutional a provision that denied father's > insurance benefits to surviving widowers with children in their care, while > authorizing similar mother's benefits to similarly situated widows... > Precisely the same reasoning condemns the gender-based distinction made by ¬ß > 402(f)(1)(D) in this case. For that distinction, too, operates ‚Äòto deprive > women of protection for their families which men receive as a result of > their employment‚Äô: social security taxes were deducted from Hannah > Goldfarb's salary during the quarter century she worked as a secretary, yet, > in consequence of ¬ß 402(f)(1)(D), she also ‚Äònot only failed to receive for > her (spouse) the same protection which similarly situated male worker would > have received (for his spouse) but she also was deprived of a portion of her > own earnings in order to contribute to the fund out of which benefits would > be paid to others.‚Äô The Court rejected the government's argument that the Court should focus solely on the distinction drawn between widowers and widows, based on the notion that the statute discriminates not against the covered wage earning female, but rather against her surviving widower, who was burdened with proof of dependency. The Court disagreed, stating that Mrs. Goldfarb \\"worked and paid social security taxes... at the same rate as her male colleagues\\" yet received narrower insurance protection than a male colleague. The Court found that this distinction requires the equal protection challenge in the case to focus on the gender-based discrimination against women and not only the distinction between widowers and widows. Based on an examination of the legislative history of the statute, the Court found that there existed \\"an intention to aid the dependent spouses of deceased wage earners, coupled with a presumption that wives are usually dependent\\" in the statute. Rejecting the \\"archaic and overbroad\\" generalizations that a wife is more likely to be dependent on her husband than a husband on his wife, the Court concluded that these presumptions cannot justify a gender-based discrimination when distributing employment-related benefits. = Justice Stevens‚Äô concurrence = Justice Stevens wrote in concurrence with the majority. Rejecting that the rationale behind the statutory scheme was justifiably based on administrative convenience or based on a 'policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden,' he concurs with the Court's judgment as to the lack of justification for the disparate treatment of genders, but is \\"persuaded that the relevant discrimination in this case is against surviving male spouses, rather than against deceased female wage earners.\\" = Justice Rehnquist's Dissent = In his dissent, which was joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart and Justice Blackmun, Rehnquist disagreed that the classification was discriminatory. Rehnquist argued that Congress' purpose in adopting these provisions for dependency was \\"to avoid the burden and expense of specific case-by-case determination in the large number of cases where dependency is objectively probable.\\" Because of the likelihood that a widow would be dependent on her husband, and not the other way around, Rehnquist argued that such a justifiably rational basis is permissible under the Fifth Amendment for the purpose of aiding administrative functions.  Implications  This ruling required an amendment to the Social Security Act in order to eliminate the burden of proof for widowers. The new language provided equal protection for both genders.

The New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NYSAOWS) was an American anti-suffrage organization in New York. The group was made up of prominent women who fought against the cause of women's suffrage by giving speeches, handing out materials and pamphlets and also publishing a journal. There were several auxiliaries of the group throughout New York and it was considered one of the most active anti-suffrage groups in the state.  History  The New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NYSAOWS) was one of the most active women's anti-suffrage groups in the state of New York. The group was first known as the New York State Association Opposed to the Extension of the Suffrage to Women and was formed in April 1895. The name was changed sometime between October 27, 1908 and November 4, 1908. The group had many \\"prominent\\" women from New York as members. There were several auxiliary organizations in different parts of the state, including in Albany, Brooklyn and Buffalo. Dues were taken from each member, starting at $3 per person. The president of the organization would bring together the executive committee every year, either in December or April. Officers would be elected and reports on their previous years' activities would be shared. The report would also include information about women's suffrage efforts across the country. The group met at the home of Mrs. George Phillips (Mary E. Phillips) for many years, but in October 1908 opened an office in the Engineering Societies Building. In July 1908, NYSAOWS started a quarterly journal called The Anti-Suffragist which was published through April 1912. NYSAOWS members believed that women participating in politics would be \\"disruptive of everything pertaining to home life.\\" They also felt that women's roles as mothers and caregivers meant they did not have to do \\"further service\\" as citizens. Overall, the members believed that more people were on their side and all they had to do was help \\"women to recognize the vital need for 'a division of the world's work between men and women.'\\" In 1896, NYSAOWS believed that only 10% of women actually wanted the vote. NYSAOWS also used tactics such as associating women's suffrage with \\"support for socialist causes.\\" The group would receive requests for information, advice or assistance from women in other states. They also sent petitions to the New York State Assembly, asking them not to grant suffrage to women. The association drew large crowds, like the one at Glens Falls City Hall in February 1915, when NYSAOWS president, Alice Hill Chittenden, spoke. Petition from Women Voters Anti-Suffrage Party of New York to the Senate, 1917 After women in New York won the right to vote in 1917, NYSAOWS reorganized to work towards the repeal of women's suffrage. They also decided to fight against a country-wide granting of women's suffrage. After the 19th Amendment passed, the Brooklyn Auxiliary of the NYSAOWS met in the home of Carolyn Putnam (Mrs. W.A Putnam) to discuss working against the federal amendment. NYSAOWS eventually decided to transition into a new organization, the Women Voters' Anti-Suffrage Party.  Presidents  Several women served as presidents of the group.

Prior to playing professionally, Bart played college baseball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. In 2018, he led the Atlantic Coast Conference in batting average and won the Johnny Bench Award, which honors college baseball's best catcher. The Giants chose him with the second overall pick of the 2018 MLB draft, and that year he led the Northwest League in slugging percentage. He made his MLB debut in August 2020. Amateur career Bart attended Buford High School in Buford, Georgia. He became the starting catcher for the school's baseball team in his freshman year. He had a .556 on-base percentage and a .859 slugging percentage in his junior year, but was pitched around by opposing teams in his senior year, decreasing his performance. Buford HS won the Georgia Class 4A State Championship his senior year going 34-2 and finishing ranked as 8th in the MaxPreps National Poll. The Tampa Bay Rays selected Bart in the 27th round of the 2015 MLB draft, but he opted not to sign. Bart enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology to play college baseball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. After his freshman year in 2016, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He was named to the Johnny Bench Award watch list in his sophomore year, but he missed the last 11 games of his sophomore season with a broken finger. Following his sophomore season, he played for the United States national collegiate baseball team, and returned briefly to the CCBL to play with the Harwich Mariners. In 2018, his junior year, Bart had a .359 batting average, the best in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and a .632 slugging percentage, the second-highest in the ACC, and a .471 on base percentage, third-highest in the conference, along with 16 triples (5th) and 55 runs (9th). He was named to the Golden Spikes Award watch list, and was named the Atlantic Coast Conference's Baseball Player of the Year. Bart also won the Johnny Bench Award. Minor leagues Considered a top prospect in the 2018 MLB draft, the San Francisco Giants selected Bart with the second overall pick. He signed with the Giants for $7,025,000, the largest signing bonus ever for a position player. Due to the layoff following the college season, the Giants sent Bart to their Scottsdale, Arizona, facility, before assigning him to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. In 45 games and 181 at bats for Salem-Keizer, Bart slashed .298/.369/.613 (leading the Northwest League) with 13 home runs (3rd) and 39 RBIs (5th), as he also was second in the league with 9 hit-by-pitch. He was named an NWL mid- season All Star, a NWL post-season All Star, a Baseball America Short-Season All Star, and a 2018 MiLB.com Organization All Star. The Giants invited Bart to spring training as a non-roster player in 2019. Bart began the 2019 season with the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced California League. He broke his hand on a hit by pitch on April 15 and was on the injured list until June 4. Bart was named to the 2019 All-Star Futures Game. In August, the Giants promoted Bart to the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League, with whom he finished the year. Over 79 games and 313 at bats between the two clubs, Bart slashed .278/.328/.495 with 16 home runs and 48 RBIs. He played in the Arizona Fall League for the Scottsdale Scorpions following the season, for whom he batted .333 (7th in the league)/.524 (leading the league)/.767 (leading the league) with four home runs (2nd) and 10 RBIs in 30 at bats, and was named a \\"Rising Star\\". He was named a 2019 MiLB.com Organization All Star. The Giants again invited Bart to spring training in 2020. Major leagues He was promoted to the major leagues on August 20. He made his debut that night against the Los Angeles Angels and got his first career hit, a double, off of Julio Teher√°n. Bart recorded an extra-base hit in each of his first three career games, only the third Giants player to do so since at least 1901.

Porter The Porter Garden Telescope was an innovative ornamental telescope for the garden designed by Russell W. Porter and commercialized by Jones & Lamson Machine Company at the beginning of the 1920s in the United States. Oriented to users with high purchasing power, and constructed in statuary bronze, it could be left permanently outdoors like sculptures and sundials, keeping the delicate optics in a case. It was embellished with floral ornament, with a style close to the art nouveau. In its base were the names of celebrated astronomers: Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. The part called the bowl bore the commercial logo \\"The Porter Garden Telescope\\", the name and address of the manufacturer, the serial number of manufacture, and the number and date of the patent.  Technical characteristics  * Material of construction: Bronze. Patent US1651412 (pag.1) of The Porter Garden Telescope (refractor version) by Russell W. Porter * Reflecting telescope, Newtonian type. * Without tube that wrap the optics. * Mount: Combination of altazimuth (terrestrial use) and equatorial type horseshoe (astronomical use). * Able to follow the movement of the apparent place of the stars, when it is used between the latitudes 25¬∫-55¬∫ of both hemispheres north and south. * Primary mirror of 6 inches (6\\": roughly 152mm). * Focal relation f/4. * Prism of 1.5 inches as secondary reflecting element. * The eyepieces provided give magnifications of 25x, 50x and 100x. * The arm that holds the eyepiece spins freely around the optical axis, allowing the user to adapt it to his comfort during the observation. * Optional: Dual eyepiece holder for simultaneous use of two users.  History  Russell W. Porter designed the telescope starting from previous concepts that he had explored before, with the idea of simplifying and reducing to the minimum the times of transport, assembly, setup and disassembly of conventional personal telescopes. By making a telescope that could stay outdoors permanently, he maximized observing time. On the other hand, it brought together his dream of promoting astronomy among the uninitiated, by embellishing its form to make it attractive to the public, but without endangering the robustness of bronze. Beginners could manipulate it without fear. Patent US1651412 (pag.2) of The Porter Garden Telescope (refractor version) by Russell W. Porter He presented the application of patent on 25 January 1922 and was conceded the same on 25 September 1923 under number US1468973. However, the final model differed of the aforementioned patent in the zone of the base, since there were later modifications of design that were collected in a new patent for a refracting telescope version. Although it presented the application some months after the first, 7 September 1922, it was conceded years later, on 6 December 1927 under number US1651412 but it was never manufactured. The primary mirror was mechanized by J&L.Mac.Co;, with the final parabolized handmade, and the specular surface of the glass was obtained by silvering. They offered to resilver at nominal cost, although they claimed that it would not be necessary to do it in years since its lacquered was tested outdoors during the rigour of one winter of Vermont without appreciating deterioration. The rest of the optics, prism and ocular, were supplied by John A. Brashear Co. The election of a prism like a secondary element was usual in the period, previous to the first aluminized optics in vacuum chambers, and deleted the need of maintenance of a second silvering specular surface. It was commercialized during a pair of years (1923-1924), with the publication of articles in skilled press and announcements in magazines of decoration and gardening, but since its price without pedestal was equal to a car Ford Model-T of the time, that saturated the market for which it was oriented with the sale of around 100 units. Other influential factors in the decommission of the product were: the few customer understanding of how to use the equatorial mount for astronomical use, initial underestimation of the costs of production (sale price changed from $250 to $400) and the own art nouveau style of the sculpture in full tendency of the art deco style. Years later, in 1936, during the collaboration of Russell W. Porter in the design of the Palomar Observatory and the Hale Telescope, which was the largest effective telescope in the world during 45 years, he requested the assignment of using the original patent to J&L.Mac.Co.; to be able to implement the horseshoe type mount in that project, obtaining it without obstacles.  Miscellanea  * On 10 September 1923 Russell W. Porter could show to his acquaintances the partial eclipse of sun, using the sundial function of the telescope and taking advantage to be able to spin freely the arm that held the eyepiece around the optical axis to project comfortably the image of the sun on a cardboard. * On 29 June 1925 one copy survived to the earthquake of Santa Barbara, showing its profit like sundial since the clocks stopped affected by the seism. * Exactly ten years after its original presentation in the magazine Scientific American, in 1933 in that magazine an only announcement in which they offered copies manufactured by Donald Alden Patch was published . Don Patch, acquaintance of Russell W. Porter and also member of Springfield Telescope Makers, had already made previously a Springfield type mount making the castings from the original design of Mr. Porter and maybe could have access to molds of the discontinued telescope. It is unknown how many of those could make or sell, but it exists proof of at least a possible copy that amalgamated pieces apparently genuine and parts adapted and re-designed to obtain a functional telescope that reminded the original. * The copy with higher numbering that has survived until the present and that it has transcended publicly is the number 54. It was exposed in Longwood Gardens and was re-discovered in 2012 under the staircase of a barn.  See also  * List of The Porter Garden Telescope original copies * Russell W.

It is the oldest bridge over the lower course of the river Main, and until 1886 it was the only stone bridge crossing the river. From the Middle Ages until the year 1914, it connected the \\"Fahrgasse\\" in Frankfurt Altstadt with the \\"Br√ºckenstra√üe\\" in Sachsenhausen. Since its first mention in official documents in 1222, the development of Frankfurt has been strongly influenced by the bridge. Over the centuries, Alte Br√ºcke has been destroyed and reconstructed at least 18 times. With its 13 brick-built circular arches, the Sachsenhausen Bridge was one of the most prominent buildings of the city, but failing to meet the increasing demands of the modern road and ship traffic, it was demolished in 1914. The current Alte Br√ºcke, sometimes called \\"Neue Alte Br√ºcke\\" (German: \\"new old bridge\\"), was inaugurated on 15 August 1926 by then- Lord-Mayor Ludwig Landmann. Two of its originally eight red sandstone-lined vaults were blown up by German soldiers on 26 March 1945. After an initial provisional reconstruction, the middle part of the bridge was replaced by a steel through truss bridge and placed in operation again on 15 September 1965. In 2006, the Alte Br√ºcke received a new porticus, which resembles a watermill that had historically been present at the bridge. Today, the view of the bridge is characterized by four portal walls at both sides of the bridge's middle part. These have been built in the course of a complete renovation in 2014. Landmarks of the Alte Br√ºcke are the \\"Brickegickel\\" and a statue of Charlemagne, mythical founder of the city.  History  = 11th ‚Äì 14th century = The oldest depiction of the Alte Br√ºcke, from the \\"Bedebuch\\" of 1405 Originally there was a ford (German: Furt) near the Alte Br√ºcke, possibly slightly downstream near the de:Frankfurt Fahrtor, giving the city its name. It is unclear exactly when the first bridge between Frankfurt and Sachsenhausen was built. Sachsenhausen's first mention in historic records was in 1193. The first known mention of the bridge was in 1222 in the records of Frankfurt Cathedral, referring to a \\"burgage plot at the bridge\\" (\\"Hofst√§tte an der Br√ºcke\\") belonging to a magistrate named Nikolaus. However, the bridge might be older than this: Chronicler Achilles Augustus von Lersner, who lived in Frankfurt, wrote at the beginning of the 18th century: In the 19th century the historian Johann Georg Battonn said: This assumption is now considered to be improbable. The oldest medieval stone bridge, the Drususbr√ºcke in Bingen, was built in the 11th century. Larger stone bridges like those in Regensburg, Prag and W√ºrzburg were built after the 12th century. This indicates that the bridge in Frankfurt was actually built of wood in the 11th century or the early 12th century, as stated by von Lersner, and that it was rebuilt after 1192 ‚Äî possibly on the orders of Ministeralis Kuno von M√ºnzenberg, who owned large properties on both sides of the river. The rebuilt bridge, according to earliest documents, was built partly of wood, with pillars made of stone. A \\"stone bridge\\" in the Frankfurt region does not appear in historical documents until 1276. In the 1920s, a row of oak poles became visible at low water level upstream of the bridge. This led to speculation that the poles were from an old Roman bridge. However, it is more likely that these poles were of medieval origin and had been used for fishing or flood protection. During the 12th and 13th century, Frankfurt grew to one of the most important trading centres of the Holy Roman Empire, not least because of the importance of its bridge, which for centuries was a major part of the north-south travel route of the Main region. On 10 May 1235, King Henry (VII) of Germany granted substantial privileges to the citizens of the city. Half of the Frankfurt coin revenue, and timber from the royal hunting forest of Wildbann Dreieich, was assigned to the maintenance of the bridge. There is also document from 1300, in which 15 Italian bishops promised indulgences to those who supported the maintenance of Alte Br√ºcke with their donations. In the 14th century the bridge was destroyed by floods and melting ice many times: The two bridge towers were mentioned for the first time in this report. On 22 July 1342, the most severe flood in Central Europe up to that date occurred. It is known as the St. Mary Magdalene's flood. In the course of the flood, the 1338 Chapel of St. Catherine and a bridge tower collapsed. These were both on the Sachsenhausen side of the Main, which was more strongly exposed to the water currents. Between the time of the flood until the Reformation, in the 16th century, an atonement procession from the Alte Br√ºcke to the Wei√üfrauenkirche church was held annually on 22 July.Lersner, Chronica, S. 532f. = 15th ‚Äì 18th century = The Frankfurt Bridge on the besiegement plan of 1552 The Frankfurt Bridge on the Merian plan of 1628 In the beginning of the 15th century, 10 of the 13 bridge arches as well as the two bridge towers were fundamentally renovated. The accountable architect might have been Madern Gerthener, who personally vouched for the safety of the vaults and arches in front of the (city?) council on 30 November 1399. On a hiking trip in Prague, Gerthener learned about the Charles Bridge, which had been built shortly before by Peter Parler. The oldest depiction of this bridge comes from 1405: It is shown in stylized form in the \\"Bedebuch\\" (burnt in World War II), with the two towers, three arches and the crucifix of the Brickegickel. The oldest complete drawing can be found in the Cosmographia of Sebastian M√ºnster, as a part of the birds-eye view of Frankfurt, in the second issue from 1550. It is a woodcut which itself is dated 1545. Shortly thereafter, in 1552, another depiction appeared on the so-called \\"Belagerungsplan\\" (besiegement plan) of Conrad Faber von Creuznach, who had already sketched the bridge in the background of his double portrait of Anna and Gilbrecht von Holzhausen in 1535. It shows the bridge during the three-week besiegement of the Protestant city by an army of the Protestant prince, under lead of the Prince-elector Maurice, Elector of Saxony in the summer of 1552, when it was defended by the Imperial Army. During this time, the bridge had been covered by cloths, and the Main had been rendered impassable by sunken ships and an iron chain. The besiegement started on 17 July and ended with the conclusion of the Peace of Passau contract on 2 August. For the city, the loyalty to the imperator paid off well: Beginning with 1562, all coronations of the Holy Roman Emperor took place in Frankfurt. In the early 17th century, the last wooden pillar of the bridge, located north of the bridge mill, was replaced by a stone equivalent. However, the ceiling of the bridge still consisted of wooden bars which could be removed quickly to prevent passing of the bridge. The bridge had a width of 31 feet (about 9 m), including the bridge parapet made of stone, which had been one foot wide each. The highest arch, when the water level was at a normal state, was about 30 feet (8.50 m) above the water; the other arches had been 2‚Äì3 feet lower in comparison. The horizontal clearance below the bridge, between two arches, had been between 7.50 m and 9 m. The street on top of the bridge was only about 4.70 m wide, just enough to allow passing of two vehicles next to each other. The footpaths had been so small that they had to be declared one-way paths: pedestrians had to take the path on the right side, relative to their walking direction. In the Thirty Years' War, as well, the bridge had been the stage of a shooting war. In August 1635, imperial troops attacked Swedes who had occupied Sachsenhausen and entrenched themselves in the bridge mill as well as in the Sachsenhausen bridge tower. During the fight, the bridge mill caught fire. It was later replaced by two new buildings. The Alte Br√ºcke before its reconstruction in the 18th century, seen towards the West, 1728 (Kupferstich von Georg Daniel Heumann nach Zeichnung von Salomon Kleiner) At the end of the 17th, and at the beginning of the 18th century, the material condition of the bridge became increasingly worse over time. Again and again, floods and melted ice hit the bridge and damaged it, and repair attempts did not completely fix the problems. In 1739, the council mandated that the bridge must not be burdened with more than 50 hundredweight at a time. This measure did not prevent a collapse of the bridge's cross arch on 16 December 1739, which also caused the Brickegickel to be lost. The two adjacent arches, the \\"Fl√∂√üerbogen\\" and the \\"Aussch√ºttbogen\\", used to toss garbage into the Main, have also been severely damaged. The council then decided to completely rebuild the bridge. The construction was to be managed by Johann Friedrich von Uffenbach. Firstly, a temporary wooden bridge was created, which stood in good stead during the coronation of emperor Charles VII. The foundation for the new stone bridge was laid on 18 September 1741; the keystone was set on 14 September 1744. In 1748, the bridge was paved; afterwards, it received a representative sandstone parapet. The portals on the path down to the Main island have been decorated by sandstone reliefs of the river god Moenus, and by two Kanonesteppels, a caricaturesque depiction of two artillerists. The relief was lost in World War II. On 27 February 1784, the bridge was again damaged by melted ice. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, on 31 October 1813, French troops, supposed to be defending the city, engaged in a violent battle against Bavarian and Austrian soldiers, who approached the bridge from Sachsenhausen. Again, both bridge mills became victims of the flames. The French troops were forced to retreat, but managed to escape from being chased by the allied troops by removing the wooden bars over the two middle bridge arches, rendering the bridge impassable one more time. In 1840, the bridge arches were finally connected by stones. = 19th century = Alte Br√ºcke, 1845 (Steel engraving by Jakob Ludwig August Buhl after a draft by Jakob F√ºrchtegott Dielmann) Alte Br√ºcke around 1885 Alte Br√ºcke on the Ravenstein plan, 1861 Unchanged by the rebuilding, the bridge still had a disadvantageous proportion of the opening width of the arches (172.17 m) compared to the complete bridge length of 264.87 metres. This caused ice jams upstream of the bridge in almost every winter. As an attempt to solve the problem, ice breakers had been added to the bridge pillars, but these turned out to be a collision danger for passing ships and were subsequently removed. Further complicating the situation, the small, long arch passages stood slightly angular to the direction of the water current, causing strong turbulences. Kolks and underminings lead to recurring damage to the bridge. Reports of the city construction manager Johann Friedrich Christian Hess from the years 1816 to 1844 noted the desolate state of the bridge pillars, and mentioned cracks with sizes up to 10 inches (0.25 m) each. Maintenance attempts of the persistently damaged bridge in the years 1825 to 1859 caused construction costs of about 230,000 Guilders.Volker R√∂del: Ingenieurbaukunst in Frankfurt am Main 1806‚Äì1914, Societ√§ts-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 1983, , S. 170f. In 1848, a second bridge, the Main-Neckar Railway, was built over the Main. In 1869, the \\"Eiserner Steg\\", a pedestrian bridge, followed. Nevertheless, the Main bridge, now called the \\"Alte Br√ºcke\\" (old bridge), turned out to be unsuitable to meet the rising demand caused by increasing amounts of street traffic. Since 1859, there had been plans to increase the width of the bridge. In 1865, first plans for a complete reconstruction with 8 instead of 13 arches, and a bridge width of 14 m, have been made. These plans even included a possible removal of the Main island. When the Free City of Frankfurt was annexed by Preu√üen in 1866, the bridge became property of the Prussian state. The reconstruction plans were temporarily paused; instead of a reconstruction of the Alte Br√ºcke, new two bridges were built: The \\"Untermainbr√ºcke\\", downstream, in 1874 and the \\"Obermainbr√ºcke\\", upstream, in 1878. The latter bridge is named \\"Ignatz-Bubis-Br√ºcke\\" as of today. In the 1880s, the Main was channelized, increasing the water level by about two metres. Between 1908 and 1910, the \\"Osthafen\\" (east harbour) emerged. Now, at the latest, the Alte Br√ºcke had become a traffic impediment for the number of ships passing through the bridge. Encouraged by a consortium from Offenbach, consisting of Weintraut (Councillor of Commerce), Weymann (banker) and the Merzbach Bank, a tram way was built. The construction was finished by the Frankfurt-Offenbacher Trambahn-Gesellschaft (FOTG) on 18 Februar 1884, and the route went from Alte Br√ºcke (Sachsenhausen) to the \\"Buchrainstra√üe\\" in Oberrad. It was the first commercially maintained, public electrical tramway in Germany. About two months later, on 10 April 1884, the tramway was extended up to the \\"Mathildenplatz\\" in Offenbach. Back then, the FOTG used a track gauge of 1000 mm (\\"Metre-gauge railway\\"). = 20th century: the \\"new old bridge\\" = The Alte Br√ºcke, seen from the Main wharf, around 1911 (Fotografie von Carl Friedrich Fay) In 1909, the Highways Department of Frankfurt composed a memorandum, summarizing the fundamental points for a reconstruction of the bridge: Reconstruction in the same place, without removing the Main island, and constructed using red sandstone taken from the river. In 1911, an Architectural design competition was announced. One of the participants had been the architect community Franz von Hoven & Hermann von Hoven;Manfred Pohl: Philipp Holzmann ‚Äì Geschichte eines Bauunternehmens 1849‚Äì1899. winners of the competition have been Franz Heberer and Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Leonhardt. On 23 May 1912, on the Main island, the foundation stone for the reconstruction has been laid. The bridge was supposed to have a width of 14 metres, and it was planned to have 8 stone arches. In spring of 1914, a temporary replacement bridge was acquired from Dresden. Over a length of 279 metres, with 15 wooden bridge pillars, this replacement bridge crossed the Main at the west side of the old bridge. On 3 July, the Alte Br√ºcke was closed for street traffic, and the demolition followed immediately. The names of the two last Frankfurt citizens crossing the bridge are known: Mr. Heymann from the \\"Heidestra√üe\\", and innkeeper Effelsberger from the \\"Alter Markt\\" (old market). This event concluded the centuries-old history of the bridge. The construction work on the new bridge, which the city council conference decided to name Kaiserbr√ºcke (emperor bridge), started 1915 on the Sachsenhausen side of the bridge with two piers over the M√ºllermain. However, affected by World War I, the work came to a standstill. On 22 January 1924, the temporary replacement bridge was ripped away by strong molten ice. Subsequently, the city founded a bridge construction society, with lord mayor Georg Voigt as chairman. In June 1924, construction work was resumed; the bridge was now supposed to be called \\"Neue Alte Br√ºcke\\" (\\"new old bridge\\"), and it was planned to have a width of 19 metres. To implement this, the already existing bridge pillars had to be laboriously relocated. In December 1925, the construction work had to be interrupted again because of melting ice. On 15 August 1926, the \\"Neue Alte Br√ºcke\\" could finally be opened by Lord Mayor Ludwig Landmann. In the course of the inauguration of the bridge, on 15 August 1926, Franz Heberer spoke in the name of the architects: The finished bridge had a length of 237.40 metres and a width of 19.5 metres, 11 of which were reserved for the road, and 4 on each side for the sidewalks. The eight arches of the bridge, five over the main river, one on the Main island, and two over the M√ºllermain, had differing widths. The two middle arches had been the widest, with a width of 29.5 metres each. This construction design was a tradeoff between modern traffic capacity and the traditional looks of the bridge. Aerial view of the Alte Br√ºcke after its destruction by German soldiers in 1945 The Neue Alte Br√ºcke only reached an age of 18 years: On 26 March 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, the German Wehrmacht imploded the two large middle arches of the bridge to prevent the approaching Allies from crossing the Main. This did not turn out to be a successful strategy: Within the next three days, soldiers of the United States Army occupied the whole city. Already in the same year, at the end of 1945, a reconstruction of the Alte Br√ºcke was initiated, this time without the naming attribute \\"Neue\\" (\\"new\\"). Out of tank armor plates and other war material, a steel middle part was created for the bridge. It had a maximum load rating of about 24 metric tons. This construction was supported by a broad steel pillar. On 13 September 1947, the Alte Br√ºcke was opened for street traffic again, as the second Main bridge of Frankfurt, after the \\"Eiserner Steg\\". The two middle arches had been imploded in 1945‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and have been replaced by a steel part in 1965. Detail view of the Alte Br√ºcke with new parapets made of sandstone Because the provisional middle part of the bridge was only wide enough for two road lanes, a complete reconstruction of the bridge was soon planned. However, this reconstruction did not happen because of a hefty cost estimation. For this reason, in the middle of the 1960s, it was decided to renovate the bridge instead of completely reconstructing it, hoping to bring an end to the increasing traffic obstructions. Especially since the construction of the wide Kurt-Schumacher-Stra√üe (Kurt Schumacher road), which today is the northern access-road to the bridge, there had often been traffic jams from the bridge up to the inner city. In 1964, to release the traffic burden from Alte Br√ºcke, another bridge was built: The Fl√∂√üerbr√ºcke was constructed, east of the Obermainbr√ºcke. Then, on 1 June 1965, the Alte Br√ºcke was closed. Two new bridge parts, each about 70 metres long and 10 metres wide, were brought via ship between the old main pillars of the bridge. Because of the upcoming International Motor Show, the construction work was finished in record time, allowing a reopening just in time on 16 September 1965. The bridge has five road lanes since this day, and there are currently about 29,000 cars traversing the bridge daily. In 1996, all the damage to the Alte Br√ºcke that had accumulated over time was repaired in a makeshift. In December 2000, the city countil conference mandated a fundamental renovation of the whole bridge. The correlated architect competition of 2001 was won by Christoph M√§ckler, with a design proposal that emphasized the historical elements of the bridge. In 2004, the city countil conference decided to let the renovation start shortly after the 2006 FIFA World Cup.Stadtverordnetenbeschlu√ü vom 15. Juli 2004, ¬ß 7578 However, the construction work was delayed to be synchronized with the reconstruction of the Kurt-Schumacher-Stra√üe (Kurt Schumacher road), avoiding prolonged interference with private transport in the inner city. For some time, the beginning of the work was planned to be in the middle of 2009; the building costs have been estimated in the 2008 city budget plan to be about 29 million Euro.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 17 September 2008 Because the Alte Br√ºcke constitutes the most used bus path of the city, the road was supposed to be prepared for an implementation of tram tracks, to create a tram connection between the Konstablerwache and Sachsenhausen. The existing five traffic lanes, including the turning lanes, were supposed to be preserved, and the bridge was planned to receive separate pedestrian and bicycle paths on both sides. To be able to implement these plans, however, the bridge would have been needed to be broadened. Because in 2013, two kilometres east of the Alte Br√ºcke, another bridge over the Main was planned to be opened, the city parliament decided not to widen the Alte Br√ºcke. Instead, it was decided only to renovate the already existing state of the bridge, for a relatively cheap 4.5 million Euro. The renovation works happened between June and December 2014. In favor of the pedestrian and bicycle paths, the middle fifth lane for left-turning drivers was waived. The bridge received new parapets made of sandstone, and a new lighting equipment.  Development of the Main island and the M√ºllermain  \\"Der M√ºllermain\\", aquarelle painting by Carl Theodor Reiffenstein New \\"Portikus\\" (porticus) on the Main island A noteworthy feature of the Alte Br√ºcke is the Main island, the shape of which has varied over time. On older plans, for example on the plan of Matth√§us Merian from 1628, three smaller islands can be seen above the Alte Br√ºcke, while there is only a shoal visible in the river below the bridge. On city maps of the 18th century, these islands had mostly disappeared. Only in the 19th century, again, on pictures and plans, an island can be seen that is crossed by multiple small canals, sources and drains of the bridge mills. Back then, the Sachsenhausen Main riverside was located considerably more in the south than it is today. The about 20 metres wide upper wharf at the riverside road, and the 23 metres wide lower wharf had not been created before 1880; until then, the Main river reached up to the front of the first houses. Upside of the bridge, the Sachsenhausen city wall touched the river. The river branch between the island and the Sachsenhausen riverside are called \\"M√ºllermain\\" (\\"miller Main\\") today, because it carried the river water to the two bridge mills and the Sachsenhausen Mill in the south. In the course of the construction of the Neue Alte Br√ºcke (\\"new old bridge\\"), the Main island has been consolidated as well. Today, it has a length of about 300 metres, and a width of about 30 metres, and is separated by the bridge in an upper island and a lower island. The area is densely vegetated with populars and willows, and it constitutes a breeding habitat for numerous aquatic birds. Furthermore, it is an important resting place for migratory birds. For these reasons, the island is not open to the public. It is not legally designated as a nature conservation area, but the municipal authorities of Frankfurt have pledged on 23 June 1977 to treat it like a nature conservation area. The narrow M√ºllermain is closed to normal ship traffic because of its low water depth. Some floating jetties exist, only for sport boats. On the Main island, between 2005 and 2006, an exhibition hall for contemporary art, called \\"Neuer Portikus\\" (\\"new porticus\\"), was constructed on the west side of the bridge. The solid brick building with a steep gable roof and a pointed gable towards the bridge has been designed by Christoph M√§ckler, who also created the 2014 renovation plan for the Alte Br√ºcke. The building name \\"Neuer Portikus\\" is derived from the porticus in front of the old city library at the Obermainbr√ºcke (\\"upper Main bridge\\"). At this place, in a hall, art has been exhibited until the library was rebuilt from 2003 to 2005. East of the Alte Br√ºcke, architect M√§ckler had conceptualized another building, with a height of 30 metres. It was supposed to have a passageway at the bottom, for members of the rowing club, and it was planned to include a restaurant and four freehold flats above. This project was disputed, however, because it would have bulldozed a nearly untouched natural area in the middle of the city, and because it would have endangered multiple trees and a breeding site of numerous birds. Furthermore, according to a citizens' initiative, the initially meant not-for-profit project had become a \\"private investors' dream\\" with construction costs of 4 million Euro. After the citizens' initiative had collected over 6,000 signatures and multiple opposition factions had filed motions against the construction, the governing parties CDU und Alliance 90/The Greens released a joint press statement against the project, bringing the issue off the table.  Structures on the Alte Br√ºcke  = Bridge towers = The two bridge towers are mentioned the first time in historical documents of 1306, when the towers had been destroyed by flood and melting ice. In 1342, the Sachsenhausen tower became a victim of flood again, but was reconstructed promptly. Its attic was decorated with five small towerlets. In 1729, it received a turret clock. The Frankfurt bridge tower was decorated with plentiful paintings: In 1392, the passageway was painted with a fresco of Jesus' passion; around 1500, the city council decided to supplement it with a so-called Judensau. Despite protests by the Jewish community, this testimony of public antisemitism stayed in place until the tower was demolished; it even was renewed multiple times. On the south side (the bridge side), since 1502, the tower facade bore a sundial and a Reichsadler; on the north side (the city side) it showed an eagle. The same situation has been preserved until today on the Eschenheimer Turm. In 1610, painter Philipp Uffenbach added an illustration of the \\"Br√ºckenfreiheit\\" (\\"bridge freedom\\", see below). The gates of the bridge towers were closed at night, preventing anyone from passing the bridge during the night. Because the Frankfurt bridge tower was constructed earlier than the other tower, it was also called the Alter Br√ºckenturm (\\"old bridge tower\\"). It served as a dungeon, and in 1693 the torture infrastructure was moved from the \\"Katharinenpforte\\" to this tower. In 1616, the heads of Vincenz Fettmilch and three other leaders of the \\"Fettmilch-Aufstand\\" (\\"Fettmilch riot\\") were exhibited at the south side of the tower. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe reported in \\"Dichtung und Wahrheit\\" that these heads still hung there 150 years later. One of the heads even persisted until the final deconstruction of the tower in 1801. The Sachsenhausen bridge tower had already been demolished in 1769. Following its example, the large townhall tower, the \\"Langer Franz\\" (\\"tall Franz\\") was constructed at the beginning of the 20th century. = Bridge mills = Pumping station on the Alte Br√ºcke (1882) In 1411, the first mill was constructed on the bridge. It was by far the largest and most significant mill of Frankfurt. During the previously mentioned combat in 1635 between Swedish and Imperial troops, the mill was destroyed. In its place, two slightly smaller mills were constructed: One to the west, in Sachsenhausen's direction, and one to the east, towards Frankfurt. These mills, too, had to be reconstructed multiple times, for example after a lightning strike-induced fire in 1718. In 1852, the westerly mill was torn down, and at the same position, a steam engine pumping station was constructed from 1856 to 1858 to provide Main water for the Sachsenhausen horticulture. Already in 1890, the pumping station was put out of service and deconstructed. The eastern mill stood until 1914, then it was demolished together with the whole bridge. Two citizens had been born inside the mills; they have been called Gickelb√ºrger (\\"rooster citizens\\", see below). = Chapel of St. Catherine = Parts of St. Catherine's Church, salvaged 1866 and 1878, photo from 1880 Already in the beginning of the 14th century, there was a small chapel on the bridge, probably built of wood, which was destroyed by the 1306 flood. In 1322, Albrecht von der Hofstatt mentioned a \\"new chapel\\" at the Sachsenhausen bridge tower in his testament. Not before 1338, the beautiful and richly decorated chapel was finished, and consecrated to Catherine of Alexandria, patron saint of the mariners, on 27 September 1338. Only four years later, in 1342, the chapel was destroyed by St. Mary Magdalene's flood and was not reconstructed. A few years later, Patrician Wicker Frosch donated Katharinenkirche to the Innenstadt. In 1866 and 1878, during construction works, well-preserved remains of this chapel have actually been found at the place described by the written historical sources. = Other structures = The Rattenh√§uschen (\\"rat cottage\\") existed between 1499 and 1569 on a pillar on the east side of the bridge. In the 15th century, rats had grown out of control in the city. The warden in the Rattenh√§uschen, named the \\"Rattenmesser\\" (\\"rat cutter\\"), paid one Heller for every killed rat, cut off its tail as a kind of receipt, and threw the rest of the body into the Main. To finance this project, the punitive damages that Jews had to pay for crossing the bridge were used. However, this did apparently cause some citizens to start breeding rats as an unconventional income method, and the rat house was repurposed as a powder magazine in 1569. On the west side of the bridge, north of the non-vaulted pillar, two public convenience stations called the \\"Heimliche Gemache\\" (\\"hidden chambers\\") existed for men and women; they have been mentioned in historical documents back to the 15th century and had been donated by the city council. During the course of the 19th century, Rowing became a popular sport. With the \\"Frankfurter Ruder-Verein von 1865\\" (\\"Frankfurt rowing club of 1865\\"), the first rowing community in German midland was founded on 28 July 1865. Beginning in 1871, they hosted the first international Regatta on the Main. Since then the club has also had a presence on the Main island. The boathouse between two pillars of the Alte Br√ºcke has been constructed in its current form in 1948. = Charlemagne statue = Statue of Charlemagne on the Alte Br√ºcke. Painting by Jakob F√ºrchtegott Dielmann, around 1845 Statue of Charlemagne, 2016 On 23 August 1843, the thousandth commemoration day of the Verdun Treaty, the St√§del Museum (city museum) donated a statue of Charlemagne to the city. The sculpture, made of red sandstone by sculptor Johann Nepomuk Zwerger, was deployed at the eastern middle pillar of the bridge, facing the city. In the progress of deconstructing the Alte Br√ºcke in 1914, this statue was moved to the yard of the Historical Museum of Frankfurt. During the bombing of Frankfurt in World War II, the statue has been severely damaged; the head and the hands of the statue have been destroyed. In 1986, it was repositioned in front of the entrance of the historical museum in R√∂merberg, after sculptor Edwin H√ºller had restored head and hands of the statue. In 2011, the museum in R√∂merberg was deconstructed to be re-built, and the sculpture was moved to a depot. During discussions in Frankfurt to extend and renovate the Alte Br√ºcke, the citizens expressed the wish to re-situate the Charlemagne statue in its original place on the bridge. Because the financial situation of the city did not allow such a project at that time, a society named Br√ºckenbauverein Frankfurt e.V. (\\"bridge building club of Frankfurt, registered society\\") was founded in 2006, under the lead of architect Christoph M√§ckler.Webseite des Br√ºckenbauvereins In the end of 2014, the city community council decided to leave the original in the new museum building in R√∂merberg, and to put up a copy on the Alte Br√ºcke, exactly where the \\"Brickegickel\\" had been located from 1967 to 2013. On 1 October 2016, mayor Feldmann inaugurated the memorial.Karl der Gro√üe auf der Webseite Kunst im √∂ffentlichen Raum in Frankfurt am Main = Brickegickel = Red sandstone base, crucifix and Brickegickel, 2018 The \\"Brickegickel\\" (\\"bridge rooster\\") is inseparably linked to the history of the Alte Br√ºcke. In 1401, a crucifix was constructed deployed on the middle arch of the bridge, the cross arch, to mark the position of the deepest point in the waterway. At top of the crucifix, there was a golden rooster, as a symbol for vigilance, and also as a symbol for the remorse about the betrayal of Saint Peter to his Lord Jesus. The rooster was supposed to remind mariners to be cautious when steering their riverboat through the strong current below the narrow bridge arch. Also, at this place, for many centuries, executions had been performed. When the last glimpse of the condemned person faced the Brickegickel, the rooster reminded them of Receptance, while the crucifix promised divine grace and forgiveness of their sins. Five times, the Brickegickel had to be replaced during the course of the centuries: * The first one already sank in the Main during a hefty windstorm in 1434. * The second one was shot down by Swedish troops in 1635, during the Thirty Years' War. It had already been damaged during the besiegement of Frankfurt in the F√ºrstenkrieg (\\"prince war\\") in 1552. * The third one sank on 16 December 1739 when the bridge collapsed in a flood. It has never been found again. * The fourth one was created with a Rococo design, with a sandstone base and a metalsmith decorated crucifix, in 1750. It stood there until the Alte Br√ºcke was demolished in 1914, and it was placed on the \\"new old bridge\\" between 1926 and 1945. During Zweiten Weltkrieg, on 26. M√§rz 1945, two arches of the bridge have been imploded by the Wehrmacht, to prevent US-American soldiers from marching over the bridge into the city. This implosion destroyed the base and crucifix, and the Brickegickel fell into the Main. It has been salvaged and displayed in the Historical Museum afterwards. Closer examination of the object showed that the Brickegickel had been perforated by multiple gunshots, likely on 31 October 1813, when French and Bavarian troops had a firefight over the bridge. * The fifth Brickegickel has been created with faithful reproductions of the destroyed sandstone base and the crucifix, on 7 December 1967, on the renovated Alte Br√ºcke. * The sixth, current, Brickegickel was built in September 1994, after its predecessor had been stolen in 1992. A donation by Helmut G√§rtner, long-time municipal administrator of Frankfurt, in celebration of his election to first councillor of Eschborn, allowed its manufacturing by sculptor Edwin H√ºller, the creator of the fifth Brickegickel in 1967. Today's Brickegickel is made out of bronze, and it is covered by a thin coat of gold. From 2013 to 2017, the Brickegickel was refurbished; it was then placed at its historical original position, the upstream side of the middle of the bridge.  Legends around the Alte Br√ºcke  The first creature to cross the bridge The Grimm Brothers delivered the story of the \\"Sachsenh√§usener Br√ºcke zu Frankfurt\\" (\\"Sachsenhausen bridge by Frankfurt\\") to posterity in their Deutsche Sagen (\\"German Legends\\") book. This legend is also being told about other bridges, in very similar form. Examples include the Teufelsbr√ºck, the Stone Bridge of Regensburg and the construction of Bamberg Cathedral as well as the bridge in Bamberg. However, in most other legends, other animals like goats or chamoises cross the bridge in place of a rooster. The origin of these legends is likely to be found in ancient records, for example the belief in river gods, which could only be appeased by sacrifices. Also, the construction of bridges had been one of the most challenging and most admired construction tasks since ancient times; for superstitious people, it was easy to imagine that supernatural powers were required for such a task to succeed.Siehe z. Connected to the firefight between Swedish and Imperial troops in August 1635 is the legend of the \\"Schwedenschuss\\" (\\"Swedish gunshot\\"):  Alte Br√ºcke and the law  Depiction of the \\"bridge liberty\\" = Br√ºckenfreiheit (\\"bridge liberty\\") = Since time immemorial, a special custom existed on the Alte Br√ºcke, the so-called Br√ºckenfreiheit (\\"bridge freedom\\"). Strictly speaking, the bridge was located outside of the city walls, and thus outside of the city. Every evening, the bridge gates were closed; passing the bridge by night was strictly forbidden. The Br√ºckenfreiheit was connected to the obligation to maintain peace on the bridge. Violations of the law happening on the bridge were subject to draconian sanctions. An illustration by painter Philipp Uffenbach, made in 1610 for the Frankfurt bridge tower, shows this in a dramatic fashion: The picture shows three men scuffling on the bridge. In the foreground of the picture, the person who began the fight gets their hand cut off: (\\"He, who breaches the liberty of this bridge, will receive punishment for his sinful hand.\\") Using such depictions, the consequences of quarrel and fighting on the bridge have been made clear to those who were unable to read. The \\"politisches Schatzk√§stlein\\" (\\"political treasure chest\\"), a collection of chalcographies from 1630 compiled by Daniel Meissner, also contains a depiction of the Br√ºckenfreiheit. Beside commonplace Latin remarks about not breaking the law, harsh sanctions and protection of the righteous, the plate also contains the German text: (\\"These bridges' liberty means, that nobody on it by day or night, may practice wickedness, waggery or violence; else, their hand will soon be chopped off.\\") = Executions on Alte Br√ºcke = In the Middle Ages, drowning was the most common kind of execution in Frankfurt. Responsible for the penal procedure was the Frankfurt City Council, since 1387. The preserved records of proceedings show that 91 people have been drowned between 1366 and 1500, followed by hanging of 70 people, and decapitation of 58 people. In the 17th century, only 38 people had been drowned, compared to 133 hanged and 28 decapitated convicts. The last execution by drowning occurred in 1613. After the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina of Emperor Charles V, drowning was listed as the designated punishment for theft, infanticide, incest, violation of legally imposed probation sanctions (breaking the \\"Urfehde\\"), poisoning and abortion. The process of a drowning execution is described in detail in the \\"Lersnersche Chronik\\" (\\"chronicle of Lersner\\"): The convicted - which also included women, because women convicted to death had normally been drowned - were walked from the bridge tower, their prison, to the Brickegickel on the cross arch of the Alte Br√ºcke: \\"Bis an die stat, da man pfleget zu richten\\" (\\"up to the place where the execution traditionally happens.\\") There, their knees, arms, hands and neck were bound, and they were pushed on a wooden plank over the bridge parapet into the Main. When the last glimpse of the condemned person faced the Brickegickel, the rooster was supposed to remind them of Receptance, while the crucifix promised divine grace and forgiveness of their sins. At this place, the river current was the strongest, causing the convict to be carried and drowned by the water immediately. When the water level was high enough, the dead body came ashore only outside of the city, not being Frankfurt's business anymore. Only when the water level was low, it could happen that the body came ashore on Frankfurt territory. In this case, the corpse was buried on the graveyard next to the leper colony. Contrary to other executions, drownings also occurred at night, to avoid the usual gathering of people at executions.  Alte Br√ºcke in art and literature  Gustave Courbet: \\"Blick auf Frankfurt\\", 1858 Carl Morgenstern: \\"Ansicht von Frankfurt am Main\\", 1850 For centuries, the Alte Br√ºcke was considered to be the most significant and beautiful building of Frankfurt. The panorama of city and bridge has inspired many painters for this reason, for example Conrad Faber, Matth√§us Merian, Anton Kirchner, Anton Radl, Domenico Quaglio, Carl Morgenstern, Friedrich Wilhelm Delkeskamp, Carl Theodor Reiffenstein and Gustave Courbet. A major representative of the Kronberg artist colony, Fritz Wucherer, and the painter Otto Meisner created the last depictions of the Alte Br√ºcke before it was deconstructed. Numerous poets addressed the Alte Br√ºcke. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote about the Alte Br√ºcke bridge in \\"Dichtung und Wahrheit\\":Translation: Original: He later said: Man kann fast sagen, da√ü die Mainbr√ºcke das einzige sch√∂ne und einer so gro√üen Stadt w√ºrdige Monument aus der fr√ºhern Zeit sei. (\\"One can almost say that the bridge over the Maine is the only beautiful monument of the past times that is worthy of such a large city.\\") The Sachsenhausen Bridge was also considered to be one of the four most significant old bridges of Germany: \\"Die Dresdner ist die l√§ngste und sch√∂nste, die Prager die breiteste und fr√∂mmste, die Regensburger die st√§rkste und die Sachsenh√§user die r√∂teste\\". (\\"The Augustus Bridge is the longest and most beautiful one, the Charles Bridge is the widest and godliest, the Regensburg Stone Bridge is the strongest, and the Sachsenhausen Bridge [A/N: Alte Br√ºcke] is the reddest.\\") Friedrich Stoltze, Adolf Stoltze and Karl Ettlinger, poets from Frankfurt, bequeathed especially many poems about the Alte Br√ºcke. Among the poets of the 20th century, Fritz von Unruh is to be emphasized, who lived in within sight of the bridge for years. He wrote the celebratory poem for the bridge inauguration in 1926. Since 1843, the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer lived at the Sch√∂ne Aussicht (\\"beautiful view\\") in immediate vicinity of the Main bridge. In his treatise \\"√úber L√§rm und Ger√§usch\\" (\\"about noises and sounds\\") of 1851, he wrote down his anger especially about \\"das vermaledeite infernale Peitschenknallen\\" (\\"the damned infernal whip cracks\\") of the waggoners in the reverberating alleys of the cities: > \\"With all due respect to the most holy usefulness, I do not accept that a > guy, who moves a carriage of sand or dung to another place, should in return > gain the privilege to scotch any upcoming thought in ten thousand minds on > their half-hour route through the city.\\" It is likely that the Frankfurt waggoners incited this anger when they spurred on their horses and carriages with loud shouts and whip cracks, and when the iron-fitted wheels of the heavy vehicles rumbled over the cobbles of the road and the bridge:  See also  * List of medieval stone bridges in Germany  Literature   Walter Gerteis: Das unbekannte Frankfurt.
