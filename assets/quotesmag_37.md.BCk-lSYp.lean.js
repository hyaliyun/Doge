Leonid Yefimovich Leonidov (real name Shapiro, March 27, 1927 - April 30, 1996). In 1979 he graduated from the Glinka Choral School under the Leningrad State Academic Chapel. In 1983 he graduated from the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts, the course of Arkady Katsman and Lev Dodin. He served in the army, in the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Leningrad Military District, together with Nikolai Fomenko and Yevgeny Oleshev. In 1983, he became one of the founders of the popular \\"Sekret\\" beat-quartet (Maxim Leonidov, Nikolai Fomenko, Andrei Zabludovsky, Alexei Murashov), who started working professionally since 1985. After leaving the group in 1989, Maxim Leonidov began a solo career. In late 1990, along with his first wife, Irina Selezneva, he immigrated to Israel. Until 1996 he lived and worked in Tel Aviv, after which he returned to St. Petersburg. Periodically continues cooperation with the group \\"Sekret\\" (mainly during the jubilee dates of the group). In 2012, musicians began to record new songs. In 2013, released the first 16 years of the album \\"Sekret 30\\", and in 2014 - \\"Vsyo eto i est lyubov.\\" In addition to the title track, the songs \\"Zabey\\" and \\"Na lyuboi storone zemli\\", to which the clips were released, became known. On February 13, 2015, on his birthday at the Mongolian embassy in the Russian Federation, he received the \\"For the Motherland\\" award of the 1st degree. This honor was honored after the tour in Mongolia in May 2014 as part of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the victory at Khalkhin-Gol. On the same day, Maxim received the \\"Chart Dozen\\" prize in the \\"Legend\\" nomination as part of the \\"Sekret\\" beat-quartet.

Hippoband HippoBand ‚Äî Yuri Guriev, Maxim Leonidov, Vladimir Gustov =History of the group= Maxim Leonidov's group \\"Hippoband\\" was founded in March 1996, after the return of the musician from Israel. In May of the same year their first concert was held. The backbone of the group was composed by well-known, professional musicians: composer, guitarist and arranger Vladimir Gustov (at his recording studio \\"Favorite\\" most of the albums \\"Hippoband\\" were recorded), keyboardist Yevgeny Oleshev (classmate Maxim in the choral school), bassist Yuri Guryev (Leonidov's friend on work in the group \\"Collected Works\\" and the rock theater \\"Sekret\\"). Its current name was received only in 2003 - with the release of the album Hippopotazm. The album's name, in its turn, came about by chance, thanks to one of the songs included in it - \\"Hippopotam\\". According to musicians, Vladimir Gustov, scoring the name of the song in the computer, accidentally made a typo by pressing the \\"Z\\" key - and this word arose. Then Maxim and Co. decided to call themselves \\"Hippoband\\", and the logo of the group was decorated with a hippopotamus (\\"totemic animal\\").–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–æ–∫ –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–ø—Å–∞–æ—Ç—Å—Ç–æ–π The composition of the band has not changed since 1997, when the first drummer of the collective Evgeny Lependin moved to Moscow to work with Vladimir Presnyakov Jr., and his place was taken by a young musician Yuri Sonin. =Group members= Permanent formation *Maxim Leonidov - vocals, songwriter, guitar, harmonica *Vladimir Gustov - guitar, vocals, arrangement *Evgeny Oleshev - keyboard, vocals, arrangement *Yuri Guryev - bass guitar, vocals, group director *Yuri Sonin - drums *Evgeny Guriev - guitar Sessional musicians *Valery Shurygin - button accordion *Mikhail Zhidkikh - saxophone *Yoel Gonzalez - percussion *Pavel Ivanov - percussion *Vitaly Pogosyan - duduk =Group discography= *1996 - \\"Commander\\" *1997 - \\"Sailing Over the City\\" *1999 - \\"Do not let him go\\" *2000 - \\"The best songs of 1985-2000\\" *2001 - \\"Let's light up!\\" (An album of military songs) *2001 - Thursday *2003 - Hippopotazm *2004 - \\"146 minutes in Russia\\" (live album) *2006 - \\"Fundamentals of Feng Shui\\"Review in FUZZ magazine, ‚Ññ 6(153), 2006 year *2008 - \\"The World for Mary\\" *2009 - \\"The Wild Thing\\" *2009 - \\"House on the Mountain\\" (live album) *2011 - \\"The Daddies of the Song\\" *2017 - \\"Above\\" =Solo discography= Released albums *1987 - \\"Recognition\\", \\"Melody\\".

He is a senior scientist at the Sainsbury Laboratory and professor of biology at the University of East Anglia (UEA). Kamoun is known for contributions to our understanding of plant diseases and plant immunity. Early life and education Kamoun grew up in Tunisia. He studied at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris and then at the University of California, Davis where he obtained a PhD in 1991 for genetic analysis of pathogenicity of the bacteria, Xanthomonas campestris. Research and career Kamoun in 2017 Kamoun is known for his contributions to our understanding of plant diseases and plant immunity. He used genomics and molecular biology methods to obtain insights into the biology and evolution of eukaryotic plant pathogens. He discovered virulence effector families from plant pathogens and showed how they can modulate plant immunity. He demonstrated how antagonistic coevolution with host plants has impacted the architecture of pathogen genomes, accelerated the evolution of effector genes, and drove the emergence of immune receptor networks. After his PhD, Kamoun worked at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for Engineering Plants for Resistance Against Pathogens at the University of California, Davis, and at the Department of Phytopathology (Wageningen University, Netherlands). He was on the faculty of the Department of Plant Pathology (Ohio State University, Wooster campus) from 1998 to 2007, before joining The Sainsbury Laboratory in 2007. He served as Head of The Sainsbury Laboratory from 2009 to 2014 and also holds the rank of professor of biology at the University of East Anglia. Kamoun served as president of the International Society for Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions from 2012-2014.  Awards and honours  Kamoun received several awards and recognitions. He received the 2003 Syngenta Award and the 2013 Noel Keen Award from the American Phytopathological Society, the Daiwa Adrian Prize in 2010, and the Kuwait Prize in 2016. He was elected a member of the Academia Europaea (MAE) in 2011, and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2015.

The main areas of his research include the Second Letter to the Corinthians (exegesis and theology), the Gospel of John (Anti-Judaism and the Gospel of John; Mary Magdalene and the Noli me tangere), and biblical hermeneutics (normativity of the future).  Education and academic career  Bieringer first studied theology at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, and then continued his studies at the Faculty of Theology of the KU Leuven, Belgium, where he defended his doctorate in 1986. His doctoral dissertation presents an exegesis of 2 Corinthians 5:14-21 in its epistolary context and is partially published in Studies on 2 Corinthians. In 1988 he was ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer, and served in a parish in Rodalben as assistant priest until 1990, when he was appointed as a full-time staff member of the Faculty of Theology (now Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies) at KU Leuven. Between 2008 and 2012 he served as Vice-Dean for Research of that faculty. Since 2014 he has been the coordinator of the Biblical Studies Research Unit. He was also the co-founder and is currently the head of the Faculty's Centre for Women's Studies Theology. He also chairs the Research Group Exegesis, Hermeneutics and Theology of the Corpus Paulinum and Corpus Johanneum. Since 2011, he has been serving as the secretary of the Colloquium Biblicum Lovaniense. Between 2012 and 2015 Bieringer served as the President of the European Association of Biblical Studies and is currently the President of the Flemish Bible Society. He is also the secretary of Colloquium Oecumenicum Paulinum, and in 2010 served as its president.  Contribution to Biblical Studies  = Reconciliation and 2 Corinthians = The theology and the background of Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians have belonged to Bieringer's main research interests since the beginning of his academic career. He is known to be one of the long-standing defenders of the letter's unity and integrity. In his doctoral work, supervised by Jan Lambrecht, and in subsequent publications, he has argued that the genesis of Paul's use of the concept of reconciliation in reference to the divine-human relationship in 2 Cor 5:14-21 is to be sought in Paul's theological reflection on his personal experience of an initial reconciliation with the Corinthians. Bieringer has also suggested that, as opposed to the traditional understanding of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒ¨Œ≥Œ∑œÑŒµ (katallagƒìte) in 2 Cor 5:20d as passive, the verb has here a reflexive meaning and thus could be translated as \\"reconcile yourselves to God\\" rather than \\"be reconciled to God\\". In a paper presented at the 2008 Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meeting in Boston, Bieringer proposed the term \\"theology in the making\\" to refer to the process whereby Paul's everyday life experiences and the resources at his disposal led to the development of Paul's profound theological insights. This paper constituted also an introduction to the series of seminar sessions on Second Corinthians: Pauline Theology in the Making, to take place every year at the Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meetings, from 2008 to 2019. Some of Bieringer's insights on reconciliation in 2 Corinthians were taken over and developed in a doctoral dissertation by Ivar Vegge, published subsequently in the WUNT series. = Normativity of the Future = In 1996 Bieringer began to develop an eschatological-oriented biblical hermeneutics, which came to be known as the normativity of the future approach. In dialogue with the theologian Mary Elsbernd (1946-2010) from Loyola University (Chicago) and their respective students, they elaborated this approach in the publication Normativity of the Future: Reading Biblical and Other Authoritative Texts in an Eschatological Perspective. The normativity of the future approach is rooted in a dialogical perspective on God's revelation, both through the Scriptures and the \\"signs of the times\\". Incorporating a variety of scholarly biblical methodologies, it focuses subsequently on the world behind, the world of, and especially the world before the text. The approach traces the explicit or implicit eschatological vision(s) in a given biblical passage (such as the kingdom of God, the new heaven and the new earth, etc.) and seeks out the moral qualities of the text: its inclusive and exclusive dimensions, its pneumatological clues, its traces of the virtue of hope and its ethical demands. The normativity of the future approach also incorporates the hermeneutical meta-questions regarding the interpreter, the interpretive process and results, and their impact on communities, especially those who are oppressed. To date, Bieringer continues to cultivate this approach, researching how Scriptures are used in various ways, such as in religious education in Australia and in interdisciplinary theologizing in a contextual manner. = Anti-Judaism and the Fourth Gospel = In collaboration with Didier Pollefeyt, Reimund Bieringer further developed the normativity of the future approach in the context of Jewish- Christian dialogue. Their joint project on the alleged anti-Jewish tendencies in the Fourth Gospel (esp. in John 8:31-59) resulted in the Leuven colloquium on Anti-Judaism and the Fourth Gospel in 2000 and has remained a research focus ever since. In 2016 their project in collaboration with Peter De Mey resulted in an expert seminar about The Spirit, Hermeneutics and Dialogues (Leuven, 25‚Äì27 May 2016). = Mary Magdalene and Feminist Approaches to the Fourth Gospel = Bieringer's research in John's Gospel and his use of a feminist lens in biblical studies paved the way for an interdisciplinary research project on John 20:1-17 entitled \\"Mary Magdalene and the Touching of Jesus. An Intra- and Interdisciplinary Investigation of the Interpretation of John 20:17 in Exegesis, Iconography and Pastoral Care, Research Foundation Flanders, 2005-2008.\\" The research results were distributed through several articles and an edited volume on the topic, as well as radio interviews, lectures, debates and an exhibition on the image of Mary Magdalene and the iconography of the Noli me tangere. = Paul and Judaism = Bieringer's research also focuses on the question of continuity and discontinuity between Judaism and Christianity in Paul's time. The interdisciplinary project \\"New Perspectives on Paul and the Jews\\" investigated the role of Pauline theology in the process of Christian self-definition with respect to the Judaism of its time and dealt with the implications for present day Jewish-Christian dialogue.

The program covers mothers that make from 200-300% of the federal poverty level. In addition, all infants born from mothers enrolled in this program are qualified for the Medi-Cal Access Infant Program. The program is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, and is paid for by the state of California and the federal government. History and impact AIM was first introduced in 1992, and provided for 3,000-4,000 women annually initially. It is difficult to assess the impact of AIM as it was introduced alongside many other maternal healthcare improvement policies including increasing the eligibility limit for Medi-Cal from 110% to 200% of the federal poverty line, and extending Medi-Cal to undocumented foreign-born women. However, these programs were able to reduce the number of uninsured pregnant mothers from 13.2% in 1989 to under 3% in the mid 1990s.

He was a volunteer in the United States Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and a volunteer Union Army colonel during the American Civil War. He was appointed colonel of the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment on July 23, 1861. He was appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army on November 29, 1862 but his appointment expired on March 4, 1863 without being confirmed by the United States Senate. His actual highest rank remained colonel. After the expiration of his appointment in 1863, Williams resigned from the Union Army and returned to his career as a civil engineer and, after his health soon declined, a writer for newspapers and magazines.

Williams moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1837. He was a railroad surveyor for 10 years.Warner, 1964, p. 561.  Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and aftermath  Williams served as a volunteer in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Historian Ezra J. Warner wrote that Williams's obituary stated that he served in the Mexican-American War but he is not listed as an officer in F. B. Heitman's Historical Register.Heitman, Francis B.

New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 717. After the Mexican-American War, Williams moved to Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He practiced engineering and became interested in the militia.  American Civil War  The 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment was organized as the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and served under that designation until the Battle of Fair Oaks. Thereafter, the 2nd Reserve Regiment was given the designation 31st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and the original regiment was renumbered as the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment. Williams was the first colonel of the regiment, having been appointed July 23, 1861. Williams commanded the regiment during the Peninsula Campaign, where the unit was in action at the Siege of Yorktown and at the Seven Days Battles during which the regiment suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Seven Pines and Battle of Malvern Hill. The regiment did not become engaged in heavy combat in the Maryland Campaign or the Battle of Fredericksburg and suffered few losses in them. Williams was appointed a brigadier general on November 29, 1862. The appointment expired on March 4, 1863 without having been confirmed. Warner notes that Williams's last appearance in the Official Records was January 31, 1863 when he was commander of the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment in the division commanded by Charles Devens.United States War Department.

He holds the Bimal Matilal Distinguished Professorship in Philosophy at the University of Toronto. He was Global Network Professor in the College of Arts and Science, New York University, previously having taught at several universities in Britain. Ganeri graduated from Churchill College, Cambridge, with his undergraduate degree in mathematics, before completing a DPhil in philosophy at University and Wolfson Colleges, Oxford. He has published eight monographs, and is the editor of the Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy. He is on the editorial board of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the British Journal for the History of Philosophy, Philosophy East & West, Analysis, and other journals and monograph series. His research interests are in consciousness, self, attention, the epistemology of inquiry, the idea of philosophy as a practice and its relationship with literature. He works on the history of ideas in early modern South Asia, intellectual affinities between India and Greece, and Buddhist philosophy of mind, teaches courses in the philosophy of mind, the nature of subjectivity, Buddhist philosophy, the history of Indian philosophical traditions, and supervises graduate students on South Asian philosophical texts in a cross-cultural context. He is a prominent advocate for an expanded role for cross-cultural methodologies in philosophical research, and for enhanced cultural diversity in the philosophical curriculum.  Philosophical Work  In the philosophy of mind, Jonardon Ganeri advances the view, in his book The Self, that our concept of self is constitutively grounded in the fact that subjects are beings who own their ideas, emotions, wishes, and feelings. He argues that the self is a unity of three strands of ownedness: normative, phenomenological, and subpersonal. In a different book, Attention, Not Self, he argues that when early Buddhists deny that there is a self, what they are rejecting is the conception of self as the willing agent, an inner origin of willed directives. For early Buddhists like Buddhaghosa the real nature of mental activity is in the ways we pay attention. So the relation between the two books is that Attention, Not Self clears the ground for the sort of conception of self defended in The Self. His earlier book, The Concealed Art of the Soul, explores thinking about selfhood in a range of Upani·π£adic, VedƒÅntic, YogƒÅcƒÅra and MƒÅdhyamika philosophers, under the rubric of the idea that the self is something that conceals itself from itself. In the history of philosophy, Ganeri argues that modernity is not a uniquely European achievement. In The Lost Age of Reason, he shows how there emerges in 17th century India a distinctive version of modernity in the work of the so-called ‚Äúnew reason‚Äù (Navya-nyƒÅya) philosophers of Bengal, MithilƒÅ, and Benares. These thinkers confronted the past and thought of themselves as doing something very new, as intellectual innovators. The innovativeness of this group of philosophers is also the subject of his earlier book, Semantic Powers, revised and restructured for the second edition entitled Artha, which aims to demonstrate that they made discoveries in linguistics and the philosophy of language which were not seen in Europe until the late 20th century. These include discoveries about the meaning of proper names, pronominal anaphora, testimony, and the relationship between epistemology and meaning theory.  Honours and Awards  In 2015, Ganeri was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Also in 2015, Ganeri won the Infosys Science Foundation's prize in the category of humanities, the first philosopher to do so.. Ganeri delivered the 2009 Pranab. K. Sen Memorial Lecture at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, the 2016 Brian O'Neil Memorial Lectures at the University of New Mexico, and the 2017 Daya Krishna Memorial Lecture at the University of Rajasthan. In 2019, Ganeri delivered a convocation address at Ashoka University, Delhi.

History  William James Butler (born on 18 March 1858 at Leamington, Warwickshire, England; died on 10 December 1932 at Wellington) and his brother Joseph Butler (born on 1 March 1862 at Leamington ; died on 30 September 1934 in London) had by 1892 become so wealthy that they could purchase a large saw mill at Kokiri, from which they began exporting to Australia. At Kokiri they pioneered the use of a steam- powered log hauler in New Zealand, and in 1895 introduced a steam locomotive running on a wooden tramway.Michael Roche: Butler, Joseph and Butler, William James, Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, first published in 1996. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Retrieved on 30 April 2018. The use of the steam hauler resulted in great economy in hauling heavy logs from the bush. In fact, so powerful was the steam hauler that timber, which at one time had to be left in the bush, was taken out with but little trouble.The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson, Marlborough & Westland Provincial Districts). The Cyclopedia Company, Limited, 1906, Christchurch. Their well-known sawmill, which was one of the largest in Westland and ranked amongst the leading sawmill businesses in the South Island, was a very complete one, capable of turning out 40,000 feet of timber per week. The machinery was of the latest pattern, and had been imported from England and America. The mill was kept working full time around 1906, to supply a brisk trade in New Zealand and Australia. In the sister colonies the name of Butler Brothers has been familiar to all users of New Zealand timbers. The firm's bush in Westland covered an area of 2000 acres, and consisted principally of red, white and silver pine. It shipped white pine in large quantities direct to Melbourne, where it was used in the manufacture of butter boxes. Acting on the advice of a Government expert, the firm at one time exported, with other merchants, large quantities of timber to London, but the results were not encouraging. Between thirty and forty men were constantly employed in connection with the mills of the Butler Brothers, who, while in Westland, gained a high reputation for bridge building. The brothers sold their Kokiri mill in 1902 and subsequently focussed on a new business that they had set up as the White Pine Company of New Zealand to mill kauri and kahikatea at Naumai on the Wairoa River (Northland), which they exported completely to Australia.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History In the late 1910s, there was significant pressure to upgrade Woodward Avenue, a major artery carrying traffic from Detroit to Pontiac. In response, the road commissions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties and the affected municipalities created a regional master plan for improvements. In 1923, the state agreed to share in some of the cost of improving the infrastructure. The state led the effort to secure a right-of-way along the Woodward corridor; one of the major impediments was the existence of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad track paralleling Woodward. After protracted legal wrangling, the railroad and the state came to an agreement, and the tracks were shifted to a new location. As part of the new construction, a series of bridges were designed by the railroad to carry street over the new tracks. Sixteen bridges, including this one carrying Derby Street, were built by A. Guthrie & Company of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1930. The bridge was extensively renovated in 1980, and still carries traffic. Further repair was completed in 2007. Description The Derby Street Bridge is a five-span concrete T-beam bridge. It is 165 feet long with a 43.2-foot wide deck. It carries a 29.8-foot-wide roadway. The railings are solid concrete, ornamented with three recessed panels per span and curving outward at each end. The construction date, \\"1930,\\" is inscribed in the concrete near the ends of the railings. The abutments, wing walls, and piers are all of concrete construction.

D. Chrostowska is an American-Canadian writer and intellectual historian of modern critical thought.http://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/sylwiac/ She holds a professorship in 20th century continental thought at York University in Canada.  Research  Chrostowska completed her PhD at the University of Toronto at the Centre for Comparative Literature under the supervision of Brian Stock. In 2014-2016 she was an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellow based at Humboldt University in Berlin. Chrostowska's academic work is principally in the history of social and literary criticism (18th-20th century). She writes mainly on Frankfurt School Critical Theory, and on the critical dimension of utopianism and nostalgia. Her first book, Literature on Trial (2012), examined the rise of modern literary criticism in connection with the development of literature as a separate domain. Chrostowska also writes cultural criticism spanning academic and nonacademic genres. Matches (2015), her wide-ranging collection of philosophical, critical, and literary fragments, was anthologized in Short Circuits: Aphorisms, Fragments, and Literary Anomalies (Schaffer Press, 2018). In 2018 Noxious Sector Press released Something Other than Lifedeath, a book of articles focusing on her work and edited by David Cechetto.  Fiction  Chrostowska's epistolary novel Permission is composed of anonymous messages sent to a well-known filmmaker and includes black and white images. Quill & Quire called it \\"one of the most intellectually bracing, technically fascinating Canadian-authored novels\\" of 2013. Her second novel, The Eyelid, is a critical dystopia set in near-future Paris, the capital of the world state of Greater America, and tells the story of two travelers through other people's dreams on a quest to save humanity from total insomnia.

While working as a civil servant for the Bavarian court, he published a hymnal which contained a complete German High Mass and songs such as \\"Das Grab ist leer, der Held erwacht\\" (The grave is empty, the hero awoken) for which he is known. These hymns and especially his German mass, used in settings by Michael Haydn, remain popular to this day.  Career  Beginning life as Johann Franz Seraph Kohlbrenner in Traunstein on 17 October 1728, he was the son of Rupert Kohlbrenner, a worker in a salt works. After attending the local Volksschule, he worked as a clerk at the salt works, responsible for the company's archives. At age 25, Kohlbrenner was called to Munich to revise and supervise the Registry of the Exchequer (Registratur der Hofkammer). In 1762, he installed a tree garden in the elector's Aerarium in Lechhausen. From 1766, he published a journal of the type, the Intelligenzblatt der Churbaierischen Lande. In 1777, together with the priest and composer , Kohlbrenner published in Landshut the first part of a Roman Catholic hymnal, Der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der r√∂misch-katholischen Kirche, which promoted liturgical singing in German, in the spirit of the Enlightenment. After this hymnal was also published in Salzburg in 1781, he added a second part, published there in 1783. Part of the hymnal was his Singmesse, for singing the complete mass ordinary in German instead of the traditional Latin. His German mass in ten songs was set to music by Michael Haydn several times, called Deutsches Hochamt (German High Mass). On 26 June 1778 Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, made Kohlbrenner a Reichsritter (Imperial Knight). Unmarried, he died at age 54 on 6 June 1783, in Munich and was buried at the cemetery of Unserer Lieben Frau Gottesaker zu St. Salvator. The inscription read: Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner is still known for his German High Mass and for his hymn which appears in the regional section of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob for Austria (2013 edition) as GL 710. \\"Das Grab ist leer, der Held erwacht\\" is frequently sung in Easter services.

He became an advocate in Constantine, Algeria. In the general elections of 21 August 1881 he ran as a radical candidate for the 1st constituency of the Constantine department, but won only 1,676 votes against the incumbent Gaston Thomson, the candidate of the Opportunist Republicans.

The sanctions were aimed at terrorists, Osama Bin Laden and members of Al-Qaida. Flag of Taliban 1997-2001  Context  On August 7, 1998, the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed and Al-Qaida had thus triggered the international public's awareness of the organisation. The Security Council's condemned the bombings in general terms but did not address Al-Qaida specifically. The same year, Resolution 1214 was adopted in which the Council demanded \\"the Taliban stop providing sanctuary and training for international terrorists and their organizations\\".UNSC S/RES/1214, para. 13. On November 5, 1998 Osama bin Laden and his military chief Muhamad Atef were accused in the US District Court of New York for a planned attack on US defense establishments. Following this event, the US delegation to the Security Council legally required to demand the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden. Taliban leader Mullah Omar‚Äôs refused to hand over Osama bin Laden. In consequence, the Security Council implemented its first measures under the 1267 sanctions regime. In Resolution 1267, the Security Council justified the sanctions regime by referring to violation of humanitarian law in Afghanistan, discrimination against women and the presence of an illicit opiate production.  Goals  Resolutions adopted by the United Nation's Security Council, 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), 1363 (2001), 1373 (2001), 1390 (2002), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526 (2004), 1566 (2004), 1617 (2005), 1624 (2005), 1699 (2006), 1730 (2006), 1735 (2006), 1822 (2008), 1904 (2009), 1988 (2011), 1989 (2011), 2082 (2012), 2083 (2012), 2133 (2014), 2160 (2014) and 2210 (2015), together expressed the goal to fully disrupt the activities of the Taliban.  UN Sanctions  The UN sanctions were designed to prevent that Taliban from supporting and conducting acts of international terrorism. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 imposed a series of travel and financial sanctions on members of the Tablian-controlled government of Afghanistan following the bombing of two US embassies by Al-Qaida in East Africa and for Taliban refusing to surrender Osama bin Laden to stand trail in the US for the embassy bombings. In addition to this, the Security Council \\"strongly condemned [...] training and planning\\" of terrorists and terrorists acts and \\"reiterat[ed]... deep concern\\" of terrorist activities, as well as violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights, in particular discrimination against women and girls. Following the US invasion of Afghanistan and the removal of the Taliban from government, the sanctions were amended to target specific individuals. These individuals were placed on a list at the request of member states. = Administration = Resolution 1267 established a Sanctions Monitoring Committee known as the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee. The Committee is composed of the 15 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Namely China, France, the Russian Federation, the UK, the US and the ten other Security Council rotating members. The al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee is one of three counterterrorism bodies set up by the Security Council. The Committee is further supported by Monitoring Groups established by subsequent resolutions. The Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established after Resolution 1526 in 2014 and the Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities monitoring team established in Resolution 2253 in 2015. As the nature of the Taliban changed, the original mandate of Resolution 1267 changed as well. The measures became targeted rather than blanket sanctions. United Nations member states would request the Committee to add names to the list. The Committee had the mandate to use its \\"discretionary powers to list [...] targeted individuals and entities\\". Guidelines to de-list individuals were established in 2006 and The Office of the Ombudsperson, established in 2009, designed to provide an independent and impartial review on requests from individuals, groups, undertaking or entities wishing to be removed from the Sanctions List. The Committee is mandated to: * oversee the implementation of the sanctions measures * designate individual and entities who meet the listing criteria set out in the relevant resolutions * consider requests for exemptions from the sanctions measures * consider requests to remove a name from the sanctions list * conduct reviews of the entries on the sanctions list * examine the reports presented by the Monitoring Team * report annually to the Security Council * conduct outreach activities = Asset Freeze = The purpose of the United Nation's asset freeze was to deny listed individuals, groups or entities the \\"means to support or finance terrorism\\". The asset freeze was to ensure that no funds, financial assets or economic resources were available to al-Qaeda or any individual connected to the organisation. The onus fell on member states to ensure that they had relevant domestic law criminalising the financing of terrorist organisations, as well as to monitor the activity of national financial institutions to ensure that they were aware of listed individuals and if necessary punish institutions that fail to freeze the assets of individuals. The UN Security Council al- Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee was supported by a Monitoring Team that reported on non-compliance. Since Resolution 1267, The United Nations Security Council has relied on cooperation with other global organisations such as Interpol and Financial Action Task Force to aid in identifying, monitoring of individuals who are finically linked to terrorist organisations. = Travel Ban = The Travel Ban was a preventative measure with the purpose to stop individuals, who were on the Consolidated List, from entering or transitting through the territories of United Nations member states. With the overall aim to limit the mobility of listed individuals and decrease likelihood of an attack by the listed individuals taking place. The onus fell on member states to implement the travel ban against all individuals on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List, in their national guidelines in accordance with their domestic legislation. The ban applied ‚Äúin all circumstances [and to] any passage‚Äù. In addition to barring individual travel, all states were obliged to deny permission to any aircraft owned or operated by, or on behalf of the Taliban. Member states were also requested to submit ‚Äúphotographs and other biometric data‚Äù on listed individuals so they could be included in Interpol-United Nations Security Council special notices. = Arms Embargo = Introduced in 2000 by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333, the UN imposed a mandatory arms embargo on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The embargo was designed to pressure the Taliban to close terrorist training camps and to further pressure the group into handing over Osama bin Laden to US authorities. The embargo was originally a blanket ban on the sale and supply of weapons to any person in the territory of Afghanistan. The arms embargo was designed as a presentation measure and aimed to limit the ability of the Taliban to fight a civil war. The UN placed an additional embargo on the provision of \\"technical advice, assistance, or training related to military activities\\" as well as barring the establishment of military or terrorist training facilities. The UN Resolution 1333 also required member states to bar \\"intermediaries [...] brokers or other third parties\\" from supplying arms to the Taliban. The Arms Embargo was supervised by a Committee established in accordance with resolution 1333 and was further supported by a Monitoring Group and Sanctions Enforcement Support Team. These support mechanisms had the power to review the enforcement of sanctions by member states and report to the Security Council on the implementation of the resolution at regular intervals. The UN modified the embargo in 2002 after the fall of the Taliban regime. Resolution 1390 amended the embargo to target al-Qaida linked individuals and entities. The resolution established a monitoring committee, which consisted of all six permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, as well as two of the ten rotating members. = Enforcement of Sanctions = Resolution 1267 was enforced by the Security Council Sanctions Committee or the al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee. The onus on implementing the sanctions fell upon the United Nations member states. Member states were encouraged to introduced domestic legalisation \\"criminalising the financing of terrorism and associated money laundering\\", as well as drafting new rules for aviation authorities and adding individuals on the Consolidated List to their national \\"no fly\\" list. Once the aviation and financial sanctions went into effect in November 1999, the sanctions directly led to the \\"closer of Afghan bank branches\\" in the neighbouring country of Pakistan, as well as the cancelation of Ariana Afghan Airline's flights. US financial institutions were bound by Executive Order 133224 to report and freeze assets. As of November 18, 2002, the US had frozen more than $200 million. = Resolution 1333 = The enforcement of Resolution 1333 was primarily the responsibility of the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee. In addition to this, the Resolution established a Committee of Experts which was authorised to consult with all relevant members states and to report on the implementation of Resolution 1267. The Committee of Experts was tasked with reviewing the implementation of the embargo as well as building the capacity of neighbouring states to enforce the sanctions. This group was known as the Sanctions Enforcement Team. Resolution 1363 (2001) outlined the assistance given to states bordering Afghanistan. The team would assist in monitoring and verifying information regarding violations, as well as assisting in reporting violations. After the fall of the Taliban-Controlled government in Afghanistan, the Committee operated with a \\"two-track\\" approach. Firstly, the Committee dealt with the Taliban in the area around the Afghan-Pakistan border and their quest for conventional arms and ammunition. Secondly, the Committee dealt with the al-Qaida cells located around the world and their attempt to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The onus on implementing the Taliban element of the arms embargo imposed by Resolution 1390 lies primarily with Afghanistan and its six bordering states, i.e. China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Focus was primarily on building capacity to monitor and stem the flow of weapons on the Afghan-Pakistan border. = Resolution 1988 = In 2011 the sanction regime 1267 (enforced in 2001, after the events of 9/11) aimed at the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, was divided into two separate sanction regimes. Sanction regime 1989 targets al-Qaida specifically, whilst sanction regime 1988 targets the Taliban in Afghanistan. The new resolution included a separate list of Taliban individuals under sanctions. The reason for this modification was that Security Council took into consideration that some of the Taliban had ended their contacts with al-Qaida, hence the need for separate sanction regimes. The type of sanctions applied for the new regime-1989 remained the same. = Effectiveness = The two goals of Resolution 1267 was to coerce the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden to US authorities to answer to criminal charges over the bombing of two US embassies in East Africa and to prevent the Taliban and al-Qaida from conducting international acts of terror. The United Nations failed to coerce the Taliban-controlled Afghan government to hand over Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan in 2011 as a part of the US war effort in Afghanistan. The sanctions also failed to prevent the Taliban for conducting terrorist acts. In the years following the implementation of the sanctions, al-Qaida claimed responsibility for the bombing of USS Cole in 2000 claiming the lives of seventeen American sailors and injured another 39. In addition to USS Cole, the Taliban claimed \\"direct responsibility\\" for the September 11 attacks, claiming the lives of 2 977 individuals in New York City, Washington, DC and outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The success of Resolution 1267 was limited due to the reliance on information provided by member states. The goal of Resolution 1333 was to restrict the Taliban's access to conventional weapons and ammunition and other weapons of mass destruction. The success of Resolution 1333 was limited because of the reliance on information provided by member states to enable Committees to successfully monitor and enforce sanctions. Resolution 1333 relied on the ability of developing nations without the capability to enforce and report violations. The Committee sent the Sanctions Support Team in 2002. The sanctions support team, which was tasked with implementing the Arms Embargo along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was described as a small and \\"inadequate force\\" which was placed in the region following the September 11 terrorist attack. The deployment of monitors was delayed and the arms embargo could not be fully implemented. Resolution 1267 and subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution, including 1333, have been credited with the promotion of international cooperation in combatting terrorism and strengthening anti-terrorism measures in intergovernmental organisation such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The mechanisms that were created to minimise the effectiveness of al- Qaida are still in place and have been utilised by the United Nations to combat the Islamic State.  Non-UN-mandated sanctions against Afghanistan  = EU Sanctions = In accordance with the United Nation's sanction regime 1337, which was adopted after 9/11 2001, the European Union (EU) has as well implemented the sanction regime through various legal acts. A number of individuals and factions have been listed for freezing of assets. However, a full implementation of the 1337-regime by all the EU-member states collectively has not been possible. There is no EU regulation allowing the listing of asset freezing for individuals linked to terrorism originating from, and active within, the EU territory. A majority of the member states have however adopted national regulations which target these individuals. In 2011, the European Union adopted the following restrictive measures against the Taliban (Council Decision 2011/486/CFSP): * Embargo on arms and related material * Ban on provision of certain services * Freezing of funds and economic resources * Restrictions on admission  Critique  Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) is an intergovernmental organisation which has established 40 recommendations and functions as a \\"standard setter\\" to promote effective measures against money laundering and financing of terrorism, among other things. FAFT evaluates its member states to guarantee the established recommendations are being followed. Regarding the implementation of resolution 1267 and the 1988/1989 sanction regimes, FAFT has criticized the EU for too slow action regarding enforcement of the UN-listings of asset freezing. According to FAFT's recommendations the member countries should implement economic sanctions settled by the UN, without impediment. Sweden is one of the countries that have been criticized, among other countries that lack national systems for these regulations. One reason for the impediment from the decision on sanctions by the UN until it is implemented by the EU, is the need for translation. From the moment the list on sanctions is published in New York until the EU-decision is published in Brussels it take some days as the text in the resolution must be translated into the official EU-languages. This delay causes some issues as during the process of translation the listed individuals can freely withdraw money from banks within the EU.  Effects on the Afghan people  Widespread protests broke out in Afghanistan in November 1999, as the UN sanctions went into effect. Protesters attacked UN offices and vehicles. The Afghan national airline Ariana that transported medicine, food and health care providers to Afghanistan was grounded. Several NGOs withdrew their programmes as the level of insecurity in Afghanistan rose and due to the withdrawal of donors' support. At the time, NGOs represented approximately 70% of the provided health care services in Afghanistan. The sanctions aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country, which had suffered from a war for more than twenty years. In August 2000 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the existing sanctions had a ‚Äútangible negative effect‚Äù on Afghanistan's populace. Aid groups like MSF and Human Rights Watch together with the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and UN Afghanistan, criticized the decision for stricter sanctions against Afghanistan's ruling party in 2000, with regard to the humanitarian situation in the country. The medical journal The Lancet reported in 2001 that the implementation of tougher UN sanctions on Afghanistan coincided with a period of drought in the country. According to a spokesperson for M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) food had become so scarce many people resorted to eating plant roots. A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called the situation ‚Äúa famine-like crisis‚Äù.  Lifting of Sanctions  On January 15, 2002 the Security Council lifted its sanctions against Ariana Afghan Airlines. This was due to the new reality that the Afghan Airlines was no longer owned by or operated by the Taliban. Sanctions against the Central Afghani Bank were also lifted. In the Security Council's Resolution 2255 (2015) the Council recognized that ‚Äùthe security situation in Afghanistan has evolved and that some members of the Taliban have reconciled with the Government of Afghanistan, have rejected the terrorist ideology of Al-Qaida and its followers, and support a peaceful resolution to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan‚Äù And further it was stated that the Security Council, ‚ÄùTaking note of the Government of Afghanistan‚Äôs request that the Security Council support reconciliation, including by removing names from the United Nations sanctions lists for those who reconcile and have ceased to engage in or support activities that threaten the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan, Expressing its intention to give due regard to lifting sanctions on those who reconcile‚Äù.  Controversies  = Disregard for Human Rights = As the sanctions were modified to target individuals, concerns about the \\"interference with the fundamental rights\\" of the listed individuals were raised. The freezing of assets denied access to private individual funds that provide for basic expenses. The nature of the sanctions lacked a definite end-date. Without an end-date the sanctions could be regarded as \\"punitive\\" rather than \\"preventative\\" without the legal protections that are provided under international criminal laws. Individuals were placed on the consolidated list at the suggestion of United Nations member states. These suggestions were accepted on the basis of \\"political trust,\\" rather than \\"credible information\\" regarding personal connections to the Taliban, bin Laden or al-Qaida. Another controversy was that an individual could be placed on the list on the suggestion of a single state, whilst a consensus of all committee members was needed for the individual to be removed. = Right to Due Process = One of the major controversies following Resolution 1267 and subsequent resolutions was the United Nations Security Council disregard for international recognised standards of due process. The committee lacked guidelines and procedures for placing individuals on the consolidated list, which blacklisted them for access to personal monetary funds. There was also no mechanisms for individuals to be informed of their listing, to know the allegations against them, or challenge their listing. After much criticism against the UN sanctions procedures, member states made efforts to improve procedures and increase transparency. For instance, improvements of the listing and delisting process followed. With resolution 1730 (2006) the Focal Point for Delisting was added, where listed individuals are able to contact the governments that had listed them, and request to be ‚Äúdelisted‚Äù. Previously there was no such mechanism available.

The family moved to Cambridge in 1908 and Wilkinson attended the local primary school, followed by Hamilton High School.  Adult life  At the age of 16, Wilkinson began studying pharmacy by correspondence; her studies were interrupted by work assisting during the 1918 influenza epidemic and she passed her final examinations in 1921. Wilkinson married in 1923 and, as was expected at the time, gave up her career to be a housewife. In 1947 Wilkinson's husband Kenneth was elected mayor of Cambridge, holding the position until 1953 and again from 1956 to 1962. Wilkinson supported him in his election campaigning and mayoral duties. In 1960 she became a justice of the peace and in 1963 she was appointed as an organiser of the Halls of Residence Campaign for the new University of Waikato. Wilkinson was also a writer and local historian. In the 1920s and 1930s she wrote short stories on family life for the New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Weekly News. She later wrote a number of works on the history of Cambridge. In the 1985 New Year Honours, Wilkinson was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service.

She was the daughter of Nathaniel Page, a former mayor of Croydon. She studied painting, but due to failing eyesight changed to courses in wood-carving and metals and enamels, and became skilled in needlework, embroidery and lace- making. She also studied Braille in order to help a blind friend. When her father died and faced with her own failing health, she left for South Africa in July 1911. She settled in Dealesville in the Orange Free State at first, but soon moved to Bloemfontein in 1912. From there she visited Palapye and Pretoria, and toured Rhodesia and Basutoland, returning to the latter country a number of times. It was there that her interest in botany was born, starting a collection of plant specimens and helping a friend, Mrs Beaumont, to create a herbarium for use by the children of Morija. While visiting Cape Town in January 1915 she showed some flower illustrations to Louisa Bolus who was struck by their quality, and persuaded her to work at the Bolus Herbarium, an association which lasted until her death. Most of her illustrations dealt with Aizoaceae, but she also depicted Iridaceae and orchids. Many of her paintings appeared in Flowering Plants of Africa and were used in books by Hans Herre. A handbook on culinary herbs written by her was published by the Royal Horticultural Society. She was commemorated in the now defunct plant genus Pagella Sch√∂nland (1921), but also in Conophytum pageae, Nemesia pageae, Crassula pageae, Erica pageana, the former taxa Psilocaulon pageae (now P. dinteri), Carpobrotus pageae (now C. mellei), and Erepsia pageae (now E. patula), and possibly also for Amphithalea pageae and Muraltia pageae.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History In the late 1910s, there was significant pressure to upgrade Woodward Avenue, a major artery carrying traffic from Detroit to Pontiac. In response, the road commissions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties and the affected municipalities created a regional master plan for improvements. In 1923, the state agreed to share in some of the cost of improving the infrastructure. The state led the effort to secure a right-of-way along the Woodward corridor; one of the major impediments was the existence of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad track paralleling Woodward. After protracted legal wrangling, the railroad and the state came to an agreement, and the tracks were shifted to a new location. As part of the new construction, a series of bridges were designed by the railroad to carry street over the new tracks. Sixteen bridges were built by A. Guthrie & Company of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1930, but the Trowbridge Road bridge was not completed until 1931. The bridge was closed in 2017, and as of 2019 was slated for demolition. Description End of parapet The Trowbridge Road bridge is a seven span, concrete T-beam structure. It is 231 feet long, with a 44-foot-wide deck carrying a 30-foot- wide roadway. It has false concrete arches with recessed panels in the spandrels. The railings are solid concrete parapets with paneled concrete posts and three recessed rectangular panels between each. The date \\"1930\\" is chiseled into the parapets at each end. The ends curve out before terminating in concrete posts, and chain-link fencing lines the inside of the railing.

History The church dates from the 14th century, though there are records of a priest in Heston in the 7th century. The Domesday Book makes no mention of Heston but in 1086 its manor was given to Walter of Saint-Val√©ry by William the Conqueror. The church was later given to the . In around 1270 Heston was made a separate parish under Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, the Lord of the Manor. Richard of Cornwall was King John's second son and had served in the Barons' Crusade of 1239, where he succeeded as a negotiator for the release of prisoners. As Saint Leonard is the patron saint of prisoners it is possible that Richard dedicated the church to the saint, although the exact date of the dedication is unknown. The church tower survived the necessary rebuilding works in the 19th century, as did the lychgate. The grave of Private Frederick John White, who was flogged to death at Hounslow Barracks in 1846, can be found in the graveyard. The outcry at the manner of his death brought about a reduction in the maximum number of lashings that could be given as punishment, and eventually the banning of the practice altogether. Naturalist Sir Joseph Banks (1743‚Äì1820) was laid to rest at St Leonard's Church. Architecture The tower is Perpendicular (late medieval) and was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as 'one of the best of the Middlesex type'. It is similar to the tower of All Saints, Isleworth. It has a south-east turret, diagonal buttresses, a three- light west window and tall, two-light, transomed windows with square heads to the belfry stage. There are embattled parapets and carved gargoyles. The west porch has a four-centred outer arch and foliated spandrels. The body of the church, rebuilt in the 19th century, is in the style of c.1300. =Interior= The arch to the tower is tall and moulded and is typical of fifteenth-century work. In the arcades between the nave and its aisles, the piers alternate between round and octagonal as was sometimes the case in medieval churches. The arcade to the outer north aisle has round piers, capitals and double chamfered arches and is said to reuse piers from the old church. The chancel arch is moulded and carried on demi-octagonal responds. The roofs to the nave, chancel and outer north aisle are of arch-braced construction. The tower and nave are divided by a modern glazed partition. Most of the nineteenth-century pews survive, however, some were removed from the east end to accommodate the altar, which has been moved forward. Many of the monuments from the original church also survive. They include one in the Lady Chapel dedicated to Robert Child and his family, owners of Osterley Park, and designed by Robert Adam. There is also a varied collection of stained glass, including work by C E Kempe and Heaton, Butler and Bayne.

Atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by stiffening and a buildup of compounds in arteries, may be prevented by barettin due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

History  Phat kaphrao mu sap with rice and a fried egg. By some accounts, phat kaphrao was included as part of Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Thai cultural mandates during WWII. Phat kaphrao, as well as pad thai, were one of the promoted dishes in local Thai food contests. Phat kaphrao was inspired by stir frying, the cooking process of Chinese people. Some of the first four survivors of the Tham Luang cave rescue asked for phat kaphrao as their first proper meal after two weeks of being trapped inside the cave.  Ingredients  Phat kaphrao consists of meat such as pork, chicken, beef, and seafood stir fried with Thai holy basil and garlic. It is served with rice and topped up (optional) with fried eggs or khai dao (). The main seasonings are soy sauce, Thai fish sauce, oyster sauce (optional), cane sugar, and bird's eye chili. Over time, phat kaphrao has evolved with the addition of other ingredients such as Chinese century eggs and Thai local vegetables, namely asparagus beans, baby corns, onions, carrots, cowpeas, banana peppers, mushrooms, Chinese kales, bamboo shoots and coconut shoots. However, adding vegetables in phat kaphrao is also seen as an effort to reduce the cost of meat and increase profit margins on the part of food vendors.

The film stars Riddhi Sen as Parimal, a trans woman from rural Bengal, and Ritwick Chakraborty as Madhu, a flute player from the Kirtaniya town of Nabadwip. At the 65th National Film Awards the film won four Awards including, Special Jury Award (Feature Film) and National Film Award for Best Actor for Riddhi Sen.  Plot  Unable to cope with the trauma of being ‚Äòbetrayed‚Äô by her teacher Subhash-da (Indrasish Roy), Porimal, a trans woman, runs away from home and joins a ghetto of eunuchs as Puti and sings at traffic signals to earn money. There she falls in love with Madhu (Ritwick Chakraborty), a delivery boy with a Chinese restaurant who moonlights as a flautist in kirtans. Their love blossoms while they dream of raising money required for the sex reassigned surgery after meeting the first transgender person in India who has completed Doctor of Philosophy, Manabi Bandyopadhyay. But transphobic society does not support their dreams. Puti is arrested and commits suicide by hanging herself with her towel inside the lock up at a police station. Eventually, Madhu joins the same ghetto of eunuchs.  Cast  * Riddhi Sen as Parimal / Puti * Ritwick Chakraborty as Madhu * Manabi Bandyopadhyay as herself Scope The film is a document that frames this experience of an invisible community, rarely portrayed in Indian mainstream cinema. The fabric of Ganguly's film moves beyond the binaries of a linear and complex narrative and instead brings forth a breathtaking ruthlessness that mirrors the hidden lives and traumas of the Transgender/ Hijra/ Intersex/ gender non-conforming communities. The film embodies the visceral experience of these communities battling centuries of prejudice and taboo. The community's lived realities of being caught between questions of vice and virtue, desire and rejection sustains the film's body narrative ‚Äì rather precariously ‚Äì avoiding a moral position ‚Äì yet examining the very contours that makes taking these positions complicated. In a society that largely considers trans bodies as dustbins to dump its traumas and miscarriages of justice, the film signals a language of change that can be used to build a narrative of resistance.

Synopsis  The plot alternates between two separate timelines set twenty years apart. =1997 timeline= Jean-Louis Rodier, a Parisian writer suffering from writer's block, decides to move with his family to his wife Fran√ßoise's hometown Valmoline: a small village in the Alps. He rents a chalet owned by Philippe and Florence Personnaz, who are also the owners of the only bar in town. The family's transition into their new life is complicated by the insular nature of the village, and by Jean-Louis's lack of progress on his second novel. Due to his feelings of inadequacy, Jean-Louis alienates his wife and seeks solace by befriending Philippe's sister Muriel, the local barkeep. Jean-Louis sees Muriel's provincial life as possible setting for his future novel. At the same time, Julien, Jean-Louis and Fran√ßoise's son, befriends Alice Bordaz, the local carpenter's daughter. This is met with open hostility by the other boys in the village, particularly by S√©bastien Genesta, who has unrequited feelings for Alice. Then suddenly the Rodiers are gone, without any explanation. =2017 timeline= Manu Laverne, who spent his summers in Valmoline as a child, arrives at the newly renovated chalet with Adele, who is two months pregnant. They have returned for the wedding of Tiphaine and Laurent, son of Philippe who still lives in the village and owns the chalet. The wedding party arrives at the nearby train station and travels towards the chalet. After they cross the bridge that serves as the only access to Valmoline, there is a rockslide which completely cuts the group off from the outside world. They soon discover that the phone and Internet connection have also stopped working. Isolated with the last six members of the village, secrets emerge from the past and a terrible revenge starts to unfold.

As early as 2015, Renea spoke in interviews about her working on her forthcoming album.

They emerged as commercial enterprises on the Victorian gold fields in 1854. History Chinese food began to be established in Australia during the middle of the 19th century by Chinese indentured labourers on outback stations, many found work there as cooks and also in country pubs. Chinese migration to Australia massively increased with the gold rushes during the 1850s, and some of these migrants opened food stores providing hot meals to Chinese gold diggers. European gold diggers also sometimes used these stores. They were referred to as \\"cookhouses\\", or as \\"cookshops\\", and were often associated with other Chinese businesses. One third of all cooks in Australia were Chinese by 1890. While Chinese migration to Australia essentially stopped from 1901 with the White Australia policy, chefs were granted exemptions and from 1934 Chinese traders with established businesses were able to bring non relative workers in from China. Family members were brought in under different names, were not trained cooks, and they had to learn on the job. Chinese restaurants were established in many country towns and all cities by the 1970s. =Australian Capital Territory= The oldest Chinese restaurant in Canberra opened in 1962, and was still operating in 2016. =Victoria= The first documented Chinese restaurant in Australia was at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, on the Victorian goldfields, owned by Chin Thum Lok, opening in 1854. The restaurant did not serve Chinese style food, but instead provided English style food such as roast beef. In Melbourne eighteen Chinese restaurants were listed in 1920, by 1939 eight had been established outside of the city's Chinatown precinct, and by 1970 there were one hundred and fifty operating throughout the city and suburbs. Ingredients and dishes The style of dish presented has changed over time. In the 1960s and 1970s typical dishes were sweet and sour pork, or beef and black beans, with fried rice. In the 21st century many, more traditional, Chinese ingredients are used. Tofu was once unheard of, but now is readily accepted. The majority of original Chinese migration came from Guangdong Province in southern China, and later from British Hong Kong, meaning Cantonese Cuisine has traditionally dominated Chinese Restaurants in Australia. This has included Yum-Cha, which has been popular to serve in the more upmarket Chinese Restaurants in Australia. The ingredients favour fresh vegetables and fruit, with fish, poultry, and pork, with rice, herbs and spices. The Dim Sim, a popular snack throughout Australia, was inspired by Cantonese Cuisine and invented by a Cantonese chef in Melbourne's Chinatown.

Since a young age Fuscarino has been involved in shaping public opinion and aiming to increase the rights for the LGBT community. In 2007, a public service announcement produced by Fuscarino won an Emmy award from the National Academy of Arts and Sciences for the way it approached the public perception of the LGBT community. In 2008, he founded The Pride Network. Previously, he worked at the Hudson Pride Connections Center and in 2013, he joined Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice. He is also a frequent writer and contributor to The Huffington Post and NJ.com on LGBTQ related matters. He joined Garden State Equality in 2016. His work with the LGBT community led him to be recognized by PolitikerNJ and The New York Observer in their Power 100 list in 2016. Early life Fuscarino grew up in Belmar, New Jersey. After moving to Maplewood, New Jersey, he attended Columbia High School, where he started organizing at local high schools.\\"How guts, grit and gusto helped one of N.J.'s most influential LGBT advocates change the game\\", Inside Jersey, July 25, 2018. Accessed July 3, 2019. \\"He moved with his mother to Maplewood, and once he got settled into Columbia High School, change is what he made.\\" He studied at Hofstra University. Career From a young age, Fuscarino has been an organizer and activist in the LGBT community. He began at GLSEN, an education network that aimed to improve students lives who were members of the LGBT community, by reducing discrimination and increasing knowledge through education. While at GLSEN, Fuscarino encouraged young LGBT students to start Gay‚Äìstraight alliance's in their schools. Fuscarino joined Hudson Pride Connections Center in 2007, based in New Jersey. He served as the program director for the center, helping the cities youth offering a number of LGBT-related services. His work during those years didn't go unnoticed, with Fuscarino winning an Emmy award. He was awarded by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for a public service announcement that was created by Fuscarino's team at the center. His involvement at the Hudson Pride Connections Center, led him to establish The Pride Network in 2008. The network serves as a non- profit, providing leadership development. After running The Pride Network for a number of months, Fuscarino joined the non-profit Bend the Arc in 2013 as their digital strategist. Bend the Arc at the time was headed up by Alan van Capelle, who had previously served as Executive Director of Empire State Pride Agenda. While working with Bend the Arc, he and van Capelle launched a campaign, which played a major role in the signing of the Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights in California. In 2016, it was announced that Fuscarino would join Garden State Equality's new Executive Director. Following the announcement, he was interviewed by The New York Observer, stating what he wanted to achieve as the new Executive Director. He stated, ‚Äúpeople all over the country are wondering what an organization in a post-marriage state looks like. They‚Äôll find out in New Jersey,‚Äù Mr. Fuscarino told PolitickerNJ. ‚ÄúOver the next few months we‚Äôll roll out our plan to engage the LGBT community in a broader social justice movement.‚Äù As director Fuscarino said that he wanted to tackle issues such as curbing HIV transmissions, protecting LGBT youth from opiate addiction, and care for the elderly. Senator Cory Booker and Congressman Frank Pallone both publicly voiced their support for Fuscarino following the appointment. After becoming the Executive Director for Garden State Equality, the PolitickerNJ listed Fuscarino in their Power 100. He was also 2nd highest LGBT New Jersey-based activist and politician on the list. In March 2017, Fuscarino spoke to the press following an attack on the Garden State Equality building where a window was smashed, where the rainbow flag was displayed. The attack, was similar to one carried out earlier in the same year at the Equality Florida headquarters. Vice Media's Broadly website listed Fuscarino as the most influential activist in the state of New Jersey.

It served on the Western Front in World War I. Reorganised between the wars, it was later converted to the anti-aircraft (AA) role. During World War II, part of the regiment served in the Siege of Malta but the rest was captured at the Fall of Tobruk. The reconstituted regiment served on in Anti-Aircraft Command until 1955 and as a unit of the Royal Engineers until 1967. Origin When the Territorial Force (TF) was created from the former Volunteer Force by the Haldane Reforms in 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. it was organised into regional infantry divisions, each with a full establishment of Royal Field Artillery (RFA) brigades. Where there were no suitable artillery volunteer units in the region, these brigades had to be created from scratch. This was the case for the North Midland Division, for which a new Howitzer brigade was raised in Derbyshire with the following composition:Frederick, p. 680.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 61‚Äì7.Conrad, British Army, 1914.Litchfield, pp. 39‚Äì41.MacDonald, p. 17.46th (NM) Division at Long, Long Trail.Monthly Amy List.RFA Btys (TF) at Regimental Warpath.Derbyshire Howitzer Btys at Wartime Memories Project. IV North Midland (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA * 1st (Derby and West Hallam) Howitzer Battery * 2nd (Derby) Howitzer Battery * IV North Midland (Howitzer) Ammunition Column The new brigade established its headquarters (HQ) at 91 Siddals Road in Derby, which it shared with C and D Squadrons of the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry.Derby at Drill Hall Project. The first Commanding Officer (CO), appointed on 1 April was Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Chandos-Pole-Gell of Hopton Hall, previously a Major in the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry.London Gazette, 31 July 1908. Most of the other officers were appointed on 6 August: the Officer Commanding (OC) of 1st Derby Bty was Major Lionel Guy Gisborne of Allestree Hall, who had seen service in the Second Boer War as a captain in the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry. Among the officers appointed to 1st Derby Bty were three Derbyshire County Cricket Club players: George Walkden, Guy Wilson and Henry FitzHerbert Wright. Wright, who later became an MP, was commissioned as a captain, the other two as 2nd lieutenants. The OC of 2nd Derby Bty was William Drury Drury-Lowe, a former Captain in the Grenadier Guards.London Gazette 11 December 1908. Lieutenant- Colonel Chandos-Pole-Gell retired in 1913 and was appointed Honorary Colonel of the brigade; Major Gisborne was promoted to succeed him, and was in command on the outbreak of World War I. World War I =Mobilisation= Territorial gunners training with a 5-inch howitzer before World War I. The order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. Shortly afterwards, the men were invited to volunteer for overseas service, and the majority having accepted this liability, the North Midland Division concentrated at Luton. In November, it moved to the area round Bishop's Stortford where it completed its war training. At the time of mobilisation, the two batteries of IV North Midland (H) Bde were each equipped with four BL 5-inch howitzers.Farndale, Western Front, p. 86. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way, duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The floods of recruits coming forward were enrolled in these 2nd Line units.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. Lieutenant-Colonel Chandos-Pole-Gell was brought out of retirement to command the 2/1st Staffordshire Infantry Brigade during its first weeks of training.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 17‚Äì23.Bradbridge, pp. 8, 115. =1/IV North Midland Brigade= The North Midland Division began embarking for France on 25 February 1915, and by 8 March had completed its concentration at Ploegsteert in Belgium ‚Äì the first complete TF division to deploy to the Western Front with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division shortly afterwards.MacDonald, p. 32. Hooge Over the following months, the artillery supported the infantry in routine trench warfare in the Ypres Salient. On 19 July, the Royal Engineers exploded a mine under the German positions at Hooge, but the infantry of 3rd Division tasked with seizing the crater had not been given a supporting artillery fireplan. As the infantry were being driven out by German artillery, counter-battery fire from 46th Division's guns and other neighbouring artillery helped to rectify the situation. When the Germans attacked the Hooge crater with flamethrowers on 30 July, 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade of 46th Division was able to stabilise the line with the help of the divisional artillery.Farndale, Western Front, p. 113.MacDonald, pp. 33‚Äì5. Hohenzollern Redoubt 46th Division's first offensive operation was the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. This was an attempt to restart the failed Battle of Loos, and the division was moved down from Ypres on 1 October for the purpose. The Germans recaptured the Hohenzollern trench system on 3 October, and the new attack was aimed at this point. The artillery bombardment (by the field guns of 46th and 28th Division, backed by heavy batteries) began at 12.00 on 13 October and the infantry went in at 14.00 behind a gas cloud. The attack was a disaster, most of the leading waves being cut down by machine gun and shell fire from German positions that had not been suppressed by the bombardment.Cherry, pp. 269‚Äì97.MacDonald, pp. 39‚Äì46.Rawson, pp. 120‚Äì8. On 23 December, the 46th (NM) Division was ordered to embark for Egypt. It entrained for Marseilles, and some of the infantry had actually reached Egypt before the order was rescinded on 21 January 1916. The artillery returned from Marseilles and the whole division reassembled on the Western Front near Amiens by 14 February. Reorganisation 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. 1/IV (NM) Brigade rearmed with 4.5-inch howitzers on 16 December 1915. A (H) Battery from CLIV (Empire) Howitzer Bde, a Kitchener's Army unit recruited from Croydon, joined the brigade from 36th (Ulster) Division on 28 February 1916, and was designated R (H) Bty on 8 March.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 61‚Äì9. On 1 May, the division was ordered into the line facing Gommecourt in preparation for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. Over the first 10 days of the month, the divisional artillery took over the existing battery positions along this front and began digging additional gun pits, observation posts (OPs) and dugouts to new designs.MacDonald, pp. 69, 80, 86. While preparing for the offensive, the divisional artillery were subjected to a thorough reorganisation that was affecting all the field artillery in the BEF. First the TF brigades were assigned numbers, 1/IV North Midland becoming CCXXXIII (233), and the 1st and 2nd Derby Howitzer Btys becoming A (H) and B (H) Btys on 13 May. The other three North Midland brigades, now numbered CCXXX, CCXXXI and CCXXXII (230‚Äì2), each formed an additional D battery. On 23 May, CCXXXIII (H) Bde transferred A (H), R (H) and B (H) Btys to the other three brigades, and in exchange received each of the other brigades' D Btys equipped with 18-pounder field guns. As a result, CCXXX, CCXXXI, and CCXXXII brigades now had three 18-pounder batteries and one 4.5-inch howitzer battery, but CCXXXIII (despite being the original howitzer brigade) had three newly-formed 18-pounder batteries (A from Lincolnshire, B and C from Staffordshire) but no howitzers. In addition, the brigade ammunition columns (BACs) were abolished and merged into 46th Divisional Ammunition Column (DAC).Frederick, p. 692.Farndale, Western Front, p. 130.Farndale, Western Front, Annex D.MacDonald, pp. 86, 108. In June, Lt-Col Gisborne was awarded a CB and Major (acting Lt-Col) Drury-Lowe, commanding 2nd Derby Bty, received a DSO, but in July Drury-Lowe returned to the Grenadier Guards and reverted to his former rank of captain. He was killed in action in September 1916.Drury-Lowe discussion at Great War Forum. Gommecourt 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. Preparations were under way for the 46th and 56th (1st London) Divisions to carry out an Attack on the Gommecourt Salient as a diversion from the main offensive further south. 46th Division would attack from the north west, converging with 56th from the south west.Edmonds, pp. 456‚Äì62. On 18 June, 46th Divisional artillery was allocated its tasks for wire-cutting and registration of targets ahead of the attack. It was divided into two groups: CCXXXIII Bde was grouped with CCXXX Bde on the right under the latter's CO, while Lt-Col Gisborne was Right Group's liaison officer at 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which was to make the division's right attack towards Gommecourt Wood. Right Group had its batteries dug in west and south west of Gommecourt with a concentration of three batteries around Chateau de la Haye and three others scattered around Sailly-au-Bois and Foncquevillers intermixed with 56th Division's batteries. C/CCXXXIII Battery at the end was lined up with Left Group's guns just west of Foncquevillers. Right Group's responsibility was the German line from the westernmost tip of Gommecourt Park to a point just north of the Gommecourt‚ÄìFoncquevillers road.MacDonald, pp.165‚Äì7. 46th Division used a high proportion of its 18-pounder ammunition to bombard enemy trenches and lines of communication, and a smaller proportion (about 27 per cent) of shrapnel shells to cut German barbed wire. However, on the right of the attack, the ground sloped away from the trajectory of the guns, making it difficult to judge Fuze-settings for wire-cutting. A/CCXXXIII and C/CCXXXIII batteries were assigned to wire-cutting on 137th Bde's front.MacDonald, pp. 208‚Äì9, 277. Apart from the wire-cutting batteries, the divisional artillery was under the direction of VII Corps during the preliminary bombardment, which began on 24 June, but at zero hour it reverted to divisional control. Once the infantry went 'over the top' the field guns were to make a series of short 'lifts', almost amounting to a 'creeping barrage'.Edmonds, pp. 460‚Äì1.Farndale, Western Front, p. 147.MacDonald, pp 296. 302‚Äì3. A final 'whirlwind' bombardment by all the guns began at 06.25 on 1 July and at zero hour (07.30) 137th Brigade made its attack with 1/6th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment and 1/6th Bn North Staffordshire Regiment in the lead. Patrols had already established that the German wire was not adequately cut: there were four partially cut lanes on the South Staffs' front and five areas of weakened wire in front of the North Staffs. In addition, German casualties during the bombardment had been few because of their deep dugouts, and when the attack went in their men emerged to receive the attack with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from their trenches and from Gommecourt Wood. Held up by uncut wire in dead ground and by enemy fire, the brigade's leading two waves only reached the German first line and were forced to take cover in shell holes where they exchanged Grenade attacks with the Germans. The third wave was stopped by machine gun fire short of the first line. The British infantry were unable to keep up with the covering barrage of the 18-pounders, which was lifted onto each enemy trench line to a strict timetable: artillery observation during the attack was difficult due to the smoke and confusion. Meanwhile, the supporting waves were held up in the jumping-off trenches or in No man's land by enemy shellfire. The whole attack had halted in bloody failure by 08.00.Edmonds, pp. 465‚Äì7.MacDonald, pp. 293‚Äì343. Lieutenant-Colonel Gisborne and the commander of 137th Bde attempted to bring the barrage back so that a second attack could be launched by the supporting battalions (1/5th South Staffs and 1/5th North Staffs). At about 08.45 VII Corps ordered a renewed bombardment on Gommecourt Wood in which A and B/CCXXXIII Btys participated. But the support units were already inextricably held up by mud and shellfire in their own trenches and the attack was postponed several times. It was not until 15.30 that 137th Bde was ready to attack again. However, the neighbouring brigade never began the advance, and 137th Bde's officers called off the attack at the last minute.Edmonds, pp. 468‚Äì70.MacDonald, pp. 344‚Äì57, 418‚Äì23, 433‚Äì50. Disbandment The Gommecourt attack was a diversion, and it was not renewed after the first day's disaster. 46th Division remained in position while the Somme offensive continued further south throughout the summer and autumn.MacDonald, pp. 555‚Äì6. There was further reorganisation amongst divisional artillery, resulting in CCXXXIII Brigade being broken up on 29 August 1916 and distributed by sections so that the rest of the divisional artillery had 6-gun batteries. The two original Derbyshire Howitzer batteries, much reorganised, continued to serve as (D (H)/CCXXX Bty in 46th Divisional Artillery and D (H)/CCXXXII Bty in an Army Field Brigade) until the Armistice. =2/IV North Midland Brigade= De Bange 90 mm cannon issued to 2nd Line TF units. Meanwhile, the men who had not volunteered for foreign service, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained to form the 2/I North Midland Brigade, RFA, in the 2nd North Midland Division (59th (2nd North Midland) Division from August 1915), which concentrated round Luton in January 1915.59th (2nd NM) Division at Long, Long Trail. At first the 2nd Line recruits had to parade in civilian clothes and train with 'Quaker' guns ‚Äì logs of wood mounted on cart wheels ‚Äì but these shortages were slowly made up. Uniforms arrived in November 1914, but it was not until March 1915 that a few 90 mm French guns arrived for training. The division took over the requisitioned transport and second-hand horse harness when 46th Division was re-equipped and left for France. The divisional artillery were joined at Luton by the 1st Line 4th Home Counties (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA, and Wessex Heavy Bty, RGA, which were fully equipped and could lend guns for training. Later, the brigade took over some 5-inch howitzers. In July the division moved out of overcrowded Luton, the artillery moving to Hemel Hempstead, where they spent the winter of 1915‚Äì16. In early 1916 the batteries were finally brought up to establishment in horses, and 4.5-inch howitzers replaced the 5-inch howitzers.Bradbridge, pp. 8, 86‚Äì9, 115‚Äì7. Ireland In April 1916, the 59th Division was the mobile division of Central Force in England, and it was ordered to Ireland when the Easter Rising occurred, the divisional artillery landing at Kingstown on 28 April. The artillery moved up to Ballsbridge to support the infantry but was not engaged, and once the trouble in Dublin had been suppressed, the troops moved out to The Curragh to continue training.Bradbridge, pp. 9‚Äì12, 89‚Äì90, 117‚Äì8. As was the case with the RFA units in the BEF, the brigade went through major reorganisation at this time. On 29 April 1916, the batteries were designated A (H) and B (H), and later the brigade was numbered CCXCVIII (298). At the end of May the brigade was joined by 3 (H) Bty from LIX Bde, a Kitchener's Army unit with 11th (Northern) Division, which became C (H) Bty. On 10 July, all three batteries were exchanged for 2/1st Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), 2/1st Essex RHA, and 2/1st Glamorganshire RHA, which had recently joined the other three RFA brigades of 59th Division (CCXCV, CCXCVI and CCXCVII Bdes respectively). These RHA batteries were each equipped with four 18-pounder field guns rather than horse artillery guns, and the brigade lost its Howitzer designation. In July, the BAC was merged into the 59th DAC.Bradbridge, pp. 89‚Äì90, 118. Western Front In January 1917, the 59th Division was relieved in Ireland and returned to the UK, concentrating at the Fovant training area on the edge of Salisbury Plain preparatory to embarking for France. Before leaving Ireland, 2/1st Glamorgan RHA was split between the other two batteries to bring them up to six guns each. A new C (H) Bty was formed, but quickly broken up, to be replaced by D (H)/CCXCVII (the former 3 (H)/LIX). 59th Division began crossing to France on 17 February 1917 and concentrated around M√©ricourt. The last unit battery of CCXCVIII Bde arrived at Le Havre on 17 March, the day the Germans began their retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich). The brigade immediately took part in following this retreat in March and April.Bradbridge, pp. 90‚Äì2, 118‚Äì9. On 4 April 1917, CCXCVIII Bde left 59th Division to become an Army Field Brigade. At the same time, C (H) Bty was transferred away to Fourth Army, to be replaced on 12 April by A/CCCXXXII Bty (originally 2/18th Lancashire Bty) from 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. Finally, D (H) Bty joined from Fourth Army Artillery on 1 August 1917 to complete the brigade to the organisation it kept for the remainder of the war: * A (2/1 Hampshire) Bty * B (2/1 Essex) Bty * C (2/18 Lancashire) Bty * D (H) Bty Messines Messines Ridge from Hill 63 by George Edmund Butler. The role of an Army Field Artillery (AFA) brigade was to reinforce sectors of the front as required, without breaking up divisional artilleries. After a period of rest, CCXCVIII Bde joined VIII Corps in a quiet area on 21 April before moving to 23rd Division in X Corps on 24 May as it was preparing for the Battle of Messines. The AFA brigades were moved into the area in secrecy, a battery at a time. Ammunition dumps had been formed containing 1000 rounds for each 18-pounder and 750 for each 4.5-inch howitzer, together with thousands of rounds of gas and smoke shells. The preparatory bombardment began on 26 May and the creeping barrage was practised on 3 and 5 June, inducing the Germans to reveal many of their own batteries, which were then bombarded. The guns ceased fire at 02.40 on 7 June and then the attack was launched at 03.10 with the firing of a series of massive mines under the Messines Ridge. The infantry advanced behind a creeping barrage (about two-thirds of the 18-pounders) protected by a standing barrage (the 4.5-inch howitzers and remaining 18-pounders) in front. Once the infantry reached their objectives, the creeping barrage became a protective barrage 150‚Äì300 yards ahead of them while they consolidated their positions. The plan worked to perfection, and there was scarcely any opposition to the initial attack from the stunned defenders. Some field batteries then moved forward into the old no-man's land to extend the protective barrage. This smashed the first German counter-attack launched at 14.00, and the British second phase attack was launched in the afternoon, taking its objectives.'Allocations of Army Brigades, RH & RFA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 182, 195.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 184‚Äì91.Wolff, pp. 111‚Äì9. Third Ypres 18-pounder in mud during the Third Ypres offensive, 1917 The brigade continued supporting 23rd and 24th Divisions in X Corps until 4 July when Fifth Army's II Corps took over that sector of the front. It supported 24th Division during the early phases of the Third Ypres Offensive, which opened with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July. Once again the field guns supplied the creeping barrage and standing barrage. Attacking towards 'Shrewsbury Forest', 24th Division got held up and left behind as the barrage advanced to timetable. The rest of the attack was a partial success, but II Corps' failure led to the development of a dangerous salient. Casualties among the gunners rose over the following days as they struggled amongst the mud to bombard the German line for a second attack (the Battle of Langemarck, 16‚Äì18 August).Becke, Pt 4, pp. 141‚Äì2.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 201‚Äì4.Wolff, pp. 157‚Äì62. 24th Division and CCXCVIII AFA Bde reverted to X Corps in Second Army on 28 August, and the gunners were rested from 8 to 17 September. The brigade was assigned to XVIII Corps in Fifth Army for the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20‚Äì25 September) in which it supported 58th (2/1st London) Division. New artillery tactics involved five belts of fire, the first two fired by 18-pounders, the third by 4.5-inch howitzers, moving at a slow pace with frequent pauses to allow the infantry to keep up. Batteries also had the task of swinging off to engage targets of opportunity, and had spare detachments to avoid exhaustion of the gunners. The barrage was described as 'magnificent both in accuracy and volume', German counterattacks were broken up by shellfire, and the attack was a resounding success.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 240‚Äì1.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 205‚Äì8.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', in Liddle, pp. 219‚Äì222.Martin, p. 72.Wolff, pp. 191‚Äì5. CCXCVIII AFA Brigade supported XVIII Corps' divisions through the following phases of the offensive, the battles of Polygon Wood (26 September‚Äì3 October), Broodseinde (4 October), Poelcappelle (9 October), 1st Passchendaele (12 October) and 2nd Passchendaele (26 October), where the conditions became increasingly impossible and the quality of artillery support diminished. The brigade was withdrawn for rest on 28 October before the fighting was over.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 208‚Äì14.Wolff, pp. 199‚Äì212, 222‚Äì42, 252‚Äì9. Spring Offensive In November, the brigade reverted to II Corps, and then moved in December to V Corps, where it supported 63rd (Royal Naval) Division from 21 December to 11 January 1918, including the action at Welch Ridge (30‚Äì31 December). It next joined III Corps, but was rested until 28 February when it was assigned to 14th (Light) Division. This formation was thinly spread along a stretch of line recently taken over from the French army, and quickly crumbled when it was attacked on the first day of the German Spring Offensive (21 March 1918). The divisional field artillery lost all their guns but the divisional artillery commander kept a composite force, including CCXCVIII AFA Bde and various heavy artillery batteries, in action until 29 March supporting 'Reynolds's Force' even after 14th Division had been withdrawn.Becke, Pt 3a, p. 47.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 150, 165.Blaxland, pp. 41‚Äì2.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 262‚Äì5.Middlebrook, pp. 274, 326‚Äì7.Murland, pp. 48‚Äì52. Hundred Days Offensive After the 'Great Retreat' of March 1918, CCXCVIII AFA Bde spent 31 March to 9 April 1918 refitting, before returning to the line with 58th Division in time for the fighting round Villers-Bretonneux. During this battle the brigade transferred to the neighbouring 5th Australian Division, and went with that formation to the Australian Corps. It remained with the Australians in Fourth Army throughout the summer of 1918, supporting different Australian divisions or acting as mobile Corps reserve during the Battle of Amiens (8 August) and the Second Battle of the Somme (21 August‚Äì2 September). The keynote of these attacks was thorough preparation and execution of the artillery fireplan, and then rapid movement of the field batteries behind the advancing infantry.Blaxland, pp. 124‚Äì31.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 284, 287‚Äì90, 295.Martin, pp. 132‚Äì47. On 13 September 1918, the brigade transferred to IX Corps, which had been reconstituted in Fourth Army to take a leading role in the continuing Hundred Days Offensive. IX Corps assigned it to 1st Division for the Battle of √âpehy (18 September), the attack on The Quadrilateral and Fresnoy (24 September), the Battle of St Quentin Canal (29 September‚Äì2 October) and the Battle of the Beaurevoir Line (3‚Äì5 October). It was rested for a while, then went back into the line supporting 1st and 32nd Divisions in the Battle of the Selle (16‚Äì20 October). After another short rest, it caught up with 46th (North Midland) Division in time for the Battle of the Sambre (4‚Äì8 November), when the division advanced on 7 November to seize the Avesnes road. As 138th (Lincoln & Leicester) Bde advanced up the road, CCXXXI (2nd North Midland) and then CCXCVIII AFA Bdes put down concentrations of fire on the main points of resistance and the Germans began to withdraw.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 190‚Äì1.Blaxland, pp. 222‚Äì4, 232‚Äì8, 254.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 520.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 298‚Äì308, 318. Most of IX Corps, including CCXCVIII AFA Bde, halted for rest on 9 November having advanced more than 50 miles since it came into the line in September. It was still resting when the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November. Interwar When the TF was reformed in 1920, RFA brigades standardised on an establishment of three field and one howitzer battery: 3rd and 4th North Midland Bdes were combined into a single unit consisting of the two Derbyshire batteries from the 4th and the 5th and 6th Staffordshire Batteries from the 3rd. Although the unit was briefly referred to as the 3rd North Midland Bde, its HQ was at Siddal's Road, Derby, and continued the lineage of the old 4th; it remained part of 46th (North Midland) Division. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the brigade was redesignated as 62nd (North Midland) Brigade with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 517.Litchfield, p. 211.Titles and Designations, 1927. * 245 (Derby) Bty * 246 (Derby) Bty (Howitzers) * 247 (Wolverhampton) Bty * 248 (West Bromwich) Bty In 1924, the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) and its brigades were redesignated 'Field Brigades'. TA units each had a Regular Army adjutant; 62nd (NM) Fd Bde's adjutant during the early 1930s was Brevet Major William Revell-Smith, MC, who went on to become Major General, AA, in 21st Army Group during World War II.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex J.Revell-Smith at Generals of World War II. =Anti-aircraft conversion= During the 1930s, the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA units and formations to the AA role. 46th (North Midland) Division became 2nd AA Division in 1936 and many of its infantry battalions and artillery brigades were subsequently converted to AA gun or searchlight roles. 62nd Field Brigade was converted on 10 December 1936: Regimental HQ (RHQ) and the two Derby batteries reorganised as 68th (North Midland) AA Regiment (the RA adopted the designation 'regiment' instead of 'brigade' for a lieutenant-colonel's command on 1 January 1939) while the two Staffordshire batteries left to form the basis of 73rd AA Regiment at Wolverhampton. The new regiment had the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì6, 772. 68th (North Midland) AA Regiment * RHQ at Siddall's Road, Derby * 200 (Derby) AA Bty at Derby * 222 (Derby) AA Bty at Derby * 270 (Wentworth) AA Bty at Rotherham, formed 1 November 1938 However, this organisation was short-lived: on 7 March 1939, 270 Bty left to be part of a new 92nd AA Regiment forming at Pontefract and Rotherham, but this regiment was never completed and instead the Bty joined 91st AA Rgt. Meanwhile, 68th (NM) AA Rgt was completed by two new batteries, 276 and 277, raised in Nottingham on 1 April 1939. The regiment formed part of 32nd (Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade based in Derby, which came under the command of 2nd AA Division.AA Command 3 Sep 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II Mobile 3.7-inch gun in 1939. =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939, the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 200 (Derby) AA Battery joined 69th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) AA Rgt soon after the outbreak of war. =Battle of Britain= At the time of mobilisation, 2 AA Division only had six heavy AA guns ready for action at Derby and another six at Nottingham, but, by 11 July 1940, at the start of the Battle of Britain, this had risen to 40 at Derby and 16 at Nottingham. A new 50 Light AA Bde had taken over responsibility for these two Gun Defended Areas (GDAs) and 68th AA Rgt had been joined by detachments from 78th AA Rgt to man some of the guns.Routledge, Table LIX, p. 377.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 105; Annex D. At the same time, at the height of invasion fears after the Dunkirk evacuation, AA Brigades were required to form mobile columns available to combat enemy paratroopers. 50th LAA Bde's column called 'Macduff' consisted of one battery from 68th AA Rgt and one searchlight company to operate directly under 2 AA Division. In addition, Brigade HQ ordered all AA units to cooperate with field forces or the Local Defence Volunteers (LDVs, later called the Home Guard) by providing fighting patrols and guards when they could not perform their primary AA role. 68th AA Regiment was provided with 60 riflemen from training regiments to supplement its own spare men for these fighting patrols, who were instructed to 'meet guile with guile' to 'ruthlessly hunt down' highly trained German paratroopers. In the event there were no landings and the patrols were soon stood down.50 AA Bde Operation Instruction No 13 of 16 June 1940 in 41 (5NSR) AA Bn War Diary 1939‚Äì40 TNA file WO 166/3059.365 AA Coy (41 AA Bn) War Diary July 1940, TNA file WO 166/3208.Routledge, p. 382. On 1 June 1940, along with other AA units equipped with 3-inch, 3.7-inch or larger guns, the 68th was designated a Heavy AA (HAA) Regiment, to distinguish it from the new Light AA (LAA) units being formed. The Midlands were barely affected during the Battle of Britain, though the Derby Barrage fired for the first time on 19 August 1940,41 (5NSR) AA Bn War Diary 1939‚Äì40 TNA file WO 166/3059. and a series of night raids on Liverpool late in the month passed overhead.Collier, Appendix XV. 68th HAA Regiment did not remain in its home area during the night-bombing Blitz that followed the Luftwaffe 's defeat in the Battle of Britain. It had been rostered for overseas service and left AA Command. As the war establishment for HAA regiments overseas was three batteries, 222 HAA Bty was detached and sent on as an independent battery to Malta, while the rest of the regiment went to Egypt soon afterwards. In December, the newly-formed 113th HAA Rgt arrived to take over the Nottingham guns.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1940-41, TNA file WO 166/2403. =Siege of Malta= Malta had been under air attack since the day Italy entered the war (11 June 1940) and urgently needed AA reinforcements. As part of Operation Coat a convoy sailed from Liverpool on 30 October carrying two independent HAA batteries: 222 and 191 (which had similarly been detached from 69th (Warwickshire) HAA Rgt), one LAA battery (59 from 19th LAA Rgt), and spare AA guns and gun barrels. At Gibraltar, the convoy collected RHQ of 10th HAA Rgt, which had been formed in that garrison in December 1939. The convoy sailed on from Gibraltar on 7 November and the troops disembarked in Malta on 10 November and joined the garrison. 10th HAA Regiment took over command of 199 and 222 HAA Btys. The rest of 69th HAA Rgt mobilised for overseas service in November, but the order was rescinded, and only 190 HAA Bty sailed, reaching Malta in January and joining 10th HAA Rgt.Anon, pp. 4‚Äì5.Playfair, pp. 119, 219, 241.Rollo, pp. 205, 280.Rollo, Annex A.Routledge, p. 167.69 HAA Rgt War Diary 1939‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/2360. HMS Illustrious (right of crane) under attack. By January 1941, theLuftwaffe had joined the Regia Aeronautica in attacks on Malta.Playfair, Vol II, p. 44. On 11 January the damaged aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious came into Grand Harbour for repairs. The Luftwaffe laid on a major air raid (possibly 50 Junkers Ju 88 and 20 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka 's) on 16 January to finish off the carrier, but the AA guns on the island had been re-sited to defend the ship alongside Parlotorio Wharf with a 'box' barrage, and the raiders suffered heavily. A second raid made two days later was also disrupted by the defences. Only one bomb hit the ship, but the adjacent towns were badly hit, and nearby ships and AA positions suffered casualties. On 19 January, the Luftwaffe tried again, with a diversionary raid on Luqa airfield, but Illustrious made her way to Alexandria under her own steam on 23 January.Anon, pp. 6‚Äì7.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 169.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 319‚Äì23.Playfair, Vol II, p. 46. Leslie Cole; depicting an AA gun (in the centre of the composition) firing during a night air raid. In February, the Luftwaffe 's Fliegerkorps X was ordered to neutralise Malta, and it began a series of heavy bombing raids, mainly at night, accompanied by mine-dropping in and around the harbour, and daylight sweeps by Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engined fighters. In March, there was dive-bombing against the RAF airfields, and attacks on a supply convoy on 23 March. The HAA guns were engaged almost every day, taking a steady toll of the bombers. By the beginning of June, the depleted Fliegerkorps X handed responsibility back to the Italians.Anon, pp. 7‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 47‚Äì51. Service personnel and civilians clear up debris on a heavily bomb-damaged street in Valletta, Malta, on 1 May 1942. From April 1941, the regiment, together with 7th HAA Rgt and the Royal Malta Artillery HAA, came under 7 AA Brigade covering the south half of the island, while 10 AA Brigade took the north. This arrangement was found not to work, and soon 7 AA Bde took over all the LAA and S/L defences, and 10th AA Bde commanded the HAA guns, including 10th HAA Rgt, which defended the RAF airfields. New guns and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar also arrived on the island.Anon, p. 8.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex F.Rollo, Annex C.Rollo, Annex E.Playfair, Vol III, p. 179.Routledge, p. 168. Tracer fire and shellbursts over Grand Harbour during a night air raid. Malta was largely left alone during the summer of 1941, but attacks resumed in November 1941 after Fliegerkorps II arrived in Sicily. Air raids were increasingly common during November and December, and rations and supplies began to run short.Anon, pp. 9‚Äì11.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 108, 118, 174.Routledge, p. 169. At the turn of the year, 10 HAA Bde instituted a policy of rotating its units to maintain freshness. 10th HAA Rgt exchanged with 7th HAA Rgt and took responsibility for defending Fort Manoel and Grand Harbour. At this point, it manned 4 x 4.5-inch guns, 16 x 3.7-inch and 4 x 3-inch guns.Anon, pp. 10‚Äì11.Routledge, Table XXVII, p. 174; Map 7. The Luftwaffe continued to pound the island, concentrating on the harbour and airfields, usually with raids of 15 Ju 88s escorted by 50 or more fighters. By now the RAF fighter strength had been reduced to a handful of aircraft, and the AA guns were the main defence. March and April 1942 were the period of the heaviest air raids on Malta, with well over 250 sorties a day on occasions. In April 1942, the Luftwaffe switched tactics to Flak suppression, with particular attention being paid to the HAA gunsites.Anon, pp. 12‚Äì6.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 158, 162, 170‚Äì1, 178‚Äì9. On the last day of April the Regia Aeronautica rejoined the attack ‚Äì which the AA gunners took as a sign that the Luftwaffe was suffering badly. By now each HAA regiment on Malta was rationed to 300 rounds per day and replacement gun barrels were scarce. When the fast minelayer HMS Welshman ran in ammunition supplies on 10 May (part of Operation Bowery), the most intense AA barrage yet fired was provided to protect her while unloading. After that, Axis air raids tailed off during the summer, apart from a flare-up in July.Anon, pp. 22‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 187‚Äì8, 193‚Äì4, 314. By October, the Luftwaffe had reinforced Fliegerkorps II, and a new round of heavy raids began, using new low-level tactics. However, these attacks also lost heavily to the AA guns and RAF fighters, despite the increasing shortages of food and supplies on the island. At last, in November Welshman and her sister ship HMS Manxman appeared, followed by a supply convoy. With the Axis defeat at Alamein and the Allied North Africa landings the same month, the siege of Malta was ended. The only enemy air activity for the rest of the year was occasional high-flying reconnaissances and one raid on Luqa in December.Anon, pp. 26‚Äì7.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 194‚Äì200. =Tobruk= A 3.7-inch HAA gun in the Western Desert. The rest of 68th (NM) HAA Rgt disembarked at Port Said in Egypt on 22 April 1941 with 200, 276 and 277 HAA Btys, under the command of Lt-Col F. Horlingham.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 168. It joined 2 AA Bde defending the Suez Canal and the harbours of Port Said and Port Suez at either end, which were vital to the flow of supplies and reinforcements to the army in the Western Desert. By October 1941, the Suez Canal defences had absorbed 72 HAA guns, while another 40 (including the eight 3.7-inch guns of 277 HAA Bty) were defending the port of Alexandria.Joslen, p. 482.Routledge, p. 134; Table XXII, p. 143. At the end of 1941, the regiment joined Eighth Army for its new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader), which began in November and succeeded in ending the Siege of Tobruk. 68th HAA Regiment was moved up to defend the captured port of Benghazi. The first phase of 'Crusader' lasted until January 1942, when General Erwin Rommel counter-attacked. Benghazi was lost again on 29 January and Eighth Army fell back and dug in along the Gazala Line.Joslen, p. 486.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 78, 140, 151, 197.Routledge, pp. 135‚Äì7. There was then a lull in the fighting until May, while both sides reorganised.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 197‚Äì205. By 12 May 1942, RHQ 68 HAA Rgt and 277 HAA Bty were defending the port of Tobruk under 4 AA Bde, 276 HAA Bty was with 12 AA Bde defending fighter landing grounds for the Desert Air Force, and 200 HAA Bty was at the army's railhead at Fort Capuzzo.Order of Battle, Eighth Army, May‚ÄìJune 1942, TNA file WO 201/692. On 22 May, the regiment was joined in Tobruk by 107 LAA Bty from 27th LAA Rgt, which formed the sole LAA defence of the harbour.107 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 169/4937. The Battle of Gazala began on 26 May, and Rommel's Axis forces quickly broke into the British position and began attacking the defensive 'boxes'. After bitter fighting in the Gazala Line and the 'Cauldron', Eighth Army was forced to retreat. The British hoped to defend Tobruk as in the previous siege, but the Axis forces reached it before the defences were ready.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223‚Äì67. The attack on Tobruk began on 20 June. After the preliminary air bombardment, Axis tanks made rapid progress through the perimeter defences. The 3.7-inch HAA guns had been deeply dug in for protection against dive- bombing, but a four-gun troop of 277 HAA Bty found themselves faced with action at short notice against Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks of 21st Panzer Division driving down the escarpment from 'King's Cross' towards the harbour. The gunners stripped down the walls of their emplacements to permit low-angle fire and engaged the tanks with armour-piercing and high explosive rounds. Together with some South African field guns and medium guns, the position held up a Panzer battalion for four hours and knocked out four tanks, but the outcome was inevitable and the AA positions were 'overrun by swarms of enemy infantry'. Rommel himself referred to the 'extraordinary tenacity' of the strongpoint.Routledge, p. 140.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 267‚Äì9. Tobruk surrendered the following day, and around 33,000 Allied troops were captured. 68th HAA Regiment lost its HQ, 277 HAA Bty, and its attached detachments of the Royal Corps of Signals, the Royal Army Service Corps, and workshop section of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.List of units captured in Tobruk 21 June 1942, TNA file WO 201/690.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 273‚Äì4. After the fall of Tobruk, the Eighth Army retreated in confusion beyond Fort Capuzzo and the Egyptian frontier, with artillery of all sorts involved in rearguard actions. The Axis advance was finally halted at El Alamein.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 281, 288‚Äì97, 331‚Äì5. It is not clear how much of 68th HAA Rgt's detached batteries survived the retreat. In 21 September 1942, the remnants of the regiment were officially reduced to a cadre. =Reformed= After the Tobruk disaster, 222 HAA Bty stationed on Malta as part of 10th HAA Rgt was deemed 'to carry on the honour title, traditions and plate' of 68th (NM) HAA Rgt. On 17 June 1943, RHQ 10th HAA Rgt was officially disbanded and reformed as RHQ 68th (NM) HAA Rgt, with the same batteries: 222 from Derby, 190 and 191 from Birmingham.Rollo, p. 280.Joslen, pp. 464, 485. At the time, the regiment was manning 15 x 3.7-inch and 6 x 4.5-inch guns and formed part of a large AA concentration protecting the build-up of forces in Malta for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky):Rollo, pp. 282‚Äì5.Routledge, Table XXIX, p. 175. * 190 HAA Bty  XHE25 (Fleur-de-Lys or 'Flurry') ‚Äì 3 x static 4.5-inch Mk I, GL Mk II radar  XHE26 (Tal-Qroqq) -‚Äì 4 x static 3.7-inch Mk II * 191 HAA Bty  XHD17M (Ta ƒ†iorni, St Julian's) ‚Äì 3 x static 3.7-inch Mk II  XHE28 (Spinola Battery) ‚Äì 3 x static 4.5-inch Mk I, GL Mk I radar * 222 HAA Bty:  XHE27 (Naxxar) ‚Äì 4 x static 3.7-inch Mk II  XHE33 (Tal-Balal) ‚Äì 4 x mobile 3.7-inch Mk IA, GL Mk II radar Although the AA defences of Malta were progressively run down as units returned home or joined the campaigns in Sicily and later in mainland Italy,Anon, pp. 30‚Äì1.Rollo, p. 287. 68th HAA Rgt remained part of the permanent garrison of the island until the end of the war and beyond. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in Malta in December 1946 so that it could be officially reformed in the TA in the UK on 1 January 1947. (The personnel remaining in Malta became 36 HAA Rgt in the Regular RA.)36 HAA Rgt at British Army 1945 on. Postwar The regiment was reconstituted at Derby (with many of its Malta veterans returning) as 262 (North Midland) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment,Frederick, p. 998.Rollo, p. 297.235‚Äì265 RA Rgts at British Army 1945 on. forming part of 58 AA Bde (the former 32 (Midland) AA Bde).30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. The term '(Mixed)' was added to the designation on 1 July 1951, indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit. On 1 January 1954, without changing its title, the regiment absorbed 526 LAA Rgt, another unit based in Derby.520‚Äì563 RA Rgts at British Army 1945 on. This lasted until the disbandment of AA Command in March 1955 when there were wholesale mergers among TA units. 262 (NM) HAA Regiment was amalgamated with 579 (Royal Leicestershire Regiment) LAA Rgt and 585 (Northamptonshire Regiment) LAA/Searchlight Rgt to form 438 LAA Rgt. The new unit was organised as follows:Litchfield, pp. 139, 189.564‚Äì591 RA Rgts at British Army 1945 on.414‚Äì443 RA Rgts at British Army 1945 on. * RHQ at Leicester * P (North Midland) Bty at Derby * Q (Royal Leicestershire Regiment) at Leicester * R (Northamptonshire Regiment) Bty at Northampton The new regiment was relatively short-lived, being broken up on 1 May 1961, when the Royal Leicestershire and Northamptonshire batteries rejoined their parent infantry regiments. P Battery was converted to the Royal Engineers, becoming 438 (Derbyshire Artillery) Field Squadron in a newly formed 140 Corps Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers based in Nottingham.Frederick, p. 1013.337‚Äì575 RE Sqns at British Army 1945 on.118‚Äì432 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on. 140 Corps Engineer Rgt was disbanded in 1967 when the TA was reduced to the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, but elements contributed to the formation of the Derbyshire Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 297, 305. Insignia While stationed on Malta, 222 HAA Bty adopted an embroidered arm badge consisting of a white Maltese cross on a shield divided vertically in the Royal Artillery colours of red (left) and blue (right). This badge was subsequently adopted after the war by 262 HAA Rgt and continued in use with P Bty of 438 LAA Rgt. Honorary Colonel The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Brig H.A. Chandos-Gell, former CO, appointed 1 May 1913 * Hon Col C.C.

In 1927, bronze memorial plaques to the men of the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division who died in World War I were erected in the parish churches of the towns and cities most closely connected with the division, including All Saints' Church, Derby (which became Derby Cathedral that year), and Chesterfield Parish Church in Derbyshire.

His numerous works on religious, political and pedagogical subjects were a part of the Jadidist movement, and the newspaper Shura, which he created and published, was an important way of political discussion for Muslims in the late Empire. Life Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddin was born as son of a Mullah in the village of Kichuchat in the gouvernement Samara. He studied at the Maktab in his village, which his father led, and then at the Madrasa in the near village of Chelsheli. At the age of 30, he became Mullah and leader of the Madrasa in the village of Ilbek. In 1891, he was elected Qadi, meaning he became a member of the Russian religious administration for Muslims (Sobranie); he therefore moved to its seat in Ufa, where he administrated the extensive archive of the agency.Mahmud Tahir: Rizaeddin Fahreddin, in: Central Asian Survey (1989, Volume 8), p. 111-115. The Building of the Muslim Religious Administration in Ufa During the 1905 Russian Revolution, he submitted an extensive reform program to the Muftis of the Sobranie. This program, among other things, included the extension of the responsibility of the agency over the Kazakh Muslims. The Russian government refused the program due to the expected gain in power this centralization would have brought for the Muslims.Azade-Ay≈üe Rorlich: The Volga Tatars, Stanford 1986; p. 53-58. In 1906, Fakhreddin retired from his religious office and became editor of the Orenburg Newspaper Vaqt. During this period, he also became a close friend of Musa Bigiev.Ahmet Kanlidere: Reform within Islam. The Tajdid and Jadid Movement among the Kazan Tatars (1809‚Äì1917), Istanbul 1997; p. 50-52. Two years later, he started publishing his newspaper Shura, which became the longest-lived of the Tatar newspapers in the Russian Empire. After the Revolution of 1917, in 1921, he again took on a religious office and was Mufti of the European regions of Russia until his death in 1936. He avoided cooperating with the Soviets as much as possible.Charles Kurzman: Modernist Islam, 1840‚Äì1940. A Sourcebook, New York 2002, p. 33. Work As it was a part of Jadidism, Fakhreddins work was influenced by many other Djadids. For example, he studied at the Madrasa of ≈ûihabetdin M√§rcani for some time and later met the political activist JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´ during a journey in St. Petersburg. The Egyptian scholar Muhammad Abduh was another influence. Fakhreddin spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkic and Russian. He used Turki, which had been proclaimed by Ismail Gaspirali as common language for all Turkic people, but kept Tatar linguistic peculiarities. The Marjani Madrasha in Kazan Fakhreddin was an extremely productive author, who wrote more than sixty books during his life.Article in the Oxford Dictionary of Islam His most important work is a two-volume edition of biographies of Central Asian Scholars (Asar and Meshhur Irler), which he wrote while he was at the archive of the Muslim religious administration. On some of the depicted individuals (which include Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Ibn Taymiyyah) his work still remains the best source. He also published journalistic texts, books and essays on the general situation of Muslims in Russia, pedagogical works or on social debates (for example on women's education and family politics). His essay Rusya Muslimanlarining ihtiyachlari ve anlar haqinda intiqad, published in 1906, is a critique against the reform demands of the Ulama against the Russian rulers, which Fakhreddin regarded as too vague. According to Azade- Ay≈üe Rorlich, the importance of education for the overcoming of poverty and the possibility of a reconciliation of Islam and science were central parts of Fakhreddins world view. He saw the rise and fall of nations as directly connected to their belief systems and therefore believed that a renunciation of superstition and a return to the beginnings of Islam would be necessary for a Muslim renaissance. He also criticized the historical work of Ibn Khallikan due to his concentration on the doings of rulers and tried to honor the deeds of \\"normal\\" Muslims in his books and writings. Works (selection) He has been described as a \\"prolific writer who published more than sixty books and left many unpublished manuscripts in a wide range of disciplines including history, politics, law, and education.\\"John L.

Early years Georges Lesueur was born on 15 April 1834 in Bordeaux, Gironde. He attended the √âcole Polytechnique, and was engineer for various railway companies including the networks of the East of France, the North of Spain, the Trans-Siberian and the Trans-Saharan. Around 1860 he married Marie Martin. Their children were Andr√©e, Roger and Germaine Lesueur. Public works contractor As a public works contractor Lesueur directed construction of the port of Philippeville, which had been considered impossible, the port of B√¥ne, the Bougie ferry terminal, bridges over the Soummam and Seybouse rivers, and the port of Bizerte. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870 he formed his workers into armed companies to replace the regular troops who had been sent to metropolitan France. Although the government told him to suspend all public works, he continued them using his own money to avoid laying off workers. Lesueur became President of the Superior Council of the Constantine department, and Vice-President of the Superior Council of Algeria. He was a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Senator Lesueur was elected to the Senate on 5 January 1888 in the first round by 94 votes against 89 for the incumbent senator Dominique Forcioli. On 10 March 1888 there was a lengthy debate in the Senate on his election. Alfred Joseph Naquet disputed the validity of the ballot and pointed out irregularities such as visits by the Prefect of Constantine with Lesueur to several communes in the department and subsidies given to some communes on the eve of the election. However, the Senate ruled by 146 votes to 110 that the election was valid. In the Senate, Lesueur sat on the left and belong to the Republican Union group. He was a member of a number of committees, and was particularly concerned with defending Algerian interests. He abstained from voting on the military law. He voted for reestablishment of the district poll (13 February 1889), for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and for the process to be followed in the Senate against General Boulanger. Lesueur was member of the Customs Committee; the Railway Committee, of which he became Secretary in 1894, and the Finance Committee. He was rapporteur for many motions related to foreign trade, railways and shipping. He was secretary of the committee for improvements to the port of Saint- Nazaire, and secretary of the senatorial group of maritime interests. In 1893 Lesueur asked the government to reserve some types of industrial and agricultural activity to Algeria to reduce unemployment, He wanted to make Algeria the granary of France, and to make the Filfla marble quarries the rivals of Carrara. He served as Administrator Delegate to the Paris Stock Exchange and President of the jury of the Antwerp exhibition. The Soci√©t√© africaine de France (French African Society) was founded in 1888 as a learned society, but soon ran into difficulties. It was restored under the chairmanship of Lesueur in 1895 as a vehicle for propaganda of the colonial party, linked to groups such as the Syndicat fran√ßais du bassin du Tchad (French Syndicate of the Chad Basin). Lesueur did not run for reelection in 1897. He died in Paris on 13 January 1910 at the age of 75.

He was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and indefinitely confined at Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care in Penetanguishene. Murders In the span of four years, Johnson, an automotive store clerk and weightlifter who worked for Ford Motor Company of Canada in Talbotville, raped and strangled at least seven women in their apartments in London and Guelph. He would stalk his victims to their apartments, waiting until he thought they were asleep, gaining access to their apartments by scaling the outside walls, sometimes for many stories to enter. There, he attacked them, sometimes watching the women sleep before sexually assaulting and suffocating them. Aside from his murders, he non-fatally assaulted 11 other women in the same area. =Victims= * Mary-Catherine Hicks (20) * Alice Ralston (42) * Eleanor Hartwick * Doris Brown (49) * Diane Beitz (23) - Beitz's body was found on New Year's Eve, 1975, by her boyfriend James Britton, with whom she had been engaged to the previous night. She had been strangled with a brassiere and her hands tied behind her back with a nylon stocking. She had been raped after death. The Guelph police offered a $5,000 reward for any clues leading to the discovery of her killer, while also searching for a dark-coloured, four-door Buick automobile seen parked at the rear of the apartment building in the early morning. At the time of her murder, Johnson was visiting his father in Guelph, and knew of Beitz because his ex-wife used to live in the same apartment building. * Louella Jeanne George (23) - George was killed in April 1977, after Johnson climbed to her fourth-floor apartment balcony and barged in, raping and killing her on the spot. * Donna Veldboom (22) - Veldbloom, who lived in the apartment above Johnson's, was strangled to death in July 1977. Arrest, trial and imprisonment In July 1977, Russell Johnson was arrested on charges of murdering three of the women: Beitz, George and Veldbloom. According to Police Inspector Robert Young, the man, who had voluntarily admitted himself to the London Psychiatric Hospital in 1969 and diagnosed as a sexual deviant, had told him that he wouldn't have killed the girls if he had gotten proper medical treatment. At trial, Johnson claimed to have had an \\"uncontrollable urge\\" to rape and kill. In the beginning, Johnson plead not guilty for the three killings before the Ontario Supreme Court. Much to the surprise of the parties present, Russell additionally admitted to perpetrating four other homicides and 11 non-fatal assaults. As he demonstrated an incapability to grasp the harshness of the crimes, Johnson was found not guilty by reason of insanity and indefinitely confined to the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care. Aftermath The investigation surrounding Johnson's crimes was the costliest in Ontario's history, amassing at least $30,000 in expenses. Every year, Johnson applies for more lenient conditions at his facility, which is constantly battled over with the family members of his victims. He has been chemically castrated, and takes Lupron to reduce his testosterone. In 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeals rejected his plea to be moved to the Brockville Mental Health Centre.

Early life  Melentyeva was born on 24 January 1924 to a Karelian peasant family in the village of Pryazha. After graduating from secondary school in her village and completing nursing courses she worked as a nurse in a hospital in Segezha. She was an athletic person and enjoyed various sports, much like her future colleague Anna Lisitsyna. Partisan activities Melentyeva's partisan activities began in 1942. On 15 June Melentyeva went with fellow partisan Anna Lisitsyna and six other Komsomol members to Sheltozersky district, which was controlled by the Axis in order to conduct a reconnaissance-in-force mission and establish an underground Komsomol organization. When the plane that was supposed to bring the partisans back to friendly territory could not come the eight were told they would have to walk on foot across enemy lines to hand over documents containing the information they had gathered on the locations of Axis garrisons and names of individuals that were fighting for the Axis. During the crossing of the icy Svir River on 3 August 1942 her friend Anna Lisitsyna drowned, but Melentyeva managed to recover the documents Lisitsyna was carrying in her hat. Alone, Melentyeva wandered through the forest for five days without clothes, shoes, or food, carrying only the bundle of documents with her. On the sixth day she encountered the 272nd Infantry Regiment of the Red Army and was able to hand over the documents. In the summer of 1943 she was sent on another mission inside Axis-controlled territory; she was supposed to make contact with underground Komsomol committee she had helped establish in Sheltozersky and report back any information they had. After an informant had reported their activities to the Finnish military a standoff ensued, with Melentyeva firing on surrounding Finnish forces until she and the other surviving partisans were captured and taken prisoner. After refusing to answer the Finnish military's questions the partisans were shot at point-blank range inside a cellar on 2 July 1943. They were later buried in Topornaya Gora, Medvezhyegorsky District.  Recognition  Melentyeva was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 25 September 1943 by decree of the Supreme Soviet, the same day as Anna Lisitsyna. She was also a recipient of the Order of the Red Star. Her image is featured in the Petrozavodsk Gallery of Heroes, a street in Karelia was named in her honor, and there are several monuments and memorials to her throughout Karelia.

He withdrew from active participation in politics after resigning from the fractious and short-lived Communist Workers' Party (\\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\\" / KAPD) in 1922, but continued his contribution as an independent left of centre commentator-journalist. During the twelve Nazi years he was arrested at least twice, spending the final years of his life, between 1936 and 1943, in a succession of jails. Sources may also identify him by the pseudonym under which some of his contributions were published, as Albert Sigrist Sachs.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Alexander Schwab was born into a Protestant family in Stuttgart. He grew up in Danzig where his father Karl Julius Schwab, a musician and composer, was in charge of the music (\\"als Opernkappelmeister\\") at the city opera house. He attended a Gymnasium (secondary school) in Danzig and then moved on to study Philosophy, Germanistics, Classical languages, Applied Economics (\\"National√∂konomie\\"), Sociology and Civil law at Rostock, Jena, Heidelberg and Freiburg i.B.. At university he participated actively in the Freestudenthood, a grouping of students who were expressly not members of the more traditional student fraternities. He was also a member of the politically left-of-centre Wandervogel hiking movement. Alexander Schwab received his doctorate from Heidelberg University in 1913. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"The influence of consumption on the German furniture industry and production\\" (\\"Der Einflu√ü der Konsumtion auf M√∂belindustrie und M√∂belproduktion in Deutschland\\"), but when it was published two years later it was under the shorter title \\"M√∂belkonsumtion und M√∂belproduktion in Deutschland\\". = Young intellectual = For a year following the award of his doctorate, during 1913/14, Schwab taught at the Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf, a progressive school that had been founded by the controversial education pioneer Gustav Wyneken in the countryside south of Erfurt in 1906. Several historians describe Schwab during this period as one of the leading intellects of the influential Free German Youth movement. In October 1913 he participated in the first ever Free German Youth Day in the Hoher Mei√üner hills north of Frankfurt. In the months before the war he also involved himself in conceptualising and organising democratically elected \\"General Student Committees\\" (\\"Allgemeiner Studenten-Aussch√ºsse\\"). Around this time Schwab and some of his intellectual friends rented a large house in Jena and embarked on what was seen at the time as a remarkable experiment in cohabitation, whereby four unmarried young men and four unmarried young women all lived together in the one house. On 8 May 1914 the unmarried status of two members of the cohabiting community ended when Alexander Schwab married Dr Hildegard Felisch: it was her twenty-fifth birthday. = War and ... political idealism = At the end of July 1914 war broke out. Alexander Schwab lost little time in volunteering for the army. He was very quickly rejected for military service, however, on account of a pulmonary hemorrhage (\\"Lungen-Blutsturz\\"). He was instead sent to a desk job in the war supplies department. Later he found himself working in Dresden at the \\"Jasmatzi\\" cigarette factory. Despite having volunteered for military service in 1914, by 1918 Alexander Schwab had joined the anti-war movement. He became friendly with the radical socialist educationalist Otto R√ºhle (1874‚Äì1943) and with the young artist Conrad Felixm√ºller. In 1917 Schwab joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) which had broken away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) following an intensification of internal party ructions over funding for the war. The next year he joined the Spartacus League: he was numbered among the close friends of the movement's best-known founders, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. = Communist Workers' Party of Germany = At the end of the year the Communist Party of Germany emerged from the USPD, founded formally at a three-day conference in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. Schwab found himself on the left wing of the Communist Party, collaborating closely with Karl Schr√∂der (1884‚Äì1950). Beyond the world of party politics, directly following the revolutions of 1918/19, he teamed up with the teacher Frieda Winckelmann (1873‚Äì1943) and others to set up a \\"Free academy community for proletarians\\" (\\"Freie Hochschulgemeinde f√ºr Proletarier\\") from which emerged, in the first part of 1919, the \\"Soviet school of the Greater Berlin labour movement\\" (\\"R√§teschule der Gro√ü-Berliner Arbeiterschaft\\"). Barely two years later the institution became insolvent and was taken over by the trades unions. The parties of the left were prone to fragment during this period, and in 1920 Alexander Schwab and his friend Karl Schr√∂der were founder members of the Communist Workers' Party (\\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\\" / KAPD), becoming a leading ideological strategist of its Berlin group. In June/July 1921 he led the KAPD delegation to the third world congress of the Communist International (Comintern), held in Moscow. He was sharply critical of Comrade Lenin's political tactics in respect of western Europe: the speeches he contributed were published in the congress minutes, using the cover name \\"Sachs\\" to identify him. = Progressive journalist = After the Moscow congress there was a cooling in relations between Schwab's wing of the KAPD and the Comintern headquarters, based in Moscow. Back in Germany his friend and political ally Karl Schr√∂der was removed from his position as head of a major group within the KAPD in 1922. This was part of a more general reconfiguration of the party, and Alexander Schwab himself left the party later that year. The party's two principal strands staggered on, increasingly divided between themselves, for a few more years, but Schwab now removed himself from direct engagement with party politics. He supported himself as a freelance journalist and author specialising in economics, and increasingly also in architecture. Some of his output appeared under the pseudonym \\"Albert Sigrist\\". Publications in which his contributions appeared most frequently included the Berliner Tageblatt, the Berliner B√∂rsen-Zeitung and Das Neue Berlin (newspapers). From 1927 he was also writing on architecture for \\"Die Form\\", the journal of the Deutscher Werkbund (loosely: \\"German Craft Association\\"). According to one commentator these contributions marked him out as \\"one of the most clear sighted writers on architecture of his time\\". From 1928 Schwab was also involved with the \\"Social Sciences Association\\" (\\"Sozialwissenschaftliche Vereinigung\\" / SWV), according to at least one source as one if its founders. His contributions at its meetings became progressively more frequent over the next few years. Several of his more prominent friends and contacts at this time were architects, on what would generally have been seen as the progressive wing of the profession. He teamed up with several, including Hugo H√§ring, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Martin M√§chler to produce \\"Das Buch vom Bauen\\", a book which appeared in 1930 under the pseudonym \\"Albert Sigrist\\". (Subsequent reprints have been published acknowledging Alexander Schwab's authorship on the cover.) Between 1928/29 and 1933 Alexander Schwab was employed as chief press spokesman for the National Institution for Unemployment Insurance (\\"Reichsanstalt f√ºr Arbeitslosenversicherung\\"). The position was one in which it became his duty to be confronted every day with the country's social, political and economic difficulties. = R√©gime change: dismissal and arrest = The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost very little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Schwab was dismissed from his job as a press spokesman under the provisions of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (\\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\\") enacted in April 1933. The law is frequently cited as an antisemitic device, which it was, but it was also directed at eliminating political opposition from the public services, and Schwab's very public political record would have been repugnant to the Nazis. That same month he was taken into \\"protective custody\\" by the Gestapo on account of suspected anti-state activities (\\"wegen des Verdachts staatsfeindlicher Umtriebe\\"). Sources vary as to the duration of this initial period of detention, which seems to have last for approximately two or six months. One source indicates that his (relatively) early release resulted from the personal intervention of his father-in-law, Dr. Paul Felisch, with Magnus von Levetzow, the Berlin police commissioner. As a former senior naval official (Admiralit√§tsrat), Paul Felisch was at this stage still not without influence within establishment circles. Even before 1933 Schwab had teamed up with old comrades from their KAPD days to form the secretive Rote K√§mpfer (\\"Red fighters\\") operation, an apparently broadly based association drawing members from various groups on the political left, intended to prepare for \\"underground opposition\\" in the event of a Nazi take-over. By its nature, details of the organisation are in short supply, but others involved in setting it up included Karl Schr√∂der, Arthur Goldstein and Bernhard Reichenbach. Schwab had been seriously considering emigration to Mexico. However, shortly after his release his wife Hildegard died, which some sources implicitly connect with his new determination to stay in Germany and engage in (illegal) political activity in opposition to the government. He joined with Franz Jung to launch \\"Wirtschaftskorrespondenz\\", a press agency with its focus on business news. It evidently filled a genuine niche in the market for this type of service, at one stage supplying regular economic news items to more than fifty newspapers, including V√∂lkischer Beobachter, the mass circulation daily newspaper of the ruling Nazi Party. The agency provided him with an income. In the words of one source, Schwab and Jung also \\"used [the agency] as a cover for [unspecified] underground political activity\\". = Arrest, interrogation and trial = It is not entirely clear when Alexander Schwab took over the national leadership of the shadowy Rote K√§mpfer (\\"Red fighters\\"). On at least one occasion, early in 1936 he crossed the border to Prague in order to arrange the production of a Rote K√§mpfer news sheet. While in Prague he received warnings not to return to Germany. He nevertheless returned to Berlin and, if he had not done so already, became the Rote K√§mpfer national leader. In the context of a wider round-up of the organisation's leadership, Alexander Schwab's office was surrounded by Nazi paramilitaries on 17 November 1936 and he was arrested. In the interrogations that followed he was badly tortured. At the session that took place on 21 November 1936 he was keen to take full responsibility for the Rote K√§mpfer on his own shoulders. He was, in particularly, determined to minimise the culpability attaching to Karl Schr√∂der, Franz Jung and, in particular, the younger members of the leadership team. It is one mark of his success that both Schr√∂der and Jung survived long enough to outlive the Nazi r√©gime. Jung, indeed, was released almost at once, and able to escape, via Prague, to Budapest. After about a year of \\"investigative detention\\", six members of the Rote K√§mpfer leadership, identified in the record as \\"Schwab and comrades\\" (\\"Schwab und Genossen\\"), faced trial before the \\"second senate\\" of the special \\"People's Court\\" in Berlin on 28, 29 and 30 October 1937. One of the defendants, Karl Schr√∂der, later shared some memories of the trial. The three judges did not appear to have backgrounds in the justice system. The third of them was a teacher who attempted to calculate a sentence for one of the defendants. He appeared unaware of the requirement to take account of pre-trial detention already served, but then wanted to reduce the sentence because the man to be sentenced had done some teaching, which sounded to him like a mitigating factor. When it was Schr√∂der's own turn to testify he found himself talking about a public meeting at which he had talked about \\"generational issues\\" (\\"Generationsfrage \\"). His testimony had to be paused while a colleague explained to the leading judge, \\"he means, sort of, between young and old\\" (\\"Er meint, so zwischen jung und alt.\\"). The three judges were evidently unable to get their heads around the fact that despite the defendants obviously being communists, they were also self evidently fervently anti-Bolshevik. According to Schr√∂der's not necessarily completely unbiased memories, he himself had so impressed the court that they came close to releasing him without further ado on the grounds that he was evidently \\"not entirely of sound mind\\" (\\"nicht ganz zurechnungsf√§hig\\"). In the end Schr√∂der received a four-year prison term. His health was ruined, but he nevertheless lived on till 1950. Of the six men facing the court it was Alexander Schwab who received the longest sentence, which seems to have reflected his continuing determination to absorb, as far as possible, the culpability that might otherwise attach to comrades. The court sentenced him to an eight-year jail term, being particularly concerned that \\"he had been writing for German newspapers while simultaneously working against the German state\\". Alexander Schwab was the only one of the six who would not survive his prison term. = Prison and death = During the ensuing years Schwab was held in prisons at Brandenburg, Zwickau and Sinnenburg. He also spend time in the Concentration Camp at B√∂rgermoor. At times he was subjected to severe physical abuses. It was at Zwickau that he died. The circumstances and cause of his death were never entirely clear. The prison authorities reported that he died of pneumonia.

API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, June 2016. Section 1A.83. In an article written by J. Bree in 1967,Bree, J. \\"Elastic-plastic behaviour of thin tubes subjected to internal pressure and intermittent high-heat fluxes with application to fast-nuclear-reactor fuel elements.\\" Journal of strain analysis 2.3 (1967): 226-238. the phenomenon of ratcheting is described as \\"Unsymmetric cycles of stress between prescribed limits will cause progressive ‚Äòcreep‚Äô or ‚Äòratchet(t)ing‚Äô in the direction of the mean stress\\". Ratcheting is a progressive, incremental inelastic deformation characterized by a shift of the stress-strain hysteresis loop along the strain axis.Roesler, J. Harders, H. Baeker, M. Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials: Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, and Composites, Springer (2007). . When the amplitude of cyclic stresses exceed the elastic limit, the plastic deformation that occurs keep accumulating paving way for a catastrophic failure of the structure. Nonlinear kinematic hardening, which occurs when the stress state reaches the yield surface, is considered as the main mechanism behind ratcheting. Several factors influences the extent of ratcheting including the load condition, mean stress, stress amplitude, stress ratio, load history, plastic slip, dislocation movement, and cells deformations. The effect of structural ratcheting can sometimes be represented in terms of the Bree diagram.Ratcheting and Cyclic Plasticity Considerations for Code Analysis https://www.lehigh.edu/~ak01/ratcheting/ratcheting.pdf Alternative material models have been proposed to simulate ratcheting, such as Chaboche, Ohno-Wang, Armstrong‚ÄìFrederick, etc. Ratcheting is a significant effect to be considered to check permanent deformation in systems which undergoes a cyclic loading. Common examples of such repetitive stresses include sea waves, road traffic, and earthquakes. Initially it was studied to inspect the permanent deformation of thin, nuclear fuel cans with an internal pressure and temperature gradient while undergoing repetitive non-zero mean stresses.

He was primarily known for being the former Director of Drama at The Juilliard School and the former artistic director of Signature Theatre Company.  Early life  James Houghton was born in San Francisco, California to mother Joan Heaney, a preschool teacher and dental assistant, and father Sherrill Houghton, a school administrator. He first found his love of theatre at St. Ignatius Preparatory School, a Jesuit school in the Bay Area. There, he started his own theatre company with friends called Overeasy Productions at age 18. Then, Houghton attended Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas as young actor, and directly after college auditioned for John Houseman and gained a spot in his prestigious group, The Acting Company.Celia McGee,\\"Juilliard Recasts the Role of Mentor\\" , New York Times, May 6, 2007. Houghton was married to actress Joyce O'Connor with whom he had two children, Henry and Lily.Ben Brantley, \\"James Houghton: The ‚ÄòSamurai Spirit‚Äô of Signature Theater\\" , New York Times, July 1, 2016.  Career  = Acting and Directing = While in New York City early in his career, Houghton worked as an actor, director, waiter and carpenter. = Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center = Houghton became the artistic director of the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut from 2000-2003. Here, he developed plays by Kia Corthron, Gina Gionfriddo, David Lindsay-Abaire, and Adam Rapp among others. = Signature Theatre Company = When he was working with Romulus Linney, he first got the idea for Signature Theatre Company to showcase one playwright for an entire season. Featuring Linney, the first season starting in 1991 had 6 shows in an 87-seat house and spent $35,000. In the 1994-1995 season, they featured playwright Horton Foote and produced The Young Man From Atlanta, which later was produced on Broadway and won a Pulitzer Prize.Bruce Weber, \\"James Houghton, Founder of Signature Theater, Showcase for Playwrights, Dies at 57\\" , New York Times, August 3, 2016. Signature would go on to feature playwrights such as Edward Albee, Arthur Miller, Adrienne Kennedy, Maria Irene Fornes, and more recently the likes of Athol Fugard and Annie Baker.Charles Isherwood, \\"James Houghton, a Daring Champion of the American Theater\\" , New York Times, August 3, 2016. It became apparent to Houghton soon that Signature Theatre Company needed a permanent and flexible home, and needed to build a theater, so in 2009 Houghton began fundraising. The building was first going to be featured at the Ground Zero location downtown as part of a redevelopment of downtown by mayor Michael Bloomberg. When costs began to be prohibitive, they moved towards the 42nd street Times Square theatre district. Part of the program to convince to build there was a plan to underwrite tickets so that they would be frozen at $25 each.Patrick Healy, \\"Theater Complex Raises Its Curtain\\" , New York Times, January 30, 2012. Houghton ended up raising $70 million for the project. Pershing Square Signature Center opened in 2012, and is a three-theatre, 75,000 square foot complex designed by Frank Gehry Architects. It also includes two studio spaces, a shared lobby with a caf√©, a bookshop, concierge desk, and administrative offices. The intent was to create a haven for theatre-makers, especially playwrights, that would hold 10 playwrights in residence to produce shows from the level of readings to full productions and all levels in-between. The goal of these types of programs and the subsequent building where to provide a sense of living and creating under one roof and creating points of intersection between artists, as Houghton once explained: > \\"What running these three programs simultaneously is about is that we get to > collide. The artists and audience get to breathe the same air. We have such > an appetite for it, whether we‚Äôre colliding with ourselves in the story > we‚Äôre seeing, or the people we‚Äôre seeing it with, or the artists we bump > into. To me, that‚Äôs what theater is. I hope this one gives much pleasure to > many people for many years to come.\\" Houghton stepped down for the 2015-2016 season, and was replaced by Paige Evans, formerly the artistic director of LCT3, the new-play development program at Lincoln Center Theater. = Juilliard School = Houghton became the Richard Rodgers Director of Drama at The Juilliard School in the 2006-2007 season, taking over the program that was founded by his former mentor John Houseman.Robert Simonson, \\"James Houghton Named Head of Juilliard Drama\\" , Playbill, April 16, 2006. After starting at Juilliard, he shifted the program from a one-day audition process and a cut program that would drop up to 1/3 of students after their first year to a weekend audition process with no-cuts. He also obtained funding and created for a Master of Fine Arts program that fully funds the students' final year of school as well as provides a stipend for living and working.BWW News Desk, \\"Juilliard Receives $10 Million to Endow Masters Program in Drama\\" , BroadwayWorld, March 13, 2013. Additionally, the masters program included a partnership with Signature in order to give students experience in a professional theatrical atmosphere. He spoke on his goals for the program: \\"My greatest hope for the students graduating from the Juilliard graduate division is that we provide them the opportunity to be expressive and more of themselves, and that we give them the tools to express through their work in a manner that is generous, responsible and authentic. We want our graduates to enter the workplace not just prepared for the task at hand, but equipped to produce work that ultimately stems from their core selves‚Ä¶ who they are, and their own voice.\\" Vikas S. Shah, \\"Theatre, Performance, and Society , ThoughtEconomics, May 8, 2016.

Death and legacy  On August 2, 2016, Houghton died of stomach cancer. Former collaborator Tony Kushner wrote on the death of Houghton: \\"He was smart and passionate. He built his singular legacy, founded on his devotion to playwrights‚Äô work and to playwrights themselves, with a uniquely sweet, generous spirit; with unflagging optimism; and with grace.\\" Colleague Oskar Eustis, artistic director of The Public Theatre, wrote upon hearing of Houghton's passing: \\"By his example, he reminded me constantly that we are all in this together, that theater isn‚Äôt a competition but a communion, that art isn‚Äôt a zero-sum game but a way of being that elevates all of us, and that the collaborative nature of our form must be reflected in the way we treat one another.\\"Oskar Eustis, \\"Jim Houghton‚Äôs Signature Achievement: He Lifted Us All\\" , American Theatre Magazine, August 10, 2016.

His work is about the transformation taking place in the former Eastern Bloc, for which he undertakes long-term projects. He is a nominee member of Magnum Photos. Milach's books include 7 Rooms (2011), In the Car with R (2012), Black Sea of Concrete (2013), The Winners (2014) and The First March of Gentlemen (2017). He is a co-founder of the Sputnik Photos collective. He won a 2008 World Press Photo award. 7 Rooms won the Pictures of the Year International Best Photography Book Award in 2011. In 2017 his exhibition Refusal was a finalist for the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize. Milach lectures in photography at the Institute of Creative Photography (ITF), Silesian University in Opava, Czech Republic. Life and work Milach was born in 1978 in Gliwice, Poland. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice in 2003 and the Institute of Creative Photography (ITF), Silesian University in Opava, Czech Republic. With ten other Central Eastern European photographers, he co-founded Sputnik Photos, a collective documenting transition in post-Soviet states. For his first book, 7 Rooms (2011), Milach accompanied and photographed seven young people for several years living in the Russian cities of Moscow, Yekaterinburg and Krasnoyarsk. In the Car with R (2012) was made on a 10 day road trip, driving 1450 kilometres around Iceland's circular Route 1. Milach made photographs and his local guide, the writer , made diary entries. Black Sea of Concrete (2013) is about the Ukrainian Black Sea coast, about its people, of whom he made portraits, and the abundant Soviet-era geometric blocks strewn along the coastline. Milach spent two years in Belarus from 2011 exploring its dire economic and political situation. Belarus is \\"a country caught between the ultra-traditional values of an older Soviet era and the viral influence of western popular culture.\\" Milach was interested in the clean, tidy glamorous facade maintained by the state. His book The Winners (2014), portraits of winners of various \\"Best of Belarus\\" state and local contests promoted by the government, is a typology of state propaganda. It depicts mostly people, but also anonymous interiors that had won awards. The obscure official prizes are intended to foster national pride but to an outside audience might appear tragicomic. Milach travelled around the country working in the role of \\"an old-fashioned propaganda photographer\\". He was guided by the authorities as to who, where and how to photograph, a process which only improved his revealing the ideology of the state. Milach has said \\"the winners are everywhere, but the winnings are not for the winners ‚Äì they are for the system\\", \\"the state is not interested in individuals, only in mass control.\\" The First March of Gentlemen (2017) was made on a 2016 residency at Kolekcja Wrze≈õnia to make work about life in Wrze≈õnia. The town is synonymous with the Wrze≈õnia children strike, the protests of Polish children and their parents against Germanization that occurred between 1901 and 1904. In 2016, there were many demonstrations by Citizens of Poland, a civic movement engaged in pro-democracy and anti-fascist actions, opposed to the political changes brought about by the government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Milach's book of collages mixes illustrations of the children strike with characters that lived in Wrze≈õnia during the communist era in the 1950s and 1960s taken by local amateur photographer Ryszard Szczepaniak. This \\"delineates a fictitious narrative that can be read as a metaphor, commenting on the social and political tensions of the present day.\\" In 2018 Milach became a nominee member of Magnum Photos.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History Milford was first settled in 1832, when Elizur and Stanley Ruggles established a sawmill here. The Ruggles sold to Stephen and John Armstrong in 1836, and the Armstrongs added a gristmill in 1839. North Milford Village was platted in 1838 by Aaron Phelps, who also dammed Pettibone Creek to create the still extant millponds. However, by the early 1840s Phelps ran into financial difficulties and sold out to the Hebbard brothers, who established an industrial park in North Milford. Soon a number of mills were located along Pettibone Creek, along with other industrial operations. As industry grew, so did the commercial ventures along Main Street, and the residential section of town grew to house the new residents of Milford. The railroad came through Milford in 1871, causing a building boom both in the industrial and commercial enterprises now provided with an easy mode of transport. The majority of the commercial structures in Milford were built between 1872 and 1898. New stores included taverns, lumber yards, grocers and dry goods stores, drug stores, tailors, restaurants, and more. The residential section of town also expanded greatly, with Victorian houses joining the previous Greek Revival structures. New larger church buildings were also constructed. In the twentieth century, the rise of the automobile brought new auto-related businesses. These included service stations, but also a new Ford Motor Company plant on the mill pond, and General Motors' Milford proving grounds outside of town. Newer houses were constructed to meet the needs of the influx of workers. In the period after World War II, Milford has avoided the urban renewal process, leaving a healthy cross-section of historical structures within the district intact. Description Main Street at Liberty, looking north The North Milford Village Historic District consists of a three-block section of commercial buildings along Milford's North Main Street, along with adjacent residential areas along five east-west streets and six north-south streets, and the two historic mill ponds along Pettibone Creek. The district contains 312 structures, 255 of which contribute to the historical character of the district. The commercial district includes two- and three-story buildings primarily of brick and concrete block, in Italianate, Commercial brick, Tudor Revival, and Art Deco styles. The residential portion of the district contains wood frame, stone, concrete block and brick houses in a range of architectural styles, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Victorian Gothic, Late Victorian, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Stick, Chateauesque, Vernacular, Tudor Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Bungalow, Craftsman, English style and Cape Cod.

He was a fortune-hunting playboy who married three older wealthy widows. The first two died while still married to him, each leaving him a sizeable inheritance. His third wife divorced him after less than a year of marriage. The that is currently on the National Register of Historic Places for San Mateo County, California was part of his estate. Background He was born John (Jack) Henry Edward Thompson on April 9, 1875 in Waco, Texas. Little is known about his early life in Texas. He was living in New York by 1907. Having unsuccessfully tried his luck in a variety of jobs, including musical stage productions, he began promoting himself as a theatrical agent by the name of Jean Harold Edward de Saint Cyr. With various spellings, he used the name Saint Cyr throughout the rest of his life. Caroline Redfield  Caroline Peck Redfield was born October 3, 1840, and was 34 years older than Saint Cyr. Trenton, New Jersey resident Bob Swem (aka Robert von Schwemm) met Phoenix National Bank president Henry A. Redfield and his wife Caroline through mutual acquaintance Alfred Moore Livingstone. After her husband's February 1907 death, Caroline began relying on Swem as a social escort. He moved into the Redfield house and made himself indispensable as her escort, secretary and accountant. He came to assume he would inherit her estate. } It is believed that Swem and Mrs. Redfield first met Saint Cyr when he worked as a hotel clerk at Alexandria Bay, New York. He presented himself as affiliated with the entertainment field, and was apparently overt that Saint Cyr was a stage name. Although his attire was that of someone down on his luck, he charmed her enough to get his foot in the door, and eventually became a permanent resident in her home. From that point forward, Saint Cyr lived the life of what was then called a \\"kept man\\", a gigolo financially supported by a wealthy woman in exchange for his relationship in her life. She bought him expensive clothing, a new car, and hired a French chauffeur and a Japanese valet for him. He began to treat the household staff as though they worked for him, and by 1908 replaced Swem in her affections. Lavishing her wealth upon both Saint Cyr and Swem severely drained her inheritance and necessitated the sale of the Redfield mansion on March 31, 1909. They moved to Yonkers, where she and Saint Cyr secretly wed on June 9, 1909. The bride was 68 years old, and the groom was 34 years old. Her last will was made June 18, 1912, amended by a codicil on October 2, 1913. Omitting Swem entirely, the bulk of her $1,000,000 estate was left to Saint Cyr. Her son Henry S. Redfield was bequeathed $150,000 and some valuable jewels. After her January 2, 1915 death of pneumonia, her will was contested by her son. Annie Armstrong Stewart Smith  Annie Armstrong Stewart Smith was born May 2, 1864, and was 11 years older than Saint Cyr. Prior to meeting him, she had lived a life of the socially elite, those whose existence revolved around traveling from one party to another, one resort to another. Her first marriage was to affluent lawyer William Rhinelander Stewart Sr. Their daughter Anita became Princess Miguel of Braganza, Duchess of Viseu. The marriage also produced a son, William Rhinelander Stewart Jr. After divorcing her first husband, she married James Henry \\"Silent\\" Smith in 1907, considered one of the world's wealthiest men. He died on their honeymoon. According to a friend of the Redfields, Colonel Alfred Montgomery Shook, Saint Cyr was distraught after the death of his wife Caroline. However, Major E. Gray Pendleton, who introduced him to Annie Smith a month later, said Saint Cyr was eager to resume the party lifestyle. Shortly after their April 25, 1915 marriage, Pendleton confronted them about reports that Saint Cyr's life prior to the Redfield marriage was that of an average working man employed in a variety of temporary professions. His new wife's response was, \\"I don't care what they call him, as long as they don't call me an old woman.\\"; ; * Saint Cyr had begun to affect a French accent, claiming to have been born near Paris. While he and his new wife were in Palm Beach, Florida in 1916, investigative journalists outed him as Jack Thompson of Texas. Happening concurrently with the expos√© of his real identity, was an ongoing court battle contesting the will of Caroline Redfield. The couple denied he was Jack Thompson, but they eventually left Palm Beach amid the brewing scandal. ; ; A year later, journalists took note that he had replaced the fake French accent with a British accent. There was an indication of a separation at some point in the marriage, but not a divorce. Upon Anne de Saint Cyr's March 3, 1925 death, they were living on an estate in San Mateo, California, that she had purchased in June 1919. It included the Eugene J. de Sabla, Jr., Teahouse and Tea Garden that is currently on the National Register of Historic Places for the county. The NRHP form states, \\"In 1922, upon dissolution of the second marriage, Anne sold it back to her husband.\\" Her 1925 obituary lists Saint Cyr as her husband, sitting by her bedside with the rest of the family at the time of death. Her estate was valued at $40,000,000. Saint Cyr received one-third of the estate, and was also named as an executor of the will, and trustee over two of the estate's funds. As a wealthy widower, he continued the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed, among the rich and famous of his era. He hosted the 1926 wedding of actress Constance Talmadge and her second husband Alastair MacIntosh on the estate. In 1926, Jean de Saint Cyr sold the mansion and grounds to a real estate developer. The Eugene J. de Sabla, Jr. Teahouse and Tea Garden was not included in the sale. The 1928 party he hosted at the Menlo Polo Club was described as, \\"one of the most elaborate and unique parties given on the peninsula\\". Helen Strong Carter  Born March 11, 1866, Helen Strong Carter was nine years older than Saint Cyr. She was the widow of Hawaii governor George R. Carter, who died in 1933. A wealthy heiress through her father Eastman Kodak president and co-founder Henry A. Strong, and his first wife Helen Phoebe Griffin, she was known for her philanthropic generosities. She helped establish, and sat on the board of directors, of the dental hygiene program at the University of Hawaii, and the Honolulu Dental Infirmary. The Strong-Carter Dental Clinic was established to train young women for careers as dental hygienists.; In 1922, Helen and her sister Gertrude made a $1,000,000 donation towards the building fund for the Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester in New York. In what the news reports called a \\"surprise ceremony\\", Saint Cyr and Carter were wed in New Orleans on April 26, 1939, attended only by her son, one of her daughters and her son-in-law.; A month after the wedding, Saint Cyr sold the teahouse and grounds to her for $400,000. It was a short-lived marriage. The couple spent September‚ÄìOctober 1939 entertaining at her Honolulu estate.; By December, she had taken up residence in Reno, Nevada to file for divorce. At the same time her attorneys claimed his \\"whereabouts unknown\\", the Los Angeles Times reported he was in Hollywood hosting a dinner party at the Earl Carroll Theatre for American socialite Louise Cromwell Brooks, wife of actor Lionel Atwill.; The divorce was finalized February 17, 1940, and she resumed using the name Helen Strong Carter. Afterwards, she sold the Japanese teahouse and garden to developer David D. Bohannon. Later years and death By 1959, Saint Cyr was afflicted with Parkinson's disease, and was unable to care for himself. His foster son H. R. Friss was named as his conservator. Attempts to contact relatives in California and Texas received no response. When he died November 3, 1966, the will that was probated had been executed in 1949. At the time of death, the estate was valued at $500,000. Probate proceedings listed a brother and five sisters. He was buried next to his second wife in San Mateo.; References External links * (1875‚Äì1966) Category:1875 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Impostor pretenders Category:People from Waco, Texas Category:People from San Mateo County, California ","title":"Jean de Saint Cyr"},{"id":"57284657","title":"Listed buildings in Cockshutt, Shropshire"},{"id":"57284663","text":"Jacqueline Eymar Jacqueline Eymar (23 June 1922 ‚Äì 6 December 2008) was a French classical pianist.  Biography  Born in Nice, a pupil of the pianist and composer Yves Nat, Eymar had a rich post-war career as a pianist and chamber musician. Eymar has interpreted a wide and varied repertoire, in which the romantic period (Brahms, Schumann, Schubert‚Ä¶) and French music (Debussy, Faur√©, Franck‚Ä¶) occupied a prominent place. Soloist with the Orchestre national and the Orchestre de la Radiot√©l√©vision fran√ßaise, she was also a regular of the major Parisian associations, playing for the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire or in the framework of concerts Colonne and concerts Lamoureux. She has toured extensively in Europe, the USSR (1958, 1961, 1967), Southeast Asia (1965) and America (1971), offering piano recitals and chamber music concerts. In addition to her solo work, Jacqueline Eymar has devoted a significant part of her work to chamber music, actively collaborating with G√ºnter Kehr ‚Äì a German violinist and conductor - and with the Kehr trio, founded by the latter. At the time of the Franco-German reconciliation, they met in quartet and gave together many concerts in France, in Germany and in the world. Critics recognized her for her exceptional power and elegance of play, most often praising her architectural design of the works. On March 30, 1960, Ren√© Dumesnil wrote in Le Monde: \\"I have rarely seen such complete possession of a performer through the music she animates.\\" On February 13, 1965, composer Luc-Andr√© MarcelLuc-Andr√© Marcel on Discogs addressed her in these terms: \\"The way in which you illuminate such and such a detail, of which you make emerge such and such a second level, of which you lead a crescendo, is of such evidence that one cannot not listen. Moreover, the extreme beauty of the sound and the astonishing variety of colours, the total absence of arbitrary, gratuitous virtuosity, add to this impression of hearing pure music.\\" Eymar has given great importance to contemporary composers, introducing French and foreign audiences to artists such as Andr√© Jolivet, Georges Migot, Serge Nigg, Antoine Tisn√©, Marius Constant and Luc- Andr√© Marcel, whose two piano concertos she created. In 1960, in the Salle Pleyel in Paris, she performed the piano concerto of Khachaturian (1926), the composer conducting the National Orchestra. In the 1980s, she retired to her family home in Pourri√®res (Var), reserving her performances for an audience of music-loving friends. She died there on December 6, 2008.  Discography  In 1961, she won the Grand Prix de l'Acad√©mie nationale du disque for the recording of Le ZodiaqueLe Zodiaque by Georges Migot (1932). The recording made in 1959-1960, then published in the form of two albums (Lumen LD 3443/3445) was the subject of a second edition in 1984 (Cybelia CY 665-666) and then a CD release in 2005 (Int√©gral). Jacqueline Eymar's recordings are rare. Albums containing works by C√©sar Franck (Philips N 00.597 L) and Faur√©, Brahms and Debussy in the series \\"Pages c√©l√®bres\\" (Le Chant du Monde LD-M-8168, LD-S-8198 and LD-S-8169). The Brahms, Faur√© and Debussy records were reissued on a single CD by Forgotten Records (http://forgottenrecords.com/) and Sakuraphon ( https://www.sakuraphon.net/). In addition, her interpretation of C√©sar Franck's quintet in F minor for piano and strings with the Loewenguth Quartet (Philips L 00.381 L, 1958, recording of 1955, followed by Pr√©lude, Choral and Fugue) remains a reference despite the years. This recording has just been republished by Forgotten Records. With the Kehr trio, she has made numerous radio recordings in Paris (ORTF) and in Germany. (S√ºdwestrundfunk Mainz Stuttgart, Westdeutscher Rundfunk K√∂ln, Norddeutscher Rundfunk Hannover in perticular). Together, they also recorded on disc Brahms's three quartets (Da Camera Magna, Heidelberg, 1968) and Faur√©'s four quartets and quintets (1966/1970) Heinz Jansen, S√ºdwest Tonstudio).

He took part in the naval operations of the Asia Minor Campaign as a crew member of the battleship Limnos, the destroyer Thyella, and the cruiser Averof, being promoted to Sub-Lieutenant on 20 May 1921. In 1922, he completed studies at the Navy's Artillery School. During the so-called \\"Navy Strike\\" of June 1924 he resigned, but was readmitted on 28 August 1924 with full restoration of his seniority.

During a Luftwaffe attack on the night of 13/14 April, the Vasilefs Georgios was seriously damaged, necessitating repairs in drydock. As a result, the ship was unable to join the rest of the fleet during its exodus to the Middle East, and was captured by the Germans. Lappas also remained in Greece, and was employed in the Navy General Directorate of the collaborationist government's Ministry of National Defence. In December 1941, however, he managed to flee Greece, joining the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East on 27 February 1942. Initially he was appointed captain of the repair ship Ifaistos, before being sent to Britain to oversee the delivery to the Greek navy of four Flower-class corvettes. Likewise, in 1943 he was head of the acceptance mission for the LST-1-class tank landing ships in New Orleans. He personally assumed command of the LST Samos (L179). On 10 January 1944 he was promoted to captain (retroactive to 9 November 1943), and took part as commander of a landing ship squadron in the Allied landing operations in Anzio (January 1944), and Southern France (August 1944). For his service as captain of the Samos, on 14 September 1944 he received the Greek War Cross, III class. For his general war service, and especially his actions during the Anzio landings, he received the Medal for Outstanding Acts on 11 December 1945. =Post-war career= Following the liberation of Greece, he assumed command of the and of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla (1945‚Äì1946), the post of Higher Navy Personnel Director (1946‚Äì1947), Higher Technical Director (1947), Higher Light Craft Commander and Higher Submarine Commander in tandem (1947‚Äì1949). He then became Higher Naval Operations Commander, leading naval operations during the closing phases of the Greek Civil War, being promoted to rear admiral on 13 September 1949. He was then posted as Deputy Chief of the Navy General Staff in 1949, Navy Inspector-General in 1949‚Äì1950, and Chief of the Fleet Command in 1950‚Äì52. At the same time, he held in tandem the posts of Chief of the Salamis Naval Base (1951‚Äì1952) and Navy Inspector-General (1952). From 6 September 1952 he was Chief of the Navy General Staff and head of NATO's COMEDEAST, being promoted to vice admiral on 6 October 1952. He held the position until his retirement on 13 September 1958. On 13 October 1958, he was recalled to active service as head of King Paul's Military Household, holding the position until 1 November 1960. He was appointed Honorary Chief of the Navy General Staff on 15 February 1963.

He was a radical republican and was dismissed from his position as mayor of Toulon by the monarchist ministry of Albert de Broglie in 1873. From 1876 to 1881 he was Deputy of Var. He was then Governor of Martinique from 1881 to 1887, and Senator of Martinique from 1888 until his death in 1899. Life =Early years= Vincent Ga√´tan All√®gre was born on 7 August 1835 in Six-Fours, Var. His parents were Jean Baptiste All√®gre (born 1798), a sea captain, and Henriette Alexandrine Baptistine Aycard (born 1808). His paternal grandfather was a garde champ√™tre on the King's estates. His family was legitimist, supporters of the Bourbon dynasty. Vincent All√®gre became a lawyer and registered at the bar of Toulon, Var. After the fall of the Second French Empire and its replacement by the French Third Republic on 4 September 1870 All√®gre was named mayor of Toulon. He was also a member of the Var General Council for several years, representing the canton of Toulon West. All√®gre was a radical Republican, a supporter of the Paris Commune, who protested the executions of Louis Rossel and Gaston Cr√©mieux in November 1871 and veiled the tricolour flag at the Town Hall as a sign of mourning. Under the first ministry of the monarchist Albert de Broglie he was dismissed from his office as mayor on 24 May 1873. =Deputy of Var= All√®gre ran for election on 20 February 1876 as Deputy of Var for the 2nd constituency of Toulon and was elected in the second round by 7,361 votes out of 8,227. He was reelected on 14 October 1877. His election manifesto pledged him to demand amnesty for the Communards and separation of church and state. He sat with the Republican Union and followed the policy of the Opportunist Republicans led by L√©on Gambetta. He voted with the majority for invalidation of the election of Louis Auguste Blanqui, for return of the Assembly to Paris, for application of existing laws to congregations, for free and compulsory primary education and for the vote of confidence in the Jules Ferry ministry on 11 November 1880. =Governor of Martinique= On 20 July 1881, a few days before the next general elections, All√®gre accepted the position of Governor of Martinique and resigned as deputy. In December 1881 All√®gre said the clergy of the island was aligned with \\"the small reactionary minority\\", and Bishop Carm√©n√©(fr) had agreed with \\"parties hostile to the Republic\\" to make out that the colony was totally disorganized. On 17 December 1882 All√®gre was elected Senator of Martinique in place of Joseph Desmazes, who had died. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 24 December 1882. His election to the Senate while still Governor was cancelled on 1 February 1883 as being tainted with illegality. In 1883 he asserted, All√®gre was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour on 24 December 1886. In 1887 he was replaced as governor by Albert Grodet. =Senator of Martinique= On 21 October 1888 All√®gre was elected to the Senate for Guadeloupe in place of Hubert Michaux, who had died. He was reelected on 3 January 1897. He sat with the Democratic Left group. He belonged to the colonial party. He was a member of the Colonial committee and vice-president of the Naval Committee. He spent most of his time on colonial issues including finance, economy and tariff administration. In 1889 he was involved in the question of improving French seaports. In 1891 Martinique was devastated by a hurricane. A commission of members of the General Council undertook an investigation of damages that All√®gre described as \\"meticulous\\" and estimated the total costs were almost 89 million francs. The central government considered this estimate to be extreme, as did the business elite of Paris, and reduced the estimated to 72 million francs. A commission of outside investigators led by Jean-Baptiste Chaudi√© further reduced the estimate to 50 million francs. Allegre wrote to the colonial office of the Ministry of Marine protesting that the outside inspectors did not understand the true losses of Martinique's \\"energetic population who, in trying to lift itself up, will use up its last resources and count on the future as well as the goodwill of the mother country.\\" Allegre continued to pressure the government to arrange a loan to fund reconstruction and to provide tariff relief on sugar and tafia exports. In 1892‚Äì93 All√®gre participated in discussions on recruitment and organization of the colonial army. He also defended small rural landholdings. Due to failing health he moved to the calm of M√®ze, H√©rault, where he died in office on 18 May 1899.

This mirrored Napoleon III's widespread backing from rural peasantry but sought to add moderate bourgeois elements who were disaffected with both Napoleon III's regime and the potentially revolutionary program espoused by the Paris Commune. The club was founded in Toulon in 1873 by former officers of the French Foreign Legion and other veterans of Napoleon III's campaigns who borrowed the name from the ancient Spartan government council. Their inaugural meeting place in Toulon, Place de la Libert√©, can still be visited.Plaque in Place de la Liberte. See Google Maps Place de la Liberte, Toulon, France Origin The society's founding motto was, Libert√©, Progr√®s, Etat (Liberty, Progress, State). Many of their initial concerns stemmed from specific military deficiencies they had first-hand experienced against the Prussians. These included the quality of German Krupp howitzers relative to French artillery, the gap between railroad and railhead concentrations in France compared to Germany and Great Britain that inhibited French forces from concentrating or maneuvering quickly, and the employment of a small-scale, long-service professional army instead of a draft/conscription system that left France defenseless after the war's initial defeats destroyed most of the Second Empire's armies.For an overview of French failings during the Franco-Prussian War see Wawro, Geoffrey (2003). The Franco-Prussian War: The German Conquest of France 1870-1. Cambridge University Press. 052161743X. Political activities Politically, the society backed the government of Patrice MacMahon and balked at the restoration a French monarch, partially because of the division amongst monarchist ranks over which family (Orleans, Bourbon, or Bonaparte) should accede to the throne. As fervor for the monarchist cause receded as the 1870s progressed, the society gradually shifted towards support for the Opportunist Republican governments who had themselves staked out more of a claim on the political center. Political philosophy Ephorist political theory was, at its core, a liberal one. This was the case, first, because of the diffusion and adoption of liberal ideals by the educated, cosmopolitan elite of Europe since the French Revolution, and, second, because of the economic and political success of Great Britain since the end of the First French Empire. While looking to the British for inspiration, though, the Ephorists held it as given that a system that was over a century old could be improved. The philosophical justification for this had been provided by Roland Meynet a decade before, at a time when he could be considered a proto-Ephorist (and later a founding member of the society). Meynet called into question the fundamental liberal tenet that members of society are atomized individuals. He asserted that liberal thinking was flawed in that it stemmed from a false premise. That false premise was the Lockean assertion that the fundamental human unit is the individual in a state of nature in which man subdues nature and pulls from it his bounty, which is solely his. Liberals simply viewed society as the sum of such individuals. To rebut that claim, Meynet drew upon the theory of evolution, the political implication of which was that humans evolved in groups (hence human subgroups with different characteristics). In fact, individuality can only be expressed through relationships with other humans‚Äîan individual cannot be defined without invoking relation to a community. And as such there never was, and most importantly, could never have been such a state where it was most natural for an individual human to exist alone. An individual human could not have come to exist without the communal heritage of group evolution. Meynet therefore concluded that man's essential nature was communal. This reasoning supported the future Ephorist belief that the group, rather than the individual, was the fundamental unit of society. After Meynet, Bernard Baas undercut the belief in the individual as responsible for securing his own self-interest. Baas was a pre-Pigouvian in that he realized that an individual's pursuit of his own self-interest was inevitably negatively or positively impacted by others pursuing their own self-interests. Building on Meynet's work, if the group was the fundamental unit of societal activity, then individual actions take place within a group context and naturally impact other members in the group. This would later be refined into the idea of an externality. From these conclusions, the reasoning that Ephorist thought followed was straightforward‚Äîpursuing solely one's own interests was not only selfish but unnatural. They believed that without the community, humanity in any real sense would cease. The truly natural state for man is to take into account the needs of the group. Unfortunately, Ephorists recognized that Western society had already been too heavily influenced by the ideas of the radical liberals, such as John Stuart Mill, to accept such an arrangement of their own accord (unlike, say Japan, which was a source of fascination for the Ephorists due to its unity of purpose). Much of their discussions centered around the need for an arrangement to reign in some of the greater excesses imbued by liberalism. Together, Meynet's and Baas‚Äô writings, and the philosophical work that grew from it, provided the intellectual foundation for Ephorism's emphasis on the role of the state. Ephorists started from the belief in the group as the fundamental entity, and as men of the Enlightenment, they recognized that the proper community was the legal, rational one of human thought and higher impulses‚Äîthe state. They believed that in this way, the state is born of man's will. Foreshadowing Weber, the Ephorists saw the state as a rational construct that could utilize modern organizational methods to harness and direct the resources of society. (As such, the Ephorists were also early proponents of a professional bureaucracy and the empowerment of technocrats). Consequently, to accept one's natural role in society is to submit to the state. In that sense, Ephorists construed most activities as political and the state's role was only constrained by efficiency. Ultimately, though, the Ephorists felt it could not be contradicted that the state was essential to human existence‚Äîif the state withered, man withered. Tenets I. The belief in the state as the supreme entity in political theory led to several positions held by the Ephorists. One was that the state would maintain balance in society‚Äîthe government would mediate interactions between conflicting segments of society. With regards to the economy, this meant that the government would mediate relations between capital and labor to insure stability and fairness, rather than letting the two groups engage in a brute struggle of wills. Indeed, Ephorists believed one of the greatest weaknesses of liberal democracy was the inability to mediate compromise between conflicting groups. They viewed democracy as a winner-take- all system in which grievances were harbored and radical swings in policy could take place during transfers of power that damaged long-term progress. II. Another Ephorist position was that private action should be mobilized for public benefit. Ephoristis recognized the strength that could come from individual actions pursuing self-interest. That could lead to new approaches and ideas (in short, innovation), but Ephorists wanted to ensure that those impulses would be directed to society's benefit. As a result, they sought to instill national pride in the population. This patriotism was to give a shared feeling of unity to the population and knowledge of communal identity (the goal was not to socialize wealth but to socialize the generator of wealth‚Äîthe population). The Ephorists believed that their economic program‚Äîdiscussed below‚Äîwould lead to an economic boom only after the cultural rebirth brought about through the inculcation of patriotism. As General Picard wrote in his opening address to the Ephorists, ‚Äú[s]ociety represents the very personality of the individual divested of accidental differences [‚Ä¶] where the individual feels the general interest as his own and wills therefore as might the general will.‚Äù III. Education, both political and technical, also ranked as an important Ephorist interest. Uneducated, the populace might devolve into indulgence of basic passions and instincts, which bring about social disintegration, moral degeneration, and a mindless spirit of rebellion against society. Ephorism was, therefore, a political and moral movement at its core. It understood and championed politics as a training ground for self-sacrifice in pursuit of an idea, one which would provide the individual with his reason for being, his freedom, and all his rights. IV. In economics, Ephorist views naturally led to a semi-market economy in which the state applied guidance and selective support to promote the general interest. Private property and the profit motive were incentives to productivity. But the Ephorists only accepted the pursuit of private interests to the extent they did not conflict with the interests of the state. The Ephorist's economic program included a drive toward self-sufficiency, government support for key industries, and an early form of currency direction. These would be carried out to ensure the development of national industries that would drive forward progress and guard against a foreign program of economic coercion (in particularly, Anglo-German pursuits of market dominance in areas key to military power). They also called for the state to ensure access to the raw material inputs needed for prosperity and security, mainly by guarding the French overseas empire. While the economic program was clear with its rewards for the productive of society (the acceptance of the profit motive), it also addressed the otherwise unproductive. Ephorists believed that all could (and should) be contributors to the grand project of human advancement, and they rejected the growing demands for social support programs in the form of charity. Instead, they advocated for giving the unemployed work in public projects and providing them opportunities for military service either abroad in the French Empire or home. These proposals were often attacked by radical socialists as a return of the corvee. V. Perhaps the most important tenet of Ephorism for the members of the Societe was the primacy of scientific development. The Ephorist program recognized science as the most important segment of societal activity. Science drove the prosperity and security of the nation forward. As such, it had benefits for the entire population, but its benefit was evenly distributed. As a result, the Ephorists concluded that the government should support and direct scientific research (they also followed the same reasoning to support large-scale state-backed infrastructure projects). They stressed, though, applied, rather than abstract research. They felt that the pace of scientific discovery was rapid and increasing and that economic-military-technological advantage would come from applying science to practical issues. Scientific advance therefore became the ideal for Ephorists, one that is a continuous and inexhaustible process of historical actualization. It represented a distinct and singular embodiment of a civilization's traditions which, far from withering as a dead memory of the past, assumes the form of a personality focused on the end towards which it strives. VI. Last, Ephorist political thought had a dim view of the international political environment. While Ephorists believed in the good of advancing standards of living, they believed that states were perpetually in competition, as evinced by the emergent continental competition between France and Germany, and a strong military was a necessity to defend and advance the group interests (as cohered in the state). Ephorists extended Darwin's principals to the world community and believed that superior systems would outcompete inferior ones and inherit the bounty of the future.

Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas. He is the son of College Football Hall of Fame cornerback Johnnie Johnson and attended high school at Valley Christian in San Jose. As of 2020, Johnson is the tallest wide receiver in the NFL.  High school career  Attending Valley Christian in San Jose, Johnson was limited by injury in both his sophomore and senior seasons but still eclipsed 1,100 yards as a senior. By the winter of his sophomore year, Johnson had garnered scholarship offers from USC, Arizona State, Utah, Rutgers, Cal, and TCU, but committed to Texas on April 17, 2014 along with his brother Kirk, a running back who is a year older than Collin.  College career  Johnson played in every game as a freshman and started one. As a sophomore, he started nine games and completed the season with 54 catches. Early in his junior season, Johnson hauled in a career-high 191 yards against USC, including 47 on a go- ahead touchdown. After underperforming against Oklahoma, Johnson was replaced atop the depth chart by Dorian Leonard. A year later, Johnson called the benching a learning opportunity and a chance for personal growth. Heading into his senior year, coach Tom Herman noted that Johnson improved markedly in the offseason. Johnson also landed on the Walter Camp Award, Wuerffel Award, and Biletnikoff Award preseason watchlists. Johnson's acrobatics and 124 yards against TCU in week four earned him National Player of the Week accolades. After a slight injury to his knee, Johnson missed the Nov 10 game against Texas Tech. In the 2018 Big 12 Championship Game, Johnson set the title game record for receiving yards with 177. The performance came after Johnson was excluded from the All-Big 12 team for 2018. His coaches also lauded him for increased blocking skills throughout the season. Professional career Johnson was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round with the 165th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Jaguars received the 165th pick used to select Johnson as a result from a trade that sent Dante Fowler Jr. to the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 5 against the Houston Texans, Johnson recorded three catches for 30 yards and his first career touchdown reception during the 30‚Äì14 loss.  Personal life  Johnson's father Johnnie also played at Texas and played for ten years in the NFL; he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Collin's older brother Kirk is also a football player at Texas, and his sister Camille is a member of the track and field team.

She was sentenced to hard labour and deported to Siberia, where she contracted tuberculosis.  Biography  = Family = Natalya Armfeldt's father was Professor Alexander Armfeldt (1839‚Äì1897), one of Russia's leading specialists in cattle breeding. He arranged for her to study mathematics at Heidelberg University. = Political = Natalya Armfeldt abandoned her studies in 1874, to join the movement among idealistic Russian students and graduates to leave the cities and 'go to the people' to learn about and try to improve the lives of the peasants. She joined an illegal socialist group in Moscow, and set out to a village in Orel province, but was arrested and deported back to Moscow. In 1875, she was exiled by administrative order to Kostroma. When her term of exile ended, in 1877, she settled illegally in Ukraine, and joined the Kiev buntari, or 'Southern Rebels'. She was present at a political meeting on 11 February 1879, which was raided by the police. Some of the men opened fire. One gendarme two of the rebels, Ivan Ivichevich and his brother, were fatally wounded. Armfeldt and three others were arrested. She was tried, with 13 other buntari and sentenced to 14 years and ten months hard labour. = Exile = Natalya Armfeldt was deported to the Kara katorga in eastern Siberia, close to the Chinese border, where she was among dozens of political prisoners forced to work in privately owned mines, in harsh conditions. She fell ill with tuberculosis. In 1883, she and two other prisoners were offered pardons if they would renounce their views and admit their 'errors'. She refused the offer. In 1884, her mother, Anna Armfeldt appealed for help from Leo Tolstoy (the author of War and Peace) to get permission to settle in Kara to look after her daughter. Tolstoy wrote to his aunt, Alexandrine, who was well connected at the court of the Tsar Alexander III, asking her to take up the case. In 1885, Natalya was released from work in the mines, but confined to political exile in the Kara district, where her mother was permitted to join her. In November 1885, the American explorer George Kennan visited Kara, bringing a letter of introduction to Armfeldt from a Russian who knew the family and had told him where the two women were living. He gave the authorities the slip and arrived unannounced at their \\"little whitewashed cabin\\". He noted that \\"Miss Armfeldt spoke French, German and English, drew, painted and was an educated and accomplished woman.\\" Her mother was \\"a worn, broken woman...with soft grey hair and a face refined, gentle, intelligent but deeply lined by care and grief.\\" Natalya asked Kennan to return that evening, by which time she had assembled a group of political exiles including Maria Kolenkina, who shared their stories with Kennan. This meeting inspired Kennan's classic study, Siberia and the Exile System, which first alerted opinion abroad to the ill-treatment of Russia's political prisoners. But when Kennan met Leo Tolstoy and described the conditions under which Armfeldt and other exiles were living, the novelist showed little sympathy, complaining that the revolutionaries had resorted to violence. She died of tuberculosis in exile in 1887. Her mother died soon afterwards.

An abbreviation of intercalated motif, the four-strand i-motif is unlike the iconic double helix DNA. I-motifs are four-stranded quadruplex structures formed by cytosine-rich DNA, similar to the G-quadruplex structures that guanine-rich DNA forms. C-rich DNA regions are common in gene regulation portions of the genome. Recently, i-motifs were discovered in human cells and were shown to play a role in cell reproduction. I-motifs have potential applications in nanotechnology and nanomedicine, because size is more than 1 nm and less than 100 nm due to their unique pH sensitivity and have been used as biosensors, nanomachines, and molecular switches. History The i-motif DNA was first found in the 1993 by Maurice Gu√©ron and colleagues in √âcole Polytechnique, France , but until 2018 had only ever been witnessed in vitro, not in living cells.\\"Scientists Have Confirmed a New DNA Structure Inside Human Cells\\", article by Peter Dockrill 23 April 2018 The latest discovery announced in 2018 was headed at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and the University of New South Wales and funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Research Council. Co-leaders of the research team were A/Prof Daniel Christ and Professor Marcel Dinger. Discovery Dr. Mahdi Zeraati at the Garvan Institute says the i-motif was discovered for its appearing and disappearing within the cell and distinctive connections via cytosines rather than base-pair letters. The research team developed a precise new tool to find the i-motif ‚Äì a fragment of an antibody molecule ‚Äì that could specifically recognise and attach to i-motifs \\"with a very high affinity\\".Public statement: \\"Found: A new form of DNA in our cells.\\" Structure RNA i-motif structure showing cytosine bases in the quadruplex. C¬∑C+ base pairing found in i-motif structures. Base-pairing energy=169.7 kJ/mol. G-quadruplex DNA structures exist in G-rich areas of DNA. The complementary cytosine-rich DNA strand can also form a four-stranded quadruplex structure called i-motif. The cytosine base pairs in the i-motif structure form an intercalated and anti-parallel tetramer structure. This structure is formed through non-Watson Crick base pairing C¬∑C+ interactions of the cytosine base pairs. C¬∑C+ bonding is a type of Hoogsteen base pairing and actually has stronger base-pair interactions and base-pairing energy than the traditional Watson Crick G¬∑C base pairing: 169.7 kJ/mol for C¬∑C+ base pairing and 96.6 kJ/mol for G¬∑C base-pairing. The C¬∑C+ bond has three hydrogen bonds: two between the hydrogen of the amines and the double bonded oxygens of the opposite cytosine, and one between the nitrogen and the hydrogen bound to the N+. These base pairs cross-link two loops of DNA. Given the hemi-protonated nature of the nitrogens in cytosine participating in C¬∑C+ bonding, this base pairing traditionally is most stable in the range of pH=5‚Äì6, significantly lower than physiological pH (7.3). However, recent work has found evidence of i-motif structures at near-neutral pH at room temperature. Wright et al. discovered that the number of cytosines in the sequence determines if a C-rich sequence can form an i-motif structure at physiological pH, as does negative superhelicity and molecular crowding. At room temperature nucleotide tracts must be at least 5 cytosines long to fold into i-motifs at near-neutral pH; additional cytosines increase thermal stability. Furthermore, intramolecular i-motif strands are most stable when there are at least 6 consecutive cytosine bases in the DNA strand while less than 6 consecutive cytosines in a strand favors intermolecular C¬∑C+ pairings. This pH-dependency of the i-motif structure is thought to be critical to its in vivo activity and function in the cell as pH is speculated to be the control mechanism used for i-motif formation and destruction.  Biological function  I-motifs are postulated to play a role in gene regulation and expression in the cell. Large tracts of G/C-rich DNA exist near transcriptional start sites in the genome, and are present in a wide variety of organismal genomes, suggesting that C-rich tracts have a biological function. Furthermore, many proteins and ligands fundamental to gene expression recognize C-rich oligonucleotides, such as Poly-C-binding protein (PCBP) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK). Until recently it was not clear whether I-motifs naturally existed in DNA due to their low stability at physiological pH; i-motifs were discovered in vivo in human DNA in 2018. Human telomeric DNA (hTelo) can form an i-motif secondary structure in vitro. Zeraati et al. confirmed the presence of i-motif hTelo in human DNA using a fluorescent marker called iMab. Furthermore, i-motif hTelo was found within regulatory regions of the genome during the late G1 phase of the cell reproduction cycle, indicating that i-motifs are involved in gene promotion and regulation. I-motifs may also act as molecular scaffolds to aid in transcription factor binding during gene transcription by aiding promoters such as BCL2 in attaching to the correct DNA sequence. Increased i-motif expression did not coincide with increased G-quadruplex expression, which instead increases during the S phase. This indicates that G-quadruplex and i-motifs are not complementary structures despite their complementary sequences and are instead mutually exclusive and serve opposite roles in gene expression regulation.  Applications  I-motifs are particularly useful due to their unique sensitivity to changes in acidity near physiological pH. A study at the University of Bonn used I-motif folding to tighten and loosen a ring of DNA. A circular ring of DNA was synthesized, with certain regions of C-rich DNA. At a pH of 5, these regions contracted to form i-motifs, tightening the ring in a fashion similar to closing a trash bag. At a pH of 8 the I-motif regions collapsed back into their linear forms, relaxing the ring. DNA rings that can tighten and loosen based on pH can be used to build more complex structures of interlocking DNA like catenanes and rotaxanes. These DNA structures can function as molecular switches. Another study showed that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), commonly used to carry drugs in the body, induce I-motif formation in human telomeric DNA. Researches modified C-rich human telomeric DNA by attaching a redox active methylene blue group to the 3‚Ä≤ end and an electrode to the 5‚Ä≤ end. In the I-motif conformation this modified DNA strand produces a large increase in Faradaic current. This biosensor only reacts to SWNTs, allowing researchers to detect a specific type of carbon nanotube with a direct detection limit of 0.2 ppm.

Miller's junior season was widely hampered by injuries. His senior season saw him record 8.5 sacks, although Miller strained his hamstring in the 2018 Orange Bowl and missed the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship game due to the injury. Miller stated that his technique improvements while in college made up for his lack of experience in college. Professional career At the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine, Miller recorded a 38.5-inch vertical jump. Miller was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the fourth round (115th overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft. In week 3 against the Arizona Cardinals, Miller recorded his first 2 career sacks on fellow rookie Kyler Murray in the 38-20 win. On August 3, 2020, Miller announced he would opt out of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal life Miller's father, Corey Miller, was a nine-year NFL veteran.

He was suffect consul in the second quarter of 65 as the colleague of Aulus Licinius Nerva Silianus, replacing Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus whom Nero forced to commit suicide. Firmus is known entirely from inscriptions. Pasidienus is a rare gentilicum. Bernard Remy believes it is Etruscan in origin.Bernard Remy, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.) (Pont-Bithynie, Galatie, Cappadoce, Lycie-Pamphylie et Cilicie) (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 27 However, noting that the suffix -enus was typical of names from Picenum and the vicinity, other authorities believe that the Pasidieni were of Picentine or Umbrian descent.George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 8 (1897), pp. 121f Based on a fragmentary inscription, Attilio Degrassi identified Firmus with the ordinary consul for the year, Nerva Silianus, arguing that Nerva Silianus had a polyonymous name. Some authorities were uncomfortable with this identification, since it presumed Firmus had been adopted by a member of the patrician Licinii Nerae, which would lead to a number of problems. The discovery of a military diploma dated to 18 June of the consulship of Nerva Silianus and Pasidienus Firmus decisively proved they were two different men. This strengthened the likely identification of Firmus with the identically named proconsular governor of Bithynia and Pontus. He is known from coins minted in Nicomedia, and a Greek inscription erected by Nicea and Nicomedia to memorialize him as their patron. This Firmus is thought to have governed the public province for two years during the reign of Claudius; Remy offers a specific term for his tenure, from the year 48 to 50. Remy connects his lengthy tenure to the victorious campaign (in 48-49) of Gaius Julius Aquila in the Cimmerian Bosphorus against Mithridates, the former king of Bosphorus, a campaign to which Claudius and his advisers attributed exceptional importance by awarding excessive rewards to the victorious generals. If these two are the same man, this would suggest that Firmus came to the consulate quite late in life, 15 years after his governing Bithynia and more than 20 years after he was praetor, typical for a homo novus.Remy, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales, p. 28 It is clear that he is related to Lucius Pasidienus Firmus, suffect consul in 75. If the younger Firmus were his son, the unusually brief period between their consulates would help confirm the theory he came to the consulate late in life. However, it is equally possible the younger Firmus could be a nephew or a cousin.

Plot Caretta \\"Cara\\" Rudland (Minka Kelly) loses her advertising job in Chicago and returns to the family beach house in South Carolina at the request of her mother, Lovie (Andie MacDowell). Not long after Cara arrives, Lovie tries to set her up with an old flame, Brett Beauchamps (Chad Michael Murray). Having just gotten out of a relationship and not planning on staying for very long, Cara resists. Lovie works with her friend Flo (Donna Biscoe) and other locals to protect wild sea turtles during their spawning cycle. Cara has always resented her mother's devotion to the turtles (Lovie went so far as to source the name \\"Caretta\\" from the scientific name for loggerheads). Cara is also initially jealous when she meets Toy Sooner (Makenzie Vega), a single, pregnant 20-year-old whom Lovie has taken in. In addition, Cara must contend with Palmer (Donny Boaz), her assertive, ambitious brother. Their relationship is tense, as he resents her for moving to Chicago and leaving him to deal with their late father, who was a domineering man. He announces plans to move Lovie in with his family and put up condos on the property where the beach house currently stands. Cara and Lovie object, but Palmer refuses to listen. When Lovie reveals that she has terminal cancer and likely will not live much longer, Cara attempts to restore their relationship. She helps out by fixing up the house and marking the turtles' nests on the beach. Faced with the reality of death, Lovie finds the courage to stand up to Palmer, taking back control of her finances and planning to leave the beach house to Cara. During a hurricane, Flo digs up the turtle eggs, despite it being illegal, and brings them to the beach house for safe keeping. Toy is rescued from the elements by Brett before she gives birth three weeks early. After the hurricane, they all reunite. Cara and Brett rekindle their romance, Palmer comes to terms with his mother's wishes and cancer diagnosis, and Lovie and Flo rebury the turtle eggs on the beach. At the end of the summer, Lovie dies peacefully. One year later Cara is still living in South Carolina, is in a loving relationship with Brett, and helps oversee the turtles hatching.

It consists of scoria cones with lava flows and has been active until recently.  Geography and geomorphology  The field lies in Hoggar, close to the Atakor volcanic field. A dome-like uplift has been associated with the volcanism in the region. The presence of volcanism has been explained by tectonic events associated with the collision between Europe and Africa, and the resulting reactivation of ancient tectonic lineaments. The field consists of scoria cones and covers a surface of . Many of these have breaches and are heavily eroded. The cones were strombolianically active and have erupted lava flows. Volcanic ash and pyroclastics are also found. Oukcem is a maar in the field that consists of two separate craters with diametres of and respectively. They are surrounded by tuffs and natron is found at the bottom of the larger crater.  Geology  The basement consists of metamorphic and plutonic rocks of Precambrian age, which are part of the Tuareg shield. Outcrops of granite are found in some places. These were first buried by tholeiitic basalts between 35 and 30 million years ago. The field has mostly erupted basalt and basanite. Xenoliths include peridotite and pyroxenite, and amphibole and feldspar form megacrysts in the rocks. Xenoliths appear to, in part, originate from a metasomatized mantle. The total volume of erupted rocks is about .  Eruptive history  Three phases of volcanic activity have been distinguished at Manzaz, the first between 20 and 12 million years ago, the second between 7 and 4 million years ago and the third between 3 and 0.01 million years ago. Volcanic activity continued into the Holocene. Some young volcanoes developed on terraces of Neolithic age.

IAEA investigation  Starting in 2005, IAEA gathered information from its member states indicating that Iran had launched in the late 1980s a plan aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device. This information indicated that these activities started within Departments of the Physics Research Centre (PHRC), and by the early 2000s came to be focused on projects of the Amad plan under the leadership of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.
