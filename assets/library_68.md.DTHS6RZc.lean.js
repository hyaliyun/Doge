Since 1 January 2005, Dinxperlo has been part of the municipality of Aalten. Before 2005, Dinxperlo was a separate municipality, covering the town of Dinxperlo itself and the village of De Heurne. The name of the village probably is derived from dingspel (justice court or area)cf. Thingspiele and loo (wood). A popular explanation is that in the Middle Ages there was a court in the woods here. Dinxperlo used to have a coat of arms depicting Lady Justice. Attractions One of the town's main attractions is the Netherlands' smallest church (Kerkje \\"De Rietstap\\"). Another is a border museum (Grenslandmuseum). Transportation The nearest train stations are Aalten railway station and Terborg railway station, with train service operated by Arriva every half-hour. Bus number 40 connects Dinxperlo to Terborg station and bus number 195 connects Dinxperlo to Aalten station. Both services start in the Willem van Oranjeplein. The service runs from Arnhem (Arnhem railway station) to Doetinchem and Winterswijk stopping at various places on the way. Dutch-German border One street in Dinxperlo, Heelweg, is partly German in the village of Suderwick, (district Borken). The road itself lies in the Netherlands, but one side of the housing zone is in Germany (where it is called Hellweg). The unique boundary line is delimited by a treaty between Germany and the Netherlands signed in April 1960, which resulted in the return of Suderwick to then West Germany on 1 August 1963 after the Netherlands annexed the village soon after the Second World War as part of claims for war reparations. The treaty also provides for the access arrangements of those living in German territory but with only access via Heelweg which is Dutch territory. The houses there belong to the small town of Suderwick, which might be translated as \\"southern area\\". Also, Dinxperlo houses a shared Dutch-German police station. Besides Dutch and German, at both sides of the border a common dialect is spoken, which is a variety of Low Saxon.

Doesburg received city rights in 1237 and had a population of in . The city is situated on the right bank of river IJssel, at the confluence of river Oude IJssel. The municipality of Doesburg is part of the Arnhem-Nijmegen agglomeration region. History Doesburg received city rights in 1237, this was one year later than the neighbouring town of Doetinchem. Because of its strategic position along the Oude IJssel and Gelderse IJssel, Doesburg has been an important fortified city for a long time. The fortification of the city made Doesburg an important economic and administrative city. The Martinikerk, the main church in Doesburg is 94 meters tall. For many reasons, many of which have to do with the IJssel decreasing in depth, the prosperity in Doesburg settled after the 15th century. Doesburg changed into a sleepy provincial town and so it would remain until after the second world war. The city was protected in 1974, designated as a historic town. As Doesburg was officially a fortified city up to 1923, town extension was not possible. After the second world war the city was rapidly extended. In the fifties on the Eastern side of the city the borough Molenveld (= mill field) was built. At south of the Oude IJssel followed in the seventies and eighties the borough Beinum. Recently at south of Beinum the borough Campstede has been built. At the beginning of the 21st century the construction of a new area at the IJsselkade was started with 44 houses and 124 apartments designed by the Italian architect Adolfo Natalini. In 2007, construction of a hotel was started called \\"Noabers\\". After a few months the hotel went bankrupt, but was taken over and reopened a year later.  Tourism  In the north of Doesburg there are several camp-sites where in the high season 4000 visitors stay each year. Also the historical inner city with several museums and many monuments draw thousands of tourists every year. Large tourist attractions are the Main court, the Doesburgse mustard factory and 'De Waag', which according to reports is the oldest public place in the Netherlands.  Industry  On the north side of the city, parallel to N317, lies the company area called Verheullweg. Here the international transport company Rotra and the construction material manufacturer Ubbink are established. To the east of the borough Beinum, along the provincial road N338, are the company areas Beinum-Oost and Beinum-West. Here various small and large ventures were established, among which are the manufacturer/wholesale company of gedistilleerd (Delcave), a houtverwerkende company (Aalbers), a plastic company (Dremefa) and a builder's company (Claus). Along the Gelderse Ijssel an iron foundry and a concrete call centre have been established, as well as, near the bridge, a builder of motor yachts.

It is situated along the Oude IJssel (Old IJssel) river in a part of the province of Gelderland called the Achterhoek . The municipality had a population of in and consists of an area of of which is water. This makes Doetinchem the largest town (by population) in the Achterhoek. On 1 January 2005, a municipal restructuring merged the neighbouring municipality of Wehl as well as the Zelhelmse Broek area with Doetinchem. Population centres The local government organization in the Netherlands is complex and fine-grained (see municipality and Govt Stats, with municipalities being divided into various entities. The municipality of Doetinchem consists of: The city ('stad'): * Doetinchem The neighborhoods ('wijken'): * Centrum * Bezelhorst * Oosseld * Dichteren * Overstegen * De Huet * De Hoop * Oosseld * Sch√∂neveld & Muziekbuurt The townships ('buurtschappen'): * Gaanderen * Wehl * IJzevoorde * Langerak  Nieuw-Wehl Wehl was a separate municipality (with about 6,750 inhabitants, including Nieuw-Wehl) until 31 December 2004, when it merged with the municipality of Doetinchem. History Slangenburg Castle It is known from archaeological finds of skulls, pottery shards, and flint arrowheads that the area was inhabited more than 11,000 years ago. These prehistoric hunters were followed by Celtic and Germanic tribes like the Franks and Saxons. Roman coins have been found and there is also archaeological evidence of the Vikings having plundered the area. The first reference to the name of Doetinchem comes in a document from the year 838 which mentions a 'villa Duetinghem', a settlement with a small church. In 887, there is another mention of 'Deutinkem', a fortress with a church which had been given to the then Bishop of Utrecht. The spelling has varied over the centuries, with 'Duttichem', 'Duichingen' and 'Deutekom' being just some examples. For a long time Doetinchem remained a small place but around 1100 it started to grow and, after suffering several attempts by plunderers, a town wall was built. In 1236, Doetinchem was granted city rights ('stadsrechten') by Count Otto II of Gelre and Zutphen, and in return the town provided taxes and soldiers for the Count's army. Also, the new city council published rules for the city, codified in the 'Keurboek van Doetinchem' (Rulebook of Doetinchem), which laid down severe punishments for infringements. In 1226, Doetinchem faced increasing danger from plunderers, and so the city wall was raised by a metre. There were four barriers in the wall which, being weak points, were replaced over time by four large city-gates known as: the Hamburgerpoort (built 1302), the Waterpoort, the Gruitpoort, and the Hezenpoort. Later a moat was dug around the wall and a rampart was built in front; the city's central windmill, the 'walmolen' (Dutch 'wal'=rampart, 'molen'=mill), stands on the remains of this rampart. Despite these defences, Doetinchem was besieged many times and during the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648) was besieged and conquered twice. However, eventually the walls became seen as redundant (or perhaps ineffective) and in 1672, they were torn down. However, it was not until the second half of the 19th century that the city-gates and most of the rampart were removed. From its early years, Doetinchem had been an important marketplace for farmers to sell their wares; the market was held in the central square called the Simonsplein right up until the Second World War. Doetinchem has had its fair share of disasters. Apart from the sieges mentioned above, in 1527 a large fire destroyed most of the city including the city archives (which means that many earlier dates in the history of Doetinchem are somewhat unreliable), and in 1580 most of the city was killed by plague. There was also occasional flooding. However, despite the fact that Doetinchem is only from the German border, because the Netherlands was not involved in the First World War, Doetinchem saw nothing more than the posting of a few border guards during that time. Even during the Second World War, Doetinchem came off fairly lightly at first; there was only a small German occupying force and the city even escaped the worst effects of the Hunger Winter. However, some prisoners were executed after being implicated in the shooting death in Putten of an important German officer by the Dutch Resistance and disastrously, in March and April 1945, the centre of Doetinchem was largely destroyed by Allied bombing which was either intended for nearby German towns or, as some say, was to destroy the German defenses in Doetinchem. Which of the two is true has never really been clarified and there is still some discussion about the true intentions of the bombardment. The city itself was liberated by The Calgary Highlanders in 1945 after a brief battle there. In 2018 a writer called Karel Berkhuysen researched about the Allied bombing. He found that the Germans were researching nuclear fission in a converted school. This information was then passed to the Allies. In the decades after the war, Doetinchem grew and in a few years had outgrown its \\"competitors\\" in the Achterhoek, namely Doesburg, Winterswijk and Zutphen. The Dutch company, Philips, had a factory for some years in the city. From 2003 till 2005, the city grew enormously as new districts such as Dichteren were built, and as Doetinchem incorporates outlying villages such as Wehl into its municipality. In 2011, the city is still growing. By building new district as het Loo and Isseldoks, and the opening of a brand new theatre and cinema, Doetinchem is the biggest growing city in Gelderland. Significant structures in Doetinchem  The main church in the central square, St Catherine's Church ('Catharinakerk') was virtually destroyed in the World War II bombing and restoration took from 1948 to 1963. Although originally a Roman Catholic church, it became Dutch Reformed in 1591. There are two castles, 'De Kelder' ('The Cellar') and Slangenburg. The city has three windmills. In the city centre, there is the already mentioned De Walmolen, the bottom of which now houses the city's tourist office. In Dichteren, there is a mill called Aurora (Latin for 'dawn') and to the east of the city a mill called Benninkmolen. All these mills are open to visitors, usually open to all one weekday morning and at other times by appointment. A few other important buildings in the city are the Amphion-Theater, the Gruitpoort, a big cultural centre, the Rietveld Lyceum, the biggest high school in Doetinchem and the Tax administration office. Sport Doetinchem has a professional football team, De Graafschap ('The County'). The home of De Graafschap was completely revamped to transform it into an all-seater arena. The stands are fully covered, with the roof painted in the blue and white of the club. The city has an indoor swimming pool, Rozengaarde. In April or May, a local evening four-day marathon is organized. Since 2005 a four-day marathon is organised which starts and ends in Doetinchem and runs through the Achterhoek. The marathon was held from 23 August to the 26th. Almost 15.000 people took part. In 2009 the city's volleyballteam took part in the CEV cup playing against Haltbank Ankara from Turkey. Festivals Doetinchem has an annual street-theater festival Buitengewoon (Extraordinary), and the City Festival, a big festival with musicacts, theatre, a carnival and fireworks.

Transport  Doetinchem has been connected to the Dutch national highway system since November 1974, when the Zevenaar-Doetinchem section of Highway 15 (A15) was opened. This section was extended to Varsseveld in 1984. Today the A15 is called the A18. Doetinchem is served by rail services from Arnhem by the regional train to Winterswijk with two stations, one in the city centre ‚Äì Doetinchem and Doetinchem De Huet lying to the west between the suburbs of De Huet and Dichteren. Doetinchem receives four trains per hour to Arnhem (Monday to Friday) and there are always 2 trains per hour between Arnhem and Winterswijk. In 2012, Arriva, took over the rail services between Arnhem and Winterswijk from NS and Syntus Bus services are also operated by Arriva.

There are no connections to any water nearby; however, there also is a direct road connection to the city of Wageningen which hosts a small industrial port on the river Rijn and a direct road and rail connection to the city of Arnhem, which features a larger port at a greater distance. The environment is clean and green due to the fact that Ede is partly built in a forest and partly on the central Dutch plains in the national park called Nationaal Park \\"De Hoge Veluwe\\". = Economy = Economically, the town of Ede is doing fairly well thanks to the proximity of major highways and railways which offer fast connections to the port of Rotterdam, Schiphol airport and the Ruhr Area in Germany. The main sources of employment used to be a factory belonging to the Dutch Enka company and the three military bases situated in the east of the town. The factory, however, has been closed and the military bases are largely underused since conscription was abolished. The town's economy is lately becoming more focused on national tourism from the more densely populated western cities like Amsterdam and Den Haag, and on education such as local colleges and the large Wageningen University in the city of Wageningen. Some of the more notable or larger companies and other employers in and around Ede are: * Fruit juice and drinks-factory Riedel, now part of FrieslandCampina. * Plant and flower auction house Plantion (since 1 March 2010).Homepage Plantion, visited 3 October 2010 * Advertising agency Lukkien who developed their own heliport on the roof of their office.Infopage Lukkien Heliport and Approach Map * The Dutch headquarters for Kimberly-Clark.Contact- page KCHealthcare website , visited 3 October 2010 * The Dutch headquarters of mattress and pillow manufacturer Tempur-Pedic.Contact page on Dutch website of company, visited 3 October 2010 * Deli-XL, a foodservice distributor in Belgium and the Netherlands. * The head office and two of the main datacenters of independent internet provider BIT.Contact page on BIT website, visited 2 October 2010 * The world headquarters of organ manufacturer Johannus Orgelbouw. =Transportation= Ede is situated along the A12 motorway and has a direct link to the A1 via the A30.

History There is evidence of a Neolithic settlement at Elburg consisting of stone tools and pottery shards. From Roman times there are names and shards of earthenware which suggest that there was an army camp at the site of Elburg. The earliest extant written record of Elburg is from 796 AD. Between 1392 and 1396 Elburg was rebuilt with a moat and a city wall, together with a gridiron street plan. This rapid rebuilding was expensive, indicating that Elburg was reasonably affluent in medieval times. Several records of Elburg date back to the 14th century. Elburg was granted town status probably by Count Otto II In the 13th century. There is a record that Elburg got its fishing right granted in 1313. In 1367 the city was recorded as a member of the Hanseatic League. At the end of the 16th century new moats and higher ramparts were built because of the improved war-techniques. Throughout the centuries, Elburgh remained a fishing and farming center until the end of World War II. Unlike many other Dutch towns, Elburg had refused to use city funds to build a railroad station in 1863. Because the land owners were asking unreasonably high prices for the right of way over their property, the track line Utrecht-Amersfoort-Zwolle bypassed Elburg. As a consequence, Elburg became less attractive for manufacturers compared with neighboring places like Harderwijk and Nunspeet. In addition, the closing off of the Zuiderzee in 1932 meant an end to the fishing industry of Elburg, since the former salt water bay gradually became a fresh water body. Therefore, since 1956, the city concluded that only tourism would be the most viable sector for the local economy. Because of its favourable position both on the edge of the canal and near the Veluwemeer, tourists have made it a popular tourist destination. Each year many visit to see the largely unchanged medieval town, especially during the 'Midweekfeesten' (mid-week feasts), 'Botterdagen' (Botter days - a botter is a type of flat-bottomed fishing boat) and 'Winter in de Vesting' (Winter in the Fortress), which attract more than 30,000 visitors each year.

Human presence in the area goes back further however, with many archaeological finds of the Bell-Beaker culture having been made in the area. Windmill De Koe For a long time the town most likely consisted of little more than a few farms and some other buildings like a windmill and a church and it didn't really grow much until the 19th century; in the year 1830 a road was made to make this part of the Veluwe more accessible and at the end of the 19th century the town got a railway station. Because the railway station was some distance away from what was then the town centre a road was constructed, the Stationsstraat, which is now considered to be the centre of the town. After the second world war a shortage of houses resulted in a rapid growth of Ermelo. In 1973 Nunspeet became its own separate municipality after having been part of Ermelo before. In 2005, Ermelo celebrated its 1150-year-long existence. Various artists from across the country performed during the festivities. A classic windmill dating from 1863 located in the town centre, named (The Cow), partially burned down in 1990 after having been hit by lightning, but was restored to working order in late 2008. A nightclub moved out due to the complete renovation. Recreation There are many campsites in the forests surrounding Ermelo which are popular place to stay for mainly Dutch and German tourists. Cycling through the forests and heaths is a popular activity, especially during the summer. The nearby Veluwemeer allows for recreation on the water or beach. The town centre is home to various bars and restaurants and a tourist information centre. Ermelo hosts various music festivals, such as the F√™te de la Musique, Multipop and the International Boogie Woogie Festival. In 2010 the latter featured amongst others pianist Little Willie Littlefield and saxophonist Big Jay McNeely. Transport Ermelo station The town's railway station is located near the town centre, with a train normally leaving every 30 minutes during the day both north towards Zwolle and south towards Amersfoort and Utrecht. By car, it can be easily reached from highway A28 which passes west of the town and provincial road N303 which passes through the town.

It is in the municipality of Oude IJsselstreek, about southeast of Doetinchem and northwest of the German city Bocholt. It has approximately 4400 inhabitants. In the Middle Ages, Gendringen was a fortress. Being property of the archbishop of K√∂ln (Cologne), Gendringen was loaned to the lords living in the castle of 's-Heerenberg. In 1830, downtown Gendringen burned down for the most part. Nowadays, most of the entrepreneurs of the town are situated in the Grotestraat, which makes this street the most important street of downtown Gendringen. Gendringen was a separate municipality until 2005. Then, due to the municipal re-organization in the Achterhoek, Gendringen and Wisch joined together into Oude IJsselstreek. Gendringen has two primary schools: Catholic school Christoffelschool and Christian school De Hoeksteen. On the north of the village is the industrial zone De IJsselweide, which is between Gendringen and nearby town Ulft. In the northeast of the village, there is a large park, Het Kernspark. On the east of Gendringen there is a large recreation area, Engbergen, with a forest with hiking routes, a restaurant with a large playground, an open-air theatre, a golf court, a corn mill, and a petting zoo. Gendringen can be accessed easily both by car and public transport: the nearest highway is 15 minutes away, and on weekdays, a bus drives between Gendringen and Doetinchem railway station at least every 30 minutes. Gendringen also has its own small airport suitable for ultralight aircraft approximately on the east of the village in nearby neighbourhood Voorst. Examples of events held every year in Gendringen are Amfipop, a low-budget pop festival, the village fair, the carnival and King's Day festivities, and Gast in Gendringen, an event with artists giving small concerts in several houses and small buildings throughout the village.

Groenlo was a municipality until 1 January 2005, when it merged with Lichtenvoorde. Until 19 May 2006 Groenlo was the official name of Oost Gelre. As of 1 January 2006 Groenlo, including its hamlet Zwolle, counted a population of 10,067. Groenlo is known locally and historically as Grolle, Groll or Grol. Today, Groenlo is known primarily for its beer brewery Grolsch (literal meaning: \\"from Grol\\"), which was in business since 1615, but has been closed in 2004 when it moved to Boekelo. Grolsch produces many specialty beers (including beers for each season) and its beer is exported all over the world. Groenlo's military history is less well known today. History The old shield of Groenlo Canons placed alongside the canals in Groenlo. Groenlo originates from the beginning of the 7th century. The name Groenlo refers to a green wood that lay in the neighbourhood (groen means \\"green\\", lo means \\"forest\\"), hence the old shield of Groenlo, a green tree. Groenlo became a Guelders enclave of Borculo. On 2 December 1277, it received city rights from landgrave Reinoud I of Zutphen. There were six councilors, four of which were aldermen and two mayors. The judicial archive of Groenlo is very incomplete. Since 1406, Groenlo has been part of the bishopric of M√ºnster. The city was an important trade center along the German‚ÄìDutch trade route, which resulted in a rich variety of guilds. It became a strong stronghold during the 16th and 17th century. The stronghold was repeatedly besieged during the Eighty Years' War. The city still has a defensively shaped Gracht (canal) and (the remains of) bulwarks stemming from this era. In 1597 the city was conquered by Maurice of Nassau. In 1606 it was reconquered by Spanish troops led by Spinola. In 1627 Groenlo was besieged and conquered by Frederik Hendrik, one of Groenlo's most important historical events. This happening still has its effects in present- day in the form of street names and the names of establishments in the city. Two restaurants in its historical center are appropriately named Frederik Hendrik and \\"Het Belegh van Grol\\" (The Siege of Grol). The battles of the Eighty Years' War are re-enacted regularly, drawing sizable crowds. As part of wider tourist attraction plan, some of Groenlo's old bulwarks have been under restoration in 2007, causing some controversy making local and even national television, the reason being a large number of large trees that had to be cut down for the plan. Tourism is of major importance to Groenlo, with over 3500 tourists spending the night locally at given times. Groenlo has been under Spanish control for a considerable time during its violent history, which has left its marks. The majority of the local population is of Catholic persuasion, an exception (together with Lichtenvoorde) in the mainly Protestant region. This has resulted in several Catholic traditions being celebrated locally, such as Carnaval and \\"Kermis\\", as well as a relatively large number of licensed establishment and festivities.

In January 2015 the former municipality merged with Millingen aan de Rijn and Ubbergen. The larger area was known as Groesbeek until January 2016, when its name was changed to Berg en Dal. Description Groesbeek is named after a small stream called the Groesbeek (beek being Dutch for \\"stream\\" or \\"brook\\"), which no longer exists in its original form. Hills and forests surround the town, and because of this, Groesbeek was isolated in the past, with a close community and a strong dialect. Geography Groesbeek and Kranenburg are situated on the banks of the Groesbeek, a small stream in the Groesbeek valley, a large valley between the Nijmeegse heuvelrug and Reichswald. The Groesbeek valley was carved out by glaciers during the Saale glacial, marking the southernmost expansion of ice-age glaciers in the Netherlands. The hills surrounding the valley in which Groesbeek lies are technically the terminal moraines of those glaciers, but in contrast to the hills in the central and eastern Netherlands, these hills are rising by 0.5-0.8 mm/year due to tectonic uplift. Due to this, the topography is much more varied here than in other higher grounds with similar origins in the Netherlands. Finally, during the Younger Dryas stadial, large amounts of loess were deposited in the valley, making it extremely fertile, while the hills around it are composed to this day of sandy loam unsuitable for intensive agriculture, so that the area has been covered with thick forests to this day. This contributed to the isolation of the area, especially considering the extent of the forests in the Middle Ages was much larger than today. The isolation of the valley was only alleviated by the arrival of the railway in 1865 and finally lifted in the interbellum by the construction of a high capacity paved road to nearby Nijmegen. World War II During Operation Market Garden the 82nd Airborne Division landed near Groesbeek. In the subsequent fighting the town was nearly completely destroyed and inhabitants were evacuated. The National Liberation museum is based in Groesbeek on one of the landing sites of operation Market Garden, and the Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery also resides there. Modern Groesbeek Annual wine harvest festival in Groesbeek Because of much better infrastructure and a generally increased amount of mobility among the Dutch after WW2, modern Groesbeek has transformed from a small village dependent on agriculture and forestry into a sprawling commuter town of nearby Nijmegen. The town itself is surrounded by hills and forests, including a three-kilometre wide band of woodlands, Dekkerswald, separating it from Heilig Landstichting and Nijmegen proper. In the last decade a viniculture industry has sprung up in Groesbeek, making the area the northernmost vinicultural centre in Europe, and the only such area in the Netherlands, owing to the highly fertile loess soil, generally warmer summers, and new variations of grapes which do better in the humid climate. Despite having under 20,000 inhabitants, Groesbeek has one football club, (De Treffers), playing in the Tweede Divisie, the country's highest amateur level. Another club, Achilles '29, accepted promotion to the national first division in 2013 (the first club that accepted promotion in many years). There are also four other football teams: Germania, D.V.S.G., Groesbeekse boys and Rood-Wit. The town is also well known as the setting of the third day of the Nijmeegse Vierdaagse when walkers participating in this international event have to pass through the town and the surrounding hills. Groesbeek is also famous for having one of the biggest parades in the Netherlands on the Sunday of the Catholic carnival. Because of its success, places are now limited as the parade. In the area The town has two notable museums: the Freedom Museum and the Bible Open Air Museum. The Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery and Memorial is located about two kilometers north of the town.

It is served by the Harderwijk railway station. Its population centres are Harderwijk and Hierden. Harderwijk is on the western boundary of the Veluwe. The southeastern half of the municipality is largely forests.  History  Harderwijk received city rights from Count Otto II of Guelders in 1231.Stenvert, R. et al. (2000). Monumenten in Nederland: Gelderland, p. 50 and 183‚Äì188. Zwolle: Waanders Uitgevers. A defensive wall surrounding the city was completed by the end of that century. The oldest part of the city is near where the streets Hoogstraat and Grote Poortstraat now are. Around 1315 the city was expanded southwards, which included the construction of what is now called the Grote Kerk (Great Church). A second, northward expansion took place around 1425. Particularly along the west side of town, much of the wall still exists but often not in entirely original form. That also goes for the only remaining city gate, the Vischpoort (Fish Gate). Between 1648 and 1811, the University of Harderwijk operated in the city. The Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist, Carl Linnaeus graduated at this university. The university, together with the universities of Zutphen and Franeker, was abolished by Napoleon. Harderwijk was a member of the Hanseatic League. It lies on what used to be the Zuiderzee shore (Southern Sea, now the IJsselmeer) and consequently its economy was strongly based on fishing and seafaring in general. That dramatically changed after 1932, when the Zuiderzee was cut off from the North Sea for safety reasons. Few fishing boats thus now remain in the Harbour, which now is home mainly to yachts. An annual event illustrating the former importance of the fishing industry to Harderwijk is Aaltjesdag, which translates to Eel day. Fish can still be bought at stands and restaurants on the boulevard throughout the year except for the winter months. Tourists are common customers, but local people no longer make their living from the fisheries. Today, Harderwijk is probably known best for the Dolfinarium Harderwijk, a marine mammal park where dolphin shows are held and various other marine mammals and fish are kept.

The municipality had a population of in . The municipality includes the hamlet of 't Zand. Name origin Dutch Topographic map of Hattem, June 2015 The name ‚ÄúHattem‚Äù is a typical farmyard name. The exact origin of ‚ÄúHattem‚Äù is yet unclear. In general two explanation exist. Hattem would be the ‚Äòheem‚Äô (home) of a people who belong to the tribe of Chattuarii (or Hattuarii or Hatten). A second origin could refer to the leader of a people under the leader Hatto. This fits with the fact that a lot of farmyard names are deduced from persons names. History A document referring to Hattem is found is dated around 800. This document is the Codex Laureshamensis, in which the settlement Hattem is mentioned because two farmhouses in this place are donated to the Lorsch abbey. =Established as parish= Despite this early statement, no church or chapel was built in Hattem. In 1176 Hattem became a parish (‚Äòkerspel‚Äô). The chapel, measuring 17,5 by 9,5 meter, was not built at the current city centre, but at the Gaedsberg (‚ÄòGods-mountain‚Äô). The borders of the parish coincide with the latter borders of the jurisdiction Hattem. Hattem obtained city rights in 1299 from the landgrave Reinoud I van Gelre. In the decades before a fortified town is founded at the northern border of the Veluwe. The city plan lies around the current church. The tower of this church is dated to the 12th century which indicates that, beside the parish church at the Gaedsberg, a chapel was present at the current city centre of Hattem. With obtaining town privileges, both the religious and the legal centre were moved. The new church and the city are dedicated to the apostle Andreas. =Later history= View of the 'Spanish Trenches', ramp work from the Eighty Years' War In 1401, duke William of Guelders donated the Hoenwaard to the citizens of Hattem, in order to feed their cattle and to manufacture bricks for their houses. In 1404 the castle St. Lucia was built, which became known as the ‚ÄúDikke Tinne‚Äù (the fat merlon). The reason can be found in the thick castle walls, at that time the thickest walls found in the Netherlands. In 1778, the castle was torn down, in order to use the bricks to build houses. In 1786, both Hattem and Elburg became known as centres of the Patriottentijd, a political faction. These movements however were successfully suppressed by stadtholder William V. Other information Hattem had a railway station from 21 November 1887 until 8 October 1950. The current mayor of Hattem is Marleen Sanderse (CDA). Hattem, bordering the forests of ‚ÄòDe Veluwe‚Äô and along the IJssel river has much to offer: cosy terraces, interesting museums, a large variety of authentic shops an annually returning events. Hattem celebrates De dikke tinne festival every two years in a medieval atmosphere. Nobeltje is founded in Hattem.

History Archaeological excavations have found remains dating back to the Stone Age and Iron Age although it is not known if the area was permanently inhabited. The Neder-Betuwe area is along the northernmost border or limes of the Roman empire. Evidence suggests that a Roman fort (Castra) was maintained where the town of Kesteren now is. Around 1300 the first dikes were put up to protect the inhabitants and agricultural lands from flooding. Most churches are reformed, there are no Catholic churches in the Neder-Betuwe area. The eastern municipal border also marks an invisible religious border, to the east a considerable part of the population is Catholic. This can be explained by the presence of a dike called the Spanjaardsdijk or Spaniards Dike which was built before or during the Eighty Years' War. The local ruler was Protestant, the rulers to the east were Catholic. During World War II the area saw a lot of fighting. During the German invasion in May 1940 the area was attacked since it was on the southern flank of the attack towards the Grebbeberg. In September 1944 the area again came under fire during and after operation Market Garden. The narrowest part of the Betuwe became the western front of the allied bridgehead in the area. Opheusden was basically ruined because of the constant fighting between the Germans and the 101st Airborne Division and later British forces and the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade. Ochten was flattened by British forces using artillery and mortars from south of the Waal. In February 1995, Ochten received international media attention because of a weakened dike after a prolonged period of high waterlevels in the rivers. This situation and the state of other dikes forced 250,000 people in this region to evacuate. The river levels had been unusually high for almost two months, reaching record heights during the first days of February. Although the dike started to shift, a huge rescue operation managed to stabilize the dike. Several months later the already planned strengthening of the dike started with almost no opposition. Some people who opposed the strengthening before the evacuation, mainly because of NIMBYism, were harassed by some locals. Geography The municipal boundaries are for a large part defined by the river Waal to the south, the river Rhine to the North and the Amsterdam- Rhine Canal to the west. Because of the location between the two rivers the area is as narrow as near Opheusden. The area is basically a polder, dikes protect the former floodplain from flooding. Since it was a floodplain the area is relatively flat and the soil is mainly clay with layers of sand and gravel underneath. =Topography= 540px Dutch Topographic map of the municipality of Neder-Betuwe, June 2015 =Population centres= Transport The highway A15 runs east to west through Neder-Betuwe. A provincial road crosses the Rhine near Kesteren and another provincial road crosses the Waal near Echteld. A railway line through the area was built in 1882, connecting Geldermalsen and Amersfoort to Nijmegen. A new dedicated freight railway line called the Betuweroute was opened on June 16, 2007. This line connects the port of Rotterdam to Germany and beyond. A ferry operates a service across the Rhine between Opheusden and Wageningen. During summer months a small ferry transports people between Dodewaard and Druten, mainly tourists, across the river Waal as part of several recreational bicycle routes. Economy The local economy runs mostly on agriculture (fruit plantations and tree nurseries) and some factories. The economy blossomed after the completion of the railway line through the area making it possible to transport fresh fruit. A considerable part of the local population works outside the municipal boundaries. =Power plant= Dodewaard nuclear power plant awaiting demolition. In Dodewaard, the Dodewaard nuclear power plant with a boiling water reactor has been decommissioned. It was operational in the period 1968-1997. It had a capacity of 58 MW. In 2003 the last fissionable material was removed. Parts of the plant were demolished, the main building is in a 40-year waiting period of \\"safe enclosure\\" from 2005-2045, before being demolished. The main source of radioactivity is cobalt-60 with a half-life of 5.27 years, hence it is reduced by a factor 193 in 40 years. Waiting longer is not as effective, since at that time the main source of radioactivity will become nickel-63 with a half-life of 100.1 years. The spent uranium and the uranium left when operation was discontinued were transported to BNFL in Sellafield for nuclear reprocessing. See also nuclear reactors in the Netherlands.

The community of Scherpenzeel also contains a part of the hamlet of Moorst. 400px Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Scherpenzeel, June 2015 History =Founding= Centuries ago, what is now the Netherlands was still a collection of small states, ruled by bishops, earls, dukes, and lords. These rulers were constantly at war over territory, causing fortifications and defenses to be built in border areas. This was the case in the Veluwe hills, which lay along the border of what is now Utrecht and Gelderland, where many castles and fortresses were constructed as safe havens. Hence, the name \\"Scherpenzeel\\", formerly known as \\"Scarpenzele\\", allows us to infer that there was a settlement built around a house (\\"zele\\") with sharpened poles (\\"scarpen\\"), the prototype of an old castle. The possession of Scherpenzeel was at various times claimed by either Gelderland or Utrecht, but it has now been a part of Gelderland since 1830. Scherpenzeel House (town hall) Scherpenzeel House The town's most notable landmark, Scherpenzeel House (Huize Scherpenzeel in Dutch; located at 3 Burgemeester Royaardslaan) began as a 14th-century tower house. In the following centuries, it underwent several modifications. In 1652, it was expanded considerably by Lady Aleyd of Scherpenzeel. In the years 1857-1858, it acquired its present Neogothic form, designed by S.A. van Lunteren, who also designed the surrounding park. At the time it belonged to the Royaard family, who maintained residence there until 1956. In 1975, Scherpenzeel House was declared a national monument and entrusted to the municipality. The building was used as the town hall until 2003.Stenvert, R. et al. (2000), Monumenten in Nederland: Gelderland, p. 287-288\\\\. Zwolle: Waanders Uitgevers. .

The town is enclosed by the Waal river and the Linge river on the south and the north side, and the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal on the east side. The city was founded in the 5th century AD.  Population centres  = The town of Tiel = Tiel is the largest town in the Betuwe area, which is famous for being one of the centres of Dutch fruit production. Orchards in the area produce apples, pears, plums and cherries. Tiel once housed the famous jam factory De Betuwe. After production was moved to Breda in 1993, the entire complex was demolished, although a part was reconstructed later. Reminding of this industry is a jam manufacturing museum and a statue of Flipje, the raspberry-based comic figure who starred in De Betuwe's, jam factory advertisements since the 1930s. Tiel is one of the oldest towns in the Netherlands. Originally located on the Linge river it became an important centre of trade in the early Middle Ages, especially after the demise of Dorestad in the 9th century. Later in the Middle Ages Tiel was associated with the Hanseatic League. At the height of its glory Tiel had two big churches, one of which, the St. Walburg, was a collegiate church that belonged to the Teutonic Knights and vanished after the Reformation while the other church, the St. Maarten, became Protestant. Much of the historic centre was destroyed during the Second World War. Every year, on the third Saturday in September, a festival known as 'Fruitcorso' is held to celebrate the fruit harvest from the Betuwe area. On this day, a parade of wagons, decorated with fruit, travels through the city, competing for the top three ranking. This top three is split in a 'normal' and a 'youth' category, with the wagons in the youth category featuring smaller wagons. Along the canal fruit mosaics are made by various organisations, also competing for a place in the top three. In the past, this event was accompanied by 'Appelpop', a free, two-day music event on the Waalkade. Due to Appelpop's popularity, Fruitcorso and Appelpop were split up, with Appelpop taking the second Friday and Saturday of September. Tiel has also been known for its pewter industry. The last pewter factory cum museum, which mainly produced collectibles for tourists, went bankrupt in early 2004, but has since been revived. Tiel can be a good starting point to explore the rest of the scenic Betuwe area, particularly in May when all the fruit trees in the surrounding areas are in bloom.

On 1 January 2005 the municipality merged with Hummelo en Keppel, Steenderen, Hengelo en Zelhem, to form the new municipality Bronckhorst. Vorden is intersected by the road from Zutphen to Ruurlo (N319) and by the Baak creek (locally called Vorden Creek), which flows to the IJssel. Vorden is located on the Zutphen - Winterswijk railway line, which was opened in 1878 and has a central station on the station road.  The town of Vorden  The name 'Vorden' occurred for the first time in documents from 1121 AD. The town has long had a predominantly agricultural function. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century this started to change, when some industry and self-employed started to flourish. Vorden is known for its eight castles: Vorden (that served as town-hall), Onstein, Medler, Hackfort, Kieftskamp, Wierse, Wildenborg and Den Bramel. The surrounding area of Vorden is known to hold equestrian events periodically including an annual fox hunt, now replaced by drag hunting, in late autumn.  History and Architecture  In the Middle Ages Vorden originated on a deck area located on the \\"Vordensche\\" brook, close to house Vorden. The village probably owes its name to the word 'Voorde', which means ford. In 1235 it became an independent parish. Until 2005, Vorden was an independent municipality, but as a result of a municipal reorganisation, on 1 January of that year, Vorden merged with the neighboring municipalities of Hummelo and Keppel, Steenderen, Hengelo and Zelhem to form the municipality of Bronckhorst. Other centers in the former municipality were Delden, Kranenburg, Linde, Medler, Mossel, Veldwijk, Vierakker, Wichmond, Wientjesvoort and Wildenborch. In 2014, the centre of Vorden was redesigned, with a number of roads being moved and in some places the pavements were also made wider. In addition, trees have been planted and a new parking lot has been laid out for long-term parkers.  Castle village  Vorden is best known for the eight castles it has, making it one of the most castles-rich villages in the Netherlands. House Vorden is on the outskirts of the village, the other seven are in a circle around it. House Vorden was first mentioned in 1315. In 1580, during the Eighty Years' War, it was looted and restored thirty years later. In 1976 it was restored and functioned as a town hall. In 2004, the municipality of Vorden sold the castle to a private individual. Since then the castle has been used as a wedding location. Hackfort Castle was first mentioned in 1324. After being partially destroyed by a fire in 1586, during the Eighty Years' War, it was rebuilt. The current fa√ßade in Louis XVI style got it in 1788. Nowadays it is divided into apartments. Castle Den Bramel of the version mentioned for the first time in 1396 and that from about 1645, little more remains; the current building dates largely from the period 1720‚Äì1726. The Kieftskamp Castle in Louis XV style, was erected in 1776. In 1920 and 1930 it was expanded. The Wildenborch Castle is a former manor, first mentioned in 1372. After devastation in 1490 it was rebuilt between 1523 and 1533. In the 17th century it was largely demolished. The remaining gate tower became part of a new country house built in 1782. The son of the clients was the poet Anthony Staring, who lived there from 1791 to 1840. The rebuilding of 1847 was undone in 1931. De Wiersse Castle was first mentioned in 1288. In the meantime, it was rebuilt in 1681. In the 18th century and in 1925 it underwent renovations. Castle Onstein, in Louis XIV style, was built in 1711 on a spot where a mansion from 1613 had previously stood. Nowadays in the possession of Hans Melchers. The Medler Castle, is a mansion dating from the 17th century, which was later renovated several times. The Enzerinck Castle, is a neoclassical country house built in 1835‚Äì1836. The Wientjesvoort dating from 1850 has the same style.

The 53rd Welsh Division and the 3rd British Infantry Division, were moving from Bocholt via Aalten to Winterswijk. The tank battle resulted in sixteen German and nine British soldiers losing their lives. On 31 March, 1945 (Good Friday) around nine o'clock in the evening allied forces had a struggle just over five km south of Winterswijk following reinforcements from the NSB. On 31 March the first allied troops finally reached the Slingestream near Winterswijk. 31 March is marked as the official day to remember the liberation of Winterswijk, despite the fact that in the late afternoon of 31 March parts of Miste and Woold were already liberated. After the liberation of Winterswijk they founded a Rest- Centre for British soldiers in the Soci√´teit de Eendracht (Zonnebrink), where the British soldiers, who came from the front, could find some rest.

The name Salehem comes from two words 'Sale' which means 'house' and 'heim' which means 'place where people are home'. The founder of this chapel was a passionate preacher called Liudger. He brought religion to the land of the Saksen. Between 1450 and 1500 the church as we know it was built. It was dedicated to St. Lambertus, bishop of Maastricht in the time of Ludger (hence the name 'Lambertikerk'). The myth of Smoks Hanne The village also has a myth of 'Smoks Hanne'. She lived in Zelhem somewhere in the nineteenth century. Nowadays she's pictured as a good witch flying on a broom.

In 1049, Emperor Hendrik III donated a large amount of land to five warlords of which the leader was named Bartholomeus II of Sevenaer. They founded a castle to protect the old Roman settlements from the Germans. In 1355 Sevenaer passed from the control of the county/Duchy of Guelders (to which the modern Dutch province of Gelderland refers) to the Duchy of Cleves (Cleveland). In 1487, the duke of Cleves gave Sevenaer city rights. Sevenaer was an important strategic point ‚Äìthis border area between Gelderland and Cleveland, was the border between the regions that would, over the centuries, be controlled from different centers of power ‚Äì the modern states of The Netherlands and Prussia (later, Germany). Some of the Castles and houses in Zevenaar have foundations dating back to the 14th Century Huize Sevenaer. When Sevenaer obtained city rights it had the monopoly on markets and on sale of bread and beer with the surrounding towns. Also the jurisdiction in Sevenaer was founded, the town government was charging taxes so that the town could build roads, railways and public buildings. For the 500 inhabitants that was a heavy tax. Because of the plundering by several armies there were not enough supplies and money to build anything. Also contagious diseases ensured much embarrassment. In that time not the citizens but some well-to-do families got the right to participation in policy and government. Sevenaer then experienced a prosperous period. In 1614 Sevenaer as part of the Duchy of Cleves fell under control of the Margraviate of Brandenburg which would eventually become part of Prussia. In 1793 the city had 900 inhabitants. In 1816, Sevenaer became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Two years later the old spelling of Sevenaer was changed to the current name: Zevenaar. The municipality then had 2564 inhabitants. The 19th century was a century of poverty, bad harvests, sicknesses and hunger. There was hardly trade and work. Many people lived by agriculture or from charity. In 1856, Zevenaar was connected to the European railroad system, which (just some decades later) led to the increase in workforce. In 1920, the cigarette factory Turmac came which insured much employment. After the second World War, which caused a lot of damage, people started to rebuild and new residential areas arose around the old core. In the 1950s approximately 10,000 people lived in Zevenaar. By 2005, that number had more than doubled to 22,500 inhabitants.

It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor.Facts About Tabun, National Terror Alert Response System It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun is the first of the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin). Although pure tabun is clear, less-pure tabun may be brown. It is a volatile chemical, although less so than either sarin or soman. Tabun can be destroyed with bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite), though the poisonous gas cyanogen chloride is produced. EA-4352 is an isopropyl analog to tabun. Synthesis Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, codenamed \\"Hochwerk\\", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, the first being reaction of gaseous dimethylamine (1) with an excess of phosphoryl chloride (2), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride (3, codenamed \\"Produkt 39\\" or \\"D 4\\") and dimethylammonium chloride (4). The dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of sodium cyanide (5), dispersed in dry chlorobenzene, yielding the intermediate dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide (not depicted in the scheme) and sodium chloride (8); then, absolute ethanol (6) was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun (7) and hydrogen cyanide (9). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along with insoluble salts and the rest of the hydrogen cyanide) was filtered to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, so yielding the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A) or (later in the war) of 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).Lohs, KH: Synthetische Gifte. 3., √ºberarb. u. erg. Aufl., 1967, Deutscher Milit√§rverlag, Berlin (East). 500px Effects of exposure The symptoms of exposure include:http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403300733.html nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact symptoms of overexposure are similar to those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body. The effects of tabun appear slowly when tabun is absorbed through the skin rather than inhaled. A victim may absorb a lethal dose quickly, although death may be delayed for one to two hours. A person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Inhaled lethal dosages kill in one to ten minutes, and liquid absorbed through the eyes kills almost as quickly. However, people who experience mild to moderate exposure to tabun can recover completely, if treated almost as soon as exposure occurs. The LCt50 for tabun is about 400 mg-min/m3. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) also works as an antidote; however, it must be administered within minutes to a few hours following exposure to be effective.Emergency Response Safety and Health Database. TABUN (GA): Nerve Agent. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed April 30, 2009. History The beginning of the research in the field of ethyl dialkylaminocyanophosphonate dates back to turn of the 19th century, when a student of German chemistry professor August Michaelis Adolph Schall synthesised diethylamino analog of tabun, defending his PhD thesis √úber die Einwirkung von Phosphoroxybromid auf secund√§re aliphatische Amine at University of Rostock in 1898. However, he incorrectly identified the structure of the substance as an imidoether, and his professor corrected him later in a large article Ueber die organischen Verbindungen des Phosphors mit dem Stickstoff which came out in 1903 in Liebigs Annalen. The high toxicity of the substance (as well as high toxicity of its precursor diethylamidophosphoric dichloride, and dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride) wasn't noticed at the time, most likely due to the low yield of synthethic reactions used. Tabun became the first nerve agent known after a property of this chemical was discovered by pure accident in January 1936Chemical Warfare Weapons Fact Sheets , about.comChemical Weapons: Nerve Agents, University of Washington by the German researcher Gerhard Schrader. Schrader was experimenting with a class of compounds called organophosphates, which kill insects by interrupting their nervous systems, to create a more effective insecticide for IG Farben, a German chemical and pharmaceutical industry conglomerate, at Elberfeld. He discovered that tabun, as well as being a potent insecticide, was enormously toxic to humans. During World War II, as part of the Gr√ºn 3 program, a plant for the manufacture of tabun was established at Dyhernfurth (now Brzeg Dolny, Poland), in 1939. Run by Anorgana, GmbH, the plant began production of the substance in 1942. The reason for the delay was the extreme precautions used by the plant. Intermediate products of tabun were corrosive, and had to be contained in quartz or silver-lined vessels. Tabun itself was also highly toxic, and final reactions were conducted behind double glass walls. Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with tabun's degradation over time, and only around 12,500 tons of material were manufactured before the plant was seized by the Soviet Army. The plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene, designated \\"Variant A\\", and in the latter half of the war switched to \\"Variant B\\", an 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed for easier dispersion. The Soviets dismantled the plant and shipped it to Russia. During the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich, testified that he had planned to kill Adolf Hitler in early 1945 by introducing tabun into the F√ºhrerbunker ventilation shaft. He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticality of tabun and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent, and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach. The US once considered repurposing captured German stocks of tabun (GA) prior to production of Sarin (GB).http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/images/pdfs/Jan-June%202006/Kirby- Nerve%20Gas.pdf Like the other Allied governments, the Soviets soon abandoned tabun (GA) for Sarin (GB) and Soman (GD). Large quantities of the German- manufactured agent were dumped into the sea to neutralize the substance. Since GA is much easier to produce than the other G-series weapons and the process is comparatively widely understood, countries that develop a nerve agent capability but lack advanced industrial facilities often start by producing GA. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq employed quantities of chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although the most commonly used agents were mustard gas and sarin, tabun and cyclosarin were also used.https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90722&page;=1 Tabun was also used in the 1988 Halabja chemical attack.http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/16/newsid_4304000/4304853.stm Producing or stockpiling tabun was banned by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.

It sometimes also aired under names like Sci-Fi Flix and Creature Feature. The show aired classic monster movies, with the name \\"Creature Double Feature\\" based on its airing two movies during its three-hour time slot. The movies broadcast were taken from the classic Universal Horror movies of the 1930s to 1950s, the Hammer Studios and American International Pictures films of the 1950s, Roger Corman's horror films of the 1960s, and Toho Studio's \\"giant monster\\" (known in Japanese as either kaiju or tokusatsu) movies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Air times Creature Double Feature usually aired on Saturday afternoons. Because it aired after the traditional Saturday morning cartoon time block, it introduced many younger viewers to classic (and not-so-classic) monster movies. In other cities it aired either on Friday night or Saturday night. =Boston= Beginning in 1972 a station in the Kaiser Broadcasting (later Field Communications) chain, WKBG (Channel 56; WLVI after The Boston Globe sold their share back to Kaiser in 1975) aired its collection of Godzilla movies‚Äîone per week at 4 p.m. on Saturday under the title, The 4 O'Clock Movie. They cycled through their collection twice, noticing that the broadcasts were especially popular with youngsters. Then, they started showing the films at midnight, calling it Creature Feature. The ratings became so popular that the show was moved to noon to increase its ratings. However, it was in direct competition with WCVB-TV's Candlepin Bowling and was moved to the 2 p.m. time slot. Its popularity grew and they tweaked the title to Creature Double Feature and changed its start time to 1 p.m. The show quickly became a staple of the station's Saturday programming schedule during the 1970s and early-1980s. Although the exact date of the final show is currently unknown, it seems to have petered out sometime in 1983 and was replaced with WLVI-TV's Martial Arts Theater, showing cheap English-dubbed Hong Kong martial arts movies, as a replacement. To this day WLVI staffers report that they still receive more e-mail and phone calls about Creature Double Feature than anything else. In 2006, Channel 56's Steve Ratner was quoted in The Boston Globe as saying \\"I'm amazed at the following the show continues to have. It's just insane how many people come up to us and ask after the Creature Double Feature. Every day we get e-mails from people all over the country.\\" However, the station is unlikely to revive the show on their own since that timeslot is usually used now for infomercials, from which the station makes a considerable amount of income. The main announcer on Creature Double Feature was a channel 56, long-time booth announcer, Neil MacNevin. His radio/TV name was Tom Evans. He and an engineer named Press Campbell would create sound effects, echoes, wind etc. off the cuff during the weekly recording sessions for the movie and promos for CDF during the week. MacNevin says he still gets comments from some of the listeners from those days and really enjoys telling them about the sessions. MacNevin and Campbell retired from broadcasting in the early nineties. In June 2006, The Boston Herald reported that Boston-area car dealership owner Ernie Boch Jr. would be bringing the show back to WLVI‚Äîat its original timeslot‚Äîon an occasional basis. The first program of the new series aired on June 24, 2006. The two films shown on this occasion were Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster and The Giant Gila Monster. Boch himself hosted the show in full makeup as The Ghoul, though the original show never had a host‚Äîonly announcers (other than for a brief time when Rich Koz, the Son of Svengoolie out of Chicago, hosted the CDF in the early '80s). A second episode aired on October 28, 2006, featuring 1973's Horror Express followed by the original 1968 Night of the Living Dead. It was brought back again on October 27, 2007 with the American International Pictures' (A.I.P.) movies Gammera the Invincible (a.k.a. Gamera) and Attack of the Monsters. The broadcast contained no pop-up ads during the films and no interruptions from any on-air talent personnel during commercial breaks. The Boston Globes Sunday Edition of their TV guide printed the schedule of the two Gamera movie titles reversed in their time slots. The show's original announcers were reportedly Ron Dwyer and Tom Evans. During most of its run in its later years, the show's announcer was Dale Dorman aka \\"Uncle Dale\\", a Boston radio personality at WRKO and at WXKS- FM who also frequently did voice work for 56's children's programming. The intro/outro music used for Creature Double Feature throughout its run was Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Toccata\\" from Brain Salad Surgery. WLVI has kept the song as the theme of the 2006 and 2007 revival. It is not yet known if current WLVI owners Sunbeam Television will continue to air the revival. =Philadelphia= In the Philadelphia area, another Kaiser/Field station, WKBS Channel 48, aired this program between 1976 and 1979 after the success the show had in Boston. Two of the most popular films included Attack of the Mushroom People and Tourist Trap.

It lies about 7 km south west of Veenendaal (10.5 km by road). The landscape rises from the flat water meadows of the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine) to the Utrecht Hill Ridge (\\"Utrechtse Heuvelrug\\"). The highest point in the western Netherlands is located 2 km east of the village. The Amerongense Berg (Amerongen Mountain) has a height of 69 metres above sea level.  History  The history of Amerongen is closely related to that of Castle Amerongen. This castle was first established in 1286 as a wooden donjon but was rebuilt in stone. It was damaged or destroyed by fire and rebuilt several times during the following centuries. In 1672 the Netherlands were invaded by the French army and in early 1673, the castle was deliberately burned down as a punishment for non-payment of taxes levied by the French. Shortly afterwards the castle was rebuilt, under the capable supervision of Margaretha Turnor, wife of Van Reede, owner of the castle and special envoy to the court of Brandenburg at this time. The newly built and extended castle, arose in the Dutch Classicist style and, although the grounds and gardens were remodelled at various time and the interior brought up to date by Cuyper in the early twentieth century, it remains a prime example of this style. The former Emperor of Germany, Wilhelm II, sought refuge in the Netherlands in November 1918 after the First World War. He lived in the castle until May 1920, when he moved to nearby Doorn, where he spent the rest of his life. It was in the Castle of Amerongen that he signed the Act of Abdication. Until January 1, 2006, Amerongen was a separate municipality, which covered the village of Amerongen itself, Overberg, and the western part of the village of Elst. Elst was transferred to the municipality of Rhenen; the largest part of the municipality has merged with four other municipalities to form the new municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug. In 2015, the village of Amerongen had 5.366 inhabitants.\\"Gemeente Utrechtse Heuvelrug\\", Inwoners te Amerongen, Used on 01-12-2015 . In 2001, the built-up area of the village was 1.21 km¬≤, and contained 2072 residences.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001 . Statistics are for the continuous built-up area. \\"Amerongen\\", \\"Van Amerongen\\" and \\"Van Nieuw Amerongen\\" are surnames that indicate that their ancestors originated from this area. Economics Amerongen had a tobacco industry until the 19th century. The downfall of the tobacco industry was caused by the rise of cigar consumption, to which the tobacco from Amerongen was not suited. The foreign tobacco market also contributed to the downfall of the local tobacco industry. In 1879 the local Earl of Amerongen, Aldenburgh Bentinck, tried to revive the local economy by opening a cream factory in 1890. However, the factory had to close in 1912 and he then insisted the village on growing tulips. However, the domestic Dutch market proved too strong for the village and the production was stopped. In a last effort the Earl insisted on building hop-yards to build hop, however this plan failed too. The majority of the villagers therefore became dependent on jobs in neighboring villages.http://utrechtseheuvelrug.punt.nl/content/2015/01/Bloembollenteelt Amerongen on 01-12-2015(DD-MM-YYYY) The factory of Technivorm, the producer of the Moccamaster coffee machine, is situated in Amerongen.http://www.moccamaster.nl/over_ons/ontwikkeling/ on 01-12-2015 =Transportation= The village of Amerongen is served by one bus line, namely line 50 to Utrecht and back to Veenendaal and Wageningen.

Wilhelm II at Huis Doorn Doorn is a town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the central Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht. On 1 January 2017, the town had 10,067 inhabitants. History In a document from 885 to 896, the settlement is called \\"Thorhem\\", dwelling of Thor, the God of Thunder. Vikings quartered at Dorestad (now Wijk bij Duurstede), called the place Thorhem because reputedly, the god of thunder was worshipped there. Indeed, archeological diggings in a moor on the estate of Hoog Moersbergen, north of Doorn, prove that there was a pagan sacrificial site. At the time, the settlement of Thorhem belonged to the homestead of Villa Thorhem. Around 1200 this homestead was in the possession of a provost of the Bishopric of Utrecht. He or one of his successors had a castle built in the 14th Century, now Huis Doorn, and a church called the Maartenskerk (\\"St. Martin's Church\\") around 1200. The church was extended in the 15th century. It fell into Protestant hands around 1585 and is still in use as a Protestant church. Another castle, Kasteel Moersbergen, was first mentioned in 1435 and has been altered several times since the 17th Century. The estate around Huis Doorn was so large that there was little room for extension of the town. Only after 1874, when the estate was parcelled out, was there room for growth. After World War II, the town has grown considerably. Doorn is also a major base for the Royal Dutch Marines. Von Gimborn Arboretum, one of the sites of the botanical gardens of Utrecht University, is near the town. Doorn was an independent municipality until 1 January 2006. Since then, it has been the principal town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug. There is also a football club, Dev Doorn. Famous inhabitants The last German Emperor, Wilhelm II, lived at castle Doorn (Huis Doorn), in the center of the village, after he was deposed in 1918. He died in Doorn in 1941. The Dutch novelist Simon Vestdijk lived in Doorn for a great part of his life (between 1939 and 1971, a few short intervals excepted). The environs of Doorn are clearly recognisable in the landscape descriptions in many of his novels. Maarten Maartens, a Dutch writer who wrote in English, had a small castle built in Doorn: Zonheuvel (\\"Sun Hill\\", finished in 1903). At present the castle is called Maarten Maartenshuis and is a part of the hotel and conference centre Zonheuvel.

Population centres The municipality consists of the following towns: * 't Goy * Houten * Schalkwijk * Tull en 't Waal =Houten (town)= The main town in the municipality is Houten, a commuter town about 9 km southeast of Utrecht. On 1 January 2020, the town had 50.177 inhabitants (municipality). The built-up area was in area, and contained 20,010 residences in 2018. The slightly larger statistical district of Houten had a population of about 39,100 in 2004.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Gemeente Op Maat 2004: Houten .  History of Houten  Historical map of Houten Remains of a Roman villa have been found in the old centre of Houten, made visible in a street pattern. There used to be a Roman villa on that spot. This building was discovered in the fifties. In the Dark Ages Houten took shape as a rural centre. The area of the municipality of Houten was divided in the so-called 'gerechten' (districts). The names of these districts are still in use: Schonauwen, Wulven, Waijen, Heemstede. A lot of elements in present-day Houten are reminders of its history. Prominent in the old centre 'Het Oude Dorp' are the Roman Catholic Church (1884) and the Protestant Church (1563). The first accounts of this church date from the ninth century, the oldest parts of the church are probably from the eleventh century. Another prominent building is the restaurant/cafe 'De Engel', already mentioned in the 16th century as a tavern.Houten te voet of the fiets, publication by the municipality of Houten (2001) Former access roads to the old centre are still recognisable by their names, such as the 'Odijkseweg' and 'Loerikseweg'. Houten had many orchards, but few have survived. = The expanding city 1966‚Äì1998 = Modern Houten started to take shape in the last decades of the 20th century (1966‚Äì1998). It was first designated by the office of Wissing-Derks as a 'Groeikern' ‚Äì a centre of growth ‚Äì to meet the needs of the growing city of Utrecht. From the beginning urban planner-designer Robert Derks was involved with the development of the New Town Houten. In 1979 the construction of 10,000 dwellings started and the population grew from 4,000 to more than 30,000 late in the nineties. Dutch Topographic map of Houten (town), March 2014 = Second designation as a centre of urban growth 1992‚Äì2015 = Until 2015, some 7,000 new houses are being built in Houten-Zuid, following the same urban design principles as the existing Northern part of Houten, but with some differences. The body of water to the east is large in comparison with water bodies in the old parts of Houten. The pentagonal green zone in Houten-Zuid embracing the centre is different from the greenzone in Houten-Noord, which runs through the whole city in a linear structure, crossing the new city centre and with larger parks at either end. Another difference is that in some places cars share the road with bicycle paths (this concept was later applied in the northern part as well). The southern part was also designed by Robert Derks and his office for urban design Stedebouw BV.  Transport  = Rail = Houten has two railway stations, Houten (opened in 1868, closed in 1934, re-opened on a different location in 1982 and restructured in 2010) and Houten Castellum (opened in 2010). These stations are served by local commuter trains to Utrecht (northbound) and Geldermalsen (southbound, with subsequent connections to Tiel and 's-Hertogenbosch/Breda). The railway has been doubled from two tracks to four, to accommodate for an extra stop at Castellum with a frequency of four trains per hour in each direction.

Unlike other cities Houten is built around a system of car free public space combined with the infrastructure for slow traffic. The design principle of separating cycling and walking from car traffic has been pushed to the limit. Houten is unique in this. Cycling comfort and safety are extremely high (optimal), even by Dutch standards. A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations and within the town the bike is the most popular means of transport. On October 29, 2008, Houten was chosen as Fietsstad 2008 ‚Äî the top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2008. The same happened on January 16, 2018, when Houten was praised for its best all round cycling characteristics and again voted the best Fietsstad 2018 ‚Äî the nations top BikeCity for 2018. Since the first bicycle city election (held every two years) in 2002 Houten is the only one that managed to win the title twice. The city of Houten is known as, nationally and internationally, and in growing interest from home and abroad, as the worlds best practical example for bicycle friendliness. A growing number of groups with politicians, developers, designers and students visit cycling city Houten for study purposes and inspiration. = Car = To the west, Houten has its own exit from the A27 motorway, and the N409 (single carriageway with bus lane) runs from Houten to Nieuwegein. To the east and south, there are only local roads, not designed for through traffic. A connection to the A12 motorway to the north is the N421 (single carriageway). The only way to get from one district to another is via the ring road which circles around Houten, thus preventing through traffic in residential areas. Maximum speed on most of the ring road is Gemeente Houten ‚Äì Veelgestelde vragen over verkeer (in Dutch, frequently asked questions about traffic)  Urban planning and architecture  = Sustainable urban design = Houten is internationally known for its urban design. Because of the city structure, people are encouraged to travel by bike and train. Distinctive qualities of Houten include the accessibility of the railway station, green and water zones throughout the whole city, numerous soccer and basketball fields, high standard of accommodation for different groups and the child-friendly bicycle paths. It is one of the safest cities in the Netherlands. Cyclists and cars are able to avoid each other: an extensive network of bicycle tracks connects the different districts of the town, while cars have to go to the city ring road before they can go to another part of the city.

It's surrounded by the municipalities of Utrecht, Montfoort, Lopik, Vijfheerenlanden and Nieuwegein. Sights The city has an old town, surrounded by a small canal. A castle stood in IJsselstein from 1300 to 1888; the tower survived. The city has two large churches, both named after St. Nicholas: the Dutch Reformed Nicolaas church, founded in 1310, and a Roman Catholic one. Inside the Protestant church there are two mausoleums; one of the family of Gijsbrecht van Amstel (1350) and another one of (1475). The catholic basilica of St. Nicolaas dates from 1887 and is neo-gothic. It was given the title of 'Basilica Minor' by Pope Paul VI in 1972.

The municipality of Leusden contains four villages: * Leusden, originally named \\"Hamersveld\\" and later \\"Leusden-Centrum\\"; * Leusden-Zuid, formerly \\"Leusbroek\\" * Achterveld * Stoutenburg There are also a number of hamlets in the municipality:ANWB, \\"Topografische atlas Nederland 1:50000\\", 2005. Cartography by the Topografische Dienst, Emmen.  The town of Leusden  The place that is now called Leusden was first mentioned as Villa Lisiduna in a charter in 777. The exact location of that settlement, which is considered to have been a rather extensive farm complex with defenses, is unknown to us. It is possible that the old village of Oud-Leusden once was the location of Villa Lisiduna but excavations in the 1980s have not provided any evidence. However, the church tower of Oud-Leusden is one of the oldest towers in the Netherlands, dating back at least to the 11th century A.D. Close to Leusden is the site of the former monastery Heiligenberg, founded around the year 1000 by bishop Ansfridus of Utrecht, who died here in 1010. In the 1970s, the agricultural villages of Leusbroek and Hamersveld grew together into a larger, mainly residential town. What once was Hamersveld is now called Leusden-Centrum, now commonly Leusden, and Leusbroek was to become Leusden- Zuid. In the original plans, Leusden was to grow into a town of around 46,000 inhabitants. After the initial expansion there was a growing resistance from the population, so some of the later phases of expansion have been abandoned.  Shopping Areas  In Leusden there are 3 shopping centres: 1.) The Hamershof, this is the biggest mall with about 80 stores in the centre of Leusden. The oldest part opened in 1980 together with the Town Hall nearby the Hamershof. 2.) The Biezenkamp, this is the second shopping centre in the centre of town, there are not more than 20 shops. 3.)

There are three main secondary schools in the city, including the Anna van Rijn College, Oosterlicht College and the Cals College. History Nieuwegein was founded on 1 July 1971 as a planned city, following the merger of the former municipalities of Jutphaas and Vreeswijk. The new town was built for the expanding population of the city of Utrecht, and grew rapidly during the decades following its foundation. In the area between Jutphaas and Vreeswijk there used to be a settlement called Geyne. This settlement received city rights in 1295 but was destroyed in 1333, in a war between the Bishop of Utrecht and the Count of Holland. Today only Oudegein House remains from that time.

History  The origin of the town of Oudewater is obscure and no information has been found concerning the first settlement of citizens. It is also difficult to recover the name of Oudewater. One explanation is that the name is a corruption of old water-meadow. Oudewater was an important border city between Holland and Utrecht. Oudewater (lit. \\"Old water\\") was of great strategic importance. The town was granted city rights in 1265 by Hendrik van Vianden, the bishop of Utrecht. Oudewater took its place in the First Free States council in Dordrecht on 19 July 1572, Oudewater was one of the twelve cities taking part in the first free convention of the States General in Dordrecht. This was a meeting that laid down the origin of the State of the Netherlands, as we know it now, under the leadership of the House of Orange. This happened at the beginning of the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648) when the Netherlands were still part of the Spanish Empire. After a Siege of Oudewater, the city was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed, including the family of famous Oudewater native and Protestant theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609). In the 16th and 17th century, Oudewater was an important producer of rope. In the surrounding area, hemp was cultivated. There still is a rope manufacturing plant and a rope museum in the town. Oudewater is the setting for the 1975 novel Das Geheimnis des Baron Oudewater set in the 16th century, when the Netherlands was fighting for its independence from Spain. Written by the German author Alberta Rommel, it has been described as a romantic historical novel.  Geography  Oudewater is located at in the southwest of the province of Utrecht in the center of the Netherlands. It is situated where the Linschoten river flows out in the Hollandse IJssel. Oudewater is bordered by the municipalities of Montfoort (in the northeast), Lopik (southeast), Krimpenerwaard (southwest), and Bodegraven-Reeuwijk (northwest). The municipality of Oudewater consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Hekendorp, Hoenkoop, Oudewater, Papekop, Snelrewaard.  Buildings  The weigh house in 2012 Oudewater is famous for the Heksenwaag (Witches' scales). This Weighing house, an official town building, became famous at the height of the European witch trials of the 16th century because people accused of witchcraft were offered a fair chance to prove their innocence as opposed to many other places where the scales were rigged. From all over Europe people made the journey to Oudewater to avoid prosecution. After the weighing, they received an official certificate proclaiming them not a witch. Nobody was ever found to be an actual witch in Oudewater, though the weighings were still a public spectacle. Certificates would state that \\"the body weight is in proportion to its build.\\" The reasoning behind this is the old belief that a witch has no soul and therefore weighs significantly less than an ordinary person; this distinction would supposedly allow the witch to fly on a broomstick. View to the town In early modern times, when accusations of witchcraft could result in being burned at the stake, the town of Oudewater offered the accused a chance of proving their innocence. This can be seen as a sign of the growing power of the citizenry as a third force next to that of the church and nobility. Before witch hunts were sanctioned by the law and the church in their bid to break the power of local herb doctors and midwifes. By giving out these certificates the citizens of Oudewater, therefore were defying the church. The Waag is still open as a tourist attraction, and official certificates are available. The town hall dates from 1588 and features a stork's nest. Oudewater has a monumental protected city centre with more than 250 protected houses. The church, now Protestant, dates from the 15th century. Its tower is from about 1300. During the religious wars, until the sacking of Oudewater, both Roman Catholics and Protestants used this church. Thereafter Catholics were still tolerated (the Spanish occupiers being Catholic) but more in low profile.

The municipality also includes the villages of Achterberg, Remmerden, Elst and Laareind. The town lies at a geographically interesting location, namely on the southernmost part of the chain of hills known as the Utrecht Hill Ridge (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), where this meets the river Rhine. Because of this Rhenen has a unique character with quite some elevation through town. Directly to the east of the built-up area lies the Grebbeberg, a hill with a top elevation of about .

In 1346, the bishop of Utrecht ordered the construction of a defensive wall around the city, which was important because it lay near the border with Guelders. Although for some time the town collected toll from ships on the Rhine, it has never had a harbour. The three city gates were demolished in 1840. Small fragments of the wall remain. The town is also famous for the Cunera Church, parts of which date back to the 15th century. Containing the relics of Saint Cunera, it attracted many pilgrims. Legend has it that Cunera was buried on a nearby hill now called the Cuneraheuvel. The church's tower was built between 1492 and 1531. In 1621, a palace was constructed at Rhenen for the ousted Frederick V. It was demolished in 1812. =World War II= Part of the center of Rhenen, which was located near the defensive Grebbelinie (Grebbe line), was destroyed during the German attack on the Netherlands in May 1940. Part of the reconstruction took place during the war. In 1945, the town was damaged again during the liberation of the country from German occupation. Many or all of the Dutch soldiers who were killed by the Germans near Rhenen lie buried at the Erebegraafplaats (Cemetery of Honor), located along the Grebbeweg (N 225) near the top of the Grebbeberg. Across the road is an important war monument with a poem by J.C. Bloem. In 2008 Rhenen celebrated its 750th anniversary.

History The original village was founded in the 16th century as a peat colony from which it got its name. Veen is the Dutch word for peat and daal for valley, so literally the name means \\"peat valley\\". In 1855 Veenendaal was hit by a flood. After that wool and tobacco industry became Veenendaal's largest source of income, roughly until World War II. Until just after World War II, Veenendaal remained a small community with only a few thousand residents. In the last fifty years, the town grew rapidly to the city with 64,000+ inhabitants of today. Until the second half of the 20th century, Veenendaal was divided into two parts, a 'Gelders' and an 'Utrechts' part ('Gelders' comes from Gelderland and 'Utrechts' from Utrecht, both Dutch provinces). This is because in the first few centuries of the town's existence it was too small to be its own municipality. The southern half eventually became independent from Rhenen and Renswoude in 1795. The northern half separated from Ede in 1960. In 1997 it was elected the greenest city in Europe and in 2004 of the Netherlands. Like most Dutch cities, Veenendaal is well adapted to the high number of cyclists. A large network of bike paths make it convenient to cycle to various destinations and within the town, the bike is the most popular mean of transportation. In 2000 and 2020, Veenendaal was chosen as Fietsstad of the year, recognised as being the top city for cycling in the Netherlands.

At Wijk bij Duurstede, the Kromme Rijn (Crooked Rhine) branches off, and the main branch is called Lek River downstream from Wijk bij Duurstede. The name 'Wijk bij Duurstede' means 'Neighbourhood by Duurstede'. Duurstede is the name of the nearby castle/ruin, also called Dorestad, where the bishop of Utrecht used to live. Wijk bij Duurstede is located at the place where Dorestad used to be, an important Frisian trade settlement during Carolingian times, that was pillaged around 850 by the Vikings. Wijk bij Duurstede has the only drive-through wind mill in the world. The mill is often confused with the mill that was made famous by Ruisdael's 1670 painting The windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, but that mill no longer exists (its foundations can still be seen a couple of blocks away from the remaining mill). At the market place of Wijk bij Duurstede is one of the few church towers in the Netherlands with a flat roof, as built because the bishop could not afford to build a spire.

Due to its central location between Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, and the fact that it has rail and road connections to those cities, it is a popular town for commuters who work in those cities.  History  The river Oude Rijn used to flow through the city center of Woerden, but in 1960 the old river was diverted around the city center. The city has a long and rich history in cheese making and trading; for years Gouda cheese for domestic and international use has been produced in this region. Woerden still holds its authentic (since 1885) cheese market at the market place in its center. = Roman castellum = Underground parking facility Castellum with photo's of Roman archeological finds Woerden is situated on the river Oude Rijn, near the confluence with the former stream. The lower stretch of the Linschoten stream from Montfoort and Linschoten to Woerden silted up a long time ago and its flow was diverted through the Lek and Hollandse IJssel rivers, but at one time it was an important branch of the Rhine delta, connecting the Lower Rhine from Wijk bij Duurstede to the Oude Rijn near Woerden. Near the former confluence was an area that was slightly more elevated than the surroundings, a natural levee, which  in an area that is prone to flooding  made it an attractive location for settlement. Here, at the highest spot, the Romans built a castellum (Castellum Laurum), as part of the limes of the Roman Empire and thus part of the defense lines of the northern border of the Roman Empire. The first castellum was built in the 40s AD and was destroyed in 69 AD during the Batavian rebellion. In 70 AD, the castellum was rebuilt, and the Romans remained until 402 AD, with an interruption lasting from about 275-300 AD. The Castellum was located at the present site of the medieval Petruschurch and surrounding churchyard. During construction work on a new underground parking facility in the city center of Woerden, the remains of numerous old Roman buildings and a Roman cargo ship were found. During field research, a lot became known about the Roman time in Woerden: the location of the castellum, the zone of defense waters with the entrance road and the remains of a Roman cargo ship. = The dark ages = Little is known about the period after the Romans left for good in 402 AD. It may be assumed that people continued to live here, but there is no archaeological evidence. The area was contested between Frisians and Franks. Frankish King Dagobert I conquered the area around 630, and a small church was built in nearby Utrecht. Around 650, the Frisians came back, destroyed the Frankish church in Utrecht, and the Frisian king established his court there. Then, in 689 king Redbad was defeated by Frankish Duke Pippin of Herstal in the battle of Dorestad and the Franks regained control of the area. King Redbad reconquered Utrecht after Pippin died in 714, but the Frisian victory was short-lived: Duke Charles Martel defeated Redbad in 718. In 734, Charles Martel went on to vanquish the Frisians, in the Battle of the Boarn. The missionaries followed in the footsteps of the Frankish conquerors: In 695 AD, Willibrord, known as the \\"Apostle to the Frisians\\" became Bishop of Utrecht, with interruptions due to Frisian incursions. Boniface worked here from 719‚Äì722. Liudger reports that Boniface preached in Wyrda, referring to Wierde, meaning that the place was on higher ground in the area. Around 850, the Bishop had to leave once more, this time because of Viking marauders. Bishop Balderik returned to Utrecht in 918, after the Viking threat subsided. The Bishop claims Woerden as part of his jurisdiction: In a list prepared between 918 and 948 it is mentioned that , meaning: In Woerden everything belongs to Saint Martin, i.e. the church in Utrecht. = Between bishop and count = Castle of Woerden The Bishop of Utrecht received land grants, first from the Frankish kings, and later from the Kings of Germany, in particular Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1024 AD, the bishops were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the new Prince- bishopric of Utrecht was formed. Around 1000 AD, settlement was limited to the river banks; further inland were undeveloped bogs. The bishops used their new authority to stimulate reclamation of this wilderness. Concessions were granted to settlers, who drained the bogs by digging dividing ditches beginning from rivers and streams and stretching about ¬æ mile inland, thus creating the characteristic grid of fields still seen today. By about 1300 AD, the reclamation process had been completed. In the meantime, a competing realm had developed to the west, along the coast. First known as West Frisia it became known as Holland when Floris II, Count of Holland moved his court to Leiden in 1101. The Counts of Holland expanded their influence, and by 1165 they built a fort called Svadeburg, near present-day Zwammerdam, about 7 miles to the west of Woerden. Around 1160, Bishop Godfrey van Rhenen built a castle in Woerden. Once more Woerden became a border town between two belligerent powers, a situation that lasted until 1527 when the Bishop of Utrecht sold his territories to Emperor Charles V and the two statelets were united under Charles' rule. Due to its strategic location on the border between the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht, various wars have been fought in and around Woerden by the various lords and ladies of these realms. From about 1131 to 1296, the van Woerden family dominated local affairs in Woerden. Several scions of the family are known as Herman van Woerden. Originally they were stewards of the castle for the Bishop, but in time they sought to become independent. In 1274 Herman VI van Woerden formed an alliance with Gijsbrecht IV van Amstel, and revolted against bishop-elect John of Nassau. In 1278, Floris V, Count of Holland, intervened on the side of the much-weakened bishop, and defeated the rebellious lords. Gijsbrecht was taken prisoner, and Herman went into exile. In 1281, Floris V was awarded the lands of the rebellious lords, including Amsterdam and Woerden. In a 1288 peace agreement Floris restored the Lordship of Woerden to Herman van Woerden, but now as a vassal of the count. However, Herman did not prove himself to be a trustworthy vassal: in 1296 the humiliated lords Gijsbrecht IV van Amstel and Herman van Woerden entered the scene again as part of a conspiracy. Together with Gerard van Velzen they captured count Floris during a hunting party and the count was assassinated. In the aftermath, Gerard van Velzen was killed, and Herman van Woerden went again into exile. In 1300, John II, Count of Holland awarded the Lordship of Woerden to his brother Guy of Avesnes, who became Bishop of Utrecht the following year. In 1311, Guy returned the Lordship to his nephew, Count William III, and Woerden remained part of Holland thereafter. Map of Woerden (c. 1557) Around 1370 bailiff ordered the construction of defensive walls and a moat to fortify the city, in order to shield Holland from renewed hostilities with Utrecht. Woerden received city rights from Albert I, Duke of Bavaria, and Count of Holland in 1372, even though Woerden was still a small town that harboured no more than about 720 citizens. Around the same time the Petruschurch was built; part of its steeple still stands. In 1410 John III, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing had the castle of Woerden constructed, and in 1510 the city hall was built. These buildings still exist, although the castle was extensively altered and renovated through the years. On 1 November 1425, Woerden chose the side of Philip the Good in the conflict with Jacoba van Beieren, after Philip confirmed the town privileges and promised that the Lordship of Woerden would never be separated from the County of Holland by awarding it to someone else. During the reign of the Dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good (1419-1467) and Charles the Bold (1467-1477) Woerden enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace, and by 1477 its population had almost tripled to about 1920. Charles the Bold's death before the gates of Nancy was the prelude to renewed unrest, both with Utrecht and the duchy of Guelders, and the town suffered economic hardship because of it. = Heretics and rebels = The reign of Charles V was a period of relative peace and prosperity for Woerden, despite religious unrest. In April 1522, Charles V introduced the Inquisition in the Low Countries. Johannes Pistorius Woerdensis (Jan de Bakker), a catholic priest, was the first preacher in the Northern Netherlands to be martyred as a direct result of his religious beliefs. His father was a sexton in Woerden and also tenant of the brickworks, and his surname was derived from that profession. Jan de Bakker was a pupil of (Johannes Rhodius), headmaster of St. Jerome School of the Brethren of the Common Life in Utrecht. Rode was a proponent of Sacramentarianism, and in 1520 his father called Jan back to Woerden, perhaps out of concern about those heretic views. Jan transferred to Leuven, and in 1522 completed his education there. He returned to Woerden, was ordained in Utrecht as a priest, and assisted his father as sexton and deacon. Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg with the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, awarded in 1573 by Philip II of Spain for his services as army commander. Jan started to spread the heretic views, and in May 1523 he and another priest were arrested by the steward of the castle. After a short while they were released, and it is thought that the two travelled to Wittenberg, but there is no evidence he met with Martin Luther. After he returned he continued his preachings, and the conflict with the Roman Catholic Church was further aggravated by the fact that he broke his celibacy, and got married. In the night of 9 May 1525, he was arrested and the next day transferred to The Hague, where he appeared before the Inquisition. He was defrocked and sentenced to death, and on 15 September 1525 burned at the stake in The Hague. His widow saved her live by recanting the heresies and lived out her life in an abbey. The old stadhuis (city hall) in Woerden, now a museum The city magistrates of Woerden were tolerant towards the Lutheran confession. In 1566 this resulted in a confrontation with duke Eric of Brunswick, who was Lord of Woerden at that time. Although Eric of Brunswick was raised Lutheran he converted to Catholicism in 1547, much to the regret of his mother Elisabeth of Brandenburg. Eric served as commanding officer in the armies of Charles V and Philip II, and fought on their side in the Schmalkaldic War (1546‚Äì1547) and the Franco-Habsburg War (1551‚Äì1559). During the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) he distinguished himself by taking French Marshals Anne de Montmorency and Jacques d'Albon de Saint-Andr√© prisoner. These prisoners were very important to Philip II as a bargaining chip during negotiations for the peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambr√©sis. In 1558, Philip II granted Duke Eric of Brunswick the Lordship of Woerden as compensation, over the objection of the city magistrates of Woerden who felt that this was an infringement of promises made by Philip the Good in 1425. In the wake of iconoclastic riots that swept the country in 1566 a prominent citizen of Woerden, Warnaer Claesz, petitioned the city magistrates to introduce the Augsburg Confession. There was also a disruption of the church worship. As a precaution, the city magistrates removed icons and other valuables from the church and stored them in a safe place, and closed the church. The court of Holland concurred with the actions taken by the city magistrates, but Duke Eric of Brunswick objected. He demanded that Catholic worship would be restored. The city magistrates delayed by questioning his authority in this matter. Duke Eric responded by raising a small army and forced the city magistrates to comply. Duke Eric was also instrumental in suppressing the ill-fated rebellion of Hendrik van Brederode, Lord of Vianen. After the rebel army was defeated in the Battle of Oosterweel (13 March 1567) Eric of Brunswick captured Vianen on May 5, 1567. In later history, the town saw occupation by the Spanish (1575, 1576) and the French (1672, 1673, and particularly disastrous in 1813). = Modern era = \\"De Windhond\\", a gristmill in the center of Woerden In 1989, there was a local redrawing of province boundaries as a result of which Woerden found itself transferred from South Holland to the province of Utrecht. In 2015, the city's refugee centre formed the scene of a violent attack by 20 hooded people, bearing fireworks and pushing down fences.  Geography  Woerden is located at in the west of the province of Utrecht in the center of the Netherlands. Woerden is bordered by the municipalities of De Ronde Venen (in the north), Stichtse Vecht (northeast), Utrecht (east), and Montfoort (south) in the province of Utrecht and Bodegraven-Reeuwijk (southwest) and Nieuwkoop (northwest) in the province of South Holland. The population centers in the municipality are De Meije, Harmelen, Kamerik, Kanis, Woerden, and Zegveld.

The original settlement was located at the present Dorpsstraat. In the late 12th century, a church was built here. Its tower is now a part of the Reformed Church, the remainder of which was built in the 19th century. Until medieval times, a branch of the river Rhine flowed close to the centre of the town. Three mansions were built near the village: the Huis te Zeist, Kersbergen, and Blikkenburg. thumb From 1677 to 1686, the \\"Slot Zeist\\" was built on or near the ruins of \\"Kasteel Zeist\\", the original castle (donjon) of Rodgar van Zeist. There is very little documentation on the family that lived there, but a few names are found: in the 12th century a Godefridus de Seist and in the late 13th century another Godefridus, a knight, with his son Johannes and his daughter Petronilla. (Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van Zeist, deel 1, ed. Van Hinsbergen) The last member of the van Zeist family was a woman, Elisabeth (?), who married a member of the Borre van Amerongen family. They had a son who adopted his mother's name and his father's coat-of-arms. In the last quarter of the 17th century, Count Willem Adriaan van Nassau, an illegitimate descendant of Prince Maurice of Orange, acquired the property and built Slot Zeist in the Dutch Classisist style. Murals by Daniel Marot are still largely intact. Members of the Evangelische Broedergemeente (Evangelical Brethren's Congregation), the Dutch name for the Moravians, settled in Zeist in 1746, building for their community an impressive array of 18th century Classisist houses planned around two squares. Their headquarters are still located in the centre of town, next to \\"the palace\\". The oldest Dutch archives of the Moravians are kept at the Utrecht Archival Centre at Utrecht. In the 19th century, Zeist became a favorite residence for the rich, mainly from the city of Utrecht. Camp New Amsterdam, (vliegbasis Soesterberg) a former Royal Netherlands Air Force military airbase near this town, was the venue for the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial to take place outside the UK, but under Scots law. The court was designated the Scottish Court in the Netherlands. Zeist is the location of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the Royal Dutch Korfball Association (KNKV) and the International Korfball Federation(IKF), and is also known for the forests surrounding the town. For many years the Dutch National Archaeological Research Service (Rijksdienst voor het Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek) was housed at Slot Zeist.

L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a United States federal law enacted on 16 November 1990. The Act requires federal agencies and institutions that receive federal fundingThe Smithsonian Institution is exempt from this act, but rather must comply with similar requirements under the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989. to return Native American \\"cultural items\\" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the repatriation process and the Secretary of the Interior may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply. NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding. Lastly, NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense may reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine. Background The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long- standing claims by federally recognized tribes for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from prehistoric, historic, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and indigenous rights, prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items‚Äîhuman remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony‚Äîto proven lineal descendants, culturally related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups. Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections' holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.Carrillo, Jo (1998). Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival Temple University Press, Philadelphia. =Tribal concerns= Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary. *State Statutory Law: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes. *Common Law: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves. *Equal Protection: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races. *First Amendment: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the first amendment. *Sovereignty Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe. *Treaty: From the beginning of the U.S. government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S. government in a treaty. The U.S. government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty. Description The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990. The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act.Canby Jr., William C. (2004). American Indian Law in a Nutshell. St. Paul: West,. Page 276. However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands. The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to lineal descendants. If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them. Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood. Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands. Congress attempted to \\"strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors.\\" The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe. This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.Frequently Asked Questions - NAGPRA, U.S. Park Service. Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes. Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned. Map of Native American reservations The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories. Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials‚Äîor if burials are discovered during such activities‚Äîthey must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities. For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project. For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation. The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land. The act allows archaeological teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned. Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands). A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American \\"cultural items.\\" Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered \\"associated\\" if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. \\"Unassociated\\" funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by‚Äîor were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of‚Äîthe agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American artifacts, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated masscataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of archaeology and physical anthropology in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with Native Americans that were felt to be constructive by all parties. History =Background= The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history in regards to the loss of cultural artifacts and land. With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of anthropology and archeology as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the Smithsonian Institution (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers. As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century. Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.Carrillo, Jo, ed. Readings In American Indian Law. Temple University Press, 1998. Pg 169. =Maria Pearson= Maria Pearson is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called \\"the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement\\" and the \\"Rosa Parks of NAGPRA\\". In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in Glenwood, Iowa. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor Robert D. Ray, finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. \\"You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up\\", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains. Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to lobby national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA. Pearson and other activists were featured in the 1995 BBC documentary Bones of Contention. =Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds= The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the Slack Farm in Kentucky, in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves.National Geographic Magazine, March 1989 Likewise, several protests at the Dickson Mounds site in Illinois, where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue. Return to the Earth project Return to the Earth is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites. Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006. The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in Clinton, Oklahoma. Controversial issues A few archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100‚Äì500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories.George Johnson, \\"Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists,\\" New York Times, 22 October 1996, accessed 19 June 2011 Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the Spirit Cave mummy; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists. =Kennewick Man= Compliance with the legislation can be complicated. One example of controversy is that of Kennewick Man, a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near Kennewick, Washington. The federally recognized Umatilla, Colville, Yakima, and Nez Perce tribes had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him. Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla. Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable. As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of indigenous origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains.McManamon, F. P. Kennewick Man. National Park Service Archeology Program. May 2004 (retrieved 6 May 2009) New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains. One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is \\"more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population.\\" In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area. International policies Hague Convention The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with El Salvador in order to protect all pre‚ÄëColumbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with Canada, Peru, Guatemala, and Mali and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 UNESCO Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It is not an easy business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.Messenger, Phyllis Mauch. The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property Whose Culture? Whose Property? New York: University of New Mexico, 1999. An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures. Minik Wallace (Kalaallit) in New York, 1897 On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant Robert Peary brought six Inuit people from Greenland to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, at the request of the anthropologist Franz Boas, in order to \\"obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance\\" regarding Inuit culture.Thomas, David H. Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity, p.78. New York: Basic Books About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit people became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. These people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the Bellevue Hospital Center with tuberculosis, which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died and shortly after that two more followed. By the time the sickness had run its course, two men survived. Minik was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while Uissakassak returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father's skeleton on display in the museum. In 1993 the museum finally agreed to return the four Inuit skeletons to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York.Thomas, David H. Skull Wars, pp. 218-9 David Hurst Thomas' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties. =Protecting cultural property= In the United States, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites in order to conserve cultural resources associated with such properties. Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains: *Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade. Countries that use these laws include Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. *Total export restriction laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property. Many Latin American and Mediterranean countries use these laws. *Other countries, such as Mexico, use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

It lies entirely in the state of Western Australia, crosses the Great Victoria Desert and Nullarbor Plain and is approximately long. History The Warburton-Rawlinna road was pioneered as part of a network of roads for the Weapons Research Establishment at Woomera, South Australia. Surveying began in July 1962, when Len Beadell, with wife Anne and baby Connie Sue, left Adelaide and travelled via the Stuart Highway and the Gunbarrel Highway to Warburton. From there they bush-bashed roughly south in his Land-Rover, until reaching the approximate latitude of the Anne Beadell Highway, which was under construction from the east. Turning east, they drove another through the Great Victoria desert to a point west of Serpentine Lakes to join up with his Gunbarrel Road Construction Party (GRCP). They ran out of fuel and water about short of their destination, but with the aid of radio and flares, were joined by their team. Beadell and family then began a reconnaissance west towards Neale Junction, followed by the GRCP. After two weeks of intense activity during August, the Anne Beadell Highway reached Neale Junction. From there, Beadell and party then commenced building a new road north towards Warburton. Just north of Neale Junction, Beadell's infant daughter Connie Sue was observed standing up for the first time in her tea-chest bassinet. It was decided there and then that the Warburton-Rawlinna road would be known as the Connie Sue Highway. The 320 kilometer section of new road reached Warburton on 15 September. After obtaining supplies, the construction team turned south and by early October were back at Neale Junction. Beadell then began surveying south towards Rawlinna to make the southern half of the new Connie Sue Highway. The GRCP with bulldozer and grader followed Beadell's tracks, constructing the road as they went. By the end of October the road was completed, and the Beadell family returned to Adelaide via the Eyre Highway. Additional details Approximately halfway along the route is Neale Junction, west of Ilkurlka, where the highway intersects with another outback road, the Anne Beadell Highway. The road, like many Len Beadell built, is a \\"highway\\" in name only. It is remote and does not carry regular traffic. There is no available ground water and it is one of the longest stretches in Australia between fuel pumps. The only place on the highway that sells fuel is Warburton. There is no fuel for sale at Rawlinna. The closest available is more than to the south, at Caiguna or Cocklebiddy, on the Eyre Highway. The track is not considered suitable for unprepared travellers. A free permit is required to travel on track in the Ngaanyatjarrak determination area and to enter Warburton. Obtaining a permit for the track requires a minimum of five working days turnaround.

It was intended to allow continuous broadcast of civil defense information to the public using radio stations, while rapidly switching the transmitter stations to make the broadcasts unsuitable for Soviet bombers that might attempt to home in on the signals (as was done during World War II, when German radio stations, based in or near cities, were used as beacons by pilots of bombers). U.S. President Harry S. Truman established CONELRAD in 1951. After the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles reduced the likelihood of a bomber attack, CONELRAD was replaced by the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) on August 5, 1963, which was later replaced by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on January 1, 1997; all have been administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Unlike the EBS and EAS, CONELRAD was never intended to be used for local civil emergencies such as severe weather. History \\"CD Mark\\" symbols (usually simple white or red triangles) at CONELRAD's 640 and 1240 kHz frequencies were on the dials of most radios sold in the US between 1953 and 1963. Cold War-era CONELRAD poster. Car radio with CONELRAD frequencies marked with small red marks First commercial transistor radio Regency TR-1 with small red dial markings Prior to 1951, there was no systematic way for the U.S. government to communicate with citizens during an emergency. However, broadcasters would typically interrupt normal programming to issue emergency bulletins, as happened during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the first successful tornado warning in 1948. Such bulletins were the forerunner to CONELRAD. The CONELRAD concept was originally known as the Key Station System. According to an FCC document created during the \\"Informal Government‚ÄìIndustry Technical Conference\\" on March 26, 1951: CONELRAD had a simple system for alerting the public and other \\"downstream\\" stations, consisting of a sequence of shutting the station off for five seconds, returning to the air for five seconds, again shutting down for five seconds, returning to the air again (for 5 seconds), and then transmitting a 1 kHz tone for 15 seconds. Key stations would be alerted directly. All other broadcast stations would monitor a designated station in their area. In the event of an emergency, all United States television and FM radio stations were required to stop broadcasting. Upon alert, most AM medium-wave stations shut down. The stations that stayed on the air would transmit on either 640 or 1240 kHz. They would transmit for several minutes and then go off the air, and another station would take over on the same frequency in a \\"round robin\\" chain. This was to confuse enemy aircraft who might be navigating using radio direction finding. By law, radio sets manufactured between 1953 and 1963 had these two frequencies marked by the triangle-in-circle (\\"CD Mark\\") symbol of Civil Defense. Although the system by which the CONELRAD process was initiated (switching the transmitter on and off) was simple, it was prone to numerous false alarms, especially during lightning storms. Transmitters could be damaged by the quick cycling. The switching later became known informally as the \\"EBS Stress Test\\" (due to many transmitters failing during tests) and was eventually discontinued when broadcast technology advanced enough to make it unnecessary. Beginning January 2, 1957, U.S. amateur radio came under CONELRAD rules and amateur stations were also required to stop transmitting if commercial radio stations went off the air due to an alert. Several companies marketed special receivers that monitored local broadcast stations, sounding an alarm and automatically deactivating the amateur's transmitter when the broadcast station went off the air. In a Time magazine article featured in the November 14, 1960 issue, the author details why the warning system consisting of localized civil defense sirens and the CONELRAD radio-alert system was \\"basically unsound\\". The author's alternative was to advocate for the National Emergency Alarm Repeater as a supplement, which did not need a radio or television to be switched on to warn citizens, nor a large CD siren to be in their vicinity. = False alarms = On May 5, 1955, the Continental Air Defense Command Western Division went to yellow alert for 3 to 10 minutes (depending on the alerted state), beginning at 10:40 AM PDT. The alert was raised by a Canadian radar emplacement which was unaware of an outbound United States B-47 bomber training exercise, due to communication failures. A yellow alert meant \\"attack expectable\\", and the word was sent to government and civil defense organizations. In the seven-minute window, the city of Oakland, the Sacramento Capitol Building, and others quickly sounded their alert sirens. In contrast, the City of Sacramento civil defense director waited for further confirmation before sounding the citywide siren; ultimately, he never did so. The alert was not acted on at all in Colorado due to the short length, and in Nevada, there was no alert because the person responsible for acting on it \\"did not know what to do with it\\". In Utah, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, and Louisiana, a yellow alert was not passed along to civil authorities at all, and those states issued a \\"white\\" (military emergency) alert to units in their state instead. Even with the short alert window, many radio and television stations went off the air as per CONELRAD procedure, but the alert was not long enough for stations to start broadcasting on the two authorized CONELRAD frequencies. On the evening of November 5, 1959, WJPG, the CONELRAD control station for northeast Wisconsin and Upper Michigan was incorrectly sent an alert status message, \\"This is an air defense radio alert\\", rather than what should have been sent for a test, \\"This is an air defense line check.\\" All three of Green Bay, Wisconsin's television stations (WFRV-TV, WLUK-TV, and WBAY-TV), as well as Green Bay radio stations WBAY and WJPG (and other Upper Michigan radio stations) were immediately taken off line as preparations were made for high priority stations to begin broadcasting on the two authorized CONELRAD AM frequencies. The transmission error was realized and CONELRAD alert preparation (and its media blackout) reversed for affected stations about 20 minutes later. A very similar false attack alarm was sent to radio and television stations through CONELRAD's replacement, the Emergency Broadcast System, at 9:33 AM EST on Saturday, February 20, 1971. This message was sent by accident instead of the usual weekly EAN test.

His acts prompted the creation of a damnatio memoriae law forbidding anyone to mention his name, orally or in writing. The law was ultimately ineffective, as evidenced by mentions of his existence in modern works and parlance. Thus, Herostratus has become a metonym for someone who commits a criminal act in order to become famous.  History  A modern 1:25 scale model of the Temple of Artemis, at Miniat√ºrk, Istanbul, Turkey. Archeological evidence indicates the site of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus had been of sacred use since the Bronze Age, and the original building was destroyed during a flood in the 7th century BC.Pausanias, Description of Greece 7.7 - 8. A second temple was commissioned by King Croesus of Lydia around 560 BC and built by Cretan architects including Chersiphron, constructed largely of marble, and measuring 337 feet long and 180 feet wide with its pillars standing 40 feet tall. The sculpted bases of the pillars contained life-sized carvings and the roof opened to the sky around a statue of Artemis. The second temple was included on an early list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World by Herodotus in the 5th century BC, and was well known in ancient times. Little is known about the life of Herostratus, though it is thought he may have been someone of low social standing, a non-Ephesian or a slave. According to tradition, the fire that destroyed the second temple was set on the day Alexander the Great was born, 21 July 356 BC. Herostratus was then captured and tortured on the rack, where he confessed to having committed the arson in an attempt to immortalize his name.Valerius Maximus, Memorable deeds and sayings, 8. 14. 5: \\"A man was found to plan the burning of the temple of Ephesian Diana so that through the destruction of this most beautiful building his name might be spread through the whole world.\\" Valerius Maximus, VIII.14.ext.5 To dissuade those of similar intentions, the Ephesian authorities not only executed Herostratus, but attempted to condemn him to a legacy of obscurity by forbidding mention of his name under penalty of death. However, the ancient historian Theopompus, who was not Ephesian but rather Chian, mentions the name of Herostratus in his Philippica, and it appears again later in the works of Strabo. It is said that in fact his name has outlived the names of his judges, and in his 1658 work Hydriotaphia Sir Thomas Browne states: > But the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and deals with > the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity. [...] > Herostratus lives that burnt the Temple of Diana, he is almost lost that > built it [...] Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there > be not more remarkable persons forgot, than any that stand remembred in the > known account of time? Work on a third temple at the site began in 323 BC, resulting in a larger and more ornate temple that would be included by Antipater of Sidon as one of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Legacy Herostratus' name lived on in classical literature and has passed into modern languages as a term for someone who commits a criminal act in order to achieve notoriety, thus winning herostratic fame. According to Julia H. Fawcett, Herostratus \\"exemplifies a figure asserting his right to self-definition, one who strikes out against a history to which he is unknown by performing himself back into that history‚Äîthrough whatever means necessary.\\"Fawcett, J. H., Spectacular Disappearances: Celebrity and Privacy, 1696-1801 (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2016), p. 33. =In language= The term \\"Herostratic fame\\" refers to Herostratus and means \\"fame [sought] at any cost\\". =In media= * Chaucer makes reference to Herostratus in The House of Fame: \\"I am that ylke shrewe, ywis, / That brende the temple of Ysidis / In Athenes, loo, that citee.\\" / \\"And wherfor didest thou so?\\" quod she. / \\"By my thrift,\\" quod he, \\"madame, / I wolde fayn han had a fame, / As other folk hadde in the toun...\\" * Many authors from 16th and 17th-century Spain refer to Herostratus to represent someone who will do anything to gain notoriety.

Don Garc√≠a, the protagonist of Ruiz de Alarc√≥n's La verdad sospechosa (Suspect Truth), compares his feats to the ancient character. * Colley Cibber's Richard III (1699) contains the oft- quoted line, \\"The aspiring youth that fired the Ephesian dome / Outlives in fame the pious fool that rais'd it.\\" * In the chapter titled \\"Dreams\\" in Herman Melville's Mardi, and a Voyage Thither (1849), the protagonist states, \\"[W]hoso stones me, shall be as Erostratus, who put torch to the temple...\\" *Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, in the preface of his last novel, The Good Soldier ≈†vejk, compared Herostratus to ≈†vejk (the protagonist) and praised the latter. * In his 6 October 1939 speech to the Berlin Reichstag, Adolf Hitler made a reference to Herostratus, making a contemporary comparison: \\"It is clear to me that there is a certain Jewish international capitalism and journalism that has no feeling at all in common with the people whose interests they pretend to represent, but who, like Herostratus of old, regard incendiarism as the greatest success of their lives.\\" * The protagonist of the 1967 film Herostratus hires a marketing company to turn his suicide-by-jumping into a mass-media spectacle. * In Gore Vidal's 1970 novel Two Sisters the real-life story of Herostratus appears as a sub-plot. * In Grigori Gorin's 1972 play Forget Herostratus! in which a \\"theater man\\" from the present observes the judgement of Herostratus in order to understand the source of the disaster that plagues humanity. * Jean-Paul Sartre's short story \\"Erostratus\\" is directly based on the story of Herostratus. *Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker makes reference to Herostratus. * The tale of Herostratus is directly referenced in two songs from the If These Trees Could Talk album Above the Earth, Below the Sky. *The Better Maker has a song titled \\"√Ürostratus\\", on their 2012 album Wissenschaft, which parallels the story of Herostratus with the redemption of King Midas. *In Sam Levinson's 2018 film Assassination Nation a hacker under the handle \\"Er0str4tus\\" leaks half of the town of Salem's personal information \\"for the lulz\\", sending the town into a frenzy of violence.

Etymology  The name Boekel can be explained bij the word \\"loo\\" the Dutch word for forest from de heeren Boc and fits in the same category as places like Boxmeer and Boxtel. The heeren Boc was seen as the first lord of van Boxmeer, but has no connection to the other two places. In present time is presumed that the name is derived from Beukeloo or Beukenbos.  Population centres  *Boekel *Huize Padua *Venhorst History = Land van Herpen = Boekel is founded somewhere in the Middle Ages as a settlement of a number of farms. In the 13th century Boekel was part of de heerlijkheid Uden. In 1233 a separation took place between the and the and Uden. At that time Uden together with Herpen formed a form of government called a heerlijkheid. Until the foundation of the city of Ravenstein, Herpen was the main city of this region. Rutger van Herpen sold or leased 1313 of 1314 the community rights (gemene gronden) to the residents of Boekel and Volkel. When the noble lord wanted to improve its cash position, then he charges the use of any of its soils, beginning with the wasteland in his heerlijkheid. This common land should particularly think of marshy land and barren higher grounds, such as heaths. = Land of Ravenstein = In 1324 the heerlijkheid of Uden administratively belonged to the Land of Ravenstein under the rule of the House of Valkenburg until 1396. From the aldermen Herpen and Uden the Heikantsgericht was created in 1339. These shipsbanks stretched across the entire former heerlijkheid of Uden, consisting of Uden, Boekel and Zeeland. Of these aldermen, which in total consisted of seven members, two were from Boekel. By childless death of Reinoud of Valkenburg (married to Elisabeth van Kleef) grants the Duke of Brabant Adolf van Kleef with Herpen, Ravenstein and Uden so in 1397 the Land of Ravenstein Kleefs territory aids was. Afterwards the area comes under ruling of Neuburg-Palts in 1629. Under the Neubergers ruling the area had religious freedom. Because the neighboring provinces of Brabant and Gelderland from 1648 officially fall under the States-General, this more and more was seen as \\"foreign\\". The religious freedom provided opportunities for Catholics in the States of Brabant. So the Catholics of Erp built their own barn church on the border with Boekel. Due to the religious freedom several Catholic religious orders settled in the Land of Ravenstein. In 1741 members of the Brothers Penitents, from the Handelse Kluis themselves wanted to settle in Boekel. Led by the brothers laid the foundations for the Psychiatric Hospital Huize Padua. From the 17th and 18th centuries various conflicts arise between the villages of Boekel, Uden and Gemert around the demarcation lines between the Ravenstein, Cuijk and Gemert areas. In 1663 the boundary dispute with the Vrije Heerlijkheid Gemert was settled. In 1729, a similar problem with Uden settled.

Eersel is situated in the Campine (Kempen) area. Eersel is part of the Acht Zaligheden (Eight Delights) and known for its attractive market. This market, together with the Hint, has been declared a protected village on October 19, 1967. This has been done to guarantee the future survival of its authentic character. The spoken language is Kempenlands (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).Jos & Cor Swanenberg: Taal in stad en land: Oost- Brabants,  Population centres   History  About 3,500 years ago the first inhabitants of the area of Eersel were builders of sepulchre hillocks or burial mounds of the Tumulus culture. Following them in the late Bronze Age the people of the Urnfield culture continued living there as has been proved by the urn with cremating ashes that has been found in ‚ÄòSchadewijk‚Äô. Before the Romans occupied this area, which they called Toxandria, the Eburones lived here. From the Roman period there are also archaeological finds. Many shards of Roman pottery are found between the church of Eersel and the hamlet ‚ÄòSchadewijk‚Äô. The Salian Franks that settled the area in the 4th century became known as Toxandrians. After the Roman time the region has been virtually depopulated. The Franks established themselves round 700 again in the region. They lived where high and lower grounds were laying close to each other. One of those high grounds was Ereslo. As from this time there is a form of government authority in this area. The Franks build their farms around a triangular square. This kind of settlement was called a domain which was the property of the high nobility of the Franks. The oldest known written indication of Eersel is found in the manuscript Codex Aureus of Echternach (or Liber Aureus) of the Abbey of Echternach. In this document is a charter included in which a certain Aengilbertus, son of late Gaobertus, with approval of his brother Verengaotus gives the property of the domain Eresloch to Saint Willibrord. In this registration of the year 712 the name of ‚ÄòEreslo‚Äô was transferred wrong to ‚ÄòEresloch‚Äô. Wilibrord on his behalve gave the heritage to the Abbey of Echternach in Luxembourg. To approximately in the year 1000 Eersel belonged to the county of Taxandria. Hereafter it came under the influence of earl of Guelders. The Earl of Leuven extends its area to the north and in 1203 the region definitively became a part of Brabant. Trading started to develop and Eersel became a cross point for the routes of Leuven and 's-Hertogenbosch and of Antwerp and Turnhout. The triangular court of the village 'Hint' (now still visible), was extended in southern direction. The new oval square became ‚Äòde Markt‚Äô (the Market) constructed for the trade as a parking place for carts. Around arose the characteristic buildings for digest and boardinghouses such as taverns. But also stables for horses with the requirements like a blacksmith. In 1325 Eersel obtained the rights of ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô (Town privileges) from Duke Jan III of Brabant. On this basis the inhabitants could designate as of now their own governor. Eersel became the head of regional schepenbank of Hapert, Hoogeloon, Vessem, Knegsel, Steensel, Bergeijk, Westerhoven, Dommelen en Borkel en Schaft. Around the 14th century Eersel became prosperous and the monumental tower of Eersel was built, together with those of Steensel and Duizel. In 1464 between the market and ‚Äòhet Hint‚Äô a chapel was built in Eersel. After the Middle Ages the region became more poorly and the villages did not grow between 1500 and 1800. This is the period of the ‚ÄòTeuten‚Äô a traveling trading people, who were touring from village to village with artisan and merchant services, like coppersmith, wig-maker, also some veterinary surgeon like horse, ram, bull and pig castrating, and trade in goods like pottery, kitchen-utensil, bed-clothes, linen, lace, silk and other textile manufactures. They were no gypsies but build their homes in a central place like Eersel and traveled to other regions and lands from there. One of the remainder of this time are the houses of the ‚ÄòTeuten‚Äô at the market. In 1800 at the time of King Willem I there came some improvement. The provincial road to Eindhoven and the road to Postel was hardened and a steam tram railway was manufactured. (1897) In 1923 Eersel absorbed the former municipality of Duizel en Steensel. Since 1900 the reclaiming of cleared bush ground had taken place and the rise of the cigar industry. During the crisis, the cigar industry ensured that unemployment was not very large, although the living then in Eersel was reasonable poverty. Eersel still enjoys a reputation as one of the largest cigar exporters of the Netherlands and takes still an important place on the world market of cigar producers. After the Second World War there was a fast increase of population from 3,700 to 12,500 inhabitants in Eersel.  Places of interest  * The church of Saint Willibrord St. Willibrord Church at Eersel The original version of the church of Eersel was a simply wooden cottage and was possibly founded by the (Catholic) abbey of Echternach . The church was mentioned for the first time in 1480. Tower dates from second half of the 14th century. The flaunting piece of the church is the monumental organ. It was entirely restored in 1972, under realm monument care. It is a combination of work of two famous organ builders: Bernard Petrus van Hirtum from Hilvarenbeek (1838) and the Smits Brothers from Reek (1852). * The Chapel of Our Lady of Campina It is built in 1464 in Gothic style and is the oldest building of the market. After the Peace of M√ºnster it was closed for mass service and was used as Council house, as prison and repository for the fire-engine. It was used for 300 years as a townhall up to 1948 before it was returned to the church and used as a chapel again. * Protestant church The church was built first in 1812, and has been rebuilt in 1861. It is a simple barge stone build church. The ceiling has an arbor, what gives it a very good acoustic.

Its name is a combination of the two towns from which the municipality originally arose: Etten and Leur. Nowadays both towns have grown into one. History Both towns, created in the Middle Ages, were relatively prosperous during the period of the Dutch Republic, the exception being the period of the Eighty Years' War in which the area was a major battleground. This prosperity was caused by the fact that Etten was a centre for the production of peat, and Leur was a local trading port, as it had a harbour. Decline in economic importance marked both towns during the nineteenth century. In 1836 Arnold Damen left Leur in order to work as a missionary in the United States. The painter Vincent van Gogh briefly lived in Etten, making him the most famous citizen in the history of Etten and Leur. During World War II, the two towns were freed from German occupation in late October 1944 by elements of the U.S. 104th Infantry Division. The economic decline was halted when, in 1950, the Dutch government decided to encourage population growth and industrial development. As a result of this development, both towns have grown towards each other and merged into one: Etten-Leur.

It is located between the towns Waalwijk and 's-Hertogenbosch. The municipality of Heusden, including Herpt, Heesbeen, Hedikhuizen, Doeveren, and Oudheusden, merged with Drunen and Vlijmen in 1997, giving the municipality its current form.  Population centres  Dutch Topographic map of Heusden, June 2015  Heusden town  Before 1997, Heusden was a municipality in itself, that included the communities of Herpt, Heesbeen, Hedikhuizen, Doeveren, and Oudheusden. = Castle = Remnants of Castle Heusden The settlement of Heusden on the river Meuse (Maas) started with the construction of a fortification to replace the castle destroyed by the Duke of Brabant in 1202. This fortification was quickly expanded with water works and a donjon (castle keep). The city of Heusden received city rights in 1318. Heusden's castle had belonged to successive dukes of Brabant; in 1357 it passed into the hands of the counts of Holland. ramparts and moats were constructed, bringing the castle within the city's fortifications and result in the loss of its function as a stronghold. The donjon was then used as a munition depot. On 24 July 1680, a terrible thunderstorm hit Heusden, and lightning struck the donjon. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder and other ammunition exploded, destroying the castle. It took seven weeks to clear the rubble and debris. The castle was never fully rebuilt. However, outlines of the main features were restored in 1987. = Fortifications and restoration = At the beginning of the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648), Heusden was occupied by the Spanish. In 1577, however, following the Pacification of Ghent, the people of Heusden allied with William, Prince of Orange. William consolidated the town's strategic position near the river Meuse, and ordered fortification works to be constructed. Work started in 1579 with the digging of moats and the construction of bastions, walls, and ravelins, and was completed in 1597. By the early nineteenth century, the defence works fell into disrepair and were dismantled. In 1968, however, extensive restoration works started, and fortifications were carefully rebuilt, based on and inspired by a 1649 map of the city of Heusden by Johannes Blaeu, son of the famous Dutch cartographer Willem Blaeu. In 1980, the city of Heusden received the European Urbes Nostrae restoration prize. Heusden currently draws over 350 thousand tourists every year who visit the historic town centre and walk the walls that once made it a formidable stronghold. = Heusden Town Hall Massacre, a German warcrime = Memorial tablet, Heusden town hall. Heusden town hall (Summer 2007). In October 1944, towards the end of World War II, the cities of Tilburg and 's-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch) were liberated by the Allied forces. The bridge across the river Meuse made Heusden, then still occupied by the Germans, strategically significant. The cellars of the old town hall, built in 1588, were a shelter for civilians during artillery fire. The German Wehrmacht used the building as a communication centre and hospital. A few weeks after Operation Market Garden, the allied Operation Pheasant started on 20 October 1944. The First Canadian Army (advancing from Belgium) and the 2nd British Army (advancing from the east) fought to liberate central and western North Brabant. On Saturday 4 November, under heavy artillery fire, two Scottish Highlander regiments advanced, and 170 civilians sought shelter in the town hall cellars. In the early morning of 5 November, three German army engineers detonated explosive charges they had placed earlier in the 40-metre tower. It collapsed, killing 134 people. Heusden was decimated. One tenth of the town's population died that night in the town hall cellars. Seventy-four victims, i.e. more than half of the total number, were children aged 16 or younger. Only hours later, the 5th battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders from the 51st Highland Division liberated Heusden. Witnesses have stated that on 4 November German soldiers carried explosives into the town hall tower, and also into two churches, a windmill, and dairy factory in Heusden. NCO (non-commissioned officer) Bottnick, who was probably following orders from commander Pf√ºhl, a mining engineer, undermined the eastern part of the tower, ensuring that it would collapse on the town hall, not on the street. Later, these events were investigated by the British Civil Affairs. However, this has never resulted in the trial and punishment of Pf√ºhl, Bottnick, and their accomplices. A new town hall was erected in 1956. Designed and built in the style of the Bossche School, it has much less splendour than its late-gothic predecessor. A memorial tablet in the forecourt still remembers the lives that were lost in the night of 4 to 5 November 1944. Its inscription: \\"Wandelaar, waar gij staat vielen vijf november 1944 honderd vier en dertig burgers den oorlog ten offer.\\" (\\"Passer-by, where you are, on five November 1944 one hundred and thirty four civilians fell victim to the war.\\") Inscriptions on one of the larger bells in the tower \\"Nabestaanden, als ik luid, weet: Uw vele, vele doden zijn niet oorlogs droeve buit, maar aan 't Gastmaal Gods genoden.\\", and an epitaph \\"5 November 1944. Hier staat in steen geschreven geen daad of droom, geen leven, maar slechts het blijvend feit van hun afwezigheid\\" (\\"5 November 1944. Here is written in stone no act or dream, no life, but only the permanent fact of their absence\\") in the building itself are also dedicated to the memory of the victims. The massacre (\\"Stadhuisramp\\") is commemorated every year. With the fusion of the municipalities of Heusden, Drunen and Vlijmen in 1997, the town hall had lost its original function. Since 2005, the building has housed a visitors centre.

Namesake of Loon op Zand. Loon op Zand is the oldest village of the municipality. Somewhere around the year 1000, this village was founded in a very wet and swampy area. There was also a lot of drift-sand whose origin, according to geological experts, dates back to the last ice age. As of this moment, Loon op Zand has the biggest driftsand area in all of western Europe. The presence of this driftsand explains the name of Loon op Zand. It means Village build on sand. Historically, the presence of this driftsand has caused the relocation of the village on several times. Hinerland farmers build many sandy embankments or levies to protect their land against the ceaseless drifting sand. For 200 years, Loon op Zand and Kaatsheuvel were the centre of the leather tanning and shoe manufacturing industry of the region. There were a lot of factories; most of these were in people's backyards. There were some big shoe manufacturers like Van Lier. This world-famous shoe brand originated in Loon op Zand.

Moerdijk is however a well-known name in the Netherlands, because of the large Moerdijk industrial area, with a large power plant, and because of the well- known Moerdijk bridges (highway and railway bridges) across the Hollands Diep. This was the last bridge available for the retreat from the vital Scheldt Estuary of the rapidly collapsing German defences near Antwerp in World War II. (Noteworthy as well, the Moerdijk bridges were one of the first targets of guided, or \\"smart bombs\\"- by American heavy bombers in late 1944.) Moerdijk made headlines on January 5, 2011, because of a large fire at Chemie-Pack (a firm processing numerous chemicals) causing a large cloud of toxic smoke to blow over the surrounding area, mostly to the north of Moerdijk.

In the North American area, a barn refers to structures that house livestock, including cattle and horses, as well as equipment and fodder, and often grain.Allen G. Noble, Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions (New York: Tauris, 2007), 30. As a result, the term barn is often qualified e.g. tobacco barn, dairy barn, sheep barn, potato barn. In the British Isles, the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for unthreshed cereals and fodder, the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters, whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables. In mainland Europe, however, barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings (or housebarns in US literature). In addition, barns may be used for equipment storage, as a covered workplace, and for activities such as threshing. Etymology The word barn comes from the Old English {{langangbere, for barley (or grain in general), and , for a storage place‚Äîthus, a storehouse for barley. The word , also spelled bern and bearn, is attested to at least sixty times in homilies and other Old English prose. The related words bere-tun and bere-flor both meant threshing floor. Bere-tun also meant granary; the literal translation of bere-tun is \\"grain enclosure\\". While the only literary attestation of bere-hus (also granary) comes from the Dialogi of Gregory the Great, there are four known mentions of bere-tun and two of bere-flor. A Thesaurus of Old English lists and (\\"meal-store house\\") as synonyms for barn.Bosworth, J.. A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language.... London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, 1838. 50. Print. History The modern barn largely developed from the three aisled medieval barn, commonly known as tithe barn or monastic barn. This, in turn, originated in a 12th-century building tradition, also applied in halls and ecclesiastical buildings. In the 15th century several thousands of these huge barns were to be found in Western-Europe. In the course of time, its construction method was adopted by normal farms and it gradually spread to simpler buildings and other rural areas. As a rule, the aisled barn had large entrance doors and a passage corridor for loaded wagons. The storage floors between the central posts or in the aisles were known as bays or mows (from Middle French moye).Malcolm Kirk, The Barn. Silent Spaces, London 1994; Graham Hughes, Barns of Rural Britain, London 1985; Walter Horn, 'On the Origins of the Medieval Bay System', in: Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 17 (1958), nr. 2, p. 2-23. The main types were large barns with sideway passages, compact barns with a central entrance and smaller barns with a transverse passage. The latter also spread to Eastern Europe. Whenever stone walls were applied, the aisled timber frame often gave way to single-naved buildings. A special type were byre-dwellings, which included living quarters, byres and stables, such as the Frisian farmhouse or Gulf house and the Black Forest house. Not all, however, evolved from the medieval barn. Other types descended from the prehistoric longhouse or other building traditions. One of the latter was the Low German (hall) house, in which the harvest was stored in the attic.Jeremy Lake, Historic Farm Buildings. An Introduction and Guide, London 1989; Eric Sloane, An Age of Barns. An Illustrated Review of Classic Barn Styles and Construction, New York 1967, 4th ed. 2005; Jean-Ren√© Trochet, Maisons paysannes en France et leur environnement, XVe-XXe si√®cles, Paris 2007. In many cases, the New World colonial barn evolved from the Low German house, which was transformed to a real barn by first generation colonists from the Netherlands and Germany.John Fitchen, The New World Dutch Barn. A Study of its Characteristics, its Structural System, and its Probable Erectional Procedures, Syracuse N.Y. 1968. Construction The skeleton of a post and beam horse barn just after raising Thomas Ranck Round Barn in Fayette County, Indiana, U.S. In the U.S., older barns were built from timbers hewn from trees on the farm and built as a log crib barn or timber frame, although stone barns were sometimes built in areas where stone was a cheaper building material. In the mid to late 19th century in the U.S. barn framing methods began to shift away from traditional timber framing to \\"truss framed\\" or \\"plank framed\\" buildings. Truss or plank framed barns reduced the number of timbers instead using dimensional lumber for the rafters, joists, and sometimes the trusses. The joints began to become bolted or nailed instead of being mortised and tenoned. The inventor and patentee of the Jennings Barn claimed his design used less lumber, less work, less time, and less cost to build and were durable and provided more room for hay storage.Fink, Daniel. Barns of the Genesee country, 1790‚Äì1915: including an account of settlement and changes in agricultural practices. Geneseo, N.Y.: J. Brunner, 1987. Print. 416. Mechanization on the farm, better transportation infrastructure, and new technology like a hay fork mounted on a track contributed to a need for larger, more open barns, sawmills using steam power could produce smaller pieces of lumber affordably, and machine cut nails were much less expensive than hand-made (wrought) nails. Concrete block began to be used for barns in the early 20th century in the U.S.Fink, Daniel.

Modern barns are more typically steel buildings. From about 1900 to 1940, many large dairy barns were built in northern USA. These commonly have gambrel or hip roofs to maximize the size of the hay loft above the dairy roof, and have become associated in the popular image of a dairy farm. The barns that were common to the wheatbelt held large numbers of pulling horses such as Clydesdales or Percherons. These large wooden barns, especially when filled with hay, could make spectacular fires that were usually total losses for the farmers. With the advent of balers it became possible to store hay and straw outdoors in stacks surrounded by a plowed fireguard. Many barns in the northern United States are painted barn red with a white trim. One possible reason for this is that ferric oxide, which is used to create red paint, was the cheapest and most readily available chemical for farmers in New England and nearby areas. Another possible reason is that ferric oxide acts a preservative and so painting a barn with it would help to protect the structure. The custom of painting barns in red with white trim is widely spread in Scandinavia. Especially in Sweden the Falu red with white trims is the traditional colouring of most wooden buildings. With the popularity of tractors following World War II many barns were taken down or replaced with modern Quonset huts made of plywood or galvanized steel. Beef ranches and dairies began building smaller loftless barns often of Quonset huts or of steel walls on a treated wood frame (old telephone or power poles). By the 1960s it was found that cattle receive sufficient shelter from trees or wind fences (usually wooden slabs 20% open).

Uses The hay track developed in the early 19th century, here showing how the hay hood (roof extension) covers the track. The gable wall of this barn is missing. In older style North American barns, the upper area was used to store hay and sometimes grain. This is called the mow (rhymes with cow) or the hayloft. A large door at the top of the ends of the barn could be opened up so that hay could be put in the loft. The hay was hoisted into the barn by a system containing pulleys and a trolley that ran along a track attached to the top ridge of the barn. Trap doors in the floor allowed animal feed to be dropped into the mangers for the animals. In New England it is common to find barns attached to the main farmhouse (connected farm architecture), allowing for chores to be done while sheltering the worker from the weather. In the middle of the twentieth century the large broad roof of barns were sometimes painted with slogans in the United States. Most common of these were the 900 barns painted with ads for Rock City. In the past barns were often used for communal gatherings, such as barn dances. Features A barn in southern Ontario, Canada A barn of the Uster castle in the city of Uster, Switzerland This barn in Thuringia, Germany has two outshots forming the recess to the middle barn doors. A farm may have buildings of varying shapes and sizes used to shelter large and small animals and other uses.

Derivatives The physics term \\"barn\\", which is a subatomic unit of area, 10‚àí28 m2, came from experiments with uranium nuclei during World War II, wherein they were described colloquially as \\"big as a barn\\", with the measurement officially adopted to maintain security around nuclear weapons research.

Old farm buildings of the countryside contribute to the landscape, and help define the history of the location, i.e. how farming took place in the past, and how the area has been settled throughout the ages. They also can show the agricultural methods, building materials, and skills that were used. Most were built with materials reflecting the local geology of the area. Building methods include earth walling and thatching. Buildings in stone and brick, roofed with tile or slate, increasingly replaced buildings in clay, timber and thatch from the later 18th century. Metal roofs started to be used from the 1850s. The arrival of canals and railways brought about transportation of building materials over greater distances. Clues determining their age and historical use can be found from old maps, sale documents, estate plans, and from a visual inspection of the building itself, noting (for example) reused timbers, former floors, partitions, doors and windows. The arrangement of the buildings within the farmstead can also yield valuable information on the historical farm usage and landscape value. Linear farmsteads were typical of small farms, where there was an advantage to having cattle and fodder within one building, due to the colder climate. Dispersed clusters of unplanned groups were more widespread. Loose courtyard plans built around a yard were associated with bigger farms, whereas carefully laid out courtyard plans designed to minimize waste and labour were built in the latter part of the 18th century.The Conversion of Traditional Farm Buildings: A guide to good practice, by English Heritage. The barns are typically the oldest and biggest buildings to be found on the farm. Many barns were converted into cow houses and fodder processing and storage buildings after the 1880s. Many barns had owl holes to allow for access by barn owls, encouraged to aid vermin control. The stable is typically the second-oldest building type on the farm. They were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals Modern granaries were built from the 18th century. Complete granary interiors, with plastered walls and wooden partitioning to grain bins, are very rare. Longhouses are an ancient building where people and animals used the same entrance. These can still be seen, for example, in North Germany, where the Low Saxon house occurs. Few interiors of the 19th century cow houses have survived unaltered due to dairy-hygiene regulations in many countries. Old farm buildings may show the following signs of deterioration: rotting in timber-framed constructions due to damp, cracks in the masonry from movement of the walls, e.g. ground movement, roofing problems (e.g. outward thrust of it, deterioration of purlins and gable ends), foundation problems, penetration of tree roots; lime mortar being washed away due to inadequate weather-protection. Walls made of cob, earth mortars or walls with rubble cores are all highly vulnerable to water penetration, and replacement or covering of breathable materials with cement or damp-proofing materials may trap moisture within the walls. First Aid Repair to Traditional Farm Buildings produced by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings gives useful guidance How to deal with damp produced by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings gives useful guidance In England and Wales some of these historical buildings have been given \\"listed building\\" status, which provides them some degree of archaeological protection.

It was assumed for years that he had been shot down, but following the discovery of the wreckage it was found that a fault with the fuel tank selector possibly meant the aircraft simply ran out of fuel. An eye-witness account detailed how his aircraft circled Steenbergen and heard its engines 'splutter and stop'.Bomber Barons, Chaz Bowyer (1983) page 165 In 2011 it was revealed the Mosquito may also have been shot down in a friendly fire incident.After The Battle no. 155 (2012), page 47, The graves are in the RC cemetery of Steenbergen. Streets have been named for both Gibson and Warwick, and one of the aircraft's propellers is located in the city park as a memorial.

Many commuters live in the municipality, and the town of Vught was once named \\"Best place to live\\" by the Dutch magazine Elsevier. Population centres *Cromvoirt *Vught =Topography= 420px Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Vught, June 2015 History =Early history= The first mention of Vught in the historical record dates to the eleventh century. By the fourteenth century, the Teutonic Order had acquired the parish and set up a commandery (feudalism) across from the Saint Lambert Church. In 1328, the residents of Vught were granted the right of municipality by the Duke of Brabant. =Eighty Years War= During the Eighty Years War Vught was the site of struggles between Catholic interests and the troops of William of Orange. The Saint Lambert Church was made into a Reformed Protestant church in the year 1629, after the troops of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, were victorious in 's-Hertogenbosch. =World War II= Watchtowers and barbed wire fences at Herzogenbusch concentration camp in Vught Vught is known for having been the site of a transit/concentration camp (Herzogenbusch) built by Nazi Germany during its occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. It was part of Camp Herzogenbusch, but usually better known as \\"Kamp Vught\\" (Camp Vught). The camp held male and female prisoners, many of them Jewish and political activists, captured in Belgium and the Netherlands. The guard staff included SS men and a few SS women, headed by Oberaufseherin Margarete Gallinat. The SS initially used this location as a transit camp to gather mostly Jewish prisoners for classification and transportation to camps in Poland and other areas. A group of women were severely punished for standing up for another female prisoner. Seventy-four women were pushed into a cell room of barely nine square meters and held there for over fourteen hours. Ten of the women died, and several suffered permanent physical or mental damage. The camp commander responsible was demoted by Himmler to the regular rank of soldier and sent to the Hungarian front; he died there in 1945. Dutch underground members Corrie and Betsie ten Boom were held at Vught in 1944, before being sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Vught was also a transition camp for many of the female laborers at the Agfa Kamerawerke in M√ºnchen-Giesing, where they built ignition and camera devises. Poncke Princen, who would later become known for going over to the Indonesian guerrillas opposing Dutch rule, was imprisoned at Vught for his anti-Nazi activities. Vught was liberated by the Canadians at the end of the war, but only after German guards killed several hundred prisoners held there, mainly by firing squad. =Camp in post-war times= Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught. The room shows the names of all men, women, and children who did not survive the imprisonment at the Kamp Vught. After World War II, the camp was first used as a prison for Germans and collaborators. Some of the camp has been preserved as a national monument related to the Nazi occupation during World War II. (See photo.) The barracks of Camp Vught were later adapted into a number of home units to house Indonesian Moluccan exiles, former soldiers of the Netherlands armed forces and their families who were transferred to the Netherlands after Indonesian independence. In addition, a prison called Nieuw Vosseveld was built on part of the site of Camp Vught. In the beginning, it chiefly held young offenders. Today it is used for high-risk criminals. To this end, the prison was equipped with a high security unit, or EBI, in 1993. Politics On 2 April 2007 Roderick van de Mortel (VVD) was appointed mayor of Vught. The current aldermen are Peter Pennings (GB, also vice mayor), Saskia Heijboer-Klapwijk (VVD) and Wilbert Seuren (D66). Landmarks and nature Maurick Castle Zionsburg, Vught Just outside the town border lies the lake IJzeren Man (literally translated Iron Man). It was named after the machine that dug it in the years 1890 to 1915. The sand was needed as fill for the expansion of the nearby city of 's-Hertogenbosch. The lake is about 2 kilometers long, has a small island and is now mainly used for recreation. Maurick Castle dates back to the 13th century. In 1629 the castle was occupied by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. Frederick Henry wanted to have the castle as his headquarters for his siege of 's-Hertogenbosch. The castle has been adapted to house a restaurant, which has been recognized with one Michelin Star. Vught is home to the Bredero barracks, which houses the Ministry of Defence's CBRN defense training center. =Ewald Marggraff= Ewald Marggraff was a well-to- do nobleman who lived in Vught in the twentieth century. He became a hermit, but had studied law and acquired a large amount of land and several buildings. He frequently argued with the local authorities, mostly over land issues. He chose to let all his properties deteriorate, which officials opposed, but letting his lands go enabled them to return to natural habitat. Animal species lived on his land that had disappeared elsewhere. His land holdings in and around the town of Vught were never open to the general public. On 7 December 2003 Marggraff's manor (Zionsburg) burned down; his body was found later in the entrance hallway near the front door. Marggraff's surviving sisters founded a non-profit corporation, Marggraff stichting, to take over and manage their late brother's extensive landholdings for public use. The organisation has opened up the land for public access, allowing people from around the region to hike in the forests. The non-profit also has plans to rebuild Marggraff's manor. In cooperation with SIX Architects BNA from Zeist, The Netherlands, it developed design and use plans, which are now under consideration by the local authorities. Department of corrections ‚Äî PI Vught From 1953, part of the former detention camp was developed as a juvenile prison. Today it contains 15 separate units, holding 2400 prisoners. PI Vught has a prison with the status of a high-security unit. Amongst the criminals imprisoned there are: * Samir Azzouz, terrorist with ties to Hofstad Network.

Woensdrecht is the home of the Woensdrecht Air Base, which is located to the north-east of the village of Woensdrecht and to the north-west of Huijbergen.  History  =Second World War= On 2 October 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of the Scheldt (2 October-8 November 1944), the Canadian 2nd Division began its advance north from Antwerp. Stiff fighting at Woensdrecht ensued on 6 October, the objective of the first phase. The Germans, reinforced by Battle Group Chill, saw the priority in holding there, controlling direct access to South Beveland and Walcheren Island. There were heavy casualties as the Canadians attacked over open, flooded land. Driving rain, booby traps and land mines made the advance very difficult. On 13 October, what would come to be known as \\"Black Friday\\", the Canadian 5th Infantry Brigade's Black Watch was virtually wiped out in an unsuccessful attack. The Calgary Highlanders were to follow up with a more successful action, and their Carrier Platoon succeeded in taking the rail station at Korteven. Heavy fighting at Hoogerheide also ensued, but by 16 October, Woensdrecht was secured, cutting the land link to South Beveland and Walcheren. The Canadians were successful in completing their objective. After that the Buffaloes, ground forces dedicating to causing as much impact to the enemy troops during the barrage, secured the Breskens pocket on the north side of the Scheldt river. =Cold War era= In 1983, it was decided that the United States would station 48 nuclear armed cruise missiles at the air base in the district, unless the USSR reduced their number of SS-20 missiles to 378. Since the number was still higher in 1985, stationing was to proceed. Among the Dutch population there was protest against this.

Zundert is the birthplace of post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. History The origin of the town of Zundert is like that of many others, very unclear. The name is first encountered in a certificate dating from 1157, in which the Bishop of Liege, confirms a donation from the place \\"Sunderda\\". This Sunderda actually relates to the current settlement of Klein-Zundert (Dutch for Small Zundert), one of the first settlements in the area. The local monks, besides their religious labour, were also involved in clearing the land, that was still rough territory, filled with swamps, peats and heath fields. The monks also assisted in improving agricultural methods. Zundert is still surrounded by a rural environment with nature areas, one of them is the \\"Buissche Heide\\", a heath area used for recreation and walking. The Kalmthoutse Heide, across the border with Belgium, is also in the vicinity. During the Second World War Zundert, Achtmaal, Wernhout and Klein-Zundert were liberated during the allied offensive Operation Pheasant on October 27, Rijsbergen on October 28. Achtmaal was liberated by the 415th Infantry Regiment of the US 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division, Zundert and Klein-Zundert by the 413th Infantry Regiment of the 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division, and Wernhout and Rijsbergen by the 414th Infantry Regiment of the 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division. At a small distance from the town, an old tavern called \\"In Den Anker\\" can be found, which has the oldest license in the Netherlands. It originally dates from 1635, but was rebuilt in 1913.  Geography  The municipality of Zundert contains the following places: Zundert lies about above Dutch sea level (NAP), and is located south-west of the city of Breda, and north-east of Antwerp, Belgium. Zundert is surrounded by the municipalities Etten-Leur and Breda on the north, Hoogstraten (Belgium) on the east, Wuustwezel (Belgium) on the south, Kalmthout (Belgium) on the southwest, and Essen (Belgium) and Rucphen on the west. Zundert is one of the most agricultural municipalities of the Netherlands. 10% of all nursery production of the Netherlands is around Zundert. Production of strawberries and young field grown trees and hedging plants is very important in the area. Architecture 179x179pxThe Roman Catholic church of Zundert, dedicated to Saint Trudo, was built in 1927, and contains art treasures from the 17th century, coming from the St. Michielsabdij in Antwerp, including an original sculpture made by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens. These treasures consist of marble altar tables, three Alabaster sculptures, several paintings and two carved oaken confessionals. The church itself was designed by Jan Stuyt, a pupil of the architect Pierre Cuypers. Stuyt also designed the church of nearby Klein- Zundert in the same municipality. The town hall of Zundert was built in 1830 in neoclassical style and demolished and rebuilt in the same style in 1965. = Windmills = De Akkermolen te Zundert Zundert is the home of a 17th- century windmill, called 'De Akkermolen' (The Croftmill). It is said to have been originally built in 1652. It is a standard mill, and it was built to process grain. The mill had numerous private owners in the past, including stadtholder Willem V, as the Baron of Breda, who became owner in 1794. In the early 1900s the mill was owned by Wilhelmus van der Stappen. The mill was heavily damaged in 1950, and its existence was threatened several occasions after that. The Akkermolen is currently owned by the municipality of Zundert, which bought it in 1959, the last private owners being the Herijgers family. After the mill was taken over by Zundert, it needed serious restoration, which took place in 1961. Another restoration took place in 1991, but then, the entire mill needed to be taken apart and restored. The Akkermolen can be visited, after arranging an appointment at Akkermolenweg 15. The town had other mills in the past, one of them was a stone-mill called \\"De Eendracht\\", which stood on Moleneind, currently known as Poteind. It burned down on January 23, 1909. The owner at the time;Jaak Theeuwis, had already lost a wooden mill in Zundert, which was blown down in the previous year of 1908. A store called \\"de Boerenbond\\" is now located on the former mills location.  Vincent van Gogh  left Statue of Vincent and Theo van Gogh by Ossip Zadkine. The Dutch Reformed church is in the background. Zundert is the birthplace and childhood home of the famous painter Vincent van Gogh. He was born on 30 March 1853 in a little house on Zundert's main street, \\"Markt 29\\". The former house is gone as it was too dilapidated to preserve, but a plaque at this location still commemorates his birth. In May 2007 the renovation of the house at Markt 29, and the neighbouring house, started. After the renovation, the Vincent van Gogh house was opened in August 2008. People can still visit the Dutch Reformed church built in 1806 in which the father of Vincent, Theodorus van Gogh, started preaching in 1849. In the graveyard is the grave of Vincent's one year older brother, who died soon in infancy - also called Vincent van Gogh. Vincent did not paint when he lived in Zundert, but drew some sketches. In letters to his Brother Theo, Vincent recalls Zundert, and its surroundings a few times when writing about childhood, serenity and learning about life. Because he died in the French town of Auvers-sur-Oise, on 29 July 1890, a special relation between these two places exists. This can, for example, be noticed by the existence of a slightly hidden Auvers-sur-Oise Street, ending at the Van Gogh Square. To keep Vincent's memory alive, the municipality of Zundert started the project of realising a Vincent van Gogh house. Rather than a classical museum, it is an active environment, with a presentation about van Gogh's life, interactive education, a documentation room and also permanent and temporary expositions. Tourist information is also located in the building, as well as a pleasant bar with a garden terrace. There is a bronze monument made by the French artist Ossip Zadkine of Vincent and his brother Theo on the \\"Vincent van Gogh Plein\\" (Vincent van Gogh square). The statue of Vincent and Theo van Gogh was unveiled on 28 May 1964 by the former Dutch queen Juliana. The statue is an abstracted representation of Vincent's connection with his brother Theo. There are several activities relating to Vincent van Gogh, you can go to tourist information Zundert about participating in these activities, which is in the Vincent van Gogh house, opposite the town hall.

The enraged Romans put her into a barrel with knives stuck into it and rolled it down a street (according to tradition, the one now called Baixada de Santa Eul√†lia). The body of Saint Eulalia is entombed in the cathedral's crypt. The choir stalls retain the coats-of-arms of the knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In his first trip into Spain, Charles, the future Holy Roman Emperor, selected Barcelona as the site of a chapter of his Order. The king had arrived for his investiture as Count of Barcelona, and the city, as a Mediterranean port, offered the closest communication with other far-flung Habsburg dominions, while the large proportions of the cathedral would accommodate required grand ceremonies. In 1518 the Order's herald, Thomas Isaac, and its treasurer, Jean Micault, were commissioned to prepare the sanctuary for the first sitting of the chapter in 1519. Juan de Borgonya executed the painted decoration of the sanctuary. \\"The church was named after Barcelona's patron saint Eulalia; its official name - Catedral de la Santa Creu i Santa Eulalia - is Catalan for \\"Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia\\". The commonly used name La Seu refers to the status of the church as the seat of the diocese.\\" The side Chapel of the Holy Sacrament and of the Holy Christ of Lepanto contains a cross said to date from the time of the Battle of Lepanto (1571). In addition to Saints Eul√†lia and Olegarius, the cathedral contains the tombs of Saint Raymond of Penyafort, Count Ramon Berenguer I and his third wife Almodis de la Marche, and bishops Berenguer de Palou II, Salvador Casa√±as y Pag√©s, and Arnau de Gurb, who is buried in the Chapel of Santa Ll√∫cia, which he had constructed. The cathedral has a secluded Gothic cloister where 13 white geese are kept, the number explained by the assertion that Eulalia was 13 when she was martyred. A program of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral was carried out from 1968‚Äì72.Detailed in Juan Bassegoda Nonell, La catedral de Barcelona: su restoraci√≥n 1968-1972 (Barcelona). History Parts of an early Christian and Visigothic episcopal complex including the baptistery (fourth century), a basilical hall (fifth century), a cross shaped church (sixth-seventh century) and bishop's palace (sixth-seventh century) are displayed in Barcelona City History Museum archaeological underground. Reportedly, this Visigothic chapel was dedicated to Saint James, and was the proprietary church of the Viscounts of Barcelona.F. Carreras Candi La Ciutat de Barcelona However, in a document from the Second Council of Barcelona in 599, it states that the cathedral was dedicated to the Holy Cross. This church was severely damaged by al-Mansur (Almanzor) during his attack on Barcelona in 985. In 1046, Count Ramon Berenguer I and his wife Almodis, together with Bishop Guislabert, began construction of a Romanesque cathedral at the site; it was consecrated in November 1058. The cathedral was constructed over the crypt of the former church. It has been reported that a Viscount of Barcelona, Mir Geribert, sold the site to Bishop Guislebert in 1058, though however, this date does not coincide with the reported start of construction. The present Gothic cathedral was begun on the foundations of the previous churches on 1 May 1298; James II the Just was King of Aragon at the time, and Bernat Pelegri was Bishop of Barcelona. The church was built from the east end towards the west end, with a simple west facade completed in 1417. The cloister was completed in 1448, making the total duration of construction 150 years. In the late nineteenth century, Miguel Girona i Agrafel offered to complete the neo-Gothic facade and central tower as inspired by the original fifteenth-century design prepared by master Carl√≠ and rearranged and drawn by the architect Josep O. Mestres. This work was completed in 1913 by Girona's children.

It was rebuilt in the seventeenth century to house the tomb of San Olegarius, Bishop of Barcelona, and Archbishop of Tarragona. The \\"Holy Christ of Lepanto\\" crucifix, is located on the upper part of the chapel entrance's front fa√ßade. The curved shape of the body is explained by a Catalan legend which holds that the cross was carried on the prow of the galley captained by Juan of Austria, step- brother of Spanish Philip II of Spain during the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. When a cannonball flew toward the cross, it leaned out of the way in order to avoid being hit, and has been inclined ever since.This is said to have inspired the Habsburg forces to victory.O'Shea, Henry. A Guide to Spain, London, Spottiswoode and Co., 1865 The Habsburgs were said to have regarded this as an encouraging omen. A separate story says that the cross was in the ship's hold and that the figure moved to cover a large hole that would have sunk the ship.\\"Holy Christ of Lepanto\\", Catedral de Barcelona  Traditions  * The tradition of the 'dancing egg' (supported by the jet of a fountain) is maintained on the day of Corpus Christi at the cathedral.  Present day  The cathedral has been updated in response to an increasing number of tourists. The cloister now contains a gift shop, the traditional candles normally lit at the shrines of saints have been replaced with electronic candles, and cellular phones have been banned from the Chapel of Lepanto.

It is used as a residential, office building, or other functions including hotel, retail, or with multiple purposes combined. Residential high- rise buildings are also known as tower blocks and may be referred to as \\"MDUs\\", standing for \\"multi-dwelling unit\\".BICSI McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002, A very tall high-rise building is referred to as a skyscraper. High- rise buildings became possible with the invention of the elevator (lift) and less expensive, more abundant building materials. The materials used for the structural system of high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and steel. Most North American style skyscrapers have a steel frame, while residential blocks are usually constructed of concrete. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper, although a building with forty or more stories and taller than is generally considered a skyscraper. High-rise structures pose particular design challenges for structural and geotechnical engineers, particularly if situated in a seismically active region or if the underlying soils have geotechnical risk factors such as high compressibility or bay mud. They also pose serious challenges to firefighters during emergencies in high-rise structures. New and old building design, building systems like the building standpipe system, HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), fire sprinkler system and other things like stairwell and elevator evacuations pose significant problems. Studies are often required to ensure that pedestrian wind comfort and wind danger concerns are addressed. In order to allow less wind exposure, to transmit more daylight to the ground and to appear more slender, many high-rises have a design with setbacks. Apartment buildings have technical and economic advantages in areas of high population density, and have become a distinctive feature of housing accommodation in virtually all densely populated urban areas around the world. In contrast with low-rise and single-family houses, apartment blocks accommodate more inhabitants per unit of area of land and decrease the cost of municipal infrastructure. Definition Various bodies have defined \\"high- rise\\": *Emporis defines a high-rise as \\"A multi-story structure between 35‚Äì100 meters tall, or a building of unknown height from 12‚Äì39 floors.\\"Data Standards: high-rise building (ESN 18727), Emporis Standards. Accessed online 16 October 2009. *According to the building code of Hyderabad, a high-rise building is one with four floors or more, or 15 to 18 meters or more in height.p. 57, Urban redevelopment: a study of high-rise buildings, K. Narayan Reddy, Concept Publishing Company, 1996, . *The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a high-rise as \\"a building having many storeys\\". *The International Conference on Fire Safety in High-Rise Buildings defined a high- rise as \\"any structure where the height can have a serious impact on evacuation\\" also Murat Saatcioglu, \\"High-Rise Buildings in Natural Disaster\\", in Encyclopedia of Natural Hazards Dordrecht, NL: Springer, 2016. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4399-4_168 *In the U.S., the National Fire Protection Association defines a high-rise as being higher than 75 feet (23 meters), or about 7 stories. *Most building engineers, inspectors, architects and similar professionals define a high-rise as a building that is at least 75 feet (23 m) tall. History These tower blocks were built in Shibam, Yemen, in the 16th century, and are the tallest mudbrick buildings in the world, some more than 30 meters (100 feet) high. Sliding ladder for firefighters in 1904 High-rise apartment buildings had already appeared in antiquity: the insulae in ancient Rome and several other cities in the Roman Empire, some of which might have reached up to ten or more stories, one reportedly having 200 stairs.Martial, Epigrams, 27 Because of the destruction caused by poorly built high-rise insulae collapsing, several Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus (r. 30 BC ‚Äì 14 AD), set limits of 20‚Äì25 meters for multi-story buildings, but met with limited success,Strabo, 5.3.7Alexander G. McKay: R√∂mische H√§user, Villen und Pal√§ste, Feldmeilen 1984, p. 231 as these limits were often ignored despite the likelihood of taller insulae collapsing. The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper stories were rented out to the lower classes. Surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyri indicate that seven-story buildings even existed in provincial towns, such as in third century AD Hermopolis in Roman Egypt.Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke, C√§cilia Fluck, G√ºnter Vittmann: √Ñgyptens sp√§te Bl√ºte. Die R√∂mer am Nil, Mainz 2004, , p. 29 In Arab Egypt, the initial capital city of Fustat housed many high-rise residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. Al-Muqaddasi, in the 10th century, described them as resembling minarets, while Nasir Khusraw, in the early 11th century, described some of them rising up to 14 stories, with roof gardens on the top story complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigating them. By the 16th century, Cairo also had high-rise apartment buildings where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The skyline of many important medieval cities was dominated by large numbers of high-rising urban towers, which fulfilled defensive but also representative purposes. The residential Towers of Bologna numbered between 80 and 100 at a time, the largest of which still rise to 97.2 m. In Florence, a law of 1251 decreed that all urban buildings should be reduced to a height of less than 26 m, the regulation immediately put into effect.Werner M√ºller: \\"dtv-Atlas Baukunst I. Allgemeiner Teil: Baugeschichte von Mesopotamien bis Byzanz\\", 14th ed., 2005, , p. 345 Even medium-sized towns such as San Gimignano are known to have featured 72 towers up to 51 m in height. The Hakka people in southern China have adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible in the forms of Weilongwu (Âõ¥ÈæôÂ±ã) and Tulou (ÂúüÊ•º), the latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth building, between three and five stories high and housing up to 80 families. The oldest still standing tulou dates back from the 14th century. Knapp, Ronald G.. China's old dwellings. Honolulu: University of Hawai ªi Press, 2000. 266. High rises were built in the Yemeni city of Shibam in the 16th century. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud bricks, but about five hundred of them are tower houses, which rise five to sixteen stories high, with each floor having one or two apartments.Old Walled City of Shibam, UNESCO World Heritage Centre This technique of building was implemented to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has existed for around two thousand years, most of the city's houses date from the 16th century. The city has the tallest mud buildings in the world, some more than 30 meters (100 feet) high. Shibam has been called \\"one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction\\" or \\"Manhattan of the desert\\". The engineer's definition of high-rise buildings comes from the development of fire trucks in the late 19th century. Magirus had shown the first cogwheel sliding ladder in 1864. The first turntable ladder drawn by horses was developed in 1892 which had a length of 25 meters. The extension ladder was motorized by Magirus in 1904. The definition of a maximum of 22 meters for the highest floor was common in the building regulations at the time and it is still so today in Germany. The common height for turntable ladders did later go to 32 meters (100 feet), so that 30 meter is a common limit in some building regulations today, for example in Switzerland. Any building that exceeds the height of the usual turntable ladders in a city must install additional fire safety equipment, so that these high-rise buildings have a different section in the building regulations in the world. Currently, the tallest high-rise apartment building in the world is Chicago's John Hancock Center, constructed under the supervision of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1969. The building has 100 stories and stands 344 meters tall. Modern development A residential block in Steinfurt, Westphalia, Germany, forming a \\"Y\\" The residential tower block with its typical concrete construction are a familiar feature of Modernist architecture. Influential examples include Le Corbusier's \\"housing unit\\" his Unit√© d'Habitation, repeated in various European cities starting with his Cit√© radieuse in Marseille (1947‚Äì52), constructed of b√©ton brut, rough-cast concrete, as steel for framework was unavailable in post-war France. Residential tower blocks became standard in housing urban populations displaced by slum clearances and \\"urban renewal\\". possibly by Jay Thakkar, \\"High Rise Residential Towers\\", (self-published, n.d.) https://www.academia.edu/32050381/High_Rise_Residential_Tower High-rise projects after World War II typically rejected the classical designs of the early skyscrapers, instead embracing the uniform international style; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even got demolished - such as New York's Singer Building, once the world's tallest skyscraper. However, with the movements of Postmodernism, New Urbanism, and New Classical Architecture, that established since the 1980s, a more classical approach came back to global skyscraper design, that is popular today. Other contemporary styles and movements in highrise design include organic, sustainable, neo-futurist, structuralist, high-tech, deconstructivist, blob, digital, streamline, novelty, critical regionalist, vernacular, Neo Art Deco, and neo-historist, also known as revivalist. =Asia= High-rise residential apartment buildings, Hong Kong Residential tower complexes are common in Asian countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Pakistan, Iran and South Korea, as urban densities are very high. In Singapore and urban Hong Kong, land prices are so high that a large portion of the population lives in high-rise apartments. In fact, over 60% of Hong Kong residents live in apartments, many of them condominiums. Sarah Williams Goldhagen (2012) celebrated the work of innovative architecture firms such as WOHA (based in Singapore), Mass Studies (based in Seoul), Amateur Architecture Studio (based in Hangzhou, China), and the New York City-based Steven Holl in the transformation of residential towers into \\"vertical communities\\" or \\"vertical cities in the sky\\" providing aesthetic, unusually designed silhouettes on the skyline, comfortable private spaces and attractive public spaces. None of these \\"functional, handsome, and humane high-rise residential buildings\\" are affordable housing. China The 2012 Pritzker Prize was awarded to Chinese architect Wang Shu. Among his winning designs is the Vertical Courtyard Apartments, six 26-story towers built in Hangzhou, by his architectural firm, Amateur Architecture Studio. \\"These towers were designed to house two-story apartments, in which every inhabitant would enjoy ‚Äúthe illusion of living on the second floor‚Äù, accomplished by folding concrete floor planes (like ‚Äúbamboo mats,‚Äù claims the firm), so that every third story opens into a private courtyard. In the larger towers, the two-story units are stacked slightly askew, adding to the visual interest of the variegated fa√ßades (Goldhagen 2012).\\" South Korea In South Korea, the tower blocks are called Apartment Complex (). The first residential towers began to be built after the Korean War. The South Korean government needed to build many apartment complexes in the cities to be able to accommodate the citizens. In the 60 years since, as the population increased considerably, tower blocks have become more common. This time, however, the new tower blocks integrated shopping malls, parking systems, and other convenient facilities. Samsung Tower Palace in Seoul, South Korea, is the tallest apartment complex in Asia. In Seoul, approximately 80% of its residents live in apartment complexes which comprise 98% of recent residential construction. Seoul proper is noted for its population density, eight times greater than Rome, though less than Manhattan and Paris. Its metropolitan area is the densest in the OECD. Seoul ranks highest in population density among OECD countries-Source-OECD report =Europe= Central and Eastern Europe Nowa Huta in Krak√≥w, Poland, serves as one of the best examples of socialist realism, with its street hierarchy resembling that of Paris. Painted panel√°ks in Prague, Czech Republic Renovated apartment building from 1963 in Bucharest, Romania. With the 2010s, renovation of older apartment buildings in Eastern Europe has become common, especially in countries which get EU funds. Although some Central and Eastern European countries during the interwar period, such as the Second Polish Republic, already started building housing estates that were considered to be of a very high standard for their time, many of these structures perished during the Second World War. In the Eastern Bloc, tower blocks were constructed in great numbers to produce plenty of cheap accommodation for the growing postwar populations of the USSR and its satellite states. This took place mostly in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, though in the People's Republic of Poland this process started even earlier due to the severe damages that Polish cities sustained during World War II. Throughout the former Eastern Bloc countries, tower blocks built during the Soviet years make up much of the current housing estates and most of them were built in the specific socialist realist style of architecture that was dominant in the territories east of the Iron Curtain. In Romania, the mass construction of standardized housing blocks began in the 1950s and 1960s with the outskirts of the cities, some of which were made up of slums. Construction continued in the 1970s and 1980s, under the systematization programme of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, who, after a 1971 visit in North Korea, was impressed by the Juche ideology of that country. Systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build blocks of flats (blocuri). In Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), panel√°k building under communism resulted from two main factors: the postwar housing shortage and the ideology of communist Czechoslovak leaders. In Eastern European countries, opinions about these buildings vary greatly, with some deeming them as eyesores on their city's landscape while others glorify them as relics of a bygone age. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of the former Eastern Bloc countries have begun construction of new, more expensive and modern housing. The ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie borough of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, has seen the development of an array of skyscrapers. Russia is also currently undergoing a dramatic buildout, growing a commercially shaped skyline. Moreover, the ongoing changes made to postwar housing estates since the 2000s in former communist countries vary - ranging from simply applying a new coat of paint to the previously grey exterior to thorough modernization of entire buildings. In the European Union, among former communist states, a majority of the population lives in flats in Latvia (65.1%), Estonia (63.8%), Lithuania (58.4%), Czech Republic (52.8%), and Slovakia (50.3%) (, data from Eurostat).see section Source data for tables and figures, Housing statistics: tables and figures However, not all flat dwellers in Eastern Europe live in communist era blocks of flats; many live in buildings constructed after the fall of communism, and some in buildings surviving from the era before communism. Western Europe In Western Europe, there are fewer high-rise buildings because of the historic city centers. In the 1960s, people started demolishing a few old buildings to replace them with modern high buildings. In Brussels, the capital of Europe, there are numerous modern high-rise buildings in the Northern Quarter business district. The government of Belgium wants to recreate Washington, D.C. on a small scale. Frankfurt is currently the best known high-rise building city of Europe. Big skyscrapers dominate the city. =Great Britain= The three tower blocks of the Crossways Estate in Bow, London, United Kingdom, before their refurbishment Tower blocks were first built in the United Kingdom after the Second World War, and were seen as a cheap way to replace 19th-century urban slums and war-damaged buildings. They were originally seen as desirable, but quickly fell out of favour as tower blocks attracted rising crime and social disorder, particularly after the collapse of Ronan Point in 1968. Although Tower blocks are controversial and numerous examples have been demolished, many still remain in large cities. They present a significant fire risk, as modern safety precautions can be prohibitively expensive to retrofit. The destruction of the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in 2017 by fire had been complained about by a local action group several years before the incident, yet remedial work had not been carried out. There are old high-rise buildings built in the 1960s and 1970s in areas of London such as Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney, and virtually any area in London with council housing. Some new high- rises are being built in areas such as Central London, Southwark, and Nine Elms. In East London, some old high-rises are being gentrified and new high- rises that previously didn't exist are also being built in areas like Stratford, London and Canary Wharf. =Ireland= Flats in Ballymun, Dublin, Ireland ;Republic of Ireland In Dublin, the Ballymun Flats were built between 1966 and 1969: seven 15-story towers, nineteen 8-story blocks and ten 4-story blocks. These were the \\"seven towers\\" referred to in the U2 song \\"Running to Stand Still\\". They have since been demolished. Inner Dublin flat complexes include Sheriff Street (demolished), Fatima Mansions (demolished and redeveloped), St Joseph's Gardens (demolished; replaced by Killarney Court flat complex), St Teresa's Gardens, Dolphin House, Liberty House, St Michael's Estate and O'Devaney Gardens and a lot more mainly throughout the north and south inner city of Dublin. Suburban flat complexes were built exclusively on the northside of the city in Ballymun, Coolock and Kilbarrack. These flats were badly affected by a heroin epidemic that hit working-class areas of Dublin in the 1980s and early 90s. During the era of the Celtic Tiger the largest cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway witnessed new large apartment building, although their heights have generally been restricted. Some large towns such as Navan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Mullingar have also witnessed the construction of many modern apartment blocks. ;Northern Ireland Tower blocks in Northern Ireland were never built to the frequency as in cities on the island of Great Britain. Most tower blocks and flat complexes are found in Belfast although many of these have been demolished since the 1990s and replaced with traditional public housing units. The mid-rise Divis flats complex in west Belfast was built in between 1968 and 1972. It was demolished in the early 1990s as the residents demanded new houses due to mounting problems with the flats. Divis Tower, built separately in 1966, still stands, however; and in 2007 work began to convert the former British Army base at the top two floors into new dwellings. Divis Tower was for several decades Ireland's tallest residential building, having since being surpassed by the privately owned Obel Tower in the city centre. In the north of the City, the iconic seven-tower complex in the New Lodge remains, although so too the problems that residents face, such as poor piping and limited sanitation. Farther north, the four tower blocks in Rathcoole dominate the local skyline, while in south Belfast, the tower blocks in Seymour Hill, Belvoir & Finaghy remain standing. Most of the aforementioned high rise flats in the city were built by the Northern Ireland Housing Trust (NIHT) as part of overspill housing schemes, the first such development being the pair of point blocks in East Belfast's Cregagh estate. These eleven-story towers were completed in 1961 and were the first tall council housing blocks on the island of Ireland.Glendinning, Miles & Muthesius, Stefan (1994). Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. London: Yale University Press. p. 288. The NIHT also designed the inner city Divis Flats complex. The six to eight story deck access flats that comprised most of the Divis estate were of poor build quality and were all demolished by the early 1990s.Glendinning, Miles & Muthesius, Stefan (1994). Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. London: Yale University Press. p. 367. Similar slab blocks were built by the NIHT in East Belfast (Tullycarnet) and Derry's Bogside area, all four of which have been demolished. Belfast Corporation constructed seven tower blocks on the former Victoria Barracks site in the New Lodge district. While the Corporation built some mid-rise flats as part of slum clearance schemes (most notably the now demolished Unity Flats and the 'Weetabix Flats in the Shankill area), New Lodge would be their only high rise project in the inner city with three more in outlying areas of the city during the 1960s, two being in Mount Vernon in North Belfast and one being in the Clarawood estate, East Belfast. The Royal Hospital built three thirteen-story towers for use as staff accommodation, prominently located adjacent to the M2 Motorway at Broadway. Belfast City Hospital also constructed a high rise slab block which since privatisation has been named Bradbury Court, formerly known as Erskine House. Queens University Belfast built several eleven storey towers at their Queens Elms student accommodation. Of the three sixteen-story point blocks of Larne Borough Council in the late 1960s, only one remains.Riverdale Flats, Larne (1) http://www.geograph.ie/photo/2313893 =North America= 432 Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, the tallest residential high-rise tower in the world, under construction in July 2014 Canada In Canada, large multi- family buildings are usually known as apartment buildings or apartment blocks if they are rented from one common landowner, or condominiums or condo towers if each dwelling unit is individually owned; they may be called low-rise (or walk-up), mid-rise, high-rise, or skyscraper depending on their height. Tall residential towers are a staple building type in all large cities. Their relative prominence in Canadian cities varies substantially, however. In general, more populated cities have more high-rises than smaller cities, due to a relative the scarcity of land and a greater demand for housing. However, some cities such as Quebec City and Halifax have fewer high-rise buildings due to several factors: a focus on historic preservation, height restrictions, and lower growth rates. In middle-sized cities with a relatively low population density, such as Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, or Hamilton, there are more apartment towers but they are greatly outnumbered by single-family houses. Most of the largest residential towers in Canada are found in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver‚Äîthe country's most densely populated cities. Toronto contains the second largest concentration of high-rise apartment buildings in North America (after New York). In Canada, like in other New World countries, but unlike Western Europe, most high-rise towers are located in the city centre (or \\"downtown\\"), where smaller, older buildings were demolished to make way in redevelopment schemes. United States In the United States, tower blocks are commonly referred to as \\"midrise\\" or \\"highrise apartment buildings\\", depending on their height, while buildings that house fewer flats (apartments), or are not as tall as the tower blocks, are called \\"lowrise apartment buildings\\". Specifically, \\"midrise\\" buildings are as tall as the streets are wide, allowing 5 hours of sunlight on the street. Some of the first residential towers were the Castle Village towers in Manhattan, New York City, completed in 1939. Their cross-shaped design was copied in towers in Parkchester and Stuyvesant Town residential developments. The government's experiments in the 1960s and 70s to use high-rise apartments as a means of providing the housing solution for the poor broadly resulted in failure. Made in the tower in the park style, all but a few high-rise housing projects in the nation's largest cities, such as Cabrini‚ÄìGreen and Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, Penn South in Manhattan, and the Desire projects in New Orleans, fell victim to the \\"ghettofication\\" and are now being torn down, renovated, or replaced. Another example is the former Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe complex in St. Louis, torn down in the 1970s. In contrast to their public housing cousins, commercially developed high-rise apartment buildings continue to flourish in cities around the country largely due to high land prices and the housing boom of the 2000s. The Upper East Side in New York City, featuring high-rise apartments, is the wealthiest urban neighborhood in the United States. Currently, the tallest residential building in the world is 432 Park Avenue located in Midtown Manhattan, having a height of 1,396 feet with the highest occupied floor at 1,287 feet. =Oceania= Housing commission towers in Waterloo, Sydney, Australia High-rise living in Australia was limited to the Sydney CBD until the 1960s, when a short-lived fashion saw public housing tenants located in new high-rise developments, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The buildings pictured along with four other 16-story blocks were constructed on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy and were available to sailors and their families for accommodation. Due to social problems within these blocks the Navy left and the Department of Housing took charge and flats were let to low income and immigrant families. During the 1980s many people escaping communism in Eastern bloc countries were housed in these buildings. Developers have enthusiastically adopted the term \\"apartment\\" for these new high-rise blocks, perhaps to avoid the stigma still attached to housing commission flats. Streets in the sky \\"Street in the sky\\" at Park Hill Streets in the sky is a style of architecture that emerged in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s. Generally built to replace run-down terraced housing, the new designs included not only modern improvements such as inside toilets, but also shops and other community facilities within high-rise blocks. Examples of the buildings and developments are Trellick Tower, Balfron Tower, Robin Hood Gardens and Keeling House in London, Hunslet Grange in Leeds and Park Hill, Sheffield, and Castlefields and Southgate Estate, Runcorn. These were an attempt to develop a new architecture, differentiated from earlier large housing estates, such as Quarry Hill flats in Leeds.Quarry Hill at BBC Online Alison and Peter Smithson were the architects of Robin Hood Gardens. Another large example, the Aylesbury Estate in South London, built in 1970, is about to be demolished.Demolition of the Aylesbury Estate: a new dawn for Hell's waiting room?, The Times, 20 October 2008 The Hulme Crescents in Manchester were the largest social housing scheme in Europe when built in 1972 but lasted just 22 years. The Crescents had one of the worst reputations of any British social housing schemes and were marred by numerous design and practical problems.Parkinson-Bailey, p.195 The ideal of Streets in the Sky often did not work in practice. Unlike an actual city street, these walkways were not thoroughfares and often came to a dead end multiple storeys above the ground. They lacked a regular flow of passers-by that could act as a deterrent to crime and disorder. This was the concept of \\"eyes on the street\\" described by Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Furthermore, the walkways and especially the stairwells could not be seen by anyone elsewhere. The Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseille provides a more successful example of the concept, with the fifth floor walkway including a shop and caf√©. Deck access Deck access is a type of flat that is accessed from a walkway that is open to the elements, as opposed to flats that are accessed from fully enclosed internal corridors. Deck access blocks of flats are usually fairly low-rise structures. The decks can vary from simple walkways, which may be covered or uncovered, to decks wide enough for small vehicles. The best known example of deck-access flats in the UK is Park Hill, Sheffield, where the decks are wide enough to allow electric vehicles; however, the design is inspired by French Modernist architect Le Corbusier, particularly his Unite D'Habitation in Marseilles.BBC 'English Heritage' documentary about Park Hill flats. Green tower blocks Salford tower blocks in 2001. In the UK, tower blocks were mostly built between the 1950s and 70s. Green tower blocks have some scheme of living plants or green roofs or solar panels on their roofs or incorporate other environmentally friendly design features.

This \\"inner\\" book has nine chapters. According to the text, the first seven chapters were abridged by the prophet Mormon and the last two by his son Moroni. These men were given a sacred charge to observe the destruction of their people for their wickedness and failure to repent; and to record their observations on metal plates which would be hidden until the Lord would reveal them to the world at a future time. The book thus explains the alleged provenance of the Book of Mormon as an ancient record, mostly of the Nephites, compiled by Mormon and Moroni on golden plates.  Narrative  =Early life= Ammaron comes to Mormon when he is ten years old, because Ammaron judges him to be a serious child who was very intelligent. He tells Mormon that when he will be 24 years old, he must to go to the land of Antum and to the hill Shim, where he can find all the plates which Ammaron buried. He is supposed to take only the plates of Nephi but leave the other plates in the ground. Then he is to keep a journal of the doings of his people on the plates of Nephi. When Mormon is 11, his father Mormon takes him south to the land of Zarahemla. Mormon finds that land to be completely covered with buildings and people. He witnesses a war between the Nephites and Lamanites along the borders of Zarahemla. The Lamanites are beaten by a force of 30,000 Nephites, then they withdraw and there is peace for four years. There is so much wickedness among the Nephites that Jesus Christ orders a recall of his three glorified disciples, and their work of miraculous healing comes to an end. But Mormon himself receives the Holy Spirit because of the soberness of his mind. He wants to become a preacher, but his mouth is stopped shut by God due to the wilful rebellion of the Nephites. There are robbers among the Lamanites who roam the land, causing the Nephites to bury their worldly goods in the earth, but the land is cursed, and it will not securely hold their valuables. =Leader of the armies= When war comes again between the Nephites and Lamanites in AD 327, Mormon is appointed the leader of their armies because he is large in stature, despite being only 16 years old. But the Lamanite armies are so great that Mormon's armies will not fight, and they began a retreat toward the north. There they take possession of the city of Angola and fortify it to defend against the Lamanites. But it is still not enough, and they are driven by their enemies out of the city and out of the land of David. Then Mormon's army comes to the land of Joshua and try to make a stand, with the western sea hard by. The Lamanite king Aaron comes against Mormon's 42,000 with 44,000 of his own men, and is defeated in battle. This occurs in AD 331. Finally it dawns on the Nephites that they cannot keep their own property on account of the robbers and the cursed land, and there arises a great lamentation. Mormon hopes that they will now turn back to the Lord and receive his blessings again, but his hope is in vain, because they are not sorrowful for their sins, but sorrowful for their lost property. The Nephites are pursued by the Lamanites to the land of Jashon before Mormon can get them to stop and make another stand. The city of Jashon, by coincidence, is near the place where Ammaron told Mormon to dig up the plates of Nephi, which Mormon promptly did. Fourteen years prior, Ammaron told Mormon to dig up only the plates of Nephi and update them with the current doings of the Nephites. But Mormon has seen nothing but wickedness and abominations around him all his life, so he makes an account of them on the plates of Nephi and they end up in the hill of Cumorah. But only a brief summary of their wickedness is recorded on the plates that Joseph Smith translated. Nephi records that besides much theft there was murder and divine cursing in the land. The Nephites boast in their strength and make oaths. They fight without asking God for help. Mormon says they were doing abominations too, but we have no record of what that entailed. The Nephites are again hunted until they come northward to the land of Shem and fortify the city there. Mormon inspires the people at last stand to boldly and fight for their wives and children and hearth and home. It seems to work, for they did not shrink back when the Lamanites attack Shem. Mormon's army of thirty thousand defeats a Lamanite army of fifty thousand.

The population was 4,075 at the 2010 census. This city is surrounded by the city of Southfield. The I-696 / Reuther Freeway goes through nearly the east‚Äìwest center of town, and Southfield Road goes nearly through the north‚Äìsouth center. The Southfield Town Center, formerly known as the Prudential Town Center, is within walking distance of the southwest corner of the city. History Louise Lathrup Kelley The city of Lathrup Village is an outgrowth of the development known as Lathrup Townsite, the dream of its developer Louise Lathrup Kelley. In 1923 she purchased a tract of in Southfield Township, in southern Oakland County, and proceeded to plat a residential neighborhood that encompasses the city of . Lathrup Townsite was conceived as a controlled community with rigorous standards, including houses built only of masonry construction; early integration of attached garages; as well as established minimums for construction cost to ensure quality (source: City of Lathrup Village). As the community developed, Mrs. Kelley implemented numerous innovative directives, including operating a shuttle service to local shopping areas, and allowing the financing of automobiles as part of the financing of houses, which created a stronger connection between the relatively isolated townsite and more established suburbs, as well as the city of Detroit. Mr. Charles Kelley, who had been a real estate writer for the Detroit News, assisted his wife in bringing talented architects to the community to design many of the custom homes that are features of the community. The City of Lathrup Village was incorporated in 1953 as the first incorporated community in Southfield Township. The residents thwarted an attempt by township residents to include Lathrup Townsite in their planned incorporation of the city of Southfield, resulting in Southfield's incorporation being delayed until 1958. Louise Lathrup Kelley played an active role in the new city until her death in 1963, after which her remaining real estate holdings in the city were sold and developed. =Lathrup Village Historic District= In 1998 much of Lathrup Village was included in the Lathrup Village Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=0 The district includes approximately 1,200 properties, primarily residential, that reflect characteristic housing styles from the first half of the 20th century. These include Colonial Revival, Tudor and ranch houses. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office: ‚ÄúThe district possesses a strong geometric street pattern integrated with curvilinear patterns that provide a rural character. This layering of patterns produces octagonal, circular and semi-circular focal points and a series of small triangular parks scattered throughout the district. It also creates unique and changing perspectives, as views of significant buildings suddenly appear at surprising moments. Likewise, at the uniquely configured intersections of many streets, one is met with a new perspective as suddenly several sections of the district become visible.‚Äù The developer of the district was Louise Lathrup Kelley. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office ‚ÄúAs a woman acting as developer starting in the 1920s, she was essentially alone, however her dogged persistence and insistence on quality resulted in a unique community that was the summation of her career.‚Äù  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The township consists solely of the Brookland Farms #1 subdivision and is served by the Northville 48167 ZIP Code. Students within Novi Township attend Northville Public Schools.  History  Novi Township was organized in 1832 from Farmington Township. The name was offered by resident Dr. J.C. Emery, at the suggestion of his wife. Residents were reportedly looking for a shorter name than Farmington. Several popular but historically inaccurate explanations have been suggested for the origin of the name Novi. One version is that it was named after the 6th tollgate on the Grand River toll road (No. VI). However, the township was named in 1832 and the toll road wasn't constructed until the 1850s. A similar claim is made about the township being stop number 6 on the railroad. However, the railroad was not constructed through the township until 1870 - 1871, almost 40 years after it was named.On the name Novi in History of Oakland County Michigan a narrative account of its historic progress, its people, its principal interests / compiled from the official records of the county, the newspapers and data of personal interviews, under the editorial supervision of Thaddeus D.

The majority of the township incorporated first as the Village of Novi in 1958 and later into the City of Novi in 1969. Before the incorporation of the Village of Novi, the northwest portion of the township was incorporated as part of the Village of Wixom, which later incorporated as the City of Wixom. Portions of the township were annexed into the Village of Northville in the early 1900s (the Oakwood Subdivision north of Baseline Road) and the City of Northville in the 1950s. In the 1970s, several areas of the township which had been detached from the Village of Novi were annexed into the City of Novi following a long legal battle between the city and township.http://northvillehistory.org/dtSearch/DTSearch/NorthvilleRecord/1981-1990S/1982-12-15-0014.pdf These areas include the Hometown Novi Mobile Home Park and land that now includes portions of Chase Farm subdivision, Maples of Novi, and Island Lake of Novi. Some of the legal disputes over the annexations were not resolved until 1984.  Political  The remaining area of the township is a legally separate entity from the surrounding City of Novi and has all the powers granted under Michigan state law to general law townships. The township has no township hall and township board meetings and township elections are held at the homes of the township board members. Most of the township services are provided through contracts with the City of Novi including fire protection and library services. The historic township hall was once located on the west side of Novi Road, south of Grand River Avenue. Moved to the civic center campus in the late 1980s, the building was restored by volunteers. The historic township hall is currently located on Ten Mile Road in the City of Novi, just west of the Novi Public Library and adjacent to the site of the former historic Fuerst Farmstead. The historic township hall is owned by the City of Novi. , the Township Supervisor is John Juntunen (elected 2004).Novi Township, politicalgraveyard.com.

As of the 2010 census, the population of Oak Park was 29,319. As a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Oak Park shares its southern border with the city of Detroit. History This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in 1840, but remained sparsely populated for many decades following. The first major housing development was constructed in 1914 at the time of World War I, when the township sold land to the Majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision.Bernadine Schoults, The History of Royal Oak, 1955 The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3, 1927. Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing \\"excessively high cost of village government,\\" failed in 1931 and 1933. The village incorporated as a city on October 29, 1945 following the end of World War II. Stimulated by the GI Bill which aided veterans in buying new housing, highways to improve commuting, and planned developments in the late 1950s, Oak Park from 1950 to 1960 was named as \\"America's Fastest Growing City\\". Its population increased sevenfold, from 5,000 to more than 36,000. Much of its population was second and third-generation children of European immigrants who had settled in Detroit in the early 20th century. These included many Jewish Americans descended from immigrant ancestors from the Russian Empire, including present-day Poland and Ukraine. Major civic improvements in this period included construction of an outdoor swimming pool and an ice rink in Major Park (now known as Shepherd Park, after former mayor David Shepherd, but long known informally as Oak Park Park). In 1995, Detroit- based window manufacturer WeatherGard moved its headquarters to Oak Park. In 2002 and 2004, the city annexed portions of neighboring Royal Oak Township to expand its land and tax base. On November 8, 2011, the citizens of Oak Park elected a new mayor, Marian McClellan. She was the city's first new mayor in 22 years, replacing the long-serving Jerry Naftaly. In April 2015, the city approved the development of a new FedEx distribution center which will be located on a 60-acre plot of land at the site of the former Detroit Artillery Armory. On May 5, 2015, the citizens of Oak Park voted to allow mixed drinks to be sold at businesses within city limits, in addition to beer and wine, which were previously allowed.

Education Oak Park's educational history began with the Clinton School, a one-room schoolhouse on property donated by Barney Clinton in the early 20th century. As the population grew rapidly, Clinton School was expanded and more elementary schools were built, particularly beginning in the 1950s. Clinton School was made a junior high school and another was built in the mid-1960s, then named for the poet Robert Frost. At that time, one school in Oak Park had a special education department for children with learning disabilities: Lessenger Elementary School on Albany St. at Sunset St. Consequently, many families with such special children gravitated to the neighborhood surrounding Lessenger, creating a \\"cluster\\" of such families rarely found elsewhere. Educational achievement was the long consistent pattern in Oak Park. Over 85% of Oak Park High School graduates continued their education immediately after high school, whether in college, or in trade or vocational schools. In the 1950s and 1960s the school system was renowned statewide due to the efforts of progressive and dedicated teachers and community support which liberally allocated tax dollars to fund education through voter approved bond issues. The high school had an average score of 3.8 on the state's MEAP test in 2011. This was one of the lowest scores in Oakland County. Students residing between 10 Mile Rd. and 11 Mile Rd. are in the Berkley School District. A square mile on the east end of Oak Park is in the neighboring Ferndale School District; the majority of the city is in Oak Park Schools. Controversy In July 2011 the City of Oak Park charged Julie Bass, a homeowner, for growing vegetables in her front yard. The vegetables were tomatoes, zucchinis, and peppers.Vegetable garden brings criminal charges\\", ABC News, July 2011 In March 2015, Stephanie Sumner and Michael Sumner were fired from their positions as city employees after the city had discovered that they had stolen $433,000 from the city over the course of two years. Several months after the story broke, the city announced that the stolen funds had been replaced through the city's insurance policy. However, many residents voiced their concerns regarding the potential insurance rate hikes that would occur after insurance claims to replace the stolen money.

Oakland Township is less densely populated than neighboring townships to the west, south, and east; and retains many elements of a rural, wooded residential bedroom community.

To this end township officials are attempting to restore water to the water wheel at the current old mill site and draw small retail businesses to the area. Former Communities: *Oakland (also known as Kline Settlement and Alert) is located within the township at Stoney Creek and Rochester Roads. This was the original settlement in the township. In its prime it had two churches and a school house. It contained the first post office in the township as well. It is now a Ghost town with only a graveyard left in the area where the town once stood. The town was established in 1822 when the post office was built. In 1894 the town changed names from Oakland to Alert and in 1902 the Alert post office closed its doors. The Paint Creek Methodist Church was moved from this town to Goodison somewhere in the 1870s. This is the last remaining building of the town. With the construction on the Michigan Central Railway which established Goodison Station, the town of Oakland was bypassed and this led to its ultimate fate. History Oakland Township has the distinction of being one of the Michigan's oldest townships, and was first named in surveys using the guidelines set by the Land Ordinance of 1785. A General Land Office opened in 1818, bringing the first permanent settlers to the area. It was one of the original 25 townships in the Territory of Michigan when counties were further divided into townships in 1827. Township boundaries and area (36 sq mi) were finalized in 1837 when Michigan gained statehood.http://www.oaklandtownshiphistoricalsociety.org/OT%20Brief%20History.htm A grist mill and mill race was built on Paint Creek in 1835. Later named Goodison Mill, it operated for more than 100 years before being dismantled in the late 1940s. The former site of the mill is the current location of Paint Creek Cider Mill. Goodison Station was a flag station built in 1872 on the Detroit and Bay City Railroad. Another branch of track served the Detroit United Railway. In 1926, a head-on collision between a passenger train and freight train near the Goodison depot resulted in one death and 37 injuries.http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Wrecks/ICCReports/MCRR- GoodisonMI-1926.pdf Passenger service on the lines had ceased by 1950. Paint Creek Trail opened in 1983 as the first rail trail in Michigan.http://www.paintcreektrail.org/ The trail is in the right-of-way of the former Detroit and Bay City Railroad, Michigan Central Railroad and Penn Central Railroad lines; linking the village of Lake Orion with the city of Rochester and passing through the unincorporated village of Goodison. The original rail line was in service until the track was removed when Penn Central's railroad operations were taken over by Conrail in 1976 The property was purchased by the trail commission representing local governments in 1983 for $450,000.http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/trailNRT/PaintCreek- MI.html Oakland Township is one possible location of the final resting place of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who has been missing since 1975.

Government Oakland Township is a Charter township. Similar to a civil township found elsewhere in the United States, a charter township in Michigan is unique in that it is exempt from annexation by neighboring cities and carries home rule responsibility. The township provides clerk, building, park, and firefighting services. Library service is provided under contract by nearby Rochester Hills Public Library. The township is primarily governed by: * Board of Trustees (7 elected members) * Park Commission (7 elected members) * Planning Commission (7 appointed members) * Zoning Board of Appeals (5 appointed members) * Historical District Commission (7 appointed members) The Board of Trustees is responsible for the hire of a Township Manager (similar to a city manager) who manages the day-to- day operations of the local government. Dale Stuart is the township manager.http://www.oaklandtownship.org/township_departments/township_manager.php All of these groups have regular meetings that are open to the public and documented with written minutes and videotape available at the township website. Police protection for the township is provided through a contract with the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, who also provides emergency dispatch services. Fire protection and emergency medical services is provided by the Oakland Township Fire Department - a \\"combination\\" fire department primarily staffed by paid-on-call personnel and one full-time firefighter/paramedic at each fire station. The Oakland Township Fire Department is an advanced life support transporting agency that responds to approximately 900 calls/year, with a majority being medical emergencies.

It is located among metropolitan Detroit's affluent northern suburbs. The population was 3,436 at the 2010 census. The village is entirely within Oxford Charter Township. The village occupies one square mile and is both politically and geographically a part of the township. The village calls itself sister city to Oxford, England. Oxford is located roughly from Flint and from Detroit. History Washington Street, 1922 During the early 19th century the northeast Oakland County area was largely avoided by the early settlers because it was believed to be nothing but impenetrable swamp land. The area was, at that time, nicknamed \\"The Barren Plains of Oxford.\\" It was called this primarily because of a report made in 1812 by the U.S. Surveyor General that described the area as a poor, barren, sandy land, on which scarcely any vegetation could grow with the exception of some very small scrubby oaks. It was concluded in the surveyors' report that there was one acre out of one hundred that appeared to be eligible for cultivation. Any hope for crop production was thought to be preposterous. At this point, the area was deemed worthless, and discouragement of any hope for development by forthcoming settlers was inevitable. Purchase of public land in what is now called Oxford was in 1823 by a man named Elbridge G. Deming. Soon after, the first person to settle in Oxford was a wolf trapper named Avery Brown. He made use of the land and gave some credibility to its value. It wasn't long after that the first area post office was officially established in what was then known as Demingsburgh on May 2, 1834. Five years later, the name was officially changed to Oxford on January 15, 1839. Elbridge D. Deming was the first postmaster for Oxford, as the post office was located in his log home near the intersection of M-24 and Metamora Road. At that time, the mail was brought from Rochester once a week by a man named Mr. Hubbard who walked the distance to ensure, what was at that time, considered as prompt delivery of the mail. A few years later the delivery time was drastically cut by another man named Mr. Rose. The route was given to him as he would use his horse and cart instead of walking like his predecessor, thus expediting the delivery time tenfold.

Between 1810 and the early 1820s, numerous settlers visited the Oxford area, primarily to hunt and trap. The first documented sale of public land in this area was recorded in 1823 to Elbridge Deming, who later built a log cabin on land in section 9 (in the area of M-24 and Metamora Road) of the township, around the spring of 1832. Oxford Township was not officially created until after Michigan became a state in 1837. It was originally part of Oakland Township, as were Addison Township and Orion Township; Oxford Township was split away and separately organized in 1837. The 1830s saw an influx of settlers to the area, originally known as Demingsburgh, Demings Corners, and Oxford Corners, before becoming known as Oxford in 1836. The family names of many early settlers to the area are evident today in names of streets and buildings, such as Powell, Hovey, Burdick, and Axford. New residents continued the trek to Oxford Township, many settling in sections 22 and 27 of what was to become the village of Oxford in 1876. Along with residents came commerce and industry. A downtown area was built in the village, but much of the area south of Burdick Street and west of Washington Street burned to the ground in 1878. When rebuilt, most of the buildings were of brick and masonry construction and are still in use today. The 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s found Oxford a prospering commercial center, with such businesses as Oxford Carriage Factory, Oxford Machine Works, Oxford Valley Mills, Oxford Brewery and several furniture and cabinetry shops. In addition to the village of Oxford, two other smaller communities developed in other areas of the township. The first developed near Baldwin and Oakwood roads, on the boundary with Brandon Township; the community of Oakwood reached a population of nearly 200 people by 1876 with a foundry and \\"the usual shops and stores\\". A railroad station and facilities were necessary near the northern edge of the township, and so the second community, Thomas, was developed. The place was platted by John Thomas in 1871. Thomas had a store, hotel, grain elevator and gristmill by the late 1870s. Thomas and Oakwood continued to prosper until May 1896, when they were largely devastated by a monster tornado which traveled across the entire north end of Oakland County. The tornado killed 41 people and injured 46 others in northern Oakland and southern Lapeer counties. Seventeen of the fatalities were in the northern portion of Oxford Township, from the Oakwood village area to Thomas. While many of the homes in Oakwood and Thomas were rebuilt, the two communities were never again centers of commerce. Railroads were largely responsible for change and continued growth in the Oxford area. No longer isolated from Detroit, and now joined with communities to the north, Oxford's commerce thrived. In addition to its businesses and factories, agriculture was a mainstay for the community. At one time in the 1880s, Oxford earned the nickname, Bagatown, from the large number of rutabagas shipped out by train. The early 1880s saw a second railroad constructed from the Pontiac area, through Oxford to Port Austin. Known as the Pontiac, Oxford, and Port Austin Railroad, or P.O. and P.A., it later became the Pontiac, Oxford, and Northern (P.O. and N.), and finally the Grand Trunk Western Railroad. With the expansion of the second rail line through town, it now became possible to travel to the tip of Michigan's thumb in one day. By 1900, a third, all electric powered passenger rail line known as the Detroit United Railway (D.U.R.) was extended through Oxford from Detroit to Flint and was noted for maintaining limited cars daily, both north and southbound. Over the years, the D.U.R. was involved in many collisions with automobiles, often resulting in death or injury to those whose automobiles tangled with the interurban cars at grade crossings. As automobile transportation became more reliable and roads improved, a growing percentage of the populace chose to travel by these means, forcing the demise of the D.U.R. in 1931.

Notable people One of the most recognizable voices throughout the nation in the 1940s and 1950s was that of Brace Beemer, the radio voice of the Lone Ranger. Beemer lived in Oxford Township on a 300-acre ranch on Drahner Road. There is a street named for him in the southwest part of the township, where he lived. His collection of Lone Ranger items is on display in the Northeast Oakland Historical Museum in Oxford.

The population was 2,526 at the 2010 census. Located along the Woodward Corridor and Interstate 696, Pleasant Ridge is a northern suburb of Metro Detroit and is about north of the city of Detroit. With a land area of , Pleasant Ridge is the fifth-smallest city by land area in the state of Michigan after the cities of Sylvan Lake, Keego Harbor, Petersburg, and Clarkston. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History Pleasant Ridge began with the subdivision of the Mayday farm by Burt Taylor in 1913. It incorporated as a village in 1921 and as a city in 1927. On December 1, 2009, the Pleasant Ridge City Council approved plans for the city's first bar. Pleasant Ridge had previously been a dry community. The city is named after the slight ridge that ran through the city. One of Pleasant Ridge's most popular landmarks was Hedge's Wigwam, a Native American-themed cafeteria-style restaurant which was located at 10 Mile and Woodward from 1927 until 1967. Pleasant Ridge was actively involved in disputing the construction of Interstate 696. =Same-sex households= Pleasant Ridge is bordered on the south by the city of Ferndale, which is considered the center of the LGBT community in the Metro Detroit region. The city of Pleasant Ridge is among the top cities in the nation with same-sex households, with at least 60 per 1,000 according to figures from the United States Census Bureau. A study by the Williams Institute from the University of California, Los Angeles recorded 59.55 same-sex couples for every 1,000 households in the city of Pleasant Ridge, while the state as a whole ranked low with only 5.6 for every 1,000 households. However, the study did not record the number of gay people, only the number of same-sex households. The study listed Pleasant Ridge as having the highest same-sex household ratio in the state, ahead of Ferndale with 35.0 same-sex couples for every 1,000 households. These numbers rank Pleasant Ridge as having the seventh-highest same-sex household ratio in the nation. Cities in the nation within a higher ratio include Provincetown, Massachusetts; Wilton Manors, Florida; Palm Springs, California; Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; Guerneville, California; and West Hollywood, California.  Government  Pleasant Ridge is governed by a city commission consisting of a mayor and four city commissioners. The current mayor of Pleasant Ridge is Kurt Metzger. Current city commissioners are Amanda Wahl, Chris Budnik, Ann Perry and Bret Scott.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 59,515. A northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Pontiac is about northwest of Detroit. Founded in 1818, Pontiac is notably the second European-American organized settlement in Michigan in close proximity to Detroit, second only to Dearborn. It was named after Pontiac, a war chief of the Ottawa people, who had occupied the area before the European-American settlers. The city was best known for its General Motors automobile manufacturing plants of the 20th century, which were the basis of its economy and contributed to the wealth of the region. These included Fisher Body, Pontiac East Assembly (a.k.a. Truck & Coach/Bus), which manufactured GMC products, and the Pontiac Motor Division. In the city's heyday, it was the site of the primary automobile assembly plant for the production of the famed Pontiac cars, a brand that was named after the city. The Pontiac itself was discontinued in 2010 by General Motors. The City of Pontiac also was home to Oakland Motor Car Company, which was acquired by General Motors in 1909. In 1975, the city built the Pontiac Silverdome, the stadium that hosted the Detroit Lions of the National Football League from 1975 to 2001, when the team returned to Downtown Detroit at Ford Field. Super Bowl XVI was played at the Silverdome in 1982. After 2001, the stadium continued to be used for concerts and other events until it was demolished in 2018.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.58%) is water. Pontiac is bounded by the city of Auburn Hills to the east and north, the city of Lake Angelus to the north, Waterford Township to the west, and Bloomfield Township to the south. The former Pontiac Township included what are now the cities of Pontiac, Lake Angelus, and Auburn Hills. The township incorporated as the city of Auburn Hills in 1983. Although the township no longer exists as a civil entity, it is still used as a survey township for land use purposes.  Demographics  As of 2000 the median income for a household in the city was $31,207, and the median income for a family was $36,391. Males had a median income of $31,961 versus $24,765 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,842.

History  Pontiac State Hospital in 1912 Oak Hill Cemetery Early European expeditions into the land north of Detroit described the area as having \\"extreme sterility and barrenness\\".Geer, Curtis M. (1904). The Louisiana Purchase and the Westward Movement, p. 291. George Barrie & Sons. Developments and exploration were soon to prove that report false. The first European-American settlers arrived in what is now the city of Pontiac in 1818. Two years later the fledgling settlement was designated as the county seat for Oakland County. The Pontiac Company, consisting of 15 members and chaired by Solomon Sibley of Detroit, comprised the first landowners in Pontiac. Sibley, along with Stephen Mack and Shubael Conant, Pontiac Company members, also formed the partnership Mack, Conant & Sibley to develop a town. Solomon and his wife Sarah Sibley largely financed construction of the first buildings. While Solomon was the first chair of the Pontiac Company, for two years Sarah Sibley was the most active as the go-between with settlers at Pontiac. Solomon Sibley was constantly traveling as a Territorial Congressman and later a Territorial Supreme Court judge.Deed, \\"Mill Privilege,\\" Oakland County, MI; Letter Sarah Sibley to Solomon, 1822, Sibley manuscript files, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library In the 1820s Elizabeth Denison, an unmarried, free black woman, worked for the Sibleys. They helped her buy land in Pontiac in 1825. Stephen Mack, agent for the Pontiac Company, signed the deed at the request of the Sibleys, conveying 48.5 acres to Elizabeth Denison. She is believed to be the first black woman to purchase land in the new territory of Michigan.Lisette, Swan, Elizabeth 1965; deeds, Oakland County, Michigan; Original Pontiac Company minutes, Pontiac Public Library In 1837 Pontiac became a village, the same year that Michigan gained statehood.Acts of the Legislature of the State of Michigan Passed at the Annual Session of 1837, p. 133. Detroit: John S. Bagg, State Printer The town had been named after the noted Ottawa Indian war chief who had his headquarters in the area decades before, during the resistance to European- American encroachment.Clark, Charles F. (1863). Michigan State Gazetteer and Business Directory, p. 443. Founded on the Clinton River, Pontiac was Michigan's first inland settlement.Fuller, George Newman (1916). Economic and Social Beginnings of Michigan, p. 490. Wynkoop Hallenbeck Crawford Co. Rivers were critical to settlements as transportation ways, in addition to providing water and, later, power. The village was incorporated by the legislature as a city in 1861. From the beginning, Pontiac's central location served it well. It attracted professional people, including doctors and lawyers, and soon became a center of industry. Woolen and grist mills made use of the Clinton River as a power source. Abundant natural resources led to the establishment of several carriage manufacturing companies, all of which were thriving at the turn of the 20th century. At that time, the first self-propelled vehicles were introduced. Pontiac quickly became a capital of the new automotive industry.Seeley, Thaddeus D. (1912). History of Oakland County, Michigan, Vol. I, pp. 323, 327‚Äì31. The Lewis Publishing Company. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Pontiac had tremendous growth in its population and size as tens of thousands of prospective autoworkers moved here from the South to work in its GM auto assembly plants at Pontiac Assembly. African Americans came in the Great Migration, seeking work, education, and the chance to vote and escape the oppression of Jim Crow in the South. Houses in the Fairgrove Avenue Historic District As the small \\"horseless carriage\\" manufacturers became consolidated under the mantle of the General Motors Corporation, Pontiac grew as the industry grew. It also suffered the same setbacks as other cities during the Great Depression years of the 1930s.Lewis, Pierce. \\"America Between the Wars: The Engineering of a New Geography.\\" In McIlwraith, Thomas F. & Muller, Edward K., eds. (2nd ed. 2001), North America: The Historical Geography of a Changing Continent, p. 384. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. The buildup of the defense industry and conversion of the automotive industry to war demands increased the need for labor. The first postwar years after World War II were a time of prosperity, but the city changed as suburbs were developed and people commuted by car to work. The more established residents moved out to buy newer housing being built in the suburbs, draining off business and resulting in vacancies downtown. In order to prevent flooding, Pontiac confined the Clinton River in concrete through the downtown in 1963. Changing ideas about urban living in the early 21st century prompted the city to study uncovering the river to create a waterfront community in the city. In late 1966, Pontiac-born real estate developer A. Alfred Taubman tried to build a large-scale shopping mall on vacant downtown land (where the Phoenix Center now stands). It was unsuccessful. Pontiac resident C. Don Davidson and his University of Detroit architectural class created a more comprehensive plan for development to benefit the city and the entire region around it. In 1969, the city of Pontiac adopted the Pontiac Plan as the official plan for rebuilding the vacant area of the downtown district. The Pontiac Silverdome in 2006 In 1965, Davidson overheard news that the Detroit Lions were seeking a new football stadium in Southeast Michigan. Professor Davidson and city leaders made a push to develop a new multi-purpose stadium, which was built and became known as the Silverdome. Construction began on the 80,000-seat stadium in 1972 and it opened in 1975 as the Pontiac Metropolitan Stadium. This was a part of Davidson's vision for Pontiac. Besides becoming the new home stadium of the NFL's Detroit Lions, NBA's Detroit Pistons and USFL's Michigan Panthers, the arena hosted such events as the 1979 NBA All- Star Game, the 1982 Super Bowl XVI game between the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals, and four matches of soccer's 1994 World Cup. Construction began in the 1970s on an urban renewal project known as the \\"Pontiac Plan\\". The initial phase of this plan included the Phoenix Center, three office buildings, a transportation center, and a high-rise residential complex. The remainder of the plan was never completed. The city has struggled with declining population since 1980, due to industrial restructuring and the loss of jobs, especially in the automotive industry. =Emergency financial manager= From 2009 through 2013, Pontiac was under the oversight of an Emergency Financial Manager appointed by the state government. The Emergency Manager was authorized to make day-to-day executive and financial municipal decisions. The position was not subject to the usual checks and balances, nor to election. The first and second managers, Fred Leeb and Michael Stampfler, were appointed by Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. The third manager was Louis Schimmel, who was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder. In order to balance the budget, state-appointed emergency managers drastically revised labor union contracts with the city, sold off city assets such as parking meters, and privatized most public services. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office handles all police (saving $2 million a year) and nearby Waterford township has responsibility for fire protection (saving $3 million). Pontiac sold its water treatment plant for $55 million, and outsources garbage collection, animal control, vital records and street maintenance. Many people working in City Hall are employed by contractors. The city payroll has declined from 600 to 50 employees. The Silverdome Stadium, once valued at $22 million, was sold for $583,000 (it would end up being demolished in December 2017). The emergency managers reduced the city's annual spending to $36 million from $57 million, and erased almost all of its long-term debt. In August 2013, Schimmel resigned as Emergency Financial Manager. Schimmel now serves as part of the four-member Transition Advisory Board for the city.Lou Schimmel resigns, The Oakland Press; accessed November 5, 2014, Other members of the board include Deputy Oakland County Executive Bob Daddow, Rochester Hills Finance Director Keith Sawdon, and Ed Karyzno, administrator of the Michigan Department of Treasury's Office of Financial Responsibility. In July 2012, Mayor Leon Jukowski and Emergency Financial Manager Louis Schimmel announced plans to demolish the Phoenix Center. Its vacancy rates were high, and the city did not want to continue the high maintenance costs. New thinking about downtown was to re- emphasize the street grid; the city wanted to reconnect Saginaw Street to the downtown area. Owners of the connecting Ottawa Towers filed an injunction, claiming the demolition would devalue their property and result in lost parking. In December 2012, a judge granted an injunction for the Ottawa Towers on an \\"expedited calendar\\", which prevented the demolition of the Phoenix Center for the time being. In 2010, city leaders and business owners had launched \\"The Rise of The Phoenix\\" initiative. This plan was intended to attract businesses interested in downtown retail space. The applicants selected would be given free rent in exchange for multi-year leases (two years or more) as well as one year of free parking in city lots. Some 52 new businesses were recruited to locate in downtown Pontiac, bringing new life to the city. Plans for the development of mixed-use and loft flats in downtown were announced in September 2011 by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA). MEGA estimates the development could generate $20.4 million in new investment and create up to 107 permanent full-time jobs in downtown. The development was to be supported by a state tax break. On January 26, 2012, West Construction Services began the renovation and restoration of the former Sears building for the Lafayette Place Lofts, the largest construction investment in Downtown Pontiac in approximately 30 years. The project is a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified residential and commercial mixed-use development: it will have 46 new urban rental lofts, a fresh food grocery store and caf√©, and an Anytime Fitness center. Construction was completed during 2012, and the lofts and market opened in December of that year. 10 West Lofts, another development in the area, will bring more residents to downtown Pontiac.  Culture  Regionally, the city was known for the Arts, Beats and Eats Festival, a widely attended summer festival featuring an art show, musical concert venues, and a sampling of food from numerous regional restaurants. In 2010, the festival was moved to nearby Royal Oak. The First Annual Scheme Cruise was held September 6, 2015, an event sponsored by the Scheme Street Battle League. The event combined rap battles, basketball competitions, and a car show. Pontiac officials are considering relocating the event to the downtown area of the city. The city is at the north end of the famous Woodward Avenue, which extends as a major boulevard into Detroit. It was originally lined with mansions and prestigious businesses. In the 1950s and 1960s it was popular with young people who would \\"cruise\\" and drag-race their hot-rods in the area. Pontiac participates in the annual Woodward Dream Cruise, an event celebrating Woodward's hot-rod history, with a parade of cars stretching from Detroit to Pontiac. Downtown Pontiac's nightlife includes nightclubs and music venues such as Club Visions, Tonic, and The Crofoot. The city hosts two nationally renowned haunted houses: The Realm of Darkness and Erebus. The Realm of Darkness has in previous years been chosen as America's Best Haunted House. Erebus held the world record from 2005-2009 for \\"Largest Haunted House;\\" it is 4 stories high. Pontiac was an early location of movie making, with the Raleigh Michigan Studios, renamed as the Motown Motion Picture Studios. Scenes of the 2012 remake of the film Red Dawn were filmed in Pontiac and other Michigan locations, recreating Spokane, Washington. Additionally, downtown Pontiac in August 2012 was the filming site for the tornado-themed disaster movie Into the Storm. The 2013 fantasy adventure film Oz the Great and Powerful was filmed at Motown Motion Picture Studios. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the latest movie to be filmed within the studio, with the bulk of filming taking place in Pontiac. Pontiac is home to the Michigan Fallen Heroes Memorial. It is located within the Oakland County Government Complex off Telegraph Road. Transportation =Rail= Amtrak operates passenger service with its Wolverine from Pontiac to Chicago via Detroit and Battle Creek, Michigan. Service is three times daily, both arriving and departing. Commuter rail service was once provided by Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW) and later Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) from Pontiac to downtown Detroit. This service ended on October 17, 1983, after subsidies were discontinued. Efforts continue to restore such commuter service. Class one freight rail service is provided by Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW), which also operates a large classification yard in Pontiac serving the local auto industry. The Grand Trunk Western Railroad (reporting mark GTW) is an important subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway (CN). It constitutes the majority of CN's Chicago Division (which is part of CN's Southern Region). It operates in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, forming the CN mainline from Port Huron to Chicago, as well as serving Detroit and Toledo. =Air= Oakland County International Airport serves the city and surrounding areas with commuter air service. When previously owned by the city, it was known as the Pontiac City Airport. But it is located outside the city in neighboring Waterford Township and not on land contiguous with Pontiac's city limits. =Bus= Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) operates local and regional bus transit. =Road= The major thoroughfares in the city are: Woodward Avenue (M-1), Huron Street (M-59), and Telegraph Road (US 24). Portions of Woodward Avenue were once known as \\"Saginaw Street\\" and \\"Wide Track Drive\\" (the portion of \\"Wide Track Drive\\" that encircles the downtown business district is now known as the \\"Woodward Loop\\") * provides a connection northwest to nearby Flint.

The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents. For Pontiac Library Board, nine candidates filed for the November 5, 2013 general election: Incumbents Joyce Allen, Roger Derby and Deirdre Waterman, as well as challengers Vernita Duvall, Juliene Dixon Jenkins, Ronnie Karpinski, Evelyn LeDuff, Rosie Richardson, and Deveda Travis.

The population was 12,711 at the 2010 census. It is a northern suburb of Metro Detroit. Rochester was the first European settlement in Oakland County when it was founded in 1818. It became part of the Avon Township in 1835 and incorporated as an autonomous city in 1967. It is mostly surrounded by the city of Rochester Hills and also borders Shelby Township to the east. Communities/Boroughs The city has the following neighborhoods: *Stony Creek is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester Hills. *The Bluffs is a neighborhood on the southeast corner of the city on the border with Rochester Hills. *Yates is shared with Shelby Charter Township, Macomb County and Rochester Hills. History The Western Knitting Mills, built in 1896, was owned by the Chapman brothers. The first settlers in what would become Rochester, the Graham family, built a log cabin in 1817. The cabin was located on present-day 3rd St., just west of Main. The city was named for Rochester, New York, just like Rochester, Minnesota, as many early settlers to the area were formerly from the state of New York. The city became an industrial center with abundant water power from the Clinton River and Paint Creek. The interconnected waterways are no longer used for travel or local industry, but provide natural beauty, some fishing, and a healthy portion of the Clinton Watershed. Historically, past industries formerly located in Rochester included a refinery for sugar beets, a paper products company, and the Western Knitting Mills factory, which was later adapted and utilized during World War II for incendiary production‚Äîbusinesses that no longer exist in the area. Rochester was served by two railroads as well as the Detroit United Railway, an interurban to Royal Oak and Detroit. Chapman Mill Pond, east of downtown, disappeared into the Paint Creek when the dam broke during the flood of 1946. The reclaimed land is the site of the current post office, Rochester Hills library, and Olde Towne Road. Water Street, formerly situated at the edge of the large pond, remains by its name a reminder of the pond's former existence. Michigan became the 26th state in 1837, and the Village of Rochester was formed on April 12, 1869, within the boundaries of Avon Township. By 1895, Rochester's population was 900. The village became the city of Rochester in 1967, breaking away from Avon Township. Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills in 1984, following a long court battle, where the city of Rochester annexed of Avon Township's land. It more than doubled the city of Rochester's size. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Since an annexation of a section of Avon Township (now Rochester Hills), the city has an eastern boundary that extends to the border with Macomb County. Culture The city has held the annual \\"Rochester Hometown Christmas Parade\\" since 1951. Held on the first Sunday in December, it features over 100 units. It claims to be Michigan's largest Christmas parade. In 2006, the city had its first \\"Big Bright Light Show\\" for the Christmas season. The downtown businesses were covered in 500,000 individual lights. An expansion of the program after its initial inception expanded that coverage to a reported one million lights. It was also aired by WXYZ-TV. =Architecture= Rollin Sprague Building, built in 1849. Established in 1817, Rochester was one of Oakland County's first settlements. Twenty-two buildings on Main Street are more than 50 years old, and several are on the State Register of Historic Places. * Rollin Sprague Building ‚Äì The oldest commercial building in the downtown is the Rollin Sprague building, built in 1849 of coursed cobblestone. Since 1930 it has housed \\"The Home Bakery\\". * Opera House ‚Äì The Opera House Building opened on November 8, 1890, as the social and cultural center of town. It featured movies, lectures, dances, commencements and other events until 1933. Ironically, an opera was never performed in the Opera House. Refurbished in 1987, it currently houses the Lytle Pharmacy. * Rochester Grain Elevator ‚Äì Located at the corner of University Drive and Water Street is the Rochester Grain Elevator (originally named Griggs Grain Elevator), in the form of a red barn, and built in 1880. Until the 1970s, farmers brought their grain to the elevator to be shipped to Detroit. After that time, its primary use has been as a supply store. An external restoration in the summer of 2009 worked toward returning the building to its former appearance. Royal Park Hotel opened in September 2004. *Royal Park Hotel ‚Äì In September 2004, the Royal Park Hotel, a four-diamond luxury boutique hotel, designed by Victor Saroki opened in downtown Rochester. It cost $43 million to build. Several celebrities have stayed there, including Paul McCartney, Hugh Hefner, and former President George W. Bush (while seeking re-election). * Western Knitting Mills ‚Äì The Western Knitting Mills, a large brick building on Water Street, was built in 1896. At one time, its annual output of 100,000 dozen pairs of gloves made it one of the largest glove producers in the world. Today the mill is fully restored, and home to The Rochester Mills brewery restaurant, as well as several other businesses. *RCS Administration Center is the former Rochester High School, at one point in its past serving kindergarten through graduating senior students. Built in 1889 but renovated at different times in its history, it opened as Rochester School (Avon #5), replacing an earlier school on that same site that had burned down in 1888. The property has been used for school purposes since 1847. Since the mid-1970s, the building has housed the Rochester Community Schools Board of Education offices and occasional related events, and is certainly one of the largest and noteworthy structures in the city. =Parks and recreation= The Paint Creek Trail of connects the Rochester area to the Lake Orion, Michigan area. Rotary Gateway Park in Rochester, Michigan. * Paint Creek and Clinton River Trails ‚Äì City is at the cross section of two major \\"Rails-to-Trails\\" projects: the Paint Creek Trail and Clinton River trail. These trails are used for recreational activities, like biking and walking. They connect to several major parks, including Bloomer Park, Rochester Municipal Park, Stoney Creek Metropark and the Dinosaur Hill Nature Preserve. The majority of the area used for the trails and pathways include former railroad and interurban rail lines, long since converted to non-vehicular recreational use. * Paint Creek Center for the Arts ‚Äì Paint Creek Center for the Arts is a regional non-profit art center dedicated to promoting the arts and artistic excellence through a full range of cultural programming including studio art classes for children and adults, exhibitions of emerging and established Michigan artists, outreach programs, community involvement and the annual Art & Apples Festival. * Rochester Avon Recreation Authority ‚Äì The Rochester Avon Recreation Authority (RARA) has been a recreation provider to Rochester, Rochester Hills, and Oakland Township since 1946. It provides recreation programs from 12 months to adults in a variety of areas, such as dance, sports classes, sport leagues, pre-school classes, special events, fitness, skiing, etc. *Rochester Municipal Park ‚Äì Formerly called Avon Park, is the largest park area in the city, comprising a large portion of the downtown area. Linked with the Paint Creek trail system (and including a significant portion of the creek itself), it offers a quiet, naturalized setting, easily enjoyed from its own trail system, as well as two playground areas, lighted tennis courts, an outdoor music-stage amphitheater, the Rochester Community House, and the Kiwanis Pavilion. The 'duck pond' has been used in past winters for skating. The public park is home to free annual events such as the Art & Apples Festival, the Heritage Festival, and the summer concert series (Music In The Park). Economy Rochester has a vibrant downtown shopping district. The Farmer's Market takes place every Saturday, May through October. It features fresh produce, flowers, handmade goods and other products from Michigan. Several city festivals take place in downtown: MI Earthday Festival (on Earthday weekend), Dancing in the Streets (August), Music in the Park (Thursdays in summer), Art & Apples Festival (weekend after Labor Day in September), and the Heritage Festival (Memorial Day Weekend), which includes two classic automobile shows. Other scheduled, traditional civic celebrations and activities include Girls' Night Out, the Gallery Walk, Lagniappe, the Sidewalk Sales, Movies In The Moonlight, and the two-day Fire And Ice Festival. The popular Rockin' Rods classic car show each August features hundreds of rare and unusual automobiles, both domestic and imported.

The first European settler was James Graham who arrived in 1817. Graham and his family reached the area by following trails created by the Sauk Native Americans.\\"Our Community's History.\\" Rochester Hills, MI Official Website. https://www.rochesterhills.org/index.aspx?NID=267.\\"Saginaw Trail Historic Marker.\\" Detroit: The History and Future of the Motor City. July 2009. http://www.detroit1701.org/. Avon Township was organized in 1835. Rochester incorporated as a village within the township in 1869. The township adopted a charter in 1948 under the Home Rule Act. Also in 1948 a post office was established under the name of Brooklands for the area between Auburn Road and Hamlin Road just to the west of Dequindre Road. In 1966, village residents voted to become the City of Rochester, effective in February 1967. As a result, Rochester residents no longer had to pay property taxes to the township, as it was now a separate municipality. In 1967, Avon Township filed a petition to become a city. In January 1968, township voters approved the petition to move forward with seeking city status. Three proposed city charters were voted down by residents, the first in March 1969, the second in May 1970, and the third in September 1971. The city of Rochester then sought to annex all of the township, which was unanimously denied by the Michigan Boundary Commission. In 1972, petitions were filed to consolidate Avon Township and Rochester. In April 1974, the consolidation petition lost by 350 votes in the township, while passing by four votes in Rochester. In May 1974, Rochester's petition to annex of Avon Township was approved by the Michigan Boundary Commission. The township became Avon Charter Township in August 1978. Court challenges to the 1974 annexation continued until November 1981, when the township was ordered to surrender the annexed property. In May 1984, township voters approved a city charter. On November 20, 1984, Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills. The name of the new city was put to a vote, with the other choice being \\"Avon Hills\\". The name \\"Rochester Hills\\" won by a landslide with voters, based on the area's historical ties to Rochester and the rolling hills that abound in the area. Township Supervisor Earl E. Borden became Rochester Hills' first mayor. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.27%) is water.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 57,236. The city is located along the Woodward Corridor, and Interstate 75 and Interstate 696 also pass through Royal Oak. As a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, the city is about north of the city of Detroit. Portions of the Detroit Zoo are within Royal Oak, extending into neighboring Huntington Woods. History Early Europeans in this area near Fort Detroit in the 18th century were mostly French Canadians; some traded with the Sauk, Huron, and other Native Americans in the area. After defeating France in the Seven Years' War, Great Britain took control of their territory east of the Mississippi River, including Fort Detroit and environs. After the American Revolutionary War, Britain promoted development of what was then called Upper Canada and Province of Quebec, across the Detroit and St. Clair rivers to the south and east. Royal Oak was not incorporated as a village until 1891, and as a city in 1921. It was named in 1819, during one of the surveying expeditions led by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass. A large oak tree at this small settlement reminded Cass of the story of the Royal Oak, where King Charles II of England was said to have hid to escape capture by the Roundheads after the Battle of Worcester. Cass named the settlement after that, several years after the United States had fought Great Britain across the northern border in the War of 1812. =20th century to present= Shrine of the Little Flower Royal Oak developed as a suburb of Detroit in the early 20th century, following Detroit's booming growth as a result of industrialization and its auto industry. The Royal Oak Farmers Market opened as a truck market, at the corner of 4th and Troy streets, on October 14, 1925 as a cooperative venture between the then-new City of Royal Oak and Oakland County, Michigan. There were still numerous farmers in the county. The present structure, at the corner of 11 Mile Road and Troy Street, is adjacent to the 44th District Court. It was erected in the spring of 1927 and dedicated July 1 of that year. In the 1920s, Father Charles Coughlin, a Canadian Catholic priest who relocated to Detroit, became the founding pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower, now a prominent landmark in the city. Through his ministry, he raised funds to build the present limestone church complex and tower. Initially he broadcast religious speeches from this site. During the 1930s, his broadcasts became more political. He initially supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt, then opposed him and promoted the causes of the fascist leaders of Germany and Italy. The Roosevelt administration closed down his radio operation after the outbreak of World War II, with support from the Catholic hierarchy. Coughlin had developed national political influence and had an increasingly anti-semitic message, at a time when Jewish people were being severely persecuted in Germany. The downtown originally had a typical mixture of small-scale retail and trade to serve the city of Royal Oak. With the development of the highway system in the postwar period, it lost business to suburban malls. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, Royal Oak's downtown has developed as an entertainment and nightlife destination. A number of large condominiums and lofts have been built in the area, increasing the density of the downtown population. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.08%) is water. Royal Oak developed around a river, the Red Run. Vinsetta Boulevard was built skirting a source branch of the Red Run for its median. In the 1930s, Vinsetta's entire median, along with the river and all but the tops of the bridges for the crossing streets were filled in as part of a WPA project during the Great Depression. During 1967‚Äì8, the rest of the river in Oakland County was buried within a six-foot drain pipe.

In 2006, the city's two public high schools, George A. Dondero High School and Clarence M. Kimball High School, were combined into a new Royal Oak High School. Beginning in 2007, the city's two middle schools were combined into one school, Royal Oak Middle School. The number of elementary schools was reduced to six. Some parents protested the planned closure and demolition of Longfellow and Whittier elementary schools. They were seeking to have them considered for historic district recognition by way of signed petition. Despite their efforts, both schools and a number of other former elementary schools were demolished in the fall of 2007. The Royal Oak school system gained brief notoriety for an incident following the Trump election. Some middle schoolers chanted \\"build that wall\\". A student video of the incident was widely shared on Facebook, attracting more than 4 million views within 24 hours. A week later a noose was found in the 8th grade boys bathroom at the middle school. The student who had placed the noose in the bathroom was removed from the school shortly afterward.

Fuller opened a hotel on the Detroit-Saginaw stagecoach line. A post office opened in 1832 and operated until 1888. Several lots were platted in 1840. History Springfield Township was established by the Michigan Legislature on March 2, 1836. Civil government was first organized April 3, 1837. Springfield, one of the first settlements in the area, began with a hotel along the Detroit and Saginaw Turnpike, now known as Dixie Highway. Andersonville, located at the intersection of Andersonville Road and Big Lake Road, was settled shortly thereafter in 1833, followed three years later by the hamlet of Davisburg. The Detroit and Milwaukee Railway (now part of the Canadian National Railway) was built in 1856, and two stations were in the township, in Andersonville and Davisburg. The railroad provided a major impetus to growth. Agriculture was the mainstay of the local economy and trains allowed the farmers to ship produce and live stock to market and to receive supplies and equipment. By 1860 Springfield Township's population was 1,425. In 1924, Dixie Highway was paved from Pontiac to Flint. With the decline of agriculture as a major economic activity in the township, residents began commuting to Pontiac and Flint for employment in the developing automotive factories, marking the beginning of the township's decline. By 1930, Springfield Township's population had fallen to 923. The township's decline would unexpectedly be reversed in the 1960s with the construction of Interstate 75. The accessibility provided by two interchanges accelerated residential growth in the late 1960s and 1970s. Population improved, going from 1,825 in 1950 to 2,664 in 1960, 4,388 in 1970, 6,502 in 1976, and 8,295 in 1980. Springfield Township has had a long-standing commitment to zoning and planning dating back to the early 1950s. The Township Board adopted an interim zoning ordinance in early 1952, which contained five zoning districts. In 1965 an ordinance which contained 13 different zoning districts was adopted. Planning and zoning functions were coordinated with the adoption of the township's first Master Plan in 1972 and subsequently the adoption of an entirely new zoning ordinance the following year. The 1973 ordinance serves as a basis for the current zoning ordinance. Out of concern for the residential growth during the 1970s and its effects on the entire township, the Planning Commission embarked on a comprehensive review of the Master Plan and the Zoning Map in the early 1980s. As a result, the revised Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance incorporated natural resource protection information and standards. This slowed the growth of Springfield Township during the decade, growing to 9,927 in 1990. Additional comprehensive reviews and updates were done in the early 1990s and again in 2002. The primary basis for the township‚Äôs planning, zoning and land use decisions for at least the last 20 years has been the protection and preservation of their abundant and very special natural resources. Today, Springfield Township is home to many parks, including Springfield Oaks County Park, site of the annual Oakland County Fair, and Indian Springs Metropark. The township is also home to several churches, a few schools including Springfield Christian Academy (the township's only high school) and a handful of shopping areas. The township's population, which increased by a third in the 1990s, continued to grow through the first decade of the 21st century. Springfield Township also houses a former Superfund site, The Springfield Township Dump. Springfield Township is a member of the Clarkston Area Chamber of Commerce. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.16%, is water.

The Shiawassee flows in a northwesterly direction toward Saginaw where it joins with the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River, which drains into the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. The Huron flows in a southeasterly direction and empties into Lake Erie. The Lower Huron River demarks the boundary between Wayne County and Monroe County. The Clinton flows in an easterly direction and empties into Lake St. Clair in Macomb County's Harrison Township.

Its population was 80,980 at the 2010 census, making Troy the most-populated city in the county and the 13th most-populated municipality in the state. As a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Troy is about north of the city of Detroit.

The last portion of the township incorporated as the present-day city of Troy in 1955. Troy has become a business and shopping destination in the region, with numerous office centers and the upscale Somerset Collection mall. In 2011, Troy was ranked the safest city in Michigan, as well as the 19th safest city in the nation.

History The earliest recorded purchases of land in what was known as Troy Township occurred in 1819. A couple of years later a settlement known as Troy Corners was established due to Johnson Niles buying 160 acres in the region. The area is currently the north-central area of Troy. In 1827 Troy Township was established. In 1955 Troy was officially incorporated primarily as a strategy for preventing border cities from taking more land. It was named after Troy, New York, as many of the early settlers, as in much of Michigan, originated from New York.

Located at the corners of Livernois Road and Wattles Road, the village is located behind the old city hall building. Open year-round, the village has ten original, complete structures which patrons may enter and observe how they functioned in the past and how they were decorated, as all buildings are full of artifacts from that period. Each structure is original and was painstakingly moved from its original location to the museum intact. Starting with a log and mud structure used by the first settlers, there is also an 18th-century schoolhouse and estate, a general store, a blacksmith's shop, a church along with the pastor's home, and the old city hall, which acts as a general museum. There is a gazebo in the center of the square which will host parties and period bands during annual festivities. Many schools from around the area plan field trips to the museum, and the church is also available for weddings. In the summer of 2005, to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary, ceramic beaver statues, each standing four feet (1.2 m) high, were displayed at various locations in the city. The beaver is the symbol of Troy, and the city's main commercial thoroughfare (Big Beaver Road) is named after it.

The population was 13,498 at the 2010 census. As a western suburb of Metro Detroit, Wixom is about northwest of the city of Detroit. The city was home to the now-demolished Wixom Assembly Plant, which operated from 1957‚Äì2007. The city is also home to several production and manufacturing businesses, including Trijicon, Discraft, NGK, and Majic Window. History The settlement of Wixom dates back to 1831. In the beginning, Wixom was named Sibley's Corners after the first settler, 20 year old philanthropist Alonzo Sibley. Sibley settled in what is today called Commerce Township, where he purchased approximately 80 acres of land. Over time, Sibley purchased about 350 more acres of land. In 1837 Sibley donated a portion of his property for a local cemetery; which was called South Commerce Burial Ground; however, was later changed to Wixom Cemetery. Sibley then became the president of the cemetery association. The establishment of Wixom as a place started in 1871 when Willard Clark Wixom (son of Ahijah C. Wixom and Lucy Clark) granted a right of way through his property for the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railroad. Willard platted land on both sides of the railroad near the Novi and Commerce Township border. In 1883, Willard opened his property up to become an important railroad junction to make way for the Michigan Airline Railroad Grand Trunk Western Railroad. With the new junction, Willard located the railroad station, union depot (called Wixom Station) and mail drop at the intersection of his property. The construction of the railroad junction attracted many new business investments, stores, a lumber yard and a cider mill ultimately turning this small village into Michigan's largest grain produce handling points. The name of the town was then change from Sibley's Corners to Wixom. Sadly on Christmas Eve 1901 Willard was struck and killed by a passenger train while crossing the tracks in his horse and buggy.http://www.wixomhistoricalsociety.org/wixom-history/ The village of Wixom was incorporated in the 1950s following the announcement of plans to construct the Wixom Assembly Plant in Novi Township. Prior to that time, Wixom was an unincorporated place. The village borders included portions of both Novi and Commerce Townships. Efforts by the remainder of Novi Township to incorporate as a village prompted the newly established village of Wixom to incorporate as a city. The city largely follows the borders of the village although a small area of parkland on the north side of the city was annexed from Commerce Township in the 1970s. On November 13, 1996, Gerald Atkins \\"shot his way\\" (according to eyewitness reports) into the Ford Wixom Assembly Plant plant with a CAR-15 semi-automatic rifle, eventually killing plant manufacturing manager Darrell Izzard (aged 57) in a hallway; the shooter wounded three others. Fleeing the plant, Atkins hid in storm drain tunnels while law enforcement surrounded the plant and trained their weapons from as far away as the Interstate 96 freeway. Hours later he surrendered.  Downtown development  The downtown area of the city is being developed with a new main street area on Pontiac Trail by the city offices called the Wixom Village Center. This was a $200 million project. The Village Center includes a pedestrian plaza, restaurants, and service shops. The residential development called Tribute of Wixom will contain 600 units that include ranch-style condos, town houses, and single-family homes. The project was postponed in 2008 and construction did not begin again until 2014.  Education  Most of Wixom is part of Walled Lake Consolidated Schools.\\"Street Map.\\" (Archive) City of Wixom.

Police and fire  The police station is located in the newly developing downtown area on Pontiac Trail. The Wixom Police Department was formed in 1958. Prior to 1958, Wixom received police services from the Oakland County Sheriff's Department. Wixom is protected by Fire Station #1 on North Wixom Road. The Wixom Fire Department is primarily staffed with paid on-call firefighters in addition to a full-time fire chief, fire marshal, EMT coordinator, and a fire inspector. The Wixom Firefighters are represented by the Michigan Association of Fire Fighters. In 1996, two Wixom police officers, Gary Hamlin and Martin Harp, undertook the dangerous task of apprehending and arresting Gerald Atkins (the above-mentioned Ford plant killer) as he sought refuge in a large storm drain. For their bravery and heroism they received awards and commendations, including official thanks in the form of resolutions passed by the state legislature and the National Association of Police Organizations TOP COPS award, which was given during a ceremony at the White House, conducted by president Bill Clinton.NAPO Washington Report. http://www.napo.org/napo6_nov.htm Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Hiram Hodge was the first resident of the community. He built a hotel, but later left. The Rose family, including Allan S. Rose, his father and two brothers, came from New York State in 1875. They built a general store with space for a post office. A post office opened with the name Churchill on September 8, 1875. On July 23, 1892, the settlement was moved east and the post office's name was changed to Rose City. Rose City was incorporated as a city in 1905. In 1910, the city was hit with a major fire that destroyed the business section with in an hour. April 3, 1910 The prosperous lumber town was engulfed in flames as it covered the commercial district. The fire has started at D.W. Benjamins grocery store on the south side of West Main Street and spread quickly. Even with the efforts of the fireman the fire continued to spread down the north side of the town. Due to the fact that most buildings back then were of frame construction (Framing, in construction, is the fitting together of pieces to give a structure support and shape. Framing materials are usually wood, engineered wood, or structural steel) it had taken less than an hour for the business district to burn. With the loss of over thirty buildings, property losses, and looting the damage estimated $175,000. The only two business left standing during the fire were two concrete buildings on the main street the bell‚Äôs store and the naylor‚Äôs store. extreme weather conditions Between 1950 to 2010 there have been a total 1433 extreme weather events recorded within 50 miles of rose city, mi.

Allendale Charter Township is best known as being home to the main campus of Grand Valley State University. History The land within the current borders of the township has been inhabited by humans since at least ca. 200 BCE to 500 CE, earliest evidence suggests occupation by Goodall Focus, a Middle Woodland Hopewellian culture. At the time of European contact, Anishinaabe-speaking peoples, the Odawa and the Potawatomi lived within the current township. The first documented European in what is now Allendale was Pierre Constant, a French fur trader who established a trading post at Charleston for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company in 1810. The first permanent European settler was Richard Roberts, of Wales, who purchased one hundred and sixty acres along the Grand River, building a log cabin in 1842 that became known as the Half-way House, as it was situated roughly halfway between Grand Haven and Grandville. Roberts established a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright and a store. In the winter of 1848‚Äì49, a meeting was held at the home of Alexander Milne for the purpose of drafting a petition requesting to become an organized Township, to be called the Township of Isaac. Those attending the meeting, along with Milne, were James Scott, Johnson Balcom, Alexander Scott, Robert Scott, John Hanna and Henry M. Reed. James Scott drew up the township petition which was signed by all of them. The petition was presented to the state legislature by state Senator Henry Pennoyer of Grand Haven. Senator Pennoyer, on his own initiative, substituted Isaac with the (misspelled) Allandale after Agnes Allen, the first name appearing on the tax roll, and the widow of Hannibal Allen, son of Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen.Allendale Historical Recognition Program , p. 19 The spelling was subsequently changed from Allandale to the current Allendale.

Grand Haven is located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Grand River, for which it is named. As of the 2010 census, Grand Haven had a population of 10,412. It is part of the Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area, which had a population of 1,027,703 in 2014. The city is home to the Grand Haven Memorial Airpark (3GM) and is located just north of Grand Haven Charter Township. History The Potawatomi and Ottawa Indians lived in the area for centuries and used the river as a trade route into the interior of Michigan. Some of the long culture of the Ottawa tribe is being revealed through the excavation of archeological artifacts. The city dates its European-American founding to French colonial settlers. A fur trading outpost called Gabagouache was first established by Madeline La Framboise and her husband Joseph.

The first permanent resident was a Presbyterian minister, William Montague Ferry, who founded in 1834 the first area church and neighboring town of Ferrysburg. Residents named the town as \\"Grand Haven\\" in 1835. Sheldon Tannery was founded in 1838, developing to process leathers from the fur trade and cattle. The second church was organized in 1850. Ferry founded the city's first bank in 1851 in the Ferry & Son building on Harbor Drive. He also started a school, Ferry Elementary, which continues to operate. The city was incorporated in 1867. In the mid-to- late 19th century, Grand Haven developed as a logging, lumber mill and shipping town, as well as a shipbuilding center. The city was served by the Grand Trunk Railway, which ran along the waterfront near the river. Its depot and offices have been adapted for use as a historical museum. The Story and Clark Piano Company built pianos in the city from 1900‚Äì1984. The smokestack at the piano factory collapsed during the Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1998. In August 2006, Eagle-Ottawa Leather Co., which developed from the 1838 Sheldon Tannery, announced it would close its local operations that year. Given the importance of shipping and water trade to the city, the Grand Haven Lighthouses were built in 1839 on the south pier, to mark the most navigable channel into the river. The current lighthouses, painted red, were built in 1875 (outer light) and 1905 (inner). They are connected by a lighted catwalk, which runs along the pier to the shore. George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson and Homer Van Meter, who became notorious 1930s criminals, committed their first bank robbery at a Grand Haven bank.

Grand Haven is home to the United States Coast Guard's \\"Sector Field Office Grand Haven.\\" The first Coast Guard presence in the city was in 1924. The Coast Guard cutter Escanaba was based in the city until the Second World War. After it was sunk by a U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, the citizens of Grand Haven raised more than $1,000,000 in bonds to build a replacement cutter bearing the same name; several pieces of wreckage remain displayed on the city's waterfront. Grand Haven hosts the annual Coast Guard Festival, a celebration based on Coast Guard Day, which draws U.S. and Canadian vessels along with parades of bands and other activities, including a memorial to the 101 sailors lost in the Escanaba sinking. The yearly attendance for this event exceeds 300,000 people over the two-week period of the festival. Grand Haven is the first city officially designated as Coast Guard City, USA by an act of Congress signed by President Bill Clinton. The act was Public Law 105-383 enacted by the United States Congress and signed by the president on November 13, 1998. The Grand Haven Musical Fountain was built on the opposite bank of the Grand River from the city center in 1969. It plays nightly during the tourist season. When it was built, it was the world's largest such fountain. Today, the overall largest fountain is in Las Vegas. Technology Grand Haven has been one of many technology leaders in West Michigan and throughout the country, having been featured in the national media, including on ABC, in PCWorld, ComputerWorld and Forbes magazine. The city was the first municipality in the country to feature a citywide wireless internet service. The wireless service is designed to work throughout the city and up to offshore for boaters.

Rex Robinson induced people of the east to come this way and the area was covered with a fine forest. Grandville was the central point of settlement and land offices were established there. In 1831 the land was surveyed and labeled as Township 5,Range 13 West. James Cronkright and his wife were the first settlers in the township. In 1843 they settled in Section 11 in where they built a 16 X 22 foot house. The closest neighbors were over four miles away and there were no roads. Bears, wolves, deer and other wild animals were common. Some were important for food. S.L. Gitchel first settled on the SW corner of Sec.1 in 1845 and finally on Sec.33. He became a specialist in making small bridges and corduroy roads. Monsur Brown, parents of Mrs. Gitchel, followed in 1846 settling in the SE corner of Sec. 11 with a son James M. Brown who was married three years later. He also settled in Sec.11. More families followed from the east but some Hollanders were entering from the west. Later Germans entered from the south. Until 1849, Georgetown and Jamestown were under the same jurisdiction. All taxes were paid in Jenison. Evidently there were no printed blanks, for tax receipts were written out in full. Twelve voters were required in what is now Jamestown before the towns could be separated. In 1849 there were a sufficient number and steps were taken to bring this about. The meeting took place at the James Cronkright Jr. home in Sec. 11. In April, Mrs. Cronkright prepared a dinner for the men and spent the day with her mother. Twelve men attended and were assisted by a Mr. James Scott from Grandville. Each was elected to an office. Of the twelve men present one-third were named James, so this new township was named Jamestown. Six men living in the township were not there. It is believed that four men from the western part of the township could not yet speak English. There were fifteen residents on the first 1849-tax roll covering seventeen parcels of land. These seventeen parcels were found in only 9 of the 36 sections of the township. Six of those sections were in the west one third of the township. Eleven family names were included in those fifteen residents. In 1850 the town meeting was held at the Cronkright home again but the 1851 and 1852 meetings were held at the first log schoolhouse in Sec. 11. In 1853 it was held at the log schoolhouse in Jamestown Center, which was the second schoolhouse in the township. The Forest Grove log school was built in 1853 by the third district in the township, out of seven, that finally served the township's educational needs for many years.The Early History of Jamestown, Pauline Hall Gitchel Points of interest =Cemeteries= * Zutphen Cemetery * Star Cemetery * Forest Grove Cemetery * Jamestown Cemetery =Lakes= * Mud Lake Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and 0.03% is water.

History In 1847, nearly 500 Dutch citizens sailed for America ostensibly to achieve religious freedom, although their decision to immigrate was probably also influenced by other factors, such as their failure to thrive under dire economic conditions in their home province of Zeeland, Netherlands and their opposition to modern scientific and social advances of the time. The emigrants were led by Jannes van de Luijster, a wealthy landowner who sold his holdings in the Netherlands to advance money for the members to pay their debts and buy passage to America. Their settlement, some of land once occupied by the Odawa people, was named after their home province of Zeeland. Van de Luyster arranged for three ships to sail for the United States. He came on the first ship, arriving on June 27, 1847. He was followed by the Steketee group on July 4, and Reverend Van Der Meulen's group on August 1 of that year.

The population was 1,376 at the 2010 census. Communities Presque Isle is a small unincorporated community located within Presque Isle Township along Lake Huron. It is approximately 15 miles north of Alpena, and 15 miles south of Rogers City. The community and the township are named for Presque Isle (literally, \\"almost an island\\") which is French for \\"peninsula\\". This peninsula, for which the entire county is named, sits in the northern part of the township and is home to two historic lighthouses. Only one narrow strip of land at the southern end of the peninsula connects it to the mainland. Sunrise and sunset over Lake Huron are both viewable from the sandy beaches along this strip of land. Presque Isle Harbor Marina, a restaurant, and a gift shop are located there as well. The community of Presque Isle is located a few miles south of this peninsula and includes a post office, seasonal gas station, chapel, community center, library, and a historic inn, the Presque Isle Lodge. The community sprung up around the homestead of John Kauffman, which currently serves as the community center. As early as the 1880s Presque Isle was frequented by hunters, fisherman, and summer vacationers and eventually the Fireside Inn, Birch Hill Hotel, and Grand Lake Hotel were built at the turn of the century to meet this demand. The Old Presque Isle Lighthouse, built in 1840, is located at the north end of Presque Isle Harbor; according to local legend, it is haunted. The New Presque Isle Lighthouse was built in 1870 and is the tallest climbable tower on the Great Lakes. Both lighthouses have museums, open seasonally to the public. The 1870 lighthouse museum houses a beautifully preserved Third Order Fresnel Lens which remained active in the tower until recent years. Both lighthouses guided sailors to Presque Isle Harbor, the only natural harbor between Detroit and Mackinac, and a critically important wooding station on Lake Huron in the days before coal burning steamships. The many reefs and rocky shoals up and down the coast from Presque Isle Harbor are home to dozens of shipwrecks within the protected waters of Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which now extends from Alcona County to Cheboygan County. Presque Isle is also home to Camp Chickagami, a boys' camp on Lake Esau opened in 1929 and currently owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Michigan. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 47.2 square miles (122.2 km), of which 35.6 square miles (92.2 km) is land and 11.6 square miles (30.0 km) (24.57%) is water. Because of its irregular shape, the civil township includes land from portions of two survey townships. Lafarge Presque Isle Quarry (formerly Stoneport, an open-pit limestone quarry) lies along Lake Huron between Presque Isle Harbor and False Presque Isle and is the township's largest employer. Presque Isle Township contains two nearly identical seven mile long inland lakes, Grand Lake and Long Lake. Each lake is over 5000 acres. Both lakes have been featured twice on the Outdoor Channel program Major League Fishing for their excellent large and smallmouth bass fishing. Grand Lake has upwards of a dozen islands, and both lakes feature \\"Sandies\\" or sandbars where boaters gather on weekends.

The CDP is located within Denton, Lake, and Roscommon townships. The population was 3,427 at the 2010 census. The CDP is situated on the southwest shore of Houghton Lake, which is Michigan's largest inland lake, and also includes the unincorporated community of Houghton Lake Heights. The community of Prudenville borders on the east. M-55 runs through the communities, and U.S. Route 127 is the western boundary of the Houghton Lake CDP. History The Houghton Lake area's first white settlers were said to be the Emery family in 1873. Augustus Emery, his wife, and their 7 children left their home in Chesaning, Michigan, and made their way on foot to an area three miles south of the lake via the well-known Saginaw Trail. It was here that Mr. Emery and his three sons, Augustus, Jr., 21, William, 19, and Harvey, 17, would construct the family home on 160 acres of homesteaded property. Lumbering had a profound impact on the early development of Houghton Lake. In the mid-1800s, lumber camps in the area were abundant, and roads, towns, and railways were established to support the lumber trade. Logs were floated from Houghton Lake down the Muskegon River to sawmills and shipping facilities in Muskegon. It has been estimated that in 1860 alone, mills on the Muskegon River produced 75,000,000 board-feet of lumber. By the late 1800s, lumbering became the primary industry in the area. As lumber camps sprung up around saw mills, more settlers arrived. Around 1883, a community at Houghton Lake had been created. Houghton Lake was originally called \\"Roscommon Lake\\". However, in 1879, after the untimely death of famous physician, explorer, and Michigan's first state geologist, Douglass Houghton, Roscommon Lake was honorably renamed Houghton Lake. With the decline of the lumbering industry in the early 1900s, railways that had been used to transport lumber were transformed to passenger lines to bring outdoorsmen to fish, hunt, and experience the beauty of the \\"north country.\\" The Houghton Lake fishery became legendary and attracted visitors from far and wide. By the mid-1900s Houghton Lake had become known as a prime resort area. Today, thousands of seasonal cottages, year-round homes, and businesses border the lake. Houghton Lake remains one of Michigan's top resort and vacation destinations and attracts thousands of visitors to its shores each year. In 1927, the \\"Johnson Dance Hall,\\" presently known as \\"The Playhouse,\\" was erected and served for many years as the entertainment center for the area. The Playhouse and the surrounding property are now home to The Houghton Lake Historical Society, as well as the yearly event \\"Historic Village Days\\" The town was struck by a windstorm on June 11, 1932, which killed four people.\\"Michigan Storm is Fatal To Four\\".

The post office remains in operation and is located at 899 West Houghton Lake Drive (M-55). The Homestead Act of 1862, which granted free land to travelers moving west, prompted settlers to the Prudenville area in 1870 due to its plentiful lumber resources. The growing community was named after early developer Peter Pruden, and the community grew to include a post office, two hotels, many businesses, and a school. In 1882, the Roscommon Lumber Company built a \\"stand-alone\\" trestle railroad to assist logging crews in pushing timber into the east bay of Houghton Lake. The logs were floated across the lake into the draining Muskegon River and further down the river to the mills of Muskegon on the shores of Lake Michigan. During its operation from 1882‚Äì1887, the company employed 700 workers and logged 175 million board feet of white and Norway pine.

The population was 2,394 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Chesaning Township. History The first mention of Chesaning in the written pages of history is the Saginaw Treaty, signed in 1819. This treaty was between members of the Saginaw Tribe, Chippewa Indians, and the government of the United States. They established a number of reservations, including along the banks of the Shiawassee River known as \\"Big Rock Reserve.\\" Chesaning is a Chippewa word meaning \\"big rock place\\". The treaty continued in effect until 1837 when a second treaty led to the reserve being surveyed and offered for sale in 1841. The first land was sold at $5 per acre to brothers Wellington and George W. Chapman, and Rufus Mason. After making their land purchase, they traveled back to Massachusetts and moved their families to their new wilderness home by late summer of 1842. During the months they had been away from their land, several settlers had moved into the area, building a dam and a sawmill. A few years later, a grinding mill was added. The new settlers named their community \\"Northampton\\" in honor of the home they had left in Massachusetts. In 1853, the legislature changed the name to Chesaning, the traditional name for the village and township. The first township elections, held in 1847, are considered to be the official birthday of the community. The village, first surveyed in 1851, was organized in 1869. The early business community was located on the east side of the river. The forest setting provided an abundance of lumber, which was used to construct many stores. However, the use of coal heating systems often caused major fires, which destroyed entire blocks of stores. The fires and the arrival of the railroad on the west side community influenced the business area to move on the west side of the river. The Owosso and Saginaw Navigation Company, organized in 1857 to move merchandise by barge up and down the river, began construction of a canal and lock on the east side of the dam for hauling goods on the river. The river continued to be important for commercial use until the railroad arrived in Owosso. The railroad through Chesaning, built in 1867, was first surveyed to be built approximately three miles west of Chesaning, going directly from Oakley to St. Charles. Luckily, Wellington Chapman donated $18,000, a considerable sum at the time, to the railroad to secure a rail line through Chesaning. The rail was very important to the economy of the village.

Education Education in Chesaning had its beginnings during the summer of 1843 when a small board shanty was built on the east side of the river. Eliza Ann Smith was the first teacher. She had 11 pupils, which included her five younger brothers. The first school year was brought to an end when a heavy rainstorm flooded the building and sent the teacher and pupils fleeing to higher ground. The school moved several times over the years, until 1869, when a brick school was built for $14,000. The building was enlarged a few years later. Then a second brick school was constructed on the site of the first brick school and opened in 1918. A gymnasium was added to the school in 1938 and a few years later, a band room. The present high school opened in 1959 and had a capacity of 1,000 students. The building was later enlarged to accommodate 1,200 students. Today, Chesaning Union Schools consists of a high school, a middle school and one elementary school. The district includes a large rural area. Zion Lutheran School is a grade school (Pre-K-8) of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Chesaning. Local media Chesaning's local newspaper is the Tri-County Citizen. Founded in 1983, it is a weekly free paper delivered to over 19,000 area homes. Many residents also subscribe to The Saginaw News, The Bay City Times, the Flint Journal, or the Argus-Press out of neighboring Owosso. Chesaning is an important location for broadcasters in Mid-Michigan, with the community being home to three nearly 1,000 foot communications towers. Flint's WJRT-TV and WSMH as well as Saginaw's WAQP have their antennas and transmitters south of Chesaning. The location gives broadcasters the ability to transmit strong signals to Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, and Lansing. Radio stations from Saginaw, Flint and Lansing can be received in Chesaning. Exceptionally strong local signals include WSGW, WTLZ, WKCQ and WILZ in Saginaw; WHNN and WIOG in Bay City; and WOAP and WRSR in Owosso.

Chicago, : The Lewis publishing company, 1915. p. 907 In the 1850s, lumbering outposts developed in the area, one of which was called \\"Loretta\\", which was given a post office named \\"Jay\\" in April 1856. The office was named for the first postmaster, Jefferson Jaqruth. This outpost was very nearly at the geographical center of Tittawabasse Township. Another settlement was placed just a little to the north. in 1867, one resident of the second locale, George Truesdale, instigated moving the post office from Loretta to his settlement, which retained the name of Jay for several years afterwards. The name of Freeland comes from \\"Mammy Freeland\\" who operated a popular tavern on the river, frequented by lumbermen and rivermen, who came to refer to the entire settlement as Freeland. The name of the post office was changed to Freeland in January 1879. It was also a station on the Pere Marquette Railroad. By another account (Moore), the Freeland family name was prominent in business and politics of the area. During World War II, the airport was used to hold German prisoners of war.

When Saginaw Township was organized as part of Oakland County in 1831, in accordance with an 1830 act of Michigan's Territorial Legislature, it covered all of today's Saginaw County (organized in 1835) and part of Bay, Genesee and Midland counties. As the boundaries for these counties were set, and new townships within Saginaw County organized, Saginaw Township was reduced to its present boundaries. The territory of the present City of Saginaw west of the Saginaw River was taken from Saginaw Township when the city of Saginaw was incorporated in 1857. In May 2020, Sagninaw Township residents. along with other Midland County residents in parts of the city of Midland, the village of Sanford, Edenville Township, Midland Township, Tittabawassee, Thomas Township, Lincoln Township, Homer Township and Dow Chemical, were forced to evacuate due to high flooding which was caused by the breach of the Edenville and Sanford dams.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/19/michigan-flooding- midland-gretchen-whitmer-evacuations/5226587002/ Education =Public school districts= *Saginaw Township Community Schools =Public high schools= *Heritage High School =Private high schools= *Nouvel Catholic Central High School *Valley Lutheran High School References External links *Saginaw Charter Township *Saginaw Township Community Schools Category:Townships in Saginaw County, Michigan Category:Charter townships in Michigan Category:1831 establishments in Michigan Territory ","title":"Saginaw Charter Township, Michigan"},{"id":"119002","text":"Saginaw Township North is a census-designated place (CDP) in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan.

Harbor Lexington State Harbor Lexington Harbor was constructed and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1965. The harbor serves mainly recreational boating activities and contains launch/retrieval ramps, fueling facilities, and 190 berthing slips which are operated by both public and private agencies. Due to infiltration of sediment through and along the peripheral breakwalls, the harbor requires regular dredging to maintain navigable channels. The dredging occurs approximately every 3 to 5 years, with excavated sediment deposited onto the beaches surrounding the breakwalls.

Communities *Gulliver is an unincorporated community in the township on U.S. 2 on the shores of Gulliver Lake. *Whitedale is a defunct town located near Gulliver. The town was abandoned in the 1950s. History A petition was first filed to form a township, Gulliver Township, in May 1890. Upon filing the petition, it raised much opposition in Manistique and from a few local families in Gulliver. For political reasons and an approaching election year, Manistique did not want to lose their voting power involving districts 41‚Äì45, Range 14. For an unknown reason, the subject was tabled until the meeting of October 15, 1890. The same petition was again presented and the same groups of people opposed the forming of a township. There was so much opposition that name calling and fist fights broke out at the meeting. Detailed reports from the Pioneer Tribune in Manistique recorded these fights and named the people involved. A main point in the case was the accusation that the names listed on the original petition were fraudulent and would have to be checked for legal residency. Through the legal battles, the case eventually came before the Michigan Supreme Court. The submitted petition checked out fine. However, one of the objections made by a State Representative was the name ‚ÄúGulliver‚Äù brought to mind a village of elves and giants. The name was hastily changed on the petition to Doyle Township after Michael J. Doyle, a Democratic legislator from Sault Ste. Marie, was recruited to negotiate a settlement. The citizens were so impressed by his negotiating skills they decided to name the township after him than for either of the feuding politicians. Michael J. Doyle had been practicing law in the Sault since 1887, became a City Attorney in 1890, and was then elected Chippewa County Representative to the Michigan Legislature in 1891.

Located on the west bank of the St. Clair River, it is one of the cities in the River District north of Detroit and south of Lake Huron. In the late 19th century, it was a major center of wooden shipbuilding and lumber processing. The population was 4,248 at the 2010 census.

History Downtown Marine City with interurban car, which traveled to Detroit. Early 20th century. The area of Marine City had been Ojibwa territory for centuries before the first European contact. Beginning in the 17th century, French trappers and missionaries entered the territory, followed by settlers in the colonial period on both sides of the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. Farmers developed long, narrow plots that were laid out in the typical rectangular shape of colonial French, with the narrow end along the riverfront. The first Catholic Church was built by French Catholics at Catholic Point, where they had bought land before the United States was formed. French Canadians also lived on the other side of the river in a small farming community known as Petite C√¥te. It was not until after the American Revolution that European- American settlers arrived in any number. In the 1780s they obtained a deed for land from the Chippewa Indians. The Americans began to call the community \\"Yankee Point\\", because so many settlers came from the Northern Tier of states, with late 18th and 19th-century westward migration originating from New England and New York. They also called the settlement \\"Belle River\\" (Belle Riviere in French), as the French had; this later was applied as the name of a neighborhood. The village was platted by Americans as Newport in 1835‚Äì37. Although never incorporated by that name, it was known as \\"Newport\\" for 31 years. In 1865, it was incorporated as the Village of Marine City. Thriving on lumber trade and shipbuilding, the village re-incorporated as a city in June 1887.Romig, Walter (1986). Michigan Place Names: The History of the Founding and Naming of More Than Five Thousand Past and Present Michigan Communities, Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 352. . The second half of the 19th century was the period of great growth in the village, with many workers employed in the lumber and shipping industries. Rafts of lumber were moved down the St. Clair River in the spring to be worked at Marine City or Detroit. Shipyards built some of the many wooden ships that crossed the Great Lakes. Lake steamers linked passengers with small towns around the lakes. Their decks were full and their flags were flying. Marine City was centered on a park by the St. Clair River, where bands played in the bandstand at City Hall during the summer. As the lumber business ran down with the exploitation of forests, the area became linked to other resource extraction. Freighters carried iron from Duluth, Minnesota, which had been mined in the Mesabi Range, to Ashtabula, Ohio for steel processing. They passed from Lake Superior through Lake Huron and to Lake Erie. Marine City was known as the town on the St. Clair River where the captains of lake freighters lived. Many of these men and their crews worked for the Pittsburgh Steamship Company. Formed in 1901 by US Steel Corporation, it became the largest commercial fleet on the Great Lakes.Al Miller, Tin Stackers: The History of the Pittsburgh Steamship Company (Great Lakes Books Series), Wayne State University, 1999 In the 21st century, Marine City has become the home of ten antique stores, including the \\"Water Street Antique Mall\\" located at 412 S Water Street. The Snug Theater is a 98-seat theater featuring live performances. It will be joined in 2014/15 by a sister theater, The Riverbank Theater, in a former bank building (originally Marine Bank & Trust) down the street.

Restaurants and retail in downtown also cater to visitors and residents. The Heather House, now operated as a bed and breakfast, was built in the Queen Anne Victorian-style. It was completed in 1885 after 2 years of construction for its owner, William Sauber. He was chief engineer for the Mitchell fleet of Great Lake steamers.

Marysville is located on the western shore of the St. Clair River, across from Corunna, Ontario. The city is marked by winding streets, subdivisions, a riverfront boardwalk, Bridge-to- Bay Bike Trail and an industrial park. The city was home to the former Wills Sainte Claire Automotive company, a Morton Salt plant, and the Detroit Edison Marysville Power Plant which was decommissioned in 2001 and razed in 2015. Geography * According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. * It is considered to be part of the Thumb of Michigan.

History Marysville traces its history back to 1786 when Antoin Morass built a sawmill at Bunce Creek. Later, in 1817, Zephaniah W. Bunce sailed up the St. Clair River and settled at the place of the mill, naming it Bunce Creek. This would later become the property of the Detroit Edison Marysville Power Plant. He later became postmaster and a member of the Michigan Territorial Council. The Marysville Power Plant was the site of Zephaniah Bunce's settlement. Meanwhile, two businessmen, Meldrum & Park, founded a sawmill in 1792 at the location now known as Cuttle Creek. This settlement was located in the southern part of current day Marysville, two streets are named after them. Also having a street named for him was Colonel Andrew Mack, a native and the 11th mayor of Detroit. He bought Meldrum and Park's mill and built his home and a general store along the St. Clair River. The small settlement with Mack's general store and mill was called \\"Mack's Place\\" and was awarded a post office. Mack was a state representative, Colonel in the War of 1812, and a co-founder of the Detroit Free Press. Colonel Mack and his wife, Amelia, are buried on the north bank of Cuttle Creek in the Riverview Golf Course. Later, Edward P. Vickery settled at the present day foot of Huron Boulevard in Marysville. He named the operation Vickery's Landing and the settlement surrounding it eventually became known as Vicksburg. In 1854, the Mack's Place post office was transferred to Vicksburg. However, there was already another Vicksburg, Michigan, so in 1859 the name was changed to Marysville, after Nelson Mill's wife Mary. These small settlements were brought together by inventor and engineer, C. Harold Wills. He worked at the Ford Motor Company, and was considered the \\"right-hand man\\" of Henry Ford. His contributions to the Ford company included designing Models A through T of the early Ford Motor Company. He was the inventor of many auto improvements including the planetary transmission used in the Models S and T. He was a pioneer in the use of vanadium steel and designed the \\"Blue Oval\\" logo, still used on Ford Products today. He resigned in 1919 and moved to Marysville to establish the C. H. Wills & Company on the banks of the St. Clair River. Two years later in 1921, the first Wills Ste. Clair automobile was produced (named for the factory's location on the St. Clair River). The factory closed in 1926 after 14,000 vehicles were made by the Wills factory. Wills' and his partner John Lee provided much of the early infrastructure of Marysville, including electricity, sidewalks, roads, etc. so that Wills is credited with the street design and city planning of Marysville. He nicknamed Marysville the \\"Dream City\\". The main area of the city to be developed before his company folded was the area surrounding Washington Elementary School. The community was deeply affected by the Great Depression, and the vision for the city was never fully realized. Subdivision development in the later half of the 20th century has further offset the strategic plan for the City of Marysville. Wills did succeed to the extent that the Marysville area is nowadays a vibrant community. Wills' former factory currently houses the Chrysler Corporation MOPAR parts distribution facility. Marysville was incorporated as a village in 1919. It became an incorporated city in 1924. Present Day Today, Marysville is a growing community, lacking a central downtown area. Most of the retail and restaurants are located along Gratiot Blvd. and Michigan Avenue. The city's administrative office and police and fire departments are located on Delaware Ave. The large industrial area is located in the southern half of the city along M-29, which snakes through Marysville. The city park and the older residential neighborhoods are along Huron Boulevard, as well as an area located off of M-29 near Gratiot Boulevard, known as the 'Salt Block', which had originally been constructed to house workers of Morton Salt Company.

Marysville Station: Border Patrol Marysville is home to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station, established in 1960. The station, originally located in Port Huron, was moved south to River Road in Marysville, along the St. Clair River. In October 2007 a new facility opened at 2600 Wills St.Marysville Station - CBP.gov The Marysville station is responsible for the United States-Canada border from Lake St. Clair, the St. Clair River and southern Lake Huron up into Michigan's Thumb. This territory includes the nearby international Blue Water Bridge crossing and St. Clair Tunnel. Marysville School District The Marysville School District, serves the city of Marysville and portions of St. Clair Township, and Kimball Township.http://www.marysville.k12.mi.us/ There are 5 schools in Marysville: 3 elementary, 1 middle school, and 1 high school. *Marysville Gardens Elementary School *Washington Elementary School *Morton Elementary School *Marysville Middle School *Marysville High School Economy Marysville has a very developed industrial economy. It houses a major Intertape Polymer factory and Mueller Brass factory. Marysville is also home to Marysville Hydrocarbons, site of a recently completed ethanol plant near the southern city border. Marysville has a growing industrial park, which includes an auto parts (previously Chrysler) factory, an addition to the MOPAR parts distribution center. In 1973, Consumers Energy built a synthetic gas plant near Marysville Michigan. It was the first of its kind ever built. In 1973 the Marysville gas reforming plant could produce up to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. That doubled in 1974 when a second train was brought on line, providing up to 220 million cubic feet (6.2 million cubic meters) of gas per day from 50,000 barrels/day of liquid hydrocarbon feedstock. The plant used natural gas liquids imported from Ontario via a pipeline under the St. Clair River. The gas produced was of comparable quality to natural gas. At one point, Marysville gas powered over one quarter of all Consumers Power customers in Michigan.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/98223263/ It also helped lessen the effects felt by Consumers Power customers during the 1973 oil crisis. The plant was shut down for economic reasons in 1979. It is now the location of Marysville Hydrocarbons, an ethanol refinery. Many local corn growers and elevators truck their grain to Marysville for ethanol processing. Marysville Hydrocarbons is the only one of its kind in the immediate area. Commercially, Marysville includes a Meijer supermarket and numerous local places of business. Climate This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.

The population was 30,184 at the 2010 census. The city is adjacent to Port Huron Township but is administratively autonomous. Located along the St. Clair River, it is connected to Point Edward, Ontario in Canada via the Blue Water Bridge. The city lies at the southern end of Lake Huron and is the easternmost point on land in Michigan. Port Huron is home to two paper mills, Mueller Brass, and many businesses related to tourism and the automotive industry. The city features a historic downtown area, boardwalk, marina, museum, lighthouse, and the McMorran Place arena and entertainment complex. History This area was long occupied by the Ojibwa people. French colonists had a temporary trading post and fort at this site in the 17th century. In 1814 following the War of 1812, the United States established Fort Gratiot at the base of Lake Huron. A community developed around it. The early 19th century was the first time a settlement developed here with a permanent European-American population. In the 19th century, the United States established an Ojibwa reservation in part of what is now Port Huron, in exchange for their cession of lands under treaty for European-American settlement. But in 1836, under Indian Removal, the US forced the Ojibwa to move west of the Mississippi River and resettle in what are now the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota.Helen Hornbeck Tanner. Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1987) p. 165 In 1857, Port Huron became incorporated. Its population grew rapidly after the 1850s due a high rate of immigration: workers leaving poverty, famine, and revolutions in Europe were attracted to the successful shipbuilding and lumber industries in Michigan. These industries supported development around the Great Lakes and in the Midwest. In 1859 the city had a total of 4,031 residents; some 1855, or 46%, were foreign-born or their children (first-generation Americans).\\"Population of Port Huron\\" , East Saginaw Courier, 13 October 1859, View 2, Chronicling America, Library of Congress, accessed 5 September 2014 By 1870, Port Huron's population exceeded that of surrounding villages. In 1871, the State Supreme Court designated Port Huron as the county seat of St. Clair County. On October 8, 1871, the city, as well as places north in Sanilac and Huron counties, burned in the Port Huron Fire of 1871. A series of other fires leveled Holland and Manistee, Michigan, as well as Peshtigo, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois on the same day. The Thumb Fire that occurred a decade later, also engulfed Port Huron. In 1895 the village of Fort Gratiot, in the vicinity of the former Fort Gratiot, was annexed by the city of Port Huron.Walter Romig, Michigan Place Names, p. 204 The following historic sites have been recognized by the State of Michigan through its historic marker program. * Fort St. Joseph. The fort was built in 1686 by the French explorer Duluth. This fort was the second European settlement in lower Michigan. This post guarded the upper end of the St. Clair River, the vital waterway joining Lake Erie and Lake Huron. Intended by the French to bar English traders from the upper lakes, the fort in 1687 was the base of a garrison of French and Indian allies. In 1688 the French abandoned this fort. The site was incorporated into Fort Gratiot in 1814. A park has been established at the former site of the fort. * Fort Gratiot Light. The Fort Gratiot Lighthouse was built in 1829 to replace a tower destroyed by a storm. In the 1860s workers extended the tower to its present height of . The light, automated in 1933, continues to guide shipping on Lake Huron into the narrow and swift-flowing St. Clair River. It was the first lighthouse established in the State of Michigan. * Lightship Huron. From 1935 until 1970, the Huron was stationed in southern Lake Huron to mark dangerous shoals. After 1940 the Huron was the only lightship operating on the Great Lakes. Retired from Coast Guard Service in 1970, she was presented to the City of Port Huron in 1971. * Grand Trunk Railway Depot. The depot, which is now part of the Port Huron Museum, is where 12-year-old Thomas Edison departed daily on the Port Huron‚ÄìDetroit run. In 1859, the railroad's first year of operation, Edison convinced the railroad company to let him sell newspapers and confections on the daily trips. He became so successful that he soon placed two newsboys on other Grand Trunks running to Detroit. He made enough money to support himself and to buy chemicals and other experimental materials. * Port Huron Public Library. In 1902 the city of Port Huron secured money from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to erect a municipal library and arranged for matching operating funds. In 1904, a grand Beaux-Arts-style structure was built at a cost of $45,000. At its dedication, Melvil Dewey, creator of a widely used book classification system, delivered the opening address. The Port Huron Public Library served in its original capacity for over sixty years. In 1967, a larger public library was constructed. The following year the former library was renovated and re- opened as the Port Huron Museum of Arts and History. An addition was constructed in 1988. * Harrington Hotel. The Hotel opened in 1896 and is a blend of Romanesque, Classical and Queen Anne architecture. The hotel closed in 1986, but a group of investors bought the structure that same year to convert it into housing for senior citizens. The Harrington Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. * Grand Trunk Western Railroad Tunnel. The tunnel was opened in 1891 and links Port Huron with Canada. This international submarine railway tunnel was the first international tunnel in the world. The tunnel's total length is , with underwater. The tunnel operations were electrified in 1908; half a century later they were converted to use diesel fuel. Tracks were lowered in 1949 to accommodate larger freight cars. During World War I, a plot to blast the tunnel was foiled. A new tunnel has since been opened. The city received the All-America City Award in 1955 and 2005. In June 1962, the Port Huron Statement, a New Left manifesto, was adopted at a convention of the Students for a Democratic Society. The convention did not take place within the actual city limits of Port Huron, but instead was held at a United Auto Workers retreat north of the city (now part of Lakeport State Park). Port Huron is the only site in Michigan where a lynching of an African-American man took place. On May 27, 1889, in the early morning, a mob of white men stormed the county jail to capture 23-year-old Albert Martin. A mixed-race man, he was accused of attacking a woman. They hanged him from the 7th Street Bridge. A memorial was installed in 2018 at the site, recounting Martin's history. The city collaborated with the Equal Justice Initiative on this memorialization. =Historic photographs= Image:PortHuron1902.jpgPort Huron circa 1902 Image:Huron Avenue, Port Huron, MI.jpgHuron Avenue in 1912 Image:St Clair River Tunnel - Port Huron Michigan.jpgSt. Clair Tunnel in 1907 Image:Fort Gratiot Lighthouse postcard - Port Huron Michigan.jpgGratiot Lighthouse in 1902 Image:Fort_Gratiot_Lighthouse_(2).jpg Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Geography *According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Saint Clair area attracts many tourists from Metro Detroit. Naming Located on the western banks of the St. Clair River, the city's name is taken from the river, which in turn was named for Lake Saint Clair, named by French explorers in the 17th century. The expedition of French explorer Ren√© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle entered the lake on August 12, 1679, the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi, and named it Lac Sainte-Claire in her honor.Jenks, p. 22 The lake is named on English maps as early as 1710 as Saint Clare. The spelling was anglicized as early as the 1755 Mitchell Map, when the lake's name was spelled as \\"St. Clair,\\" as it is currently.Jenks, pp. 23-24 The name is sometimes attributed to honoring the American Revolutionary War General and Governor of the Northwest Territory Arthur St. Clair, but it was in use with the current spelling long before St. Clair was a notable figure. The earlier name of the lake may have been conflated with that of the general in naming some of the political entities near the lake and the river, such as St. Clair County, St. Clair Township, and the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores. Some have thought that the name was in honor of Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the outlet of the Pine River. There in 1764 he built Fort Sinclair, which was in use for nearly twenty years before being abandoned.Fuller, pp. 21-22 History St. Clair was first platted under the name of Palmer by Thomas Palmer in 1828.1883 History of St. Clair County The city of St. Clair's roots go back to 1764, when a British fort was built on the south side of the Pine River near where it flows into the St. Clair River. Pontiac's Rebellion had taken place the year before and the British wanted a military base on the St. Clair River to protect their shipping route between Detroit and Fort Michilimackinac. Col. Patrick Sinclair was given the task of building it. He also made the new Fort Sinclair a trading post and sawmill center. The fort and the trading post both operated for about twenty years. In 1817, Robert Fulton platted a town on the north side of the Pine River. He lobbied for the creation of St. Clair County, and then convinced the state to make his settlement the new county seat. St. Clair remained the county seat until 1871, when it was moved to Port Huron. Thomas Palmer of Detroit bought Fulton's mostly undeveloped town in 1826, and for a time the village was called Palmer. The sawmill industry began to flourish due to the area's large supply of pine and oak. Clay from the Pine River's banks provided the material for several brickyards that operated into the Twentieth Century. Shipbuilding began in the 1820s and continued for a hundred years. Many of the town's men became sailors on the Great Lakes and numerous captains built homes in the city. In 1887, the Diamond Crystal Salt Company began tapping the area's vast underground salt deposits. In the late 1800s, St. Clair became a well-known resort with the building of the luxurious Oakland Hotel in 1881 and the Somerville Hotel in 1888. In addition to the natural wonders of the area, both hotels offered mineral baths. Passenger steamers stopped daily at the hotel docks. In the 1960s, the downtown area was redeveloped with the help of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The crown jewel of the project was the expansion of Palmer Park with its boardwalk along the St. Clair River. Today, this beautiful park draws visitors from all over.

The population was 4,229 at the 2010 census and 4,145 at the 2000 census (an increase of about 2%). Caro is located northeast of Flint and east of Saginaw in Michigan's Thumb region.  History  Caro began as a logging camp on the Cass River established by Curtis Emerson in 1847.Walter Romig, Michigan Place Names, p. 99 Later Samuel P. Sherman, who purchased in the north half of the northwest quarter of section 3 in Indianfields Township on September 8, 1852. Prior to this, only two land sales had been recorded, both for lumbering or speculative purposes. His son, William E. Sherman, had worked in the lumber industry nearby on the Cass River for some time prior to 1852 and William's favorable report persuaded his father to visit in 1851 and afterwards purchased several tracts of land in addition to his initial purchase. In the 1856-57 session of the Michigan Legislature, construction of a road was authorized from Bridgeport in Saginaw County northeast to Forestville in Sanilac County, with a route that would pass through what is now Caro. Once the road was cleared, commercial interests began to locate here. Melvin Gibbs, who had been keeping a hotel in an old log house, in 1858 put up a new frame building, known as the Gibbs House. In 1859, William E. Sherman built another hotel, which he named the Centerville House, based on the location being near the center of the county. The name Centerville became associated with the developing community. In 1865, Centerville was selected as the county seat. A post office named Tuscola Center was established on April 25, 1866. To address confusion caused by the differing names, community leaders met in 1868 and at the suggestion of William E Sherman selected the name Caro, based on a variant spelling of the Egyptian city of Cairo. On July 23, 2007 Governor Jennifer Granholm announced Caro as a community chosen by the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) to take part in the Blueprints for Downtowns program. Caro will receive a comprehensive, market- driven strategy toward developing an action-oriented downtown that will result in economic growth, job creation and private investments. Caro residents voted in favor of changing to the status of a city on November 3, 2009. Village President Tom Striffler was elected to the position of mayor.

The population was 563 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Fairgrove Township. Early history The settlement of Fairgrove dates back to June 1852 when Amzy Clay bought acreage from Patrick McGlone of neighboring Juniata Township, Michigan. The land surrounding Fairgrove was level, sloping slightly to the northwest. The soil was ideal for farming, although many drainage projects were necessary to rid the area of its large mosquito population. Forest lands enclosed the township with stands of beech, maple, elm and basswood occurring in groves, giving the town its name. No roads into or out of the township existed at the time and Mr. Clay along with his father, Henry Clay, Jacob Winchell, Erastus A. Marr, David Gorter, a Mr. Blank, Patrick McGlone and Joseph R. McGlone hacked through five and a half miles of densely crowded forest to connect the new township with neighboring communities. Settlement did not begin in earnest until the following spring when several new families moved into the township. Before the township was given a name it was designated as township 13 North, of Range 8 East by the State of Michigan.\\"Town of Fairgrove.\\" In History of Tuscola and Bay Counties, Mich with illustrations and biographical sketches of some of their prominent men and pioneers.

Located almost entirely in Tuscola County's Denmark Township, the village includes only a tiny portion of Blumfield Township in Saginaw County. The population was 1,454 at the 2010 census.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.  History  The area of what is the village of Reese today was first settled in 1865 when Mrs. Louisa Woodruff and her son built the first home (near the current intersection of Reese and Saginaw roads.) The Saginaw-Watrousville plank road was opened in 1871, which increased access to the community from Saginaw and the surrounding area. In 1873, the Detroit and Bay City railroads were built and Hudson B. Blackman plotted a tract of land adjacent to the original community (near the current intersection of Saginaw and Meridian streets) and named it Reese, in honor of Alvin H. Reese the railroad superintendent.Village of Reese William B. Stark was born in 1831 in New York and came to Denmark, Tuscola County, in 1865. Six brothers and one sister came to live with him in the following years. They lived in tents in the dense forest of the area in what is now Camp Street. In 1873, William's brother, Joseph, came to the area and opened a hotel near the corner of Reese and Saginaw roads. He was the fourth family to move to the area, with the others being his brother, the Woodruffs, and the Rogerses. In the fall of 1865, A.W. Gates, a stage proprietor from Saginaw, established a plank road from East Saginaw, through Reese, and into Watrousville. In 1871, Gates established a mail and stage route along the plank road. Gates kept his express and stage offices in Rogers‚Äô hotel. The post office was also in Rogers‚Äô hotel. The post office was named Gates in 1871 after the man responsible for its establishment. In the fall of 1871, Daniel Woodruff opened a grocery and provision store across the street from the hotel, and George Melatt and Archie Scott opened a blacksmith shop. In September 1872, Asenath M. Rogers, Roberts‚Äô wife, surveyed and platted eleven acres and called it Gates. Acquired by the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA's Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite, the image shows the town on May 21, 2012. In 1873, G. W. Reese brought the Detroit & Bay City Railroad through the town. Hudson B. Blackman then platted a tract of land adjoining Gates, and called it Reese, in honor of the railroad superintendent. The station, post office and town were then renamed after him. Thomas Haniford and Michael Doyle probably worked for that same railroad, and Eustius Gall, born in Switzerland, was an engineer. Blackman also donated the right‚Äìof‚Äìway and grounds on which the depot sat. In 1875, Aseneth Rogers surveyed and platted an addition to the village of Gates. With the railroad station at the east end of town being called Reese, the post office of Gates at the west end eventually merged, the entire village and surrounding area becoming known as Reese. James N. Taylor, whom, according to the 1880 census was born in Virginia, served as postmaster from 1878 to at least 1883. In 1889, he and his family lost most of their possessions in a house fire. In 1905 Gatestown was a common name of the west end of the community,Moden v. Superintendents of the Poor of Van Buren County.

In 1877, Reese was described as the railroad and trading point for a large section of farming country. Along with transporting people to and from the area the railroad would also transport timber, limestone and produce to markets throughout Michigan. In the early 1900s, the railroad also was used by local farmers to ship hogs and cattle to Detroit. Stages were also running daily from Saginaw to Caro. The depot served both railroads, as two train order boards were present. (One on a mast for the NYC and one on the building for the PM). Reese Crossing was not an interlocking but it was protected by a target that was set by approaching train crews. The east-west route is that of the Pere Marquette, and the north- south route going by the grain elevator is the Michigan Central branch line between Denmark Jct. and Bay City. The target was set vertical for a Michigan Central movement on the Denmark Jct. Branch. In 1946, the C&O; Railway purchased the line. In 1985 the C&O; combined with B&O; to form CSX Transportation. In 1988, Huron and Eastern Railway purchased the rail line which is still in operation today. In 1993, Reese celebrated 120 years of rail service. Reese area farmers are one of the Huron & Eastern Railway's major shippers. Even today the farming success depends on efficient use of the rail system. The first school meeting in the area was held in April 1866 and school was taught in a lumber shanty. There were 200 children of school age in the district. The original Reese School was built in 1880. The left side of the building was the original structure which was remodeled and increased in size in 1912. On April 25, 1913, a student set fire to the school and it burned to the ground. A new school was built in 1914 at a cost of $10,231. That structure remained, with renovations and additions, until it was torn down in 1962. it was replaced by the present middle school building which was erected from 1957-1966. In 1972, the gymnasium was refaced. At that time, the building housed both middle school and high school aged students. The present elementary school was built in 1957 and housed the lower grades. Total district enrollment was 1,308 students. The current Reese High School as built at a cost of $3,195,000 and opened for the 1976-77 school year housing grades 9-12. The middle school housed grades 6-8, with grades K-5 in the present elementary building. Total enrollment for the district was 1,358 students. The middle school closed at the end of the 2014-15 school year, with students moving into the high school building. RMS went up for sale in 2015 but after a year of no purchase agreements, it was demolished in 2016. There are also three parochial elementary schools that serve the district. In 1971, 44 teachers from the elementary and high school went on strike. After refusal to go back to work, the Reese Board of Education fired all 44. Reese 44 members were the first teachers in Michigan fired for demanding a fair contract by striking. This produced the phrase \\"Remember the Reese 44\\".Remembering the Reese 44, MEA Voice, June 2008 The area continues to be largely agricultural.

Paw Paw was incorporated in 1837 and is located in the southwestern portion of Michigan, on Interstate 94 (I-94) approximately west of Kalamazoo. Paw Paw is in a rural location whose primary agricultural product is grapes, which are used both in the local Michigan wine industry and for juice and jellies. The St. Julian Winery and Warner's Winery started in Paw Paw. Paw Paw has an annual Wine and Harvest Festival, which traditionally occurs the weekend following Labor Day. The Festival features a beer tent, bandstand, live music, a popular grape stomping competition among barefoot locals, carnival foods, and fireworks over scenic Maple Lake. Fine dining establishments in the Theater District cater to attendees of the Festival. Paw Paw is named for the pawpaw trees which once grew along the Paw Paw River. However, the pawpaw trees are less common at present due to the clearing of the shade trees that pawpaws require. An experimental planting of pawpaw trees on the high school grounds failed to flourish due to its location in an open, sunny field. The village is the main setting for the musical Dear Edwina by Marcy Heisler and Zina Goldrich.

Originally a village, Dexter residents voted to adopt a city charter in November 2014. The population was 4,067 at the 2010 census. Between 2000 and 2010, Dexter's population grew 73.9%, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the state. While there is no formal political connection between the City of Dexter and the adjacent Township of Dexter (located just northwest of the municipality), both share the 48130 zip code and Dexter, Michigan mailing address, as well as some basic services. The township was named for village founder and Washtenaw County's first circuit judge Samuel William Dexter. History Monument Park Tornado outside of Brass Creek The area was first settled in 1824, 13 years before Michigan became a state, when land speculator Samuel W. Dexter purchased a large tract of land and originated the village. It was known as \\"Mill Creek Settlement\\" until the village was platted in 1830, when its name was officially changed to Dexter. Mill Creek and the Huron River, which form much of the western and northeastern boundaries of the city, respectively, have long been valuable resources to Dexter. A sawmill was built in 1827, a woolen mill in 1838, a grist mill in 1844, and a cider mill in 1886. After being appointed County Court Justice in 1826, Judge Dexter reportedly established a post office in his home, shuttling mail between there and Ann Arbor on horseback. The founder of the original village, Samuel W. Dexter served as the chief justice of the Washtenaw County Court as well as being elected a University of Michigan regent. His home just northwest of the city overlooking Mill Creek was built in the early 1840s in Greek Revival architecture and is a recognizable landmark in the area. Samuel Dexter called it Gordon Hall to honor his mother's family. Gordon Hall was built by Calvin T. Fillmore, an architect and builder in the area. Calvin was a brother of president Millard Fillmore. Samuel Dexter was a staunch abolitionist, and it is nearly certain that Gordon Hall was a stop on the Underground Railroad (amongst other evidence, Gordon Hall contained secret areas in the basement, accessible only through hidden doorways). Gordon Hall and of surrounding property was gifted to the University of Michigan in 1950 by Katharine Dexter McCormick. (In 2006, the property was purchased by the Dexter Area Historical Society and Museum, with the goal of preserving and restoring the home). On March 20, 1966, the Dexter area experienced \\"one of the most infamous of all UFO sightings in history\\" when local truck driver Frank Mannor spotted a glowing object near his home. Astronomer J. Allen Hynek visited Dexter and declared the object was probably caused by \\"swamp gas,\\" a term which has since become closely affiliated with UFO sightings. Hynek's swamp gas theory prompted then-Michigan Congressman (and future president) Gerald R. Ford to call for a thorough Congressional investigation of \\"the rash of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in southern Michigan\\".HUFFINGTONPOST, 2013-01-14MICHIGANTODAY, 2013-04-13 On Thursday, March 15, 2012, Dexter was struck by a large EF3 tornado causing substantial damage to local houses and businesses, yet no injuries were reported.Accuweather News On November 4, 2014, Dexter residents voted to adopt a new charter, officially turning the former village into a city.9&10NEWS , 2014-11-05 Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
