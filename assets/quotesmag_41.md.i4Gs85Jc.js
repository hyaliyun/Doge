It has a single rounded leaf and a flowering stem with up to four pink or pinkish green flowers with a flat, oblong labellum. Description Cyrtostylis oblonga is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single heart-shaped to almost round leaf long and wide. Up to four pink or pinkish green flowers long are borne on a thin flowering stem up to high. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to narrow lance-shaped and the lateral sepals are narrow linear and somewhat smaller than the dorsal sepal. The petals are similar in size and shape to the lateral sepals. The labellum is flat, oval, about long wide with two round calli at the base and two parallel longitudinal ridges. The column is shorter than the labellum and has two wings widening towards the tip. Flowering occurs from July to November. Taxonomy and naming Cyrtostylis oblonga was first formally described in 1853 by Joseph Dalton Hooker and the description was published in Flora Novae-Zelandiae. The specific epithet (oblonga) is a Latin word meaning \\"longer than broad\\".

His notable work is a photo set called Pink Man. The set consists of photos of a man in pink silk tuxedo and his pink shopping cart shot in different locations around the world.  Biography  Manit was born in Bangkok and graduated from Srinakharinwirot University. After graduation, he worked as a photographer for Bureau Bangkok. In 2007 he won the Higashikawa Prize from photo fiesta in Hokkaido, Japan. He worked in film industry as a producer and cinematographer of Citizen Juling (2008), Shakespeare Must Die (2012) and Censor Must Die (2014).  Work  In 1982 Manit had his first exhibition in a group exhibition called \\"5 View Points\\" at Bhirasri Modern Art Institute, Bangkok. His first solo exhibition was \\"Artists in Back & White\\" in 1990 at Alliance Fran√ßaise, Bangkok. In 1985 he had his first international group exhibition \\"The 4th Asian Painting\\" in Brunei. He got his first solo international exhibition \\"Phantom Parody\\" in Singapore and \\"Bangkok in Pink\\" in Japan in 2002. = Pink Man = In 1997 he created the Pink Man collection to convey his attitude towards consumerism in Thailand and around the world. The first collection was called Pink Man Begins, featuring photos of a man in a pink silk tuxedo (played by Sompong Thawee) and his pink shopping cart in La-Lai-Sup market, Bangkok. According to Manit, \\"Pink Man is my upset and alienated feeling towards the concept of consumerism which has been accepted simply and without consideration by Thai society. I feel that this system has enslaved us without our realization. Moreover, we are being forced to act in the same way; there is a move towards uniformity. Pink Man is wandering quietly and smilelessly, like a robot\\". In 1998 he made a second set of photographs called Pink Man on Tour are taken at tourist locations in Thailand to show disagreement to the government's campaign called \\"Amazing Thailand\\". In 2000 he published the Pink Man on European Tour\\" photo set; in 2001 he made a photo set called Horror in Pink showing photos of the pink man edited into historical photos of the 1976 Thammasat University massacre to remind people of that event again. In 2003 he created the sets call Pink Man in Venice, Hungry Ghost, and Pink Man in Paradise. He published La Vie en Pink in 2004, Pink, White & Blue in 2005, Beijing pink in 2006 and made a model product from the Pink Man character as \\"Pink Man‚ÄîThe Icon of Consumerism\\" during 2007 ‚Äì 2008. = Kathmandu Gallery = In 2006 he also opened a gallery called Kathmandu Photo Gallery on Pan Road, Silom, Bangkok. It features his own works, but also the works of other artists. =Cinema Oasis= With collaborator and financial backer, Ing Kanjanavanit, AKA Ing K, Manit opened Cinema Oasis in central Bangkok. It has a 48-seat screening room with a five-metre screen and Dolby 5.1 surround sound system. Manit says that the initial urge to build the cinema was fueled the pair's outrage over the banning of their films. The cinema's mission has evolved into exposing people to films they would not normally see and to provide a platform for independent filmmakers. \\"Our first programme was a series called 'Beyond Pad Thai', Thai films that are underrated and little known,\\" he said. = Political work = In October 2007 Manit Sriwanichpoom and Vasan Sitthiket together founded a political party called the \\"Silapin Party\\", to criticize the policy of the Thai Rak Thai Party. Manit served as deputy chief, but later he quit the party on 15 November 2007. The party was disbanded in 2009.

Life The son of James Sterling, he entered Trinity College, Dublin as a scholar in 1718, graduating B.A. in 1720 and M.A. in 1733. In that year he went to London with his friend Matthew Concanen. In November 1737 Sterling took a living in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was from 1739 the minister of the Episcopal St. Paul's Church near Chestertown. His ministry lasted to 1763, and saw the brick church doubled in size. Sterling travelled to London in 1752. He had associated in a scheme, with Benjamin Franklin who brought in backers from Philadelphia, to develop the North-West Passage. Franklin had become a sponsor of Captain Charles Swaine, who eventually made a Labrador Sea expedition in the Argo, in 1753. Sterling, however, struck out on his own, with a group of London merchants, and went to the Board of Trade for them, seeking exclusive rights to trade on the Labrador coast. Plans came to nothing, when the Board favoured the Hudson Bay Company instead. Works Sterling published: *The Rival Generals, as it was acted at the Theatre Royal, Dublin (verse drama in five acts) *The Loves of Hero and Leander (1728) from the Greek of Mus√¶us, reissued with a smaller pieces as Poetical Works of the Rev. James Sterling (Dublin, 1734) *The Parricide: a tragedy (London, 1736, verse drama in five acts), given five times at Goodman's Fields in December 1735. It possibly had already been performed in Dublin, c.1726. Henry Giffard, manager of Goodman's Fields, was brother-in-law of Sterling's first wife. *An Epistle to the Hon. Arthur Dobbs (Dublin and London, 1752), long poem. It made much of the commercial prospects of the North-West Passage, as promoted by Arthur Dobbs. *Zeal against the enemies of our country, sermon preached 13 December 1754, printed at the Annapolis press in 1755. It was preached at the request of Horatio Sharpe, Maryland's governor, after an outbreak of frontier fighting. In 1724 Sterling made three contributions to Concanen's Poems, signed \\"J. S.\\" Family Sterling married, firstly, Nancy Lyddell, who had acted in The Rival Generals in Dublin. In 1723 they went on to London, and Nancy made her stage debut there. She had died by 1733. In Maryland, he married in 1743 Rebecca Holt, widow of the Rev. Arthur Holt, and they had a daughter Rebecca, who married William Carmichael. He married as his third wife Mary Smith, in 1749.

He begins drinking more heavily resulting in him holding Chrissie hostage and slashing her across the face with a scalpel. Stuart made his final appearance in series ten, episode 18, \\"The Extra Mile\\". Development Stuart is a locum cardiothoracic consultant who first appears in the series ten episode titled \\"The Apprentice\\", which was broadcast on 6 November 2007. The BBC had approached Mullen with the offer of playing the role of Stuart. The actor is often hired to assume the \\"bad guy\\" role. Holby City's series producer Diana Kyle described Stuart as \\"dishy\\", \\"sexy\\" and a \\"good-looking\\" new addition to the show. Mullen told Jon Horsley from TV Mag that \\"as a locum, Stuart knows he's not going to be at Holby forever, so he doesn't care about hospital politics. Stuart also gets the nurses' back up a bit by making changes. The man's a bit of a renegade!\\" The BBC described Stuart following his departure as \\"a people person full of Irish charm. But he was also a deeply jealous alcoholic and needed to control the person he saw as 'his'.\\" In his backstory his first wife Amelia had decided to leave Stuart due to his drinking. He arrives on the wards take on duties left by Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) who has decided to take a sabbatical. She tells registrars Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers) and Joseph Byrne (Luke Roberts) that they will need to impress Stuart. Stuart refuses to perform an operation on a heavy smoker and Sam supports his decision. But Joseph challenges him, which leads to Stuart favouring Joseph over Sam who he believes is immature. The show further developed Stuart's rivalries with Connie and Sam, but made an ally in fellow alcoholic Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola). When Connie arrives back from her leave early, she is unimpressed with how Stuart has ran Darwin and clashes with him. Stuart's time on the show sees him embark on a romantic relationship with sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). A Radio Times writer stated that \\"Stuart fails to make a good impression on Chrissie with his reorganisation of the ward, but his charm subdues her arguments.\\" Their connection was heightened when a crossbow attack was launched within the hospital. Mullen said of the storyline: \\"It is carnage. Stuart can‚Äôt get in touch with Chrissie. He knows a nurse has been shot, but doesn‚Äôt know which one.\\" Upon discovering that Chrissie was alive and well, the two characters shared a kiss, which Mullen stated \\"moves things forward between them. Stuart and Chrissie are both aware that this could go further ‚Äì and it possibly will!\\" As they continue their romance, Chrissie often spends time with her ex- boyfriend Sam who is suffering from cancer. When Sam falls asleep and misses an operation Stuart excuses his behaviour but Keith Greene (Alex Macqueen) becomes concerned and reports the situation to Connie. Chrissie believes that Stuart orchestrated the situation to remove Sam from the ward. Hobley told a What's on TV reporter that Stuart \\"becomes slightly possessive and he's always there when she's with Sam. Then Chrissie finds out that he‚Äôs tried to get Sam off her ward and he‚Äôs done it in a way that makes Sam look incompetent.\\" Chrissie decides to end her relationship when she finds evidence of Stuart's vendetta against Sam. She discovers missing patient notes in Stuart's locker that he had stolen from Sam. This causes Stuart to start drinking more frequently and his behaviour becomes erratic. Hobley told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Stuart \\"basically lost the plot\\". He goes to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings but starts discussing Chrissie to fellow attendees. She decides to move on but \\"unbeknownst to Chrissie, he's been ranting about her [...] he's convinced himself that they can get back together, but she knows that's never going to happen.\\" While on shift a patient under Chrissie's care suffers heavy bleeding and Stuart is forced to work alongside her. Chrissie notices Stuart has been drinking alcohol and confronts him. She is shocked to learn the full extent of his alcoholism and refuses to work with him. Stuart sees this as a rejection and harasses her to get back together. Hobley explained that Stuart loves Chrissie and cannot give her up and her rejection \\"sends him over the edge\\" leading to an \\"awful confrontation\\". Stuart chases Chrissie in an operating theatre and slashes her across the face with a scalpel. He then ties her up, gags her mouth and stitches her face up. As Stuart is drunk he makes \\"an awful job\\" of Chrissie's wound. The actress described the scenes as \\"horrific\\" and said her character is \\"absolutely terrified\\". Connie arrives outside of the theatre and manages to free Chrissie. Hobley later recalled the difficulty she and Mullen had filming the scenes. She said \\"I was being chased around the operating theatre with a scalpel four months pregnant, pretending I wasn't pregnant  that was hard work.\\" On-screen Stuart continues his abuse and tries to convince Connie that Chrissie is mentally ill and cut herself. Stuart then tries to locate Chrissie, who goes into hiding to escape him. Hobley said the attack leaves her character \\"physically and psychologically scarred\\". She then has to find evidence to convince everyone that Stuart was the one who caused her injuries. Stuart is subsequently arrested, and makes his final appearance in series ten, episode 18, \\"The Extra Mile\\". Stuart then tries to make amends with Chrissie by sending her a compensation cheque for twenty-five-thousand pounds. Reception A writer from the Daily Record included the episode in which Stuart attacked Chrissie in their \\"pick of the day\\" feature. They said it had \\"devastating consequences\\" and branded it a \\"disastrous turn of events\\". A Daily Star writer also named the episode in their \\"pick of the day\\". They branded Stuart as \\"seriously bladdered\\" and \\"deranged\\". A What's on TV reporter branded Stuart a \\"sexy surgeon\\" and added that Chrissie thought she had found \\"the one\\" when she got with him. The Swanswell Trust project, a domestic violence charity produced by Warwickshire County Council, welcomed the storyline for helping to raise awareness. They assessed that \\"if Stuart's character got in touch with the Swanswell Trust, they would work with him to reduce the levels of alcohol he was drinking to within safe limits by exploring how his current use affects others. If Chrissie contacted them, she would be given support to make choices about her life, referred for counselling and would receive help to keep safe.\\" A reporter from the Coventry Telegraph said that Stuart and Chrissie's storyline was \\"hard-hitting\\" and highlighted a problem in British society. A Liverpool Daily Post writer said that Stuart gets \\"drunk and goes bonkers\\" and called it a \\"shocking storyline\\" and \\"ghoulish plot\\". Inside Soap's Katy Moon believed that Stuart was a \\"psychotic\\" character and thought the attack on Chrissie made \\"horrifying\\" and \\"gritty\\" scenes.

History  The CUS Roma Rugby is born officially in 1947 as the rugby union section of the Centro Universitario Sportivo di Roma, which collects the legacy of the university sports group of the fascist era. Under the name GUF Roma, the team took part in serie A from 1934/35 to 1942/43, last championship played before the suspension due to the bellic events. In 1950‚Äì51 CUS Roma is the first university club in the post-war to return in the top division. It was a short-lived experience, terminated with the relegation in serie B. In 1956‚Äì57 the team takes part again in serie A, where they manage to resist for three consecutive seasons. The first golden age for CUS Roma opens in 1962‚Äì63 with the return in the top division. The university club was suddenly projected to the top of the Italian rugby union. In 1964‚Äì65 and in 1965‚Äì66 CUS was in the second place for two consecutive times behind the eventual Italian champions, Partenope. In 1966‚Äì67 the team reaches the third place, behind L'Aquila and the eventual champions, Fiamme Oro Padova. In the same season, in a historic final, CUS Roma beats CUS Torino 15‚Äì3 and wins the first edition of Coppa Italia. The magical era stopped abruptly the following year, when CUS experienced one of the several splits that devastated its history. The entire team passed in block to Buscaglione Roma, a newly-formed team which acquired CUS' sports tile and the right to take part in the top division. The university club had to start over. The team would not return to Serie A until the summer of 1974, with the victory against CUS Napoli in the decisive play-off which was played inL'Aquila, even if the permanence in the top division that time lasted the timespan of one season. The club's importance at domestic level is witnessed also by the election of Sergio Luzzi-Conti, former head of the rugby union section and then e CUS Roma president, to the office of president of Federazione Italiana Rugby, which he maintained from 1971 to 1974. In 1973 Luzzi-Conti was the inspirator of Italy first tour in South Africa, which marked an important breakthrough for the Italian rugby union. The second CUS Roma Rugby's golden age was in the 1980s, with Alberto Gualtieri as chairman. The university club returns in Serie A for a season in 1982‚Äì83, but it was not until 1986‚Äì87 where the journey of a generation of new talents started. In four consecutive seasons the team takes parte to the Serie A1, new name assumed by the top division. In those years the championship registered the presence of the most important international players, who joined from the major Italian clubs. In the historic Acqua Acetosa field, CUS faced several rugby stars such as David Campese, John Kirwan and Naas Botha. Notwithstanding with the disproportion between the forces in field, CUS Roma does not demerit and, according to many fans, played the most beautiful and spectacular game of the championship, thanks to the quality of its backs. Many CUS players in those years were called up in the national team (Tinari, Pratichetti, Caranci, Salvati, De Biase, Ambrosio, to cite a few names). The player that was a symbol of that generation was Stefano Barba, centre with outstanding attack abilities who took part at the 1987 Rugby World Cup and collected more than 30 caps for Italy. In the same years the youth sector was submitted to a development, which reached the top levels of the domestic scene, as demonstrated in the several finals reached in the various categories and the title of Italian Champion won by the under-17 squad in 1983.84 (under the name CUS Roma) and in 1985/86 (under the name Primavera Roma). However, a breakaway group of executives and coaches of the youth teams in the late 1980s founded an autonomous team, l'U.S. Primavera, where the youth sector growth is still one of the club's main goals. In the early 1990s are inaugurated the university sports facilities in Tor di Quinto, where it stands \\"the biggest rugby field in Italy\\". CUS Roma finally had an own playing field. It could be the chance for a further step forward, but the rising financial restrainments and a series of team vicissitudes marked the start of an era of gradual resizing of the CUS' ambitions. The first team, relegated in Serie A2 in 1989‚Äì90, dispute again a competition in the top division in 1993‚Äì94. In the following season the team plays in Serie A2 and is relegated to Serie B to later return in Serie A2 in 1995‚Äì96. That season was the last appearance in Serie A. Another split from a group of players and coaches gave birth to Unione Rugby Capitolina, weakening the CUS' organic in all the categories. From 1996 to 1997, CUS Roma Rugby plays in Serie B competition. In the last two seasons, the entire CUS Roma team underwent a renovation, which brought to the election Gianfranco Morrone as chairman. The renovation affected also the rugby section: the new section Board, made up entirely of active players, is working hard to bring back the university rugby team of the capital to its level. At the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, CUS Roma achieved the promotion to Serie A after 19 seasons played in Serie B (see La storia del CUS on cusromarugby.com). The 2015‚Äì2016 season was not as lucky for the team, which did not manage to remain in the top division, thus being relegated to Serie B.

Photo by Walter Kaudern. Moraego (or raego, or marego), is the name of a traditional and ritual dance in Central Sulawesi. In historical time, Central Sulawesi highlanders have performed circle dances and accompanying songs (in Uma raego) at all major precolonial rituals. The Moraego dances and songs were performed to summon and communicate with their pre-Christian deities. They were ritual procedures, among other things, to augment the agriculture and human fertility of highland families. In the course of time many dances have become profane dances. The first European missionaries and scholars working in the area debated among themselves by the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century if the dances and the songs held a religious component, or were mere secular entertainment. Missionaries, as well as Dutch authorities, sought to reduce the moraego performances for various reasons. For the authorities the problem was that the dances and rituals took time from doing \\"real work\\". In the dances there was close physical contact between men and women and this was something European missionaries objected to. Married women did not dance the ¬¥raego, although they and their children were audience to these public events. But the wives participated in the choice and invitation of their husbands dance partners.  Early reports  From the end of the 19th century there are several descriptions of the Moraego dances and rituals, especially from the Palu Toradja, the Koro Toradja, as well as the Poso Toradja. Similar dances are also known from the Mori District in East Central Sulawesi and from the so called Saadang Toradja in the south-western part of Central Sulawesi. In 1897 Adriani and Kruyt witnessed a raego in Kulawi on their journey across Central Sulawesi. Captain Boonstra van Heerdt, a dutchman records the raego from Kulawi, Lindu and other places.  Healing  Not all ¬¥raego songs were oriented toward courtship activities. Rather, like other ritual speech forms in eastern Indonesia, the songs served more generally as performative elements of religious rituals and as hallowed words that had binding effects on human and deity relations. For example, some types included trance-like chanting that was meant to heal and cure sickness.  Pubarty rites  While the children were confined to heal and fed only rice porridge after the puberty rites, adults celebrated just outside the temple singing and dancing moraego every night. One animal was sacrificed for every girl and for every three to five boys.

The building has been renovated to serve commercial tenants, including Rochester Mills Beer Company. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History In 1844, Hosea B. Richardson built a wool carding and cloth-dressing mill at this location. This original building was destroyed by fire in 1867. A new building, the Rochester Woolen Mill, was constructed soon after, and purchased by Hosea's son Samuel Richardson, who owned the Western Knitting Works in Detroit. This new plant produced woolen goods until it too was destroyed by fire in 1882. In 1891, stockholders in the Western Knitting Works bought out Richardson, reorganized it, and changed the name to Western Knitting Mills Inc. They moved the company's headquarters to Rochester, and built another mill in Middleville, Michigan. In 1896, the company began construction of this plant in Rochester. The original 1896 plant was constructed in a U-shape, and included a three-story watchtower on one corner, which for use by the village as a night fire watchtower. The mill measures 60,000 square feet, and had its own hydro generating station, two large warehouses and two dormitories on site, as well as a railroad spur directly onto the property. The mill made knitted wool socks, gloves and mittens until 1916, when it began making wool cloth. At some point the U-shaped factory was filled in to make a square, and in 1916 an addition was constructed to handle the cloth making. During World War I, the government commissioned the factory to make khaki gloves for U.S. soldiers. However, after the war, business began to decline, and the mill closed in 1927. In 1929, the Bradley Knitting Company of Wisconsin purchased the factory to produce yarn and knitted cloth, but the onset of the Great Depression forced the mill to close again in 1931. It reopened briefly in 1933, but soon closed again permanently. After that, several other companies used the factory beginning in the 1940s, including McAleer Manufacturing Company, Higbie Manufacturing, Avon Tube and ITT-Higbie. The last manufacturer, ITT-Higbie, closed the plant in 1993 and sold it to private owners in 1997, who renovated it for commercial use. During and previous to the renovation, the other buildings on the property were demolished, leaving only the 1896 mill in place. The Rochester Mills Beer Company opened in the building in 1998, and as of 2018 still occupies the ground floor. Description The Western Knitting Mills factory is a two-story, brick late nineteenth-century mill building with a square plan. The building measures 140 feet by 150 feet. The building has a built-up roof and a fieldstone foundation with a basement. The building is eight bays wide on each original elevation, with bays separated by brick pilasters projecting from the building. The north elevation, originally the interior of the U shape, has three bays on each side of the former courtyard. Each bay contains two windows set in flat arched openings. The windowsills and parapet caps are of stone. The main entry fronts into what is now a parking lot, and is topped with a high parapet and a carved name block which make it a visual focal point. A three-story fire tower is located on one corner of the building. The original tower was demolished in the early 1900s, but it was reconstructed during the 1997-98 renovation of the building. The tower has a hipped roof with dormers on each side.

Competition Format Player eligibility Players under 20 years of age cannot play for a county's senior and under-20 championship teams. This rule was introduced to prevent player burnout and to allow the senior and under-20 championships to be scheduled in the same summer months with separate panels of players. If an under-20 player plays for a county's senior championship team, he is ineligible to play for their under-20 team. This rule results in some county under-20 county teams playing without their best under-20 footballers. For example, Sean O'Shea and David Clifford played for the Kerry senior championship team in 2018 and therefore were not allowed to play for the Kerry under-20 team which meant that the under-20 team was weakened.

It has been the governing party of the Northern Territory since winning the 2016 election under Michael Gunner. It previously held office from 2001 to 2012. History The first Labor candidate from the Northern Territory‚Äîwhich was then represented by the Northern Territory seat in the South Australian House of Assembly‚Äîwas Pine Creek miner and former City of Adelaide alderman James Robertson in 1905. The first Labor MP was Thomas Crush, who was elected at a 1908 by-election and accepted into the South Australian Labor caucus despite not having signed the Labor pledge. He was re-elected in 1910, and served until the Northern Territory formally separated from South Australia in 1911, resulting in the loss of the seat in state parliament. A non-voting federal seat in the Australian House of Representatives, the Division of Northern Territory, was established for the 1922 election, and was won by independent candidate and former union leader Harold George Nelson, who joined the Labor caucus after the election.James, B. (2008) \\"Crush, Thomas George (Tom)\\" and \\"Nelson, Harold George\\", Northern Territory Dictionary of Biography, Revised Edition, ed. Carment, D, Edward, C. et al., Charles Darwin University Press: Darwin. . In March 1928, a general meeting of the North Australian Workers Union resolved to establish a Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party and elected an interim executive. In July 1928, it was reported that the federal secretary had requested that the South Australian branch instead form a Darwin branch. It was reported in October 1928 that affiliation with the South Australian branch had been granted, and that the South Australian state executive had re-endorsed Nelson to contest the 1929 election. An Alice Springs branch was established in 1947. The Northern Territory branch was upgraded to receive the status of a state branch in August 1967. The Northern Territory Legislative Council was established in 1947 as a partly elected representative body with limited powers, with the Labor Party endorsing candidates from the first election. Labor members of the Legislative Council included Tom Bell, Eric Marks, Charles Orr, Len Purkiss, Tom Ronan, and Richard Ward In 1974, the Legislative Council was replaced by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in preparation for self-governance. However, the 1974 election was disastrous for Labor, which failed to win a single seat. The party recovered to some extent at the 1977 election, winning six seats. However, over the next 24 years, it never came particularly close to winning government; it never won more than nine seats at an election and never held more than two seats in the Darwin/Palmerston area at any time.Green, Antony. 2005 election summary. ABC News, 15 April 2005. As a result, Labor remained in opposition until 2001 election, when Clare Martin led the party to government for the first time primarily on the strength of a near-sweep of Darwin, including all seven seats in the northern part of the capital. Four years later, in 2005, Martin led Labor to one of the most comprehensive victories on record at the state or territory level, winning 19 out of 25 seats, the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory. Martin retired in 2007 and was succeeded by Paul Henderson. Under Henderson, Labor won a third term with a reduced majority in 2008 before being defeated by the CLP at the 2012 election. After one term in opposition, Labor returned to power at the 2016 election. Under Michael Gunner, Labor won a landslide almost as massive as the one it won in 2005, with 18 seats, the third-largest majority government in the history of the Territory. Gunner was reelected in 2020 with a somewhat reduced mandate of 14 seats.

The army was made up of 10,000 infantry, 1,600 cavalry and 1,000 naval troops. It is not known how many men formed the artillery unit but it did not exceed 700. In total, the army contained 13,000 regular troops. On July 9, 1713, the Principality of Catalonia declared war on the Kingdom of France and the Duke of Anjou (Philip V of Spain), who since the Catalan constitutions of 1706 did not recognize him as the legitimate king of the Monarchy of Spain and the next day it published a ban to remove troops for the Army of Catalonia, being his first units the Regiment of the Deputation of the General of Catalonia and the Regiment of the City of Barcelona. For the position of general commander of the Army they appointed Lieutenant Marshal Antoni de Villarroel i Pel√°ez on July 10. The artillery and the Cavalry Regiment of the Faith were financed by the merchant Amador Dalmau and Colom, as well as two ships for the Navy.

They were formed by militarized citizens of the guilds Offices Even so, the Coroneles and mercenary troops such as miquelets were not included in the army, the troops had to be professional and well-armed.  Cavalry  The cavalry, in the first moments of the formation of the Army of Catalonia, were of a high strategic importance. Thanks to its high mobility, the Catalan authorities hoped to use it to avoid the collapse of important sites in Bourbon hands and open fronts in the interior of Catalonia.

The book reports on how careful observations can lead to correlations between transmission of infective disease between families, farms and villages. It contains the detailed observational studies of a 1928 epidemic of catarrhal jaundice and a 1929 epidemic of Bornholm disease which were published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1930 and 1933 respectively. Background William Pickles first realised the possibilities for epidemiological studies for a GP after he read James Mackenzie's The Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment in Heart Affections in the 1920s. With the assistance of his wife Gertie, who kept the charts, Pickles recorded his observations on a 1928 epidemic of catarrhal jaundice and a 1929 epidemic of Bornholm Disease in his district. His findings were published in the British Medical Journal in 1930 and 1933 respectively and in 1935 he presented them at the Royal Society of Medicine. The work was praised by Major Greenwood who wrote that Pickles's work would mark a \\"new era in epidemiology\\". His observations led to new understandings of the transmission of infective disease within families, farms and villages. Research and content Epidemiology in Country Practice contains Pickles's observational studies and a number of articles previously published in medical journals, including the detailed observational studies of the 1928 epidemic of jaundice and the 1929 epidemic of Bornholm disease. The book has been described as more of an essay on epidemiology than a book filled with masses of data. Most of the research was done between 1929 and 1939. From 1937, in order to work on the book, Pickles kept evening surgeries \\"to a minimum and often there were no patients at all\\". He methodically reported patterns of prevalent diseases in his area; however, his data collection and publications lacked the consent processes now considered necessary to avoid identification of individuals afflicted by epidemics, particularly in small communities where recognition of persons is deemed easier. Pickles was well acquainted with the eight villages he looked after, and once, as he looked down upon Wensleydale from the top of a hill, realised that he knew everyone in the village and most on first-name basis. The book begins with a personal appeal by Pickles for GPs to consider the importance of observations, followed by eight chapters that cover cases such as \\"influenza, measles, scarlet fever, whooping-cough, and mumps\\", as a well as jaundice and myalgia. One story is that of a \\"gypsy\\" who accompanied her sick husband into the village in a caravan. Her husband was suffering from typhoid and Pickles was able to trace the source of the disease to a faulty water pump that the wife used to wash her laundry. In the book, he compares the case to the work of one of his heroes, William Budd, who carried out similar observations. The book also describes an epidemic of catarrhal jaundice that resulted in 250 cases out of a population of almost 6,000, many of which were children. The exact incubation period was not known and ranged from 3 to 40 days. After two years of keeping records and with assistance from the Ministry of Health, Pickles was able to show that the incubation period was 26‚Äì35 days. He cross-referenced the evidence with smaller studies in neighbouring villages and in one case was able to trace 13 infections to a single country maid who was determined to attend a fete despite Pickles attending to her in her sickbed the same morning.GB/2134/ B PIC PERSONAL PAPERS WILLIAM PICKLES, Royal College of General Practitioners, 2006. One of the cases was another young woman and her male friend who, according to his (the man's) sister, often went \\"in the back door in the evenings, and helps her wash up\\", causing Pickles to observe that \\"studies in epidemiology sometimes reveal romances.\\"Pickles, William Norman. (1949) Epidemiology in Country Practice. Bristol: John Wright & Sons. pp. 68-69. Publication history The book was first published by John Wright & Sons of Bristol in 1939. It had a preface by Major Greenwood, professor of epidemiology and vital statistics at the University of London. In April 1941, during the Second World War, the entire stock of the book, unbound sheets and the type were completely destroyed by enemy action but such was the demand for the book that in 1949 it was reissued in virtually identical form. In 1970, a limited edition was published with profits going to the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) appeal. The book was subsequently reprinted by Devonshire Press of Torquay in 1972 and in later editions by the RCGP (1984: ). Reception and legacy The book was described by John Horder in 1969 as a \\"classic\\", that \\"makes it all sound too easy and one wonders why no one had thought of it all before\\". Pickles's obituary in the British Medical Journal in 1969 declared that it had \\"received excellent notices\\" and in 2004, J.A. Reid portrayed it as \\"a seminal book that has been read and assessed during past decades by many public health students and practitioners\\". Later, RCGP president Denis Pereira Gray described it as \\"a masterpiece recognised throughout the world\\" and that practice-based research should be modelled on Pickles's thorough and accurate recording. The book facilitated the link between research and primary care, resulting in the modern expansion of surveillance practices for improvements in public health. In addition, it revealed that general practitioners could carry out \\"world class research\\" in the community.  Further reading   * Pemberton, John.

Lagos steam tramway was a passenger and sanitary tramway that carried cargo and passengers within Lagos Colony. The tram was an important public transit system connecting travelers and merchandise from Ibadan and Abeokuta via the railway terminus at Iddo, mainland Lagos to Port of Lagos. The system ran from 1902 to 1933, it carried passengers and goods for twelve years from 1902 to 1914 and nightsoil from 1906 to 1933. Steam tramway =Passenger and goods line= Between 1901 and 1902, public sanitation and mosquito eradication palliatives resulted in the construction of an iron bridge over Five Cowrie Creek and swamp land reclamation projects at Kokomaiko. When the colonial government completed the Lagos to Ibadan rail track, the terminal on the Lagos side ended on Lagos mainland and a system had to be devised to link Iddo with the Port of Lagos and other areas on the Island. In 1901, construction commenced of a single track over Carter Bridge. The tram was open to the public in 1902, the passenger cars ran northwards from Kokomaiko in the Marina side of Lagos passing customs wharf then turning left into Balogun St to Iddo train terminus via Ereko, Ebute Ero, Idumota and Carter Bridge. The passenger line was one of the earliest public transport system built within Lagos, it carried travelers, traders and workers from the train station at Iddo going to Lagos Island. The line was a single track tramway with a 2 ft 6 in gauge and 7 passing loops on the track. There was a run-in at Iddo terminus with sidings to the goods warehouse.

Allan worked as a compositor in Edinburgh, and joined the Social Democratic Federation. He was active in the Scottish Typographical Association (STA) and the Edinburgh Trades Council. He attended the STUC from its foundation, always taking a prominent part in debates. Allan was first elected to the General Council of the STUC in 1899, and on the council he championed the creation of a Scottish Labour Representation Committee, to stand Parliamentary candidates on behalf of the socialist, trade union and co-operative movements. This was formed as the Scottish Workers' Representation Committee, and Allan became its first secretary, although in 1902 he was replaced by leader of the STUC, George Carson. In 1913, Allan stood to become general secretary of the STA, but he took third place with only 581 votes, behind Charles Jackson and the winner, James Brown. He was re-elected to the Parliamentary Committee of the STUC in 1912, and in this role gave some support to the Red Clydeside movement, arguing that its actions were \\"hasty and unwise\\", but that the committee should not ignore it, but instead try to give it guidance. By 1917, Carson was seventy years old and looking to reduce his involvement in the STUC. Allan had developed a strong working relationship with Carson, and was also the STUC President that year. He was seen as the natural choice to become his assistant secretary. The following year, he succeeded Carson as Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the STUC, its leading figure. Allan believed that the organisation was ineffective, and gave too much power to small unions. At the 1919 Congress, he proposed adopting a block vote system similar to that used by the Trades Union Congress, but this was opposed by a majority of unions. Carson persuaded the Parliamentary Committee to found a Labour Institute in Glasgow, as a fitting base for the STUC. He purchased a site, with the STUC meeting monthly repayments, but it was only in 1922 that affiliated unions became aware of the deal. With union memberships falling as unemployment rose, the deal became unaffordable, and Allan was suspended. A couple of days later, he was seriously injured at Carlisle railway station and lost both his legs. In sympathy, he was allowed to stand down on good terms, but never again played a leading role in the trade union movement.

He was the oldest still active Disney creator shortly before his death.  Disney comics  His work for Disney Italia started in 1953 when he was inking for Giovan Battista Carpi, who was also his most important artistic influence. The first stories he had drawn entirely himself were published in Topolino 1956. As an author, he debuted in 1964 but didn't start writing regularly until the mid-1970s. Most of his self-penned stories were released in the 1980s, when he was also dabbling with unusual formats: From 1986 to 1995, he wrote and drew several comics which consisted of mostly four \\"painted panels\\" per page. These panels were created with a technique that involved airbrush, oil paint and / or watercolour, and subsequently used as the background for \\"normal\\" drawings of the main comic figures. For three of these stories, he also created cover illustrations in that style, as featured on Topolino 1707, 1741 and 1891. A few other artists such as Sergio Asteriti, Roberto Marini, Marco Ghighlione, Luciano Gatto and Moreno Chist√© (who was also involved with the colouring of some Chierchini comics) also experimented with this two-rows-per-page format in this periodSearch results at INDUCKS. According to Chierchini, these painted panels were well-received by the readers, but weren't to the liking of the Italian editors. In this period, Chierchini wrote, painted and drew a lot of stories that featured his creation Little Gum, an alien humanoid duck that eats chewing gum and can use it for various purposes, alongside Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie. In his first story, Little Gum was introduced as an enemy of Duck Avenger but became an ally of his when the Beagle Boys tried to rob the Money Bin. In 1994, two Disney comics (co-)written but not drawn by Giulio Chierchini (this was done by Moreno Chist√© instead) were released. They turned out to be some of his last published works as a Disney author, as Topolino has not published any stories written by him after 1995. He is nonetheless still working for Topolino as an artist only. While Chierchini was clearly influenced by Carpi, he quickly developed his own signature style. The typical facial expressions (with Scrooge and the Beagle Boys in particular often being displayed as rather aggressive) and Chierchini's penchant for gothic architecture make his art unmistakable. \\"Gothic\\" themes also regularly appear in his stories, such as \\"Topolino e Little Gum fantasmi a bizzeffe\\", \\"Topolino e le vendite a domicilio\\" (Mickey helping a ghost sales agent who sells things to other ghosts), \\"Zio Paperone i fantasmi B. B.\\" (Beagle Boys as fake ghosts) and \\"Topolino & Pippo ghostbusters (cacciatori di fantasmi)\\" which obviously parodies Ghostbusters, but also marks the re-appearance of the Ghost of Black Brian from the Floyd Gottfredson continuity. Another character revived partially by Chierchini is Doctor Vulter in \\"Topolino e il ritorno dell'artiglio magnetico\\", written by Guido Martina.  Other work  Before he started working for Disney, Chierchini had tried his hand at animation and turned his hand to drawing for various Italian titles (\\"Volpetto\\", \\"Mao & Okey\\", \\"Castorino\\", \\"Tik Corvo\\", \\"Dan Lepre\\") and created the character/series \\"Nonna Abelarda\\". Later in his career, he also worked for the German publisher Kauka. Together with collaborators Valerio Oss, Moreno Chist√® and Sandra Verda, he created a five-hour instructory video for aspiring comic creators.

The embryonic development of the larva occurs as a series of stages. During stage 1, the first cleavage occurs, which gives rise to an AB and a CD blastomere, and is in the interphase of this cell division when a yolk-free cytoplasm called teloplasm is formed. The teloplasm is known to be a determinant for the specification of the D cell fate. In stage 3, during the second cleavage, an unequal division occurs in the CD blastomere. As a consequence, it creates a large D cell on the left and a smaller C cell to the right. This unequal division process is dependent on actomyosin, and by the end of stage 3 the AB cell divides. On stage 4 of development, the micromeres and teloblast stem cells are formed and subsequently, the D quadrant divides to form the DM and the DNOPQ teloblast precursor cells. By the end stage 6, the zygote contains a set of 25 micromeres, 3 macromeres (A, B and C) and 10 teloblasts derived from the D quadrant. The teloblasts are pairs of five different types (M, N, O, P, and Q) of embryonic stem cells that form segmented columns of cells (germinal band) in the surface of the embryo. The M-derived cells make mesoderm and some small set of neurons, N results in neural tissues and some ventral ectoderm, Q contributes to the dorsal ectoderm and O and P in the leech are equipotent cells (same developmental potential) that produce lateral ectoderm; however the difference between the two of them is that P creates bigger batches of dorsolateral epidermis than O. The sludgeworm Tubifex, unlike the leech, specifies the O and P lineages early in development and therefore, these two cells are not equipotent. Each segment of the body of the leech is generated from one M, O, P cell types and two N and two Q cells types. The ectoderm and mesoderm of the body trunk are exclusively derived from the teloblast cells in a region called the posterior progress zone. The head of the leech that comes from an unsegmented region, is formed by the first set of micromeres derived from A, B, C and D cells, keeping the bilateral symmetry between the AD and BC cells.

Innovate Trust provides supported living services to adults with learning disabilities, mental health conditions, physical disabilities or sensory impairments in Cardiff, the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhondda Cynon Taff. The charity is based on Cowbridge Road East in Canton, Cardiff. The charity employees over 850 individuals across a 20-mile radius, primarily as support workers. Innovate Trust is one of the largest supported living providers operating in South East Wales. The charity was originally established by a group of student volunteers, including the charities main founder Jim Mansell CBE, from Cardiff University in the academic year of 1967/68. The charity was originally called Cardiff Universities Social Services or C.U.S.S. before being renamed to \\"Innovate Trust\\" on 22 April 2002 by Rhodri Morgan AM.  History  = Early development (1967‚Äì1973) = Innovate Trust was formally named Cardiff Universities Social Services (C.U.S.S.). It was established as a student volunteering project in the academic year of 1967.Initial Report on the Possibility of Establishing a Group Home of Young Volunteers and Mentally Subnormal Young People in the City of Cardiff: Cardiff University Social Services CUSS. (Report). Cardiff Universities Social Services. 1971. The volunteers worked supporting adults with learning disabilities at Ely Hospital to go on day trips, learn new skills and to act as a social contact. The volunteers worked with a group of 25 adults with learning disabilities. = The first supported living home (1974) = After the success of the early volunteering project, the students felt more could be done to improve the lives of those with learning disabilities. After much planning and preparation, working with Cardiff University, Cardiff Council and Ely Hospital the volunteers opened the UK‚Äôs first traditional group home on 13 July 1974 at 12 Ruthin Gardens, Cathays, Cardiff. Five adults with learning disabilities from the hospital moved into the property with three student volunteers. During the day the group home tenants would spend their time at Trelai adult training centre whilst the students were attending lectures. = Expansion and further development (1975‚Äì1983) = After the success of the group home experiment, the charity relocated the tenants to a more stable residency at Kings Road in Cardiff. The volunteers spent the next nine years raising awareness of this new model of support delivery, sharing their lessons with local authorities, hospitals and universities. The charity went on to open more group homes, funded by the Welsh Office consisting of both volunteers and paid staff support workers. Part of the charities work in this time included producing reports, evaluations and recommendations for the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council. In 1977, the charity opened a short respite centre for adults with learning disabilities on Boverton Street in Cardiff. This home was used to provide a break for carers and adults with learning disabilities who still lived at home with their families. The property was moved to Hamilton Street in Canton, Cardiff in 1980 where it is still operated by the charity. In response to the charities work with learning disabilities, the social services department at Cardiff County Council set up a new department in 1981, called NIMROD or New Ideas for Mentally Retarded in Ordinary Dwellings, in order to replicate and extend the Cardiff Universities Social Services model of providing support to adults with learning disabilities, opening a number of supported living homes in Cardiff and the surrounding areas.Community Based Services Provision for People with Learning Difficulties: NIMROD an Overview; a Summary Report of a Five Year Research Study. (Report). Mental Handicap in Wales: Applied Research Unit 1990. In 1983, partially in response to the Ely Hospital Scandal, the Welsh Office launched the \\"All Wales Strategy for the development of Services for mentally handicapped people\\". This new piece of legislation, requiring local authorities to move away from the institutionalised model of support, highlighted Cardiff Universities Social Services as an archetypal model to be shared across Wales.All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People. 1983. = Sharing the C.U.S.S. model (1984‚Äì1990) = In response to the All Wales Strategy, supported living expanded rapidly across Wales, and the rest of the UK, with Cardiff Universities Social Services taking a leading role in either directly setting up new services or advising newly formed bodies on resettlement and supported living. In 1985 C.U.S.S. helped develop the Opportunity Housing Trust (renamed to Mirus in 2012http://www.mirus- wales.org.uk/), a large organisation set up to extend the C.U.S.S. supported living model across Wales by providing advice, guidance and transferring staff and trustees to the newly formed charity. In 1988, after many years of rapid expansion, Cardiff Universities Social Services, working with Mencap Cymru, the Welsh Office and parents groups split its operations, combined with new contracts from local authorities to create Catrefi Cymru; another all wales supported living charity adopting the C.U.S.S. approach. = Diversification (1991‚Äìonward) = After several years of expansion and later reduction, the charity remained with a large number of supported living homes in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan but began to expand the range of services they provided for adults with learning disabilities across South East Wales. In 1991 the charity launched a bespoke employment agency for adults with learning disabilities called Quest. In 1997 the charity established two emergency accommodation centres for adults with learning disabilities in crisis to stop them from becoming homeless. In 2001, the charity was renamed to Innovate Trust and made a formal partnership with Student Volunteering Cardiff - SVC (previously known as Cardiff Student Community Action ‚Äì CSCA) a charity that had been working alongside C.U.S.S since its origins. In 2003 the charity added a catering division to support adults with learning disabilities to learn to cook and to have meaningful employment, consisting of a catering company and three cafes across Cardiff and the Vale. In 2013 the charity expanded its operations to provide supported living services for an additional 89 adults with learning disabilities in Rhondda Cynon Taff, also opening a new regional office in Talbot Green Business Park, Pontyclun. In 2014 the charity launched a new department called Green Days carrying out environmental work, training and outdoor opportunities for adults with learning disabilities In 2017, Innovate Trust launched a new research project in partnership with Nesta, the Welsh Government and Cardiff University exploring smart technology and the use of smart speakers for supported living tenants. The charity was awarded the Wales Council for Voluntary Action‚Äôs digital inclusion award for its innovative and inclusive use of technology. This is the first known project of its kind and received a lot of attention from various media outlets. After the initial research project the charity expanded this technology to all 197 individuals it supports in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It sits at the junction of tracks which are now owned by CSX Transportation and Canadian National Railway. History Saw and grist mills were established in what is now Holly in 1843 and 1844, and a village slowly grew up around them. However, real growth only began with the arrival of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway (later the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway and now part of the Canadian National Railway) in 1855. The D & M Railway constructed a small wooden depot, and soon replaced it with a better one. In 1864, a second railroad line, the Flint and Holly Railroad (now part of the CSX Saginaw Subdivision), was completed into Holly. The two rail lines co-operated to build a union depot to serve both lines, located at the site of the present depot. This wooden depot burned in 1884. The two railways created temporary space for passengers in their freight sheds, and in September 1885 contracted with Heitsch and Son of Pontiac to construct a new depot and baggage room. Construction began in October and was complete in February 1886. The depot served passengers on the two lines and their successors until 1964, when the Grand Trunk Western Railroad ceased passenger operations through Holly. It was later used as storage by the railroad, and in 1998 the village of Holly purchased the building. It has since been restored. As of 2018, the depot may be moved to another location. Description The Holly Union Depot is a long, single story cross-gable-roof structure made from reddish-orange and yellow-buff brick on a stone foundation. It has broadly overhanging eaves supported by open triangular timber brackets. Gabled projections are on each long side; these once contained separate ticket offices for the two railways. A rectangular carved stone plaque is set into the facade of each projection, containing the town name, HOLLY, in raised capital letters.

Early life  Peraza was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1838 to Nicanor Bolet Poleo y Ega√±a and Mar√≠a del Pilar Peraza Sosa. He was one of six siblings and was the younger brother of the artist Ramon Bolet Peraza. At the age of one Peraza and his family relocated to Barcelona, Venezuela where his father would establish a printing press. This press would soon work both Ramon and Nicanor who would both go on to pursue interests in publication. Eventually Nicanor and Ramon established their first magazine, El Oasis. Nicanor would be pushed away from publishing due to the declaration of the Federal War in 1859. At the age of 21, he enlisted in the federal army and fought in Venezuela's largest war since Spanish independence. Following the Federalist victory in 1863, Peraza would return to his birthplace of Caracas and work together with his brother to establish the Rotary Museum Illustrated, a political newspaper. Peraza would also soon marry Mar√≠a Perfecta Monagas Marrero and have four children.  Political career  Having earned the rank of Brigadier General during the war, Peraza took an active role in national policy. He was appointed as a representative in congress while simultaneously maintaining his work in publication which largely focused on national opinion. After the former vice-president, Antonio Guzman Blanco, had assumed the presidency in 1870, Peraza had initially been supportive of the new regime in hopes of peace, prosperity, and stability, yet soon grew bitter of Guzman's abuse of power. When Guzman was ousted in 1877 and Francisco Linares Alc√°ntara rose to power, Peraza had embraced the new policy and quickly became one of Alc√°ntara's strongest supporters which would eventually earn him a position as secretary of the Ministry of the Interior and Justice. This prompted Peraza's push to pursue generous and reconciliation policies towards Venezuelan exiles from the war. Due to Alc√°ntara's untimely death in 1878, Antonio Guzman would retake control of the government. To counter Guzman's regime, Peraza frequently published newspapers that censured and criticized Guzman and his government. Subsequent targeting of opposition by Guzman would cause Peraza to exile himself to the United States in 1880 along with his family for the rest of his life.  In exile  In New York, after having been forced to leave a successful publishing and political career in Venezuela, Bolet Peraza found himself starting a new life at the age of 42. Despite this, Peraza managed to find success by building on his prior pursuits as an editor and writer. He became the editor of two Spanish-language illustrated magazines in New York City. From 1885-1890, he was the principle editor of La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York (New York Illustrated Magazine), in which Jos√© Mart√≠'s essay \\"Nuestra Am√©rica\\" (\\"Our America) first appeared. Later, he founded and edited Las Tres Am√©ricas (The Three Americas) from 1893-1896. His editing work, however, could be seen as only part of an expansive career. Peraza‚Äôs writing prowess and political inclination fueled him in most professional endeavors. From a government position (U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela) who‚Äôs offer incited his resignation from La Revista, to his own publication years down the line. Peraza had also frequently collaborated with other prominent Hispanic figures such as fellow countryman Juan Antonio P√©rez Bonalde and Cuban poet Jos√© Mart√≠. Working alongside Mart√≠ during his time in New York, Peraza (while lesser known and acknowledged) shared many similar views. Part of what may have left him lingering behind a bit might have been his lack of view into the danger‚Äôs the U.S. posed to Latin America. Instead, Peraza saw the industrialization and innovations to be something Latin America could and should have. Again unlike Marti, Peraza failed to acknowledge that the same forward movement he thought the U.S. to have would be a detriment and lethal weapon in terms of Latin America. In 1888, the president of Venezuela, Juan Pablo Rojas Pa√∫l, recognized Peraza's prominence as a Venezuelan writer and appointed him Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to Washington. After a successful career in Washington, Peraza returned to New York to resume his work in publication. In 1895, Peraza was invited to attend the 100th anniversary of Jos√© Gregorio Monagas, a past Venezuelan president who fought for emancipation and had been Peraza's father-in-law. After accepting the invitation from the current president, Peraza returned to his native land in order take part in the commemorations. Though he was moved to excitement about experiencing his homeland once more, he ultimately decided to return to New York. Peraza died 11 years later at the age of 67, just a few months shy of his birthday.  Selected Authored & Edited Works  *El Oasis.

Smith worked as a coal miner in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, and became active in the Ayrshire Miners' Union (AMU). He became a full-time agent for the union and became its president in 1908, serving for many years. Smith also became politically active, representing the Labour Party and becoming Provost of Kilwinning. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, he stood in Bute and Northern Ayrshire, taking a distant second place with 28.5% of the vote. The AMU was affiliated to the Scottish Mineworkers' Union (SMWU), and Smith was elected as secretary of the SMWU in 1918. He remained in the post until 1927, when he was defeated by William Allan, leader of the Lanarkshire Miners' County Union. Smith was also losing support in the AMU, perceived as being too right-wing, and members began calling for their officials to be subject to regular re-election. In 1928, members of the AMU voted Smith out of office, along with secretary James Brown and treasurer James Hood. Brown blamed the vote on agitation by members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). However, a further vote a week later reinstated all three officials, on the condition that they put themselves up for periodic elections. By 1929, the CPGB was in decline, and Smith was again elected as secretary of the SWMU.

was built in the 1960s. It was listed as a historic building in 1992. It was the headquarters of the Federal Police in S√£o Paulo from the 1980s until 2003, after which it was occupied by squatters. It caught fire and collapsed on 1 May 2018, causing at least 7 fatalities.  Building  The modernist building was designed by Roger Zmekhol. It was built between 1961 and 1968 by Morse & Bierrenbach. It occupied a plot of , with around of internal space. The structure's columns were made of steel and steel-reinforced concrete, which supported cantilevered floor slabs of ribbed concrete. An aluminum-framed glass curtain wall wrapped the exterior of the building. It was located at 22 Rua Antonio de God√≥i in the Rep√∫blica area of S√£o Paulo, adjacent to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of S√£o Paulo. It had 24 floors. It was one of the first buildings in S√£o Paulo with a glass fa√ßade, with air conditioning built in to keep the fa√ßade clear. It had a marble and stainless steel hall. The building was considered a property of historical, architectural and landscape interest, which guaranteed the preservation of its external characteristics. In 1992 it was listed by CONPRESP (, Municipal Council for the Preservation of Historic, Cultural and Environmental Heritage of the City of S√£o Paulo). The building was initially owned by businessman and politician Sebasti√£o Paes de Almeida, and housed various companies. Debts meant that the building was taken over by the federal government. It housed the headquarters of the Federal Police in S√£o Paulo between the 1980s and 2003, and was also the headquarters of INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social) before being abandoned and occupied by squatters. It was put up for sale in 2015 for around R$20 million.  Fire and collapse  The fire started on the fifth floor of the building at around 4:20am GMT (1:20 a.m. local time) at the first hours of 2 May 2018 (late night of 1 May, May Day holiday), and collapsed about 90 minutes later. The cause of the fire was a short-circuit in a power strip connected to a microwave, TV and refrigerator. The fire spread to an adjacent building, which was not in danger of collapse. The central part of the adjacent Evangelical Lutheran Church of S√£o Paulo was also destroyed during the collapse of the building. At the time of the fire, 372 people (146 families) were occupying the building. Makeshift wooden living structures helped to spread the fire throughout the building, with the empty shafts where lifts had formerly been acting like a chimney. Around 160 firefighters attended the scene. At least one person died, who was being rescued using a steel rope when the building collapsed. The exact number of deaths and injuries are still unknown since the building was mostly occupied by homeless squatters. Initially, the fire was thought to have been caused by a gas explosion. As of 18 May, 2 residents of the building are still missing. The first body was found on 4 May, with six people missing. Prior to collapse, the building had recently been surveyed, and no structural risk had been reported; this investigation was reopened after the collapse, along with a new inspection of 70 other buildings in S√£o Paulo.

The temple was founded on December 25, 1908, being one of the main meeting places of the German community in the first half of the twentieth century.Processo de Tombamento pelo Conpresp - Resolu√ß√£o 37/91-71. p. 2l Initially, it was called by the German name Stadtkirche, being later known as Mother Church and then, only in 1991, being baptized as Martin Luther Church. It is considered the first evangelical Lutheran parish in the city of S√£o Paulo, as well as the first temple in the Neogothic style to be built in the city.  History  The evangelical Lutheran community that lived in S√£o Paulo since the beginning of the nineteenth century was organized autonomously, without the initial presence of pastors. The group had difficulties during the course of the 1800s due to the Catholic regime that existed in Brazil. The first meeting of the German Lutheran community in S√£o Paulo occurred on December 26, 1858, at the drugstore Ao Veado d'Ouro. The ceremonies were performed in the German language, due to the large number of Germans among the visitors, who were attended by pastors of Rio Claro and Campinas until 1871, when Pastor Emil Bamberg founded the first Evangelical Lutheran community in S√£o Paulo, \\"Egreja Evang√©lica Alleman\\". Beginning November 15, 1889, with the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil and the separation of the State and the church, members of the Evangelical Lutheran community had more freedom for the development of religion. On October 29, 1891, Pastor Emil Bamberg was able to organize the community, which initially brought together 80 families. The registration of the statutes of the religious association, however, was only published in 1907. While Lutheran evangelicals raised donations for the construction of the first temple in S√£o Paulo, the services were also held in a Presbyterian Church. = Construction = In 1906, the brothers Daniel and Hermann Heydenreich donated a land in the then street Visconde of the White River, n¬∫ 10 and 12 (current Rio Branco Avenue, n¬∫ 34).Primeiro Cart√≥rio de Im√≥veis da Capital - n¬∫ 45904 - livro 3-A-J-40, 1¬™ s√©rie The donation record only occurred on April 3, 1907, 11 days before the foundation stone was laid. The work was completed only on November 28, 1909, and was the scene of worship in the Evangelical Lutheran community before the end of construction. = Inauguration = In August 1908, the church's pastoral house, at the bottom of the land, was inaugurated with the creation of an administrative office. Four months later, on December 25, 1908, in the midst of the Christmas celebration, the Martin Luther church was inaugurated, then named Stadtkirche in German, which means \\"City Church.\\" During the festival, there were Christmas carols chanted by a choir, honored by about five hundred people. Bells, also donated by the Heydenreich brothers, were sounded in the middle of the ceremony. With the completion of the work only on November 28, 1909, was also organized a party, with the presence of pastors of the Rio de Janeiro, Campinas, Rio Claro, of Santos and Petr√≥polis. = First World War = In the midst of World War I (1914-1918), the Evangelical Lutheran community, predominantly of German origin, had difficulty staying in the capital of S√£o Paulo, due precisely to the proximity to Germany, which was part of the Triple Alliance and ended up being defeated in the conflict. In 1917, the Brazilian government broke off relations with German and, shortly afterwards, in S√£o Paulo, the celebration of cults in celebration for the 400 years of the Protestant Reformation was prohibited. In the following years, without the money received by the German community, the Evangelical Lutheran church suffered with a strong financial crisis. = Second World War = New problems arise with the beginning of World War II (1939-1945), with Brazil breaking relations once again with Germany, and in 1943, with the sending of Brazilian troops to fight against the Axis powers. During this period, by the determination of the then president Get√∫lio Vargas, the celebrations could no longer be performed in German. The introduction of Portuguese, however, generated a strong integration of the community with Brazilians.  Architectural features  The Martin Luther Church was designed by the architect \\"Guilherme von E√øe\\", also responsible for the construction of the S√£o Paulo Conservatory of Dramatic and Musical Conservatory. He completed the temple project in February 1907. First building built in the neogothic style in S√£o Paulo, the temple sits in an area of just over 1012 square meters and has a ground floor area of 465 square meters. The church has a unique tower, which is centralized to the main facade. The main access of the church is through a wooden door with two leaves. = Reform = Layer study of inner walls of Martin Luther Lutheran Church Between 2012 and 2013, the Martin Luther Church underwent an internal reform. A large study was conducted by Companhia do Restauro to retake the initial characteristics of the church, according to what the Municipal Council of Preservation of the Historical, Cultural and Environmental Patrimony of the City of S√£o Paulo determined.Ata da 531¬™ Reuni√£o Ordin√°ria do Conpresp. p. 3 Due to lack of money, the restoration could not be made in the outer area of the temple. The Lutheran Church of S√£o Paulo tried to get support from Rouanet Law, but could not have access to the economic incentive. = Organ = Front door of the Martin Luther Church with detail for the Walcker Music Organ on the top floor In 1909 was inaugurated in the church an organ constructed by the Walcker House that, originally, had 12 registries and 620 pipes. The instrument was reformed in 1956, when the number of pipes passed to 1,090 pipes. New extension in 1995, made by the organist Ricardo Clerice, caused the organ to reach the current 1,146 pipes. = Stained glass = The Martin Luther Church has stained glass, produced by Casa Conrado, of the stained glass artist Conrado Sorgenicht, who produced the pieces of the Market and the Municipal Theater of S√£o Paulo. In the temple of the Rio Branco avenue, the stained glass exposes the Luther Seal and passages of the gospel.  Historical significance  The Martin Luther Church was a symbol for the settlement of the German community in St. Paul and for the union of the Lutherans in the city. No matter how many groups already existed in the neighborhoods of Vila Ema, Vila elina, Vila Prudente and Santo Amaro, the church of the Center became the religious symbol of that town, that already divided spaces like Deutsch Schule (German School), that soon became the Visconde College of Porto Seguro and the Sport Club Germ√°nia (current Sport Clube Pinheiros), since the mid-nineteenth century. Despite the difficulties of the two world wars, the temple became a reference for Lutheran evangelicals in the city of S√£o Paulo. = Heritage = The Church Martin Luther was registered in 1992 by the Municipal Council of Preservation of the Historical, Cultural and Environmental Patrimony of the City of S√£o Paulo and in 2012 by Conselho de Defesa do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico, Arqueol√≥gico, Art√≠stico e Tur√≠sticoAta da Sess√£o Ordin√°ria 1658¬™ do Condephaat. p. 46. of the State of S√£o Paulo. The temple is under Protection Level 1, which requires the integral preservation of the good.  Current state  Currently, Martin Luther Church is in the midst of busy buildings of large stature, which have been occupied by homeless people, and have problems with serious external malfunctions due to time and vandalism. The temple continues to be a meeting place of the German community in S√£o Paulo, but has suffered with the reduction and aging of the faithful. The difficulties also appear due to the large number of evangelical churches in the city, which caused the spreading of the regulars. In addition to the services that take place every Sunday, the Church organizes every Friday a snack for street dwellers in the central region of S√£o Paulo, who can register and keep the documents in the temple to avoid losses and breakdowns.  Collapse  At dawn on May 1, 2018, a fire occurred at Edif√≠cio Wilton Paes de Almeida, a building, occupied by homeless people, located alongside the church. The building collapsed and destroyed part of the church, including most of the stained glass and other historical pieces.  Reconstruction  The Lutheran Church is to spend more than R$ 4 million to rebuild 80% of the destroyed structure commencing on May 1, 2018. Work began on March 27. A piano was also damaged and a German pipe organ of 1908, valued at R$1 million and that was in the mezzanine, had minor breakdowns. For safety, the musical instrument was disassembled and will only be returned to the place after completion of the reconstruction. With 30% of the total amount for reconstruction collected by the church, something around R$1.7 million, the first of the four phases of the works began in March. The money was obtained through property insurance and donations from the faithful. The first stage of the work consists of strengthening the foundations, rebuilding the side wall, roof and lining, stained glass frame and mooring of the altar. In the other stages are planned the revision of the structure of the tower and the reconstruction of stained glass, benches, chandeliers and other items of the church.

Senator Wicker announced in 2015 that an agreement had been reached by Quitman County, Amtrak, and Canadian National to establish a permanent stop in Marks. To construct the $1.2 million station, a number of grants were awarded. A $500,000 grant was allocated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), a 20% matching grant from Mississippi Development Authority that was worth $150,000, and a $300,000 grant from the Delta Regional Authority.

Once completely in force, the single market is supposed to allow significant freedom of air transport in Africa, advancing the AU's Agenda 2063. Primarily, the goal of the SAATM is to fully implement the 1999 Yamoussoukro Decision. This means that all participants agree to lift market access restrictions for airlines, remove restrictions on ownership, grant each other extended air traffic rights (first through fifth freedoms, not affecting cabotage rights), and liberalise flight frequency and capacity limits. Both passenger and cargo aviation are included. It also seeks to harmonise safety and security regulations in aviation, based on ICAO requirements. Oversight over the SAATM is exercised by the African Union, its Regional Economic Communities, and the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC).  History  The benefit of liberalising air traffic, particularly the fifth freedom, was first acknowledged in the Yamoussoukro Declaration of 1988. This declaration was reaffirmed in 1999, when the African Union passed the Yamoussoukro Decision. However, the implementation of the decision faced obstacles, as regulatory bodies did not become operational as stipulated in the agreement. A number of member states did not grant fifth freedom rights to airlines from other countries. In 2015, the laid the framework for a single market implementing the Yamoussoukro Decision to be established by 2017. This deadline was later extended with plans to launch the single market during the 30th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa. There, the launch of the SAATM was then made official on 28 January 2018 by Rwandan President Paul Kagame, as new Chairperson of the African Union. The organisation sought to have 40 members by the end of 2019.  Participation  Twenty-three member states of the African Union originally agreed to join the SAATM as starting participants. there were 33 countries participating:  Evaluation  Some African governments and airlines have criticised the project. Especially smaller airlines, as well as the Ugandan government, allege that the agreement would lead to few big airlines dominating the market, thus stifling competition. The African Development Bank, among other analysts, predicted that the SAATM would lead to cheaper flights, greater passenger volumes and economic benefits. The International Air Transport Association commended the African Union for launching the single market, but warned that more work would be required to effectively implement the policy.

They often associated with having have lax tax regulation acting as tax haven and having financial secrecy. Regulatory haven's can be a state, country, or territory which maintains a system of financial secrecy and little or no financial regulation. Some of the countries that are considered to be regulatory havens include Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Singapore and Hong Kong. They are used by some financial firms to avoid strict financial regulation and is a form of regulatory arbitrage. It has been argued that the consequence of regulatory havens is increasing of inequality of income redistribution and increase systemic risk of financial markets in countries that operate well developed financial regulations while benefiting those jurisdictions that operate as regulatory havens by attracting business activity and economic development. Characteristics Regulatory havens are used by market participants in order to maximize their profit to exploit regulatory gaps. They take even more market risk that is, due to existence of the gap, not detected in a timely manner or is simply ignored by the regulatory agencies even if it is noticed. Companies that try to maximize their profits in this way more often than less take advantage of regulatory havens. Regulatory havens can be defined as jurisdictions that have light financial regulation system as well as lax tax regulation. Also, regulatory haven poses less strict reporting requirements and trading restrictions. Those mostly include low minimum capital required and opacity of the owners to conduct a business in a country that is considered to be regulatory haven. Some of the countries that are considered to be regulatory havens include Caymans, Singapore and Hong Kong. Regulatory havens can most easily be characterized as jurisdictions that have different tax system that is usually suitable for companies trying to use regulatory gaps to increase their profit and as jurisdictions that apply stricter confidentiality rules compared to the country where the company that uses such haven is placed (Morriss, Henson, 2013). Besides that regulatory havens, also often called offshore financial centers, can be characterized as follows: * Jurisdictions that incorporate big number of various financial institutions that mostly conduct business with non-residential business subjects, * Financial systems that are in possession of external assets and liabilities that are not proportional to the domestic financial intermediation and are primarily designed to support domestic economy and economic growth, * Systems that offer multiple financial services to nonresidential business partners. Some of those services may include low or no taxation, light financial regulation as well as bank secret and anonymity. Components As a financial system, regulatory haven can be divided in two components that include: * Financial services. Financial services of regulatory havens are services provided and billed to nonresidential companies outside their domestic territory. These services may include some of the following: service fees for intermediaries, foreign exchange, financial leasing, commissions, trading in securities and other financial instruments, services in the context of asset management etc. * Registration fees that are obligation for licensed entities such as offshore banks, international companies, insurance companies, trusts etc. Consequences  The concept of regulatory haven is often linked to the concept of tax haven. Tax haven can be defined as jurisdiction that requires low or no taxation and is characterized by strict banking secret. The information regarding taxes is not the subject of exchange with other countries, but if they are the achievement of restrictive conditions is required. Tax haven primarily ensures to nonresidential subjects and companies to avoid paying higher taxes in their domestic territory. Disregarding the motivation for a company to establish business relationships within the jurisdictions that are classified as regulatory havens, that can include no tax obligation, banking secret or low regulatory requirements, and no matter the activity undertaken, the establishment of regulatory haven can be attributed to the effort to specialize the economy of a country in some type of business activity, for example export of financial services. This type of specialization most commonly attributes the need to generate revenues that in some countries represents majority of realized national income. According to previously stated the main motivation to establish regulatory haven is to support domestic economy through business conducted with nonresidential companies by offering them better financial conditions for their business. That can also have negative consequences in the legal sense by enabling: * Tax evasion which is a type of criminal behavior that includes deliberate concealment of full income, i. e. full amount of taxable income which is punishable by law in forms of fines and imprisonment. * Tax avoidance that is a type of avoidance of paying full tax amount by using legal gaps, i. e. structures that enable reducing of one‚Äôs tax liability but in the limit that are ‚Äúallowed‚Äù by law and tax regulations. The example of tax avoidance in the context of international company is partial relocation of assets within the jurisdiction that has lax regulations which is considered to be regulatory haven. * Financial regulation avoidance that is considered to be avoidance of compliance with existing financial regulations, mostly in tax havens. The direct consequence of regulatory havens is increasing of inequality of income redistribution. Since the higher incomes are mobile, regulatory havens protect those society members that earn more and enable them to increase their net profit due to lower tax base in regulatory haven. Consequently, society members that earn less pay more in taxes compared to wealthy individuals that use regulatory havens since they can be called upon their debts more reliably. Also, is contributes to social inequality since smaller producers face paying higher taxes even though they work more and usually work in worse working conditions. Regulatory havens enable the concealment of income and that is one of its main attractions compared to non-haven states. Reactions Since regulatory havens have impact of financial system, the necessity to develop control reactions has become mandatory. There are two possible directions that could be taken in order to regulate those jurisdictions that are considered to be regulatory havens. Those include the following: * Unilateral measures that require the participation of state. Taking the state involvement into consideration, the unilateral measures include lifting of banking secret, financial transparency of outland jurisdictions, transfer prices adjustment, declaration of more strict regulatory requirements and additional measures such as reversed onus of proof. * Multilateral measures include tax harmonization, transparency of information and control of electronic communication between banks and other financial institutions.

A sugar refinery named Union House was from 1771 to 1811 located in a now demolished warehouse adjacent to the building by a group of British merchants and plantation owners from St. Croix in the Danish West Indies. Architecture =Andreas Bj√∏rn and his dockyard= Andreas Bj√∏rn in 1834 B√•dsmandsstr√¶de was the northernmost street in Johan Semp's original masterplan for Christianshavn from 1617. The narrow tract of land on the north side of B√•dsmandsstr√¶de was in the beginning of the 18th century the site of a lumberyard owned by Niels Alsing. It reached all the way from Strandgade to Christianshavn Canal and was partly lined with a row of wooden warehouses along the street. The property was in 1732 acquired by Andreas Bj√∏rn. He demolished most of the buildings and constructed the Andreas Bj√∏rn House at the corner of Strandgade and B√•dsmandsstr√¶de in 1834. He was also granted permission to establish a dockyard on reclaimed land to the north of his new property. Separated from the rest of Christianshavn by a branch of Christianshavn Canal (now Wilders Kanal), his dockyard became known as Bj√∏rnsholm (Bj√∏rn's Isle). Andreas Bj√∏rn died in 1750 and his widow died in 1758. Their daughter, Karen Bj√∏rn (1742-1795), who then inherited the property, married the writer and philosopher Thyge Rothe (1731-1795) in 1761. They purchased Tybjerggaard in 1763. =British owners andUnion House= In 1766 the property was purchased by William Chippendale (1747-1802). Originally from England, he had settled as a merchant in Copenhagen in 1760. He instantly sold part of the garden (closest to Christianshavn Caal) to ship builder Ole Gad. Chippendale's company traded on the Danish West Indies with its own fleet of merchant ships. Chippendale developed a good relationship to a number of Irish and English plantation owners on St. Croix. One of them, Nicolas Tuite, made a significant investment in his company. Robert Tuite and Charles August Selby, his son and nephew, were in return secured positions in the enterprise. Selby established his own trading house after a couple of years. In 1771, Chippendale, Selby, Tuite and two more investors from St. Croix established a sugar refinery in the warehouse located adjacent to Chippendale's House in Strandgade. The two new partners were Theobald Bourke and Christopher MacEvoy Sr.. The name of the sugar refinery was Union House. In 1777, Robert Tuite became the sole owner of the house and sugar refinery in Strandgade. This happened on the same day that he purchased the Prince William Mansion on Sankt Ann√¶ Plads in the fashionable Frederiksstaden. In 1779, he sold the Strandgade property bavk to Chippendale, Selbye and John Duncan. John Duncan and John Good, a merchant based in Helsing√∏r, were the owners in 1784.

In 1946 the United States, United Kingdom, and France unified their occupation zones in Germany. The Marshall Plan was introduced to support economic recovery of Western Europe and stop the expansion of Communism. In retaliation the Soviet Government began the Berlin Blockade (June 24, 1948 ‚Äì May 12, 1949) by halting all surface traffic communications (road, railroad, and canal transport) to West Berlin, which was located 100 miles (160 km) inside Soviet-controlled Eastern Germany. Diplomatic negotiations on the terms of lifting the blockade were going at a very slow pace. As war-like tensions kept dangerously mounting Soviets began to reduce the number of their experts seconded to the United States. In June 1948, on orders from Moscow, the Soviet school in New York was closed. All teachers and students were to return to the USSR by September. On July 31, when the steamer \\"Pobeda\\" was scheduled to sail, the former headmaster and math teacher Michael Samarin with his wife (an English teacher) and their 3 children were reported missing. Also missing was the 52-year-old chemistry teacher Oksana Kasenkina. Samarin immediately went to the FBI and asked for political asylum for his family, which was granted.New York Times, August 9, 1948, pages 1, 4, Russian asks protection of U.S.New York World-Telegram, August 20, 1948 Kasenkina's behavior was erratic, which caused a major international scandal.\\"The Mystery of the Kidnapped Russian\\", Life, August 23, 1948, vol.25, 8, 23‚Äì27 For 50 years and political reasons the US State Department held the documents of the Kasenkina case as classified and top secret. The documents declassified in 1998 and available to the public at the State Archives of the United States (National Archives, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740) show that three days before her departure, at different times two Russian-speaking men, chemist Dr. Alexander Korzhinsky and Leo Castello, independently, started a conversation with Kasenkina on a park bench close to her place of residency. Korzhinsky invited her to his apartment for dinner; she refused to eat but complained that she did not want to return to the USSR.New York Daily Mirror, Aug.21, 1948, pages 1, 6; Well, Where's the FBI?

On July 31 Vladimir Zenzinov a journalist and former member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, took her to Reed farm in Valley Cottage belonging to the Tolstoy Foundation. The President of the Foundation, countess Alexandra Tolstaya, provided Kasenkina shelter and a job. The teacher worked in the kitchen and dining room serving farm workers, many of whom previously served in the White Movement and the Russian Liberation Army and therefore distrusted the Soviet teacher.New York Daily Mirror, Aug.25, 1948, p.3; \\"Tolstoy Farm is land of promise for Anti-Reds\\", by Rodney Stahl and James Carterhttp://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3266723, Fyokla Tolstaya,\\"Three times my grandfather was taken to be executed by squad\\" The Mystery Letter  After five days at the farm Kasenkina stopped a passing-by driver with a vegetable cart and secretly smuggled out a handwritten letter to the Consul-General of the USSR. On August 6, 1948, Consul Jacob M. Lomakin received the five-page muddled handwritten letter in which she complained of loneliness and a suicidal mood. The excerpts from the letter read: -\\"the reaction of the already undermined organism has set in. You never considered it necessary to speak frankly with me... I was in despair ready to commit suicide... Finally they began to persecute me, apparently being aware of my state of mind... And then just before my departure it seemed that they begun to pay some attention to me, but I was already warned of my condition...\\" Kasenkina used propaganda clich√©s about loyalty to the dictatorship of the working class, \\"devotion and love for the Fatherland and her \\"hatred for traitors\\", not a word about the US and no information on how she came to the farm. Her disorganized thoughts jumped from past to present. The letter certainly imparted no suggestion that its author was driven by an overwhelming desire to begin life over in United States, borne aloft by her ardor for freedom and hatred of Soviet tyranny ... The letter's most unambiguous statement is in its concluding plea to the Consul: \\"I implore you, I implore you, don‚Äôt let me perish here. I have lost my will power.\\" Cold War Captives.

Questioning under oath of the President of the Tolstoy Foundation, Countess Alexandra Tolstaya at the New York Supreme Court on August 12, 1948 revealed the following events. As the black Buick executive car with a driver carrying the Consul, the vice- consul Zot Chepurnykh and stenographer Maria Kharlamova arrived, Kasenkina took her suitcase and walked out to meet them. Countess Tolstaya ordered 12 men to surround the diplomat's car. She called Kasenkina into the house, locked the door and tried to convince the teacher not to leave with the Soviets. Kasenkina did not listen to the arguments and repeated ‚Äì \\"I must go, I must go\\".

In this emergency press conference Kasenkina told how she was drugged and kidnapped by \\"White Russian bandits\\". Lomakin showed the envelope and Kasenkina's handwritten letter. He read aloud extracts from the letter in English translation. The photostatic copy was given to the United States Department of State and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Consul gave the photocopy of the letter into the hands of the representatives of the U.S. State Department, hoping for a fair resolution of the conflict. Publication of the letter would demonstrate that Kasenkina came to the Consulate of \\"her own free will\\". Despite the validity of his actions, the press and radio accused Lomakin of kidnapping, the authenticity of the letter was denied or called forged. Reporters hounded Lomakin. Day and night the building was surrounded by journalists and anti-soviet crowds.

Life and career  William Conger was born in Dixon, Illinois and raised in Evanston and Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood. He was exposed to art early in life, including trips with his mother, an amateur painter, to the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) and studies at its junior school.Art Institute of Chicago, ‚ÄúWilliam Conger‚Äù, Artists Oral History Archive, Retrieved May 1, 2018. After an erratic high school career, he enrolled there in 1954, but transferred to the University of New Mexico (UNM) in 1957, to set out on his own. At UNM, Conger studied under Raymond Jonson‚Äîfounder of the Transcendental Painting Group‚ÄîElaine de Kooning, and sculptor Robert Mallary. Jonson and de Kooning were key influences, as were the romantic southwestern landscape and imagery, including Native American pottery. After earning a BFA in 1960, Conger returned to Chicago, painted in a shared studio with artist Robert Lewis, and found advertising work with Montgomery Ward and Skil Power Tools. He soon met his future wife, Kathleen‚Äîthey married in 1964‚Äîand returned to school to pursue art full time, choosing the University of Chicago. He studied with professor Seymour Rosofsky, returned to figurative work for a time, and earned an MFA in 1966. After graduating, Conger began a distinguished education career, initially at Rock Valley College in Rockford, Illinois, and later as professor and chair of art departments at DePaul University and Northwestern University.Conger, William.

Features that unite him to this more solitary, symbolic tradition are his illusionistic space, mix of organic and geometric forms, and openness to reference beyond the canvas. John Brunetti wrote that Conger's fluid, \\"muscular language\\" refined the formal grammars of Cubism and Surrealism to incorporate intuitive expression of feelings, memories and engagement, often informed by his native Chicago. As early as 1976, Conger labeled his paintings \\"metaphors of experience and feeling... the mind as nature.\\"Conger, William. Statement, Krannert Museum Exhibition, University of Illinois, 1976. Critic Saul Ostrow described Conger's method as \\"fluctuating between the rational, the associative, and the subjective.\\" Although non-representational, his work connects to the everyday world through signifiers and titles he lets emerge during the painting process, which evoke what he calls \\"'as if' places and stories\\" without depicting any specific one.Heinz, Jack. \\"Conger's Intuition,\\" William Conger: This/That, catalogue essay, St. Louis: Bruno David Gallery, 2017. He does so based on his contention that abstract work can never be completely non-referential‚Äîthat intentionally or not, all art generates meaning beyond itself. For Donald Kuspit, the process yields an aesthetically resonant, \\"spontaneous means of introspection, even self-analysis\\" that invites psychological unpacking. In Chicago, however, all of this placed Conger on the \\"wrong\\" side of two largely critic-fueled battles. First, local identification with the increasingly famous, representational Chicago Imagists often relegated abstract work to comparative obscurity.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Private Treasures, Public Spirit,\\". Art in Chicago 1945-1995, Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren, New York: Thames and Hudson, 1996, p. 78. Retrieved May 1, 2018.Gedo, Mary Mathews. \\"Interconnections: A Study of Chicago Style Relationships in Painting,\\" Arts Magazine, September 1983, p. 92-97. Secondly, minimalism‚Äîrepresented by the ideas of Clement Greenberg and work of Frank Stella‚Äîdominated post-1960s abstraction. Characterized by formal regularity, geometricity, flat space and non-referentiality, minimalism had, in Kuspit's words, purged the subjective roots of abstraction and reduced it \\"to an emotional vacuum uninhabited by any self.\\" William Conger, South Beach, oil on canvas, 60\\" x 72\\", 1985 Conger resisted. Although an abstractionist, he felt a personal kinship with the Imagists, and little affinity for the limiting strictures of Greenbergian minimalism. His blend of ambiguous forms and atmosphere, oblique referentiality, and metaphorical allusions to art, history and geography occupied a unique place where abstraction and representation coalesced, bridging the groups.Noell, Denise. \\"William Conger: The Gouache Paintings,\\" catalogue essay, Charleston, Illinois: Tarble Arts Center, Eastern Illinois University, July, 2014.Silverman, Lanny. \\"Introduction,\\" William Conger: Paintings 1958‚Äì2008, Chicago: City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, 2009, p.3. With like-minded, but visually diverse Chicago painters Miyoko Ito, Richard Loving and Frank Piatek, Conger formed the informal \\"Allusive Abstractionists\\" in 1981, to spark dialogue and make space for a wider conception of abstraction. Critics have identified elements in their art‚Äîidiosyncratic \\"languages,\\" graduated light, organic forms, contradictory space and meticulously crafted surfaces‚Äîrelating them to the Imagists, formally, if not in tone.  Work  In his early career, Conger painted in a style reminiscent of Hans Hoffmann that, by 1970, gave way to work featuring hard-edged, modulated shapes set in complex juxtapositions against light grounds.Gedo, Mary Mathews. \\"William Conger,\\" Painting at Northwestern: Conger, Paschke, Valerio, catalogue, Evanston: Mary and Leigh Block Museum, Northwestern University, 1986, p. 12-19. According to Mary Mathews Gedo, with Flossy's Night (1972), Conger's mature style began to emerge with more organic ribbon-like forms in luminous jewel tones edged in light and set against a deep red-black ground. Also fully developed were his Immaculate, beautifully glazed surfaces and his \\"metaphysical,\\" neon-like illumination which, lacking a visible source or cast shadows, created a surreal quality.Freeman, Rusty. \\"William Conger: What Painting Allows,\\" catalogue essay, Mt. Vernon, Illinois: Cedarhurst Center for the Arts, Mitchell Museum, 2012. Critics like Artforum's C. L. Morrison soon noted Conger's growing assurance with color and composition, and an architectural turn employing frame-like apertures to contain his fractured, lively forms in a state of stained-glass-window equilibrium.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Painting at Northwestern,\\" Painting at Northwestern: Conger, Paschke, Valerio, catalogue, Evanston: Mary and Leigh Block Museum, Northwestern University, 1986, p. 9-10. William Conger, City on the Make, oil on canvas, 60\\" x 96\\", 2001 William Conger, Trolley, oil on canvas, 66\\" x 30\\", 2007 Conger's work of the 1980s more overtly referenced the natural and urban worlds. Passages of brushwork and modeling suggested lake, sky, and horizons behind quasi-floral forms that clashed and overlapped in illusionistic space. He explained, \\"My aim was to suggest a furious condition of nature, something swift, terrifying, and yet beautiful.\\"Conger, William. Artist statement, Abstract/Symbol/Image, catalogue essay, Illinois Arts Council Travel Exhibition, 1984. In works like the large- scale Broadway‚Äîreferring not to Manhattan, but to the bustling Chicago thoroughfare Conger grew up near‚Äîor South Beach (both 1985), he evoked, in his words, \\"Chicago's jazzy materialism, sensuality, and tension.\\" In the 1990s, Conger pushed naturalistic and geometric elements‚Äîlike modeled asteroid-like shapes or inexplicable rectangles, circles and orbs‚Äîfurther to create otherworldly, sometimes metallic-colored landscapes glimpsed in fragments between shapes.Holg, Garrett. \\"William Conger at Roy Boyd\\", ArtNews, January, 1995, p. 169. With his \\"Circus\\" (1997‚Äì8), \\"Childhood\\" (2000), and \\"Iron Heart City\\" (2002) series came a new dynamism, a formal playfulness, and a lighter mood. He captured the vitality, visual clutter and shifting emotional flux of spectacle, schoolyard and early city in exuberantly colored paintings like City on the Make (2001) or Trolley (2007), whose puzzle-like compositions of geometric and sinuous shapes, are enlivened and held together by bold, undulating lines. Critics, and Conger, likened these works to a circus act, juggling unresolved tensions between flat and illusory space, compositional thrust and counter-thrust, and off-key color relationships that ARTnews said came together with an \\"uncanny sense of balance.\\" William Conger, Say When, oil on canvas, 30\\" x 28\\", 2017 Intermittently, throughout his career, Conger has made and exhibited small paper and wood collages and gouache paintings. In 2010, he began showing very small gouache paintings‚Äîlooser, immediate works that feature vital, cross-hatched strokes and serve as a form of experimentation. These works, and later paintings like Say When (2017), display a shift toward slightly shallower space and more geometric forms.

Teaching and education  Conger began a forty-year career in education at Rock Valley College (1966‚Äì71). While there, he was joined by realist painter James Valerio, who would become a lifelong friend and colleague. In 1971, Conger was appointed as chair of the Department of Art and Art History at DePaul University. He served there until 1984, when Northwestern University's Department of Art Theory and Practice hired him on the recommendation of Imagist painter Ed Paschke. In 1985, the department appointed Conger as professor and chair, and also hired Valerio. The three artists showed together in \\"Painting at Northwestern: Conger, Paschke, Valerio\\" (1986) at the university's Mary and Leigh Block Museum.Mary and Leigh Block Museum. Painting at Northwestern: William Conger, Paschke, Valerio, catalogue, Evanston: Northwestern University, 1986. When Paschke died in 2004, Conger eulogized him at the Art Institute and Northwestern. Conger retired as Professor Emeritus in 2006. His legacy includes the appointments of artists Judy Ledgerwood and Jean Dunning as professors, and accomplished former students Michelle Grabner, Anna Kunz, John Sabraw, Joan Backes, Maria Tomasula, Chris Cosnowski and Chris Kahler. Conger's teaching approach was open, but traditional in terms of his belief in studio practice. He also encouraged artists to be literate, well-informed readers, writers and thinkers, and initiated use of the GRE standardized exam as part of the studio admissions process, seeking students who took scholarship seriously.

She learnt yoga as an early student of two of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya's pupils, B. K. S. Iyengar who taught her the asanas, and T. K. V. Desikachar who taught her pranayama (yoga breathing). Her style of yoga was developed with the help of her long-term student, the yoga teacher Diane Long. Life Vanda Scaravelli was born in Florence in 1908. Her father, Alberto Passigli, was involved in creating the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino as well as the Orchestra Stabile which enabled Florence to have its own orchestra. Her mother, Clara Corsi, was a teacher and one of the first women to graduate from a university in Italy. At the age of three Vanda started learning the piano, and went on to train as a concert pianist, taught by . She maintained her involvement in music throughout her life. The family home functioned as a salon for famous artists and musicians. World class musicians such as Pablo Casals, Andres Segovia and Arturo Toscanini were frequent visitors to the family villa, Il Leccio. As a young girl, Vanda met the philosopher Krishnamurti, who became a family friend. He stayed at their home in Florence each year. Krishnamurti and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, another friend of the family, invited the pioneer of modern yoga Tirumalai Krishnamacharya to come to Scaravelli's home in Gstaad, Switzerland to teach them yoga. Krishnamacharya sent two of his students, B. K. S. Iyengar and T. K. V. Desikachar, to teach them. Iyengar taught her the asanas, and Desikachar taught her the awareness of the breath. In this way she took up the practice of yoga in her 50s. When they left Europe she no longer had a teacher, and had to develop her own practice. As this progressed, she developed a focus on breath, gravity and the spine. Her daughter, Paola Scaravelli Cohen, has updated her book from Scaravelli's notes.  Publications    Legacy  Her book Awakening the Spine was called a classic by Yoga Journal. Scaravelli- style yoga, inspired by her work and that of her student for 23 years Diane Long, continues to be taught into the 21st century, by teachers such as Esther Myers in Toronto.

He is also in charge of the management work at Breakpoint Inc.  Biography  Nokubo was born in Iwata, which was formerly known as Toyodach√¥, Iwata-gun, Shizuoka. After graduating from Kinshin High School, Nokubo wanted to be part of the entertainment industry and went to an acting school in Tokyo. He later became a Watanabe Entertainment affiliate, and in August 2004, became one of the first \\"D-Boy Audition\\" recipients. This event selected the members for the upcoming young actor group D-Boys. Nokubo appeared in television drama Mother & Lover in October of the same year. In 2005, he appeared in H2~Kimi toita Hibi, which is considered his most notable debut work. He became part of the \\"Gein≈ç-kai Sensui Senshuken\\" team in the Quiz Present Variety: Q-sama!! in July 2006. This program is touted as the \\"entertainment world diving championship\\". In a two-hour special of the same program aired September, he broke the 115 meters record for the Yasuda Dai Circus' Dancho Yasuda at \\"No Dynamic, No Apnea, No SwimfinA competition going in parallel with the ground with freediving.\\" and established Japan's diving record of at that time.It was the diving plan of 24 Hour Television of 2006 that the establishment of the Japanese record accurately revealed on television. Since then, he has regularly appeared in this team of Q-sama!! several times. Nokubo also made his first appearance on the quiz variety programme Quiz! Hexagon II on 29 November 2006. He later became a regular performer in the summer of 2007, which gave him the break as an \\"Obaka Tarento.\\" In addition, along with his co-stars Takeshi Tsuruno and Yusuke Kamiji, they formed the obaka unit Shuchishin and made their CD debut, releasing their eponymous single \\"Shuchishin\\" on April 2008. The record was a hit and his increasing popularity allowed him to expand to films. He acted on drama shows as an individual actor while continuing his appearances on different Japanese variety shows. In 2009, a controversy involving Nokubo negatively affected his career. At the beginning of the year, he was active, acting in stage plays. But his pursuits and exposures have drastically decreased due to a disturbance regarding his office in April of the same year. Shinsuke Shimada was quoted saying Nokubo \\"left for a bit from tomorrow\\" in order to study. He also immediately left Hexagon II for the ending of FNS no Hi 26-Jikan TV 2009: Ch≈ç Egao Parade Bakush≈ç! Odaiba Gasshuku!! broadcast on 25 and 26 July of the same year. On 1 April 2010, his profile and blog were deleted from Watanabe Entertainment's official website, and it became clear that he left the same office. A few days later, he was announced to appear on the stage play Kimazuge: Ai no kotoba on the website of Gekiden Taish≈´ Sh≈çsetsuka, and his entertainment activities were reverted with that work. In June of the same year, he joined the acting group \\"Ai no Katamari\\" (renamed \\"ai-kata\\" in 2011), derived from Gekiden Taish≈´ Sh≈çsetsuka, and also started an individual Twitter account, and entrusts fan letters, reception works, etc., to break-point in which the group are doing business alliances. In \\"ai- kata\\", in addition to stage performances, they would also be active in the formation and events of fan clubs. He made a surprise performance at \\"Hexagon Family Concert 2011 We Live Hexagon,\\" the last live performance of Quiz! Hexagon II, held at Makuhari Messe on 26 November 2011. Shuchishin were also reunited for one day only and their dissolution was announced at the same time. On January 2012, he was treated as a \\"public place for the first time in three years\\" at the production press conference of the stage play Legend of the Galactic Heroes Chapter II: Free Planetary Alliance performed on April of the same year. In September of the same year, he appeared in a television drama for the first time in three and a half years with Tokyo MX's Danshi- ing!!.  Personal life  Nokubo is very good in sports and he started playing baseball since he was in elementary school and has expressed desire to play professionally in the future. In his junior high school, he won second place nationwide while playing in the Hamamatsu Senior of the Senior League, Taketoshi Goto of the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, and others. When he was in second grade, he hit a home-run while playing at the Meiji Jingu Stadium. He was also a captain when he was in third grade of Kinshin High School, and his name was listed on the draft candidate list of the Chunichi Dragons. Tomoyuki Oda (former Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters' inside fielder) and Masaki Hayashi (former Hiroshima Toyo Carp pitcher) were also in his second senior grade of high school. He often went to see the games of J√∫bilo Iwata. He has also expressed in several interviews that he is a fan of Masashi Nakayama. Prior to his acting career, Nokubo has also spoken several times about his experience as a doorman at Prada as a temporary part-time job. He began his acting career by auditioning for several shows such as Ayumi Hamasaki's Live Dancer Audition and the Asayan Men's Vocalist Audition, which produced Chemistry. He also participated in the auditions for Bakuryu Sentai Abaranger and Mahou Sentai Magiranger. = Office independence uproar = In 2009, his blog was said to be vandalized and it was temporarily suspended. It published articles regarding a planned independence from his management company, which created an uproar. Although it was updated smoothly after that, the updating of his blog was stopped at the end of the update on 30 March. On 20 April of the same year, he opened the blog Full Count Never Give Up na Jinsei at Ameba Blog. Immediately after that, nearly 6,000 comments were received. In the article, there was a description that seems to confirm independence from his affiliated office (Watanabe entertainment), and, on the next day, large number of independent news was also posted on the Internet. However, the new blog was closed on the same day, and at the same time news about independence was all deleted from the net. Even at the PR event of the film Burn After Reading, which Nokubo attended the same day, he refused to comment on the issue further. Presently, Nokubo is still signed as one of the talents of Watanabe Entertainment, which for its part has denied reports of the actor's independence.

Early years Ngcukaitobi studied his undergraduate at the University of Transkei and finished his LLB at Rhodes University. Early in his career, he served as law clerk to Chief Justice Arthur Chaskalson at the Constitutional Court of South Africa. Ngcukaitobi worked at the Legal Resources Centre, a leading South African public interest law centre, first as a candidate attorney and later as Director of its Constitutional Litigation Unit. Apart from his well known role as an advocate, Tembeka is also an Acting Judge at the Land Claims Court of South Africa, with his notable work in that regard being the Msiza case. He played a critical role in the removal of the Former President of South Africa Jacob Zuma by initially arguing in the Constitutional Court on the Nkandla matter that the Public Protector's remedial actionsthat the President must pay back the money claimed to be for security upgradeswere binding. The implications of such an argument was that Zuma had broken his oath of office, a view which the Court ultimately held. In what became known as the Secret Ballot case in 2017, Ngcukaitobi argued that the Speaker of the National Assembly had a discretion to allow members of parliament to vote anonymously, in a bid to oust Zuma. He holds the degrees of BProc, LLB (Unitra), LLM (Rhodes) and LLM (London School of Economics). He is currently working with the international legal team that is representing the major opposition political party in Zimbabwe after the deadly elections. In 2019, he became a senior counsel after practising law as an advocate for only 8 years, an enormous achievement in light of the status typically obtained by older advocates given the 10 to 15 years minimum requirement.

Blick oversaw operations similar to the later 1989 DC prostitute expulsion: en masse coercion of sex workers to leave the city.

The film won the 17th Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Screenplay in 1998.  Plot  A story teller narrates the life of the legend Cantonese opera playwright, Kong Yu-Kau (played by Tse Kwan-ho). Kong was born in 1909 as the 13th son of a Chinese government official. He was talented and was at the top of classes at a Medical school. At a charity ball he was attracted by a girl named Lily. To pursue her love, he gave up his promising career and followed her to Shanghai. But Lily had no feeling towards him and left him stranded in streets for two years. When Kong finally returned to his home town, he was unable to continue his medical studies so he took up teaching. In his free time he went to the Cantonese Operas especially those performed by one of the leading opera singers of the time, Sit Gok-Seen. He started writing songs and plays and proposed them to Sit. His talent was soon being recognized and Sit invited him to join his opera company as playwright. He became famous and arrogant and gave himself a pen name: Mr. Thirteen. He was extremely difficult to work with and no one was willing to serve him until Tang Ti-sheng () came and worked as a copyist and assistant to him. They became good friends for many years. When Guangzhou fell to the hands of Japan in the 1930s, Kong went to Hong Kong and continue to write anti-Japanese scripts. After the war against Japan ended, he returned to Guangdong, but his outspoken and eccentric manner made numerous enemies. Thus, no one asked him to write a script; and no one watched or played the anti-Japanese written by him. The Public taste had changed, but he was unwilling to comprise. In the 1950s he went back to Hong Kong and wandered in the streets. As he grew older, he became insane and was admitted to a mental hospital. He died in 1984 at the age of 74.

Born in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada on March 24, 1841, Lucy Anne Rogers was known to family and friends as \\"Annie,\\" and was the eighth child of Elsie (Knowles) Rogers (1808-1849) and Benjamin Rogers (1801-1884), a shipbuilder in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia. Her siblings included Ruth (1827-1850), Mary Eliza (1829-1864), Benjamin James (1835-1902) and Angus Knowles Rogers (1837-1911).Annie H.

Reared in a household which adhered to \\"the strict discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist tradition,\\" and \\"well educated\\" in comparison to the children of other families of her era according to Toni Ann Laidlaw, a professor of education at Dalhousie University who researched Butler's life, Annie Rogers was just eight years old when her mother died in 1849, and was laid to rest at the Yarmouth Mountain Cemetery in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia. Her father then remarried ‚Äì to Rebecca Crosby (1817-1884) sometime around 1850. Shortly thereafter, her father and his second wife greeted the arrival of a daughter, Alice (1851-1857), followed by sons, Franklin (1853-1881) and Clarence Rogers (1857-1912) (all of whom were half-siblings to Lucy Anne Rogers). At least one of her brothers grew up to become a mariner. Their sister, Mary Eliza, went on to wed George Smith, but died young in 1864, as did their older sister, Ruth, who passed away in 1850. Like their mother, Ruth and Mary were both interred at the Yarmouth Mountain Cemetery.Mary Eliza Smith and Ruth Rogers. Find A Grave: Accessed May 1, 2018. Marriage and adventures at sea At the age of 29, Annie Rogers embarked on a new journey when she wed master mariner John Kendrick Butler (1837-1876) at the Providence Church in Yarmouth on June 9, 1870, and moved with him to Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, where he had secured employment as captain of the Daisy, a brig slated to sail for South America. According to Laidlaw: > When Annie agreed to accompany John on the Daisy for what was to be a > honeymoon voyage, neither could have predicted the delays and the dangers > they would encounter because of an epidemic of yellow fever raging in Buenos > Aires. The trip would take more than 13 months. On 3 Jan. 1871, after 98 > days at sea, Annie began a journal to record her observations, thoughts, and > feelings during the remaining voyage. Ironically, it is this private > document that has brought her to the attention of the public. Using her diary to document her husband's work as the captain of a trading vessel, Annie Butler also illustrated what it was like to be the only woman on a small ship staffed by men from a different social class, who were often intemperate in speech as well as with their alcohol consumption. In addition to baking, preserving food, and washing the clothes she and her husband wore, she also recruited male members of the ship's crew to assist her with keeping the ship clean, and \\"donated a Bible to them, prayed on their behalf, tended the sick, and offered comfort when they became 'blue,'\\" according to Laidlaw, who noted that Butler was frustrated by men who failed \\"to observe the sabbath.\\" > Annie's diary also reflects the close relationships that women shared as > relatives and friends. She particularly missed her sister Maria (\\"Rie\\") and > often dreamt of her.... She had the occasional opportunity to socialize with > the wives of other captains off Buenos Aires, and these brief encounters > were a source of pleasure. The deep affection that she and John shared could > not quench her desire for female companionship. Their business concluded in South America, Annie Butler, her husband and his crew ultimately returned safely to Boston. Returning to Yarmouth in Nova Scotia, Canada, she and her husband began to build their lives there, greeting the arrival of son Frank in April 1872 and daughter Elsie in 1875. But their happy life was short lived. A mariner at heart, her husband was pulled back to the sea sometime in 1876 ‚Äì a decision which proved to be a hazardous and ultimately fatal one. On September 12, 1866, he nearly lost his life as ship's master of the Clifford when the 105-ton brigantine was pushed onshore at St. Kitt's during a hurricane. Owned by B. Rogers & Son, the ship had been insured for $3,500, and was ultimately declared a total wreck.Lawson, J. Murray. \\"Vessels Lost belonging to the County of Yarmouth, N.S., since 1875\\", in Appendix to the Record of the Shipping of Yarmouth, N.S., from 1876 to 1884 (Inclusive), pp. 52-71. Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: Yarmouth Herald, 1884. Just three months later, John K. Butler was back at sea, but this time his luck ran out. Initially announced to be missing when his ship, the brigantine Clarence sank en route to Martinique in the West Indies on December 8, 1876, he was ultimately determined to have been lost at sea and declared dead. The ship, another owned by B. Rogers & Son, had been insured for $12,000, and had departed from Yarmouth two days earlier on its maiden voyage with a cargo of fish and lumber. The crewmen who perished with Capt. Butler were: Rufus Nickerson, steward; William Utley, mate; William Benson, James Purdy, and Robert Robbins. In its April 12, 1877 notice, \\"Remarkable Circumstance,\\" the Yarmouth Herald described how her husband had been killed:Lawson, J. Murray. Appendix to the Record of the Shipping of Yarmouth, N.S., from 1876 to 1884 (Inclusive), pp. 78-80.

Life as a widow  Newly widowed with two small children, Annie Butler opted to remain in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, where she could live near her immediate family, as well as her husband's parents. In May 1882, she founded her own school in Yarmouth, and provided instruction to six kindergarten-aged children of relatives and an additional three youngsters who were the children of other members of her community for a fee of 25 cents per week. Two years later, her father died in Yarmouth County, and was laid to rest at the Yarmouth Mountain Cemetery.Benjamin Rogers. Find A Grave: Accessed May 1, 2018. By 1891, Annie Butler had found a more stable form of employment as matron of the Protestant Orphans' Home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which had been established \\"to provide orphans and destitute children of both sexes with a comfortable home, educational facilities, and religious instruction during the time of their residence in the institution.\\"\\"An Act to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to the Halifax Protestant Orphans' Home.\\" The Statutes of Nova Scotia Passed in the Forty-Ninth Year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Being the Fourth General Session of the Twenty-Eighth General Assembly Convened in the Said Province, pp. 227-228.

According to Laidlaw: > Annie belonged to a group of paid female workers whose responsibilities > included administering charitable programs for working-class women and > children [aged two and older]. They were the predecessors of women who would > later enter the profession of social work. Their activity reflected the > Christian concern for those who were poor or disadvantaged. Retiring from social work in 1900, Annie Butler spent her final years in Halifax, residing not far from the orphans' home where she had helped so many young children find a new pathway forward. Residing with her until her death on January 25, 1906 were her children Frank and Elsie. She was then laid to rest in the same cemetery where her parents and sister were buried ‚Äì the Yarmouth Mountain Cemetery in Yarmouth County.

The women's liberation movement in Europe was a radical feminist movement that started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1970s and in some cases into the early 1980s. Inspired by developments in North America and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in Britain and the Scandinavian countries. In addition to improvements in working conditions and equal pay, liberationists fought for complete autonomy for women's bodies including their right to make their own decisions regarding contraception and abortion, and more independence in sexuality. Groups which formed typically rejected hierarchical structure and operated on the basis of membership consensus, rejecting the idea that leadership conferred any expert status, and instead was simply another experience. They believed direct actions, which informed the public on the issues women faced, were more productive in changing thoughts than reforming laws. Their aims were to redesign society by changing the perception of women and their roles in society. Though European liberationists were more aligned with socialist movements than liberationists in the groups which formed elsewhere, women in the WLM typically viewed class-based struggle as secondary to addressing patriarchy. Liberationists were resistant to any political system which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. As groups operated autonomously without centralized organization, there was a fluidity in issues they addressed, but almost all members in the movement felt that unfettered access to education, jobs and child care were primary issues. Bringing issues to the public, which up to the time had been considered private matters, such as division of household labor, lesbianism, objectification of women, and sexual violence, was controversial and met with backlash from the media and public who labeled liberationists as man-haters. There were robust liberationist movements in almost all Western European countries, though Greece, Portugal and Spain were late to form movements, as they emerged from dictatorship in the era. By the middle of the 1970s or early 1980s, as compromises were made by liberal reformers and governments on major target issues, most liberationist groups had disbanded or gone on to work on single focus issues. Austria Though Austria was a conservative society, known as one of the most traditional in Western Europe, and has been characterized as having had no protests during the early 1970s when the Women's Liberation Movement was sweeping throughout the world, the characterization belies that women came together and began writing about and analyzing the status of women as second-class citizens from a feminist perspective by the late 1960s. One of the first writers to evaluate women's place in society in the period was Barbara Frischmuth who published Die Klosterschule (The Convent School) in 1968. The autobiographical novel examined the patriarchal structure of the convent school and its training of women to be submissive and passive. That same year, women participated in the student revolts, but were frustrated that they were confined to roles of serving coffee. The Arbeitskreis Emanzipation (Emancipation Working Group) formed with men and women in 1969 to discuss how women's equality could be furthered. In 1971, a group known as the Arbeitskreis Emanzipation der Frau (Working Group for Women's Emancipation, AKE) was formed by the Social Democratic Party of Austria (). Their goals were to protest the idealization of mothers and eliminate barriers to contraception and abortion. On Mother's Day, 7 May 1971, 130 activists demonstrated on Vienna's Mariahilfer Stra√üe to call attention to women's inequality and lack of autonomy to make their own life choices. Hosting a conference the following year in Vienna, the AKE brought women from the states of Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg to join with Viennese women to strategize on how to create an autonomous women's movement. Their goals were to be free of the influence of political parties, working to mobilize women to fight for their own liberation, including control of their own bodies and economic choices. From this congress, Erica Fischer, Renate Flei√üner, Renate Kohlbacher, Eva Kreisky, Mirl Ofner, Bodil Pedersen, Emmy Scholl, and Jane Wegscheider co-founded the Aktion Unabh√§ngiger Frauen (Independent Women's Action, AUF) group, hosting the first group meeting in 1972 to discuss whether men should be allowed to participate in their group. In December 1972 the AUF joined with women from the Communist Party of Austria () and the SP√ñ calling for the abolition of section 144 of the criminal code which prohibited abortion. Gertrud Edlinger, Rosemarie Fischer, Irmtraud Goessler and Kreisky formed a committee Aktionskomitee zur Abschaffung des ¬ß 144 (Action committee for the abolition of section 144) to plan the protest to force a referendum. Using street theater, Erika Mis dressed as a convict with ¬ß 144 emblazoned on her apparel. Other actors posed as a doctor, judge and priest, and at the end of the presentation, Mis chopped the prison cage with an axe. A key characteristic of the AUF was its lack of organizational structure, opposition to hierarchy, and opposition to patriarchy within a classless society. Their aims were not focused on reforming laws, but in changing the way that women were perceived and allowed to participate in society. The movement grew rapidly in the early 1970s, but by the middle of the decade had developed many critics. Among them were the Socialist feminists, who believed that women's issues would be resolved if class inequality was eliminated and liberal reformers, who felt that by adding women's concerns to existing structures and organizations change would come about. By 1976, AUF dissolved and was reorganized as a women's center with a loose umbrella organizational structure to facilitate groups working on various focal issues regarding women. Belgium Hunger strike in Ghent in support of abortion rights, January 1973. Inspired by the student demonstrations in France and the Women's Lib movement in the United States, renewed interest in feminism emerged in Belgium in the late 1960s. Supported by Chantal de Smet and Rose Proesmans, the Flemish extension of the Dutch Dolle Mina (Mad Minas) was effective in influencing public opinion by taking a humorous approach to the cause. In French-speaking Wallonia, a more socially oriented, worker-based movement known as Marie Mineur was founded by Jeanne Vercheval. In Brussels, at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, a group known as Le Front de Lib√©ration des Femmes gained fame by invading the Miss Belgium event in May 1971, shouting, \\"Stop the beauty contest, we are not cattle!\\" That same year, the journal Et ta s≈ìur? (And your sister?) began publication. The following year, the journal, Le Petit livre rouge des femmes (The Little Red Book of Women) was published as an initiative of . She brought together a wide range of women from various schools of thought on feminism, including liberals, radicals, and socialists, as well as workers and intellectuals to compile their thoughts on their lives. The book became very influential, selling 15,000 copies in a few months. De Nieuwe Maand (The New Month) was another influential journal published in the period, which attempted to bridge the traditional divides between socialists and Catholics in Flanders. One of the work groups of De Nieuwe Maand focused on women's issues and in 1971, they hosted a regional symposium in Woumen to discuss the similarities women had regardless of their political and religious beliefs and the lack of response on issues effecting women from official organizations and government. This would become the autonomous group Vrouwen Overleg Komitee (Women's Consultation Committee, VOK), which was predominantly a Flemish organization. On 11 November 1972, Simone de Beauvoir, who had been invited to come to Belgium at the protest held in Paris on International Women's Day that year, came to Brussels to speak at a workshop, which they called Women's Day, organized by women from the Brussels-Capital Region, Flanders, and Wallonia. Based upon the success of that meeting, organizers of the VOK prepared a second Women's Day workshop in Antwerp and soon were hosting meetings throughout the country in various cities. Out of these various meetings, the focus of the VOK was defined to encourage structural transformation of society, centered on issues such as employment and education. In an effort not to alienate their Catholic members, the organization struggled with its approach to abortion, as they required input and consensus from all women to launch policy directives. For the Dolle Minas and the Marie Mineurs, the main issues were initially free contraception and free abortion. The law forbidding access to contraceptives was withdrawn in 1972. In 1974, women of the VOK, preparing for celebrations of the United Nations' International Women's Year adopted the slogan the \\"Year of the Unemployed Woman\\" and focused their efforts on bringing awareness that changes needed were not for a year, but for women's lifetimes. The VOK finally adopted a policy of pro-choice on reproductive rights and while it lost some of its conservative members over the decision, there were affiliated group like the Catholic Vrouw and Maatschappij (Women and Society) which continued to work with the VOK. In 1975, members of the VOK rallied at the Belgian Parliament's Palace of the Nation protesting the lack of women elected to office. They organized a campaign along with other women's groups to encourage women to vote and to vote for women candidates. By the end of the 1970s, tensions in the various women' groups operating in Belgium grew, as liberals wanted to focus on changing laws and analyzing women's position based on expert opinion. Liberationists, such as the members of the VOK, opposed moving away from the grass-roots nature of women's work and allowing all members to have a voice. By 1985, the cooperation and work of liberationists for women's autonomy, had given way to more formally-established, politically organized women's groups. The VOK though reduced in numbers was able to survive the change and by the 1990s, turned toward preventing the sexual abuse of women and the quality of women's lives. In 1990 liberals triumphed with partial decriminalization of abortion, and liberationists moved away from the issue. Members of the VOK joined the Women in Black movement to protest Yugoslavian war crimes. France As early as 1967, women began organizing in France through various political parties and one group, founded by Anne Zelensky and Jacqueline Feldman, who had been part of the Women's Democratic Movement, was the F√©minin, Masculin, Avenir (Feminine Masculine Future, FMA), which allowed participation of both female and male activists. Interest in better conditions for women in France progressed in 1968, inspired by the civil unrest in May of that year. During the occupation of the Sorbonne, Feldman and Zelensky participated in events with the FMA, and realized that preference was given to male activists to speak and the women were shut out. Antoinette Fouque, Monique Wittig and several others organized meetings of women activists from October 1968. The press referred to their activities as MLF or Mouvement de lib√©ration des femmes, the French equivalent of the American Women's Liberation Movement. By 1970, the movement began to thrive with demonstrations, including the presentation in August of a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to recognize his \\"even more unknown\\" wife. Typically women who joined the MLF were leftist-leaning politically, had little trust in centralized-hierarchical organization, supported provocation of authority, and believed in revolutionary change for society. That same year in April, the FMA became the F√©minisme, Marxisme, Action (Feminist Marxist Action) and its male members left, leaving a unisex, all-woman's group. Another liberationist group hosted a demonstration at the Universit√© de Vincennes in May, calling for an end to sexism. The MLF began publishing leaflets by anonymous authors styling themselves as \\"any woman\\" or \\"some activists\\", to emphasize their belief that no one woman could be the spokesperson for all women. Articles like \\"Combat pour la lib√©ration de la femme\\" (Combat for the liberation of women) published in L'Idiot International and \\"Lib√©ration des femmes, ann√©e 0\\" (Liberation of Women, year zero) in the magazine Partisans in 1970 became widely read. By September 1970, more than one hundred liberationist groups were meeting regularly around Paris. Activists aligned with the movement began to meet every two weeks at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and by December 1970, had begun publishing the newspaper ' (Waging the Battle). Each issue, though the de facto editor was , was produced by a different liberationist group as a means of validating a broad spectrum of ideas. In April 1971, at one of the meetings at the Beaux- Arts, under the guidance of Simone de Beauvoir, the Manifesto of the 343 calling for free access to contraception and abortion was signed by 343 prominent women, which would become one of the main rallying points of the movement. In 1979, after a demonstration preceding the passage of the Veil Law, named after Simone Veil the parliamentarian who pushed through abortion reform, Antoinette Fouque, Marie-Claude Grumbach and Sylvina Boissonnas secretly filed paperwork to form an association and trademarked the name \\"Mouvement de liberation des femmes ‚Äì MLF\\" with the Institute of Industrial and Commercial Property. Activists and publishers immediately protested against the misappropriation of their actions which took a movement, belonging to all, and made it the private property of a few with the ability to legally forbid use of the name. Germany Hunger strike against abortion reforms in Bonn, 22 April 1974. During the student protests in 1968, in West Germany, women who were part of the Socialist German Student Union (SDS) in West Berlin formed the ' (Action Council for the Liberation of Women). Their concerns were not only the expectations society placed upon women to confine their role to the family, but also the lack of commitment to women's emancipation by their fellow socialists. Focusing on child care centers, the Aktionsrat members set up anti-authoritarian facilities in Berlin to teach children egalitarian roles. Soon thereafter, on 13 September 1968, at the SDS Federal Congress in Frankfurt, Helke Sander gave a speech articulating the reasons for the founding of Aktionsrat and the need to politicize the issues of women, which were still considered private matters. Her speech was not taken seriously by the men in attendance and angered at their arrogance, threw three tomatoes at the podium, hitting , one of the leaders of the SDS, in the face. The tomato became a symbol for the women's movement thereafter. Women in Frankfurt founded the Frauen den Weiberrat (Women's Council) soon after the congress and excluded men from their meetings. By November a Frauen den Weiberrat had been established in Hanover. Women, as elsewhere in the period, formed collectives which held consciousness-raising sessions and offered advice to other women on issues such as health care, discussing things like the dangers of the pill, alternative contraception devices and abortion. One such group was Brot und Rosen (Bread and Roses) a collective formed in Berlin, founded by Helke Sander, when Aktionsrat disbanded in 1969. Similar small groups formed in various parts of the country taking small initiatives, though liberationists were more restrained than elsewhere in Europe. In part, this was because of the movement's apolitical stance, but also in part because consciousness- raising and the maxim \\"the personal is political\\" were the antithesis to German leftists. For example, the word used to describe feminist consciousness-raising was Selbsterfahrung (self-experience), which equated to bourgeois, individualistic expression; while the political left used the term Aufkl√§rung (enightenment), which has a serious, political and intellectual connotation. The cause in West Germany was expanded by the German journalist Alice Schwarzer, who became active in France in 1970, where she had been behind the \\"Manifesto of the 343\\" calling for free access to abortion. She managed to convince Wilfried Maa√ü to have a similar \\"Manifesto of the 374\\" published in the Stern. Appearing on 6 June 1971 under the heading Wir haben abgetrieben! (We have had abortions) and signed by prominent figures such as the actress Romy Schneider, it was immediately effective, causing pro-abortion pressure groups to be created throughout the country. The Aktion 218 campaign, a reference to the section of the criminal code which banned abortion, was instigated by students in Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and West Berlin. A public display on the topic of abortion was at a rally held by various groups in November 1971 in D√ºsseldorf, where it gained mass support. Helke Sander and Verena Stefan, among others, living in the collective Brot und Rosen published Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verh√ºtungsmittel (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives) in 1971. Within three years, the \\"yellow\\" original 30,000 copies had sold out and the second \\"red\\" edition was published. Similarly, Stefan's autobiographical novel, H√§utungen (Shedding), published in 1975 quickly sold and was in its 5th edition by 1976. Chronicling Stefan's journey to free herself from the indifference and exploitation of women towards a life shared with women and embracing homosexuality, H√§utungen became a best seller and inspiration to many in the movement. In 1971, Homosexual Action West Berlin (HAW) was formed and within a year, eight lesbians had joined the movement opening a women's group within HAW in a commune in Sch√∂neberg. Among the eight members of the group were Ilse Kokula, Monne K√ºhn, Gisela Necker, Cristina Perincioli, Eva Rieger, Waltraut Siepert, and Christel Wachowski. Some of these women were instrumental in founding the Berlin Women's Center. Placing an advertisement in the alternative journal Hundert Blumen, in November 1972, Perincioli and Siepert attracted around seventy women who were interested in an apolitical group where women could meet, share publications, counsel and interact with other women. Small subgroups formed and women in each group worked on various topics which were of interest to them. Issues concerned a wide berth of topics including: consciousness-raising, publication, sexuality, and women in prison, among others. There was also a group which demonstrated against the law banning abortion, provided counseling, and arranged medical intervention trips to the Netherlands. By 1973, there were active groups working in Bochum, Bonn, Bremen, Cologne, Darmstadt, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, Giessen, Munich, Nuremberg, and T√ºbingen on various issues, and networks of support among the various groups and women's centers. A nationwide meeting of liberationist groups took place in Munich in 1973 and in 1974, they met again in Cologne. In 1974, liberationists organized a women's festival at the Technical University of Berlin. Brot und Rosen organized a large event discussing abortion where various women talked about illegal abortionists and filed a complaint against several doctors, though no investigation ever resulted. The Berlin Women's Center organized a public women's party and rejecting male musicians featured women artists like and the Flying Lesbians. The 1974 murder trial of Judy Andersen and Marion Ihns for the murder of Ihns' abusive husband became a rallying point for women, who held protests inside and outside the courthouse in Itzehoe. Bringing domestic violence to the forefront for the first time in Germany, the trial brought recognition of the magnitude of the problem and led to the establishment of the Berlin women's shelter in 1976 and a rape crisis hotline the following year. By 1982, as had happened on an international scale, there was backlash from both society at large and liberal reformist feminists against the liberationists and they became less visible. Greece The first women's group autonomous from a political party in Greece formed in 1975 as the Kinisi gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon (Movement for the Liberation of Women, KAG), in Athens. Adopting slogans from the Women's Liberation Movement in the United States they believed that personal issues could be politicized. Their first public action in 1976 was to protest the lack of access to contraception. As the country had just emerged from dictatorship and a new constitution was being discussed, members of the movement sought to bring attention to the inequalities faced by women in their families and society. They established a newspaper Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon (For the Liberation of Women) to disseminate their ideas, publishing articles about child care, employment, ideology and sexuality. After four years the group dissolved. Ireland In Dublin, a group called the Irish Women's Liberation Movement (IWLM) was founded in 1970 when M√°ir√≠n de Burca, invited a working-class homemaker M√°ir√≠n Johnston, journalist Mary Maher, physician Moira Woods, to join her on Monday nights at Margaret Gaj‚Äôs caf√© on Baggot Street in Dublin. Inspired by the WLM in the United States, the non- hierarchical structure of the movement and the shock approach to addressing discrimination appealed to the group. Soon after forming, the group published a pamphlet, Chains or Change, outlining their goals, which included equal education, pay and legal rights; removal of the ban against work for married women; fair treatment of deserted wives, unwed mothers and widows; and access to family services such as child care, playgrounds and contraception. The IWLM appeared on The Late Late Show in 1971 and conducted protests and activism. They led the Contraceptive Train to bring attention to the hypocrisy of the state's ban on contraception, as officials were unable to enforce it. At the time, the only legal contraceptive was the pill, but it could not be prescribed except as a medication to regulate menstrual cycles. Protesting women boarded a train in Dublin and traveled to Belfast to purchase condoms. Upon the return trip, they distributed the contraband condoms to the crowd, flouting the official ban. After a year, the group dissolved, but was widely influential in that short time-period in changing the societal perception of women. In 1975, the Irish Women United formed as a liberationist group in Dublin. Their first protest actions were to demonstrate against the male-only Forty Foot bathing area at Dublin Bay and the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club. They also picketed the Miss Ireland beauty pageant and competition, and protested during the trial of Noreen Winchester, who had been imprisoned after killing her sexually abusive father. They hosted consciousness-raising sessions and sought removal of legal barriers and bureaucratic obstacles to an egalitarian society including, divorce equal education and pay, free contraception, and self-determined sexuality. To publicize their goals and issues, they created the journal Banshee and published eight issues before the group dissolved in 1977. Liberationist groups also formed in Cork and Limerick, establishing women's centres and refuges as well as rape crisis centres. Italy Demonstration for abortion rights in Milan, 1975 In 1967, at the regional congress of the Radical Party held in Bologna, the issues of sexual and psychological freedom were first brought to discussion as political topics. The following year at the national convention of the party in Rome, the discussion broadened to include sexual repression and social oppression, and a motion was approved to focus on these issues. In 1969, the regional congress in Milan adopted similar themes, which led to the creation in the winter of 1969‚Äì1970 of the group Movimento di Liberazione della Donna (MLD) (Women's Liberation Movement). The two planks of the organization were to liberate women by affirming their right to be free and control their own bodies, and to create the necessary health structures to legalize abortion. From the beginning the organization had political aims, and constructed a plan of action to decriminalize abortion. By 1975, the organization had split from the Radial Party and become an independent organization fighting for the change to the civil codes dealing with family law. The goals of the Italian movement were to make women and their issues a political subject, taking the family out of the private sphere; to create new types of organizations and practices, which allowed women to become political actors; and to redefine the methods of engagement with institutions, political parties and other social organizations. In 1969 a women's only collective, Collectivo delle Compagne (Collective of Companions, CDC) formed in Turin, in response to the refusal of male activists to print texts on the liberation movement. Led by Maria Clara Rogozinski and Maria-Teresa Fenoglio, the collective attracted hundreds of members and in 1971 renamed the group, which had become a commune, Colletivo di Via Petrarca, after the street on which it was located. At the meetings of the group, consciousness-raising sessions were held to assist women in removing the boundaries between their personal and public lives and recognizing how private matters could be politicized. In Rome, a sexual-health movement, which centered on women's reproductive rights, discovering their own body and sexuality, and creating facilities to offer solutions to women developed. Known as the Comitato romano per la liberalizzazione dell‚Äôaborto e della contracezzione (Roman committee to liberalize abortion and contraception, CRAC) the group rejected any involvement by either medical professionals or the state in women's complete control of their own bodies, though they did support state run medial facilities offering services to women. In 1970, Rivolta femminile (Feminist Revolt) was founded in Rome by Carla Lonzi, along with Carla Accardi and Elvira Banotti, as a rejection of Marxist theory, declaring that women were not oppressed as a social class, but rather oppressed because of their gender. In Naples, the collective Le Nemesiache, founded by Lina Mangiacapre in 1970, held reenactments of fables and myths as all-women productions, to assist in consciousness-raising, using the arts as a form of protest. Le Nemesiache‚Ä≤s Manifesto proclaimed that women need not integrate into masculine society or strive for legal equality, but should find their own definitions of what being a woman meant. Cerchio spezzato (Broken Circle) was formed in 1970 by students from the University of Trento, as the first group to advocate separatism. Members saw the sexual revolution as a means to objectify women and traditional leftist groups as invalidating women's full participation in society. In 1972 Il Collettivo di via Cherubini 8 (The Collective at 8 Cherubini Street) formed in Milan, and began publishing the magazine Sottosopra (Upside Down) to disseminate feminist materials from throughout Italy. An important group in Milan, they hosted several international conferences, meeting with liberationists from France and Denmark. While they were willing to allow men to participate in protest, the members believed that only women could define their own sexuality. In 1974 the Gruppo Analis i (Group Analyst I) and the following year the gruppi di Pratica dell'inconscio (Practice Groups of the Unconscious) both formed in Milan for the purpose of analyzing the ties between women. Neither were involved in individual analysis, but rather in evaluating the psychology that was shared by women. On 3 April 1976 when some 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome, calling for abortion on demand. Liberationists failed in their aims, as under the influence of the Christian Democrats, a compromise solution was reached, giving doctors, rather than women themselves, the necessary decision- making powers, but in practice women were now granted the right to abortion. The Collettivo Femminista di Santa Croce (Feminist Collective of Santa Croce) which formed in Florence in 1973, participated in a national conference held in their home city in December 1977, known as Donna e follia (Woman and Folly). The two aims of the conference were to explore how women could choose to rebel from the strictures of society on a personal level without being considered insane by the rest of society. Many came away from the meeting with mixed feelings, understanding that through the collectives they had gained support from other women who understood their issues, but by having isolated themselves to find their voice, they had in fact marginalized themselves from the greater society. By the end of the 1970s, the movement became fragmented and activists focus moved toward working on private projects, rather than in the public sphere. Netherlands Dolle Mina movement in The Hague in 1973. The WLM movement in the Netherlands, as elsewhere, was born out of the political climate of the late 1960s, which included the anti-Vietnam, the student movement, and the Dutch Provo Movement, a provocative movement aimed at undermining The Establishment. At the time, there was international discussion on sexuality, sexual liberation, sexual orientation, and the relationship of those to marriage, topics that up to that time had not been considered to be political issues. The concept of patriarchy and a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society did not exist at the time. Joke Kool-Smit wrote an article Het onbehagen bij de vrouw (The Discontent of Women) in 1967 which attempted to put into words the issues for women in Dutch society. In 1968, she formed the Man Vrouw Maatschappij (Man woman society) as a coalition between men and women to address the inequalities from a liberal position of changing legislation through lobbying. In 1969, a group calling themselves the \\"Mad Minas\\" () formed with a far more radical position, engaging in public protests to call attention to sexism. Through consciousness-raising sessions, the Minas met and discussed the issues that they faced in their lives and how those could be politicized. Between January 1970 and October 1974 they staged numerous protests, the first of which was lodged against the Nyenrode Business University, which did not allow women to enroll at that time. In 1970, they led a protest in Amsterdam to address anonymous groping. Sitting on parked cars and bikes, the demonstrators whistled at male bypassers. Entering bars they pinched the buttocks of male patrons to emphasize their objectification. Other actions in which they participated included protests for day care centers, reproductive rights and women's toilets in public spaces. After 1972, most of the Minas protests were focused on the issue of legalized abortion and their most successful campaign was called Baas in eigen Buik (Boss of your Belly), which argued for women's right to govern their own decisions regarding their bodies. In 1971, a group known as formed along the lines of liberationist lesbians in the United States. Their name derived from Betty Friedan's reference to lesbians as the \\"Lavender Menace\\" and they operated as a separatist group, believing that all women were lesbian and should not bed their oppressers. Rather than reforming the existing society with its hierarchical structure giving men priority, they called for the creation of separate societies for women to evaluate their marginal positions in the family and society as well as the politicization of personal issues. These ideas were characterized by Dutch media much as they were in other places and women who advocated for separatism were seen as being anti-male. After 1974, the liberationist groups in the Netherlands gave way to action groups and liberal feminist groups aimed at legal change, as they believed that thought had significantly changed and political action was necessary. Portugal The Women's Liberation Movement came to Portugal via the \\"trial of the three Marias\\"‚ÄîMaria Teresa Horta, Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Velho da Costa. In 1972, Horta, Barreno and Velho da Costa published Novas Cartas Portuguesas (New Portuguese Letters), a critique of the repression imposed by the Portuguese state since the advent of the New State, specifically upon women under the arbitrary and patriarchal governing systems. The authors were arrested shortly after the book's printing and charged with violating public moral codes and publishing censorship laws. When the book was banned by censors of the Caetano regime, the Marias smuggled copies of the book to France. Sending copies with a cover letter in French to Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, and Christiane Rochefort, they called on international feminists for help. Feminists rallied to their support using the book as a feminist icon for the unity of sistership, hosting demonstrations of support in Belgium, England, France, Germany and Sweden, as well as in major cities in the United States like Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, D. C. and bringing international pressure to bear on the Portuguese regime. Ironically, Novas Cartas Portuguesas was not translated except in fragments until after the authors' acquittal in 1974. The ban of the book, and subsequently ban on discussing it, or the trial, on the news, meant that within Portugal, it was not read either. Subsequently, it was translated into French (1974), English (1975), German (1976) and Italian (1977). Two weeks after the Carnation Revolution ousted Marcelo Caetano from power 25 April 1974, the Marias were acquitted. Velho da Costa immediately distanced herself from the book and the feminist movement making a public declaration that the text had not been a feminist treatise, but was written against fascist repression. Barreno refuted Velho da Costa's stance in a public rebuttal. Madalena Barbosa and Horta founded the group Movimento de Liberta√ß√£o das Mulheres (Women's Liberation Movement, MLM) in May 1974, to utilize the momentum created by the trial to improve women's conditions. Support from other international feminists continued with activists from France, Germany and the Netherlands regularly attending meetings and conferences, providing literature, and providing financial support in Portugal. C√©lia Metrass and were influential members of the group, but as elsewhere, it was formed without hierarchical leadership and met in small groups, where women explored their personal experiences to evaluate commonalities with other women and politicize them. Influenced by the French feminists, small subgroups formed to discuss issues which were of interest to them, including access to employment, restrictions of motherhood, sexuality, among others. On 13 January 1975, the MLM held a demonstration in Eduardo VII Park to bring attention to the objectification of women. The press reported that they would be burning bras and there would be a striptease, fueling curiosity as well as disdain for the activists. They were not allowed to burn the veil, mop or flowers, carried by three activists dressed as a bride, a housewife and a sex symbol. In February of that year, the MLM published the Manifesto de Movimento para a Contracep√ß√£o e Aborto Livre e Gratuito (Manifesto of the Movement for Contraception and Free and Abortion, MCALG), demanding free distribution of contraception and educational materials as well as access to abortion and abolition of laws preventing women from controlling their own reproduction. Horta, C√©lia Metrass and Helena S√° de Medeiros laid out the position of the MLM in their book Aborto, Direito ao Nosso Corpo (Abortion, Right to Our Body, 1975); abortion was an individual right and not subject to the control by the moral position of the majority. In April 1975, after a year of meeting in members' homes, the group found a derelict building on Avenida Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, in Lisbon and took over the space. One of the critical issues was women's right to control their own bodies, and they demanded not only the right to contraception and abortion, but instituted a campaign for sexual education. Unlike other places, the military, specifically those involved with the Movimento das For√ßas Armadas, who had implemented the coup d'√©tat, worked with the MLM on issues of family violence, because wartime sexual violence was high at the time. The group continued to work on various women's issues through 1979, though never gaining the same visibility as they had with the park protest. Turning their attentions more toward publishing efforts, at the end of the decade, members founded the Cooperativa Editorial de Mujeres (Women's Editorial Cooperative, 1977) and later the Cooperativa Informa√ß√£o, Documenta√ß√£o, Mulher (Cooperative Information, Documentation, Women, 1979). They believed that the time for organizing in the street had passed and that the focus should move toward analysis and creating discourse on the issues. Scandinavia The development of the second wave of women's movements in Scandinavia continued the interest in improved conditions for women which had begun in Denmark in 1871 with the Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund). In contrast to the United States where many organizations were disbanded after the right to vote had been achieved, work in the Scandinavian countries had continued without interruption. Renewed interest in gender and equality emerged in the 1960s as individuals such as Elsa Gress, √Öse Gruda Skard and Alva Myrdal promoted debate and commissions on the status of women were formed. In particular the Redstockings (R√∏dstr√∏mpebev√¶gelsen) in Denmark and the New Feminists (Nyfeministene) in Norway reflected most of the trends emerging in the United States and elsewhere in Europe. As elsewhere, the movement was open to all women. Men were typically discouraged from participation to allow women to develop their agenda on their own terms. Organizations were decentralized and non-hierarchical, focused on societal change rather than reform for rights, and relied on consciousness-raising to help women politicize their issues. Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. =Denmark= In Denmark, the Women's Liberation Movement had its roots in the 1960s when large numbers of women began to enter the labour market, requiring services such as child care and improved health care. Supported by the Danish Women's Society, the Red Stocking Movement was established in 1970. It fought in particular for equal pay for men and women and for better treatment of women in the workplace, with one of its first public protests being a sit-in on public buses in Copenhagen in May 1970. To demonstrate the variance in women's and men's wages, activists insisted that their fare should be 20% less than that charged to men, as that was the pay gap on their wages. Among many public protests liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants and walked through the streets, costumed in outlandish, suggestive clothing, to agitate against being treated as sexual objects. The following year, Redstockings hosted an all-women summer camp, allowing only male children, if they were under age thirteen. The success of the camp led to experiments in communal living and women's homes, as well as a feminist festival, hosted in 1974. The first three to four years of the liberationist movement saw many new issues raised for public debate, including matters previously considered private family concerns like abortion, child care, distribution of domestic chores, incest, and sexual violence, among others. Liberationists were successful in their demands concerning abortion in Denmark, as the law which previously gave limited access, changed in 1973 granting free service on demand with paid sick leave. In 1972, members protested and women campaigned against entry into the European Community, fearing that harmonization of Europe might deteriorate their rights. Danish liberationists preferred to work autonomously and did not integrate with traditional political parties. They focused their demonstrations toward women, society in general and workers and away from governmental lobbying efforts. From the mid-1970s, when state initiatives, such as the Equal Status Council formed in 1975 to address socio-economic inequality, direct actions by the liberationists ceased. =Iceland= The Women's Liberation Movement in Iceland was inspired by the Danish and Dutch Redstocking movement and began in 1968, when the first meeting was held. Launching a journal Forvitin rau√∞ (Red and curious), the Redstockings explored controversial topics such as abortion, inequality, oppression and the role of women in society. Media portrayed women affiliated with the Redstockings as unkempt and unfeminine man-haters. Demonstrations of women wearing red stockings took place on 1 May 1970, as part of the Labour Day activities. While the majority of women supported socialist class struggle, a small group broke off from the Redstockings joining the more politically neutral Women's Rights Organization (Kv√©nrettindaf√©lag). In 1975, Redstockings proposed a women's strike and participated with other women's groups in organizing a massive demonstration known as Women's Day Off. Ninety percent of the women in Iceland struck on 24 October 1975 to demonstrate how vital their participation was in society. Working women refused to work and home makers left child care and domestic chores to their male partners to attended the protest. Men juggled the demands that women typically had to deal with trying to work, while attending to children. Without workers, businesses and schools were forced to close and fathers without day care facilities had to take their children to their work places. The event made worldwide headlines and spurred the government to pass a law guaranteeing that men and women had equality the following year. As elsewhere, liberationists declined by the end of the decade as their values became mainstream and reforms changed the society. =Norway= Norwegian women began reading literature on the Women's Liberation Movement when Myten om kvinnen, the translation of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique was published in 1968 and was widely read. When American liberationist Jo Freeman visited Oslo in 1970, Norwegian women became interested in new ways to approach addressing women's policy. Inspired by activities in Denmark and Britain, the New Feminists (Nyfeministene) emerged that same year with action groups in Oslo, Bergen and other large cities, as women began to search for an identity outside their homes and sought personal development. In the quest to identify for themselves who or what they wanted to be, women in the liberationist movement rejected the notion that equality could be attained in a society in which they were dependent upon men and challenged societal gender roles. Uninterested in analysis and reform, they believed that the perception of women could be changed through direct action, which made the public aware of issues such as a woman's control of her own body, the need for day care, the objectification of women, and a working environment which offered equal opportunity, pay and working conditions. Members of New Feminists were leftist, but mostly apolitical and rejected hierarchical organizational structures, this brought them into conflict with groups such as the Women's Front (Kvinnefronten) founded in 1972, which called for a specific socialist policy for women, verging on Communism. New Feminists believed that the similarities in women's lives because of their bodies, their responsibility for family, and even their sexual experience, bound women into a sisterhood which could not be addressed by traditional class-based activism or structures which had fixed goals. Women's autonomy and gaining their own awareness through consciousness-raising were critical, as liberationists believed that changing oneself and society depended on active evaluation of ones' experiences. Leadership had no special value, as leaders' experiences were not more or less true than other women's experiences. Subgroups quickly spread throughout Norway but monthly joint meetings were held in Oslo. In 1972, with the release of Esther Vilar's book The Manipulated Man, Nina Karin Monsen led a group of activists to protest at the publishing house Aschehoug. Their concern was that since Friedan had been translated, no feminist texts had been released, but Vilar's anti-feminist book was published. The pressure caused the publisher to release a Norwegian translation of the Swedish title ' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood) by and in 1973. That same year, during demonstrations held on International Women's Day, New Feminists were kicked out of the march in Oslo by members of the Women's Front. Undeterred, the liberationists went to a nearby basement and created banners bearing slogans like No for forced labor, No forced births, I am the prime minister to spread their message. In January 1973, when members of the New Feminists were refused service at the pub Sofus on Klingenberggata by managers claiming they were trying to keep prostitutes from their premises, they staged two sit-ins in the establishment. Bringing attention to the unequal treatment by the bar for men and women and showing solidarity with the sex workers, the liberationists forced the bar to close and reopen with a different policy. New Feminists founded a journal, Sirene in 1973 with the aim of uniting various liberationist groups and disseminating information. The journal's attack on housewives was an effort to win women to the cause, as liberationists used the discontent and unhappiness many women felt with the \\"housewife/breadwinner system\\" to fuel the idea that being an unpaid or underpaid laborer led to invisibility and frustration, but the stance caused controversy. That same year the liberationists held a national committee meeting in Sandnes for the 200 autonomous organizations throughout the country. The national committee established its own journal, Feministen and published the common goals of various groups, but did not serve as an executive board or direct the local groups. 1973 also marked the year, liberationists began to publicly support lesbian liberation, though in 1974, to address their different needs Lesbisk bevegelse (Lesbian Movement) was founded by former New Feminist members. Abortion as part of a woman's right to control her body had been a major part of the New Feminists activism since their founding. In 1975, when the Norwegian parliament was debating the issue, New Feminists, hiding slogan placards under their coats, asked for a tour, entered the chamber, and protested, demanding unrestricted access to abortion as well as no coercion on the subject. Removal by the police did not prevent further action, such as when the following year liberationists ringed the exterior of the Storting building singing songs and carrying banners in peaceful protest. Police were again called to break up the protest. In 1975, during the annual women's meeting in Oslo, the group, Br√∏d og Roser (Bread and Roses) came together from activists who left Women's Front because of its close alignment with the Communist Party (). They officially formed in March 1976 under the theme that whatever the root cause of women's oppression, they were united in their need for bread (economic liberation) and roses (sisterhood and love). Combining both a class-based and sexist based theory, but acknowledging that some of their members were not socialists, Bread and Roses had subgroups throughout the country. In 1977 liberationists returned to the objectification of women and worked with other feminist organizations in the fight against pornography. Creating a traveling exhibition, they protested the consumption of women, which they saw as a catalyst for sexual violence against women. That same year New Feminists in Oslo began the first domestic violence hot line and the following year opened the first emergency women's shelter. Quickly hotlines and shelters became scattered across Norway, as did negative press characterizing activists working against sexual violence as man-haters. Interest in feminism nevertheless spread with the support of other women's organizations in the country leading to activism in the universities and in sports. On 8 March 1978, some 20,000 women demonstrated for improved rights. Ironically, at the height of their influence, radical groups were splintering. The 1978 march was actually two marches, one led by the Women's Front, the Norwegian Women's Association (), the Oslo Women's Legal Rights Association (), and various communist groups, which began at Youngstorget. The other led by the Oslo Women's Equal Rights Association, gathered at before starting their march. Members of Bread and Roses, the Lesbian Movement and New Feminists, marched in each protest. In December, 1978, an abortion reform bill was passed which did not meet liberationists demands but rather required women to be advised before making a choice up to the 12th week of pregnancy. After that time, the decision was to be made by a committee. Sirene published its final issue in 1983. =Sweden= In 1968, began giving a series of lectures on women's history at Uppsala University in a newly developed class on gender. Two of her students, Birgitta Bolinder and , who were working teachers attended Berg's night classes. Deciding to form a discussion group, eight of the students founded Grupp 8 (Group 8) to evaluate the gender and class struggle. The study group operated for two years, but felt they needed to become more active. In 1970, Grupp 8 opened to new members, attracting around 100 interested women at their first meeting in Stockholm and soon spread throughout Sweden. That same year women in Lund, established Kvinnoligan (Women's League), after a member brought the book Sisterhood is Powerful home after a visit to the United States. Both groups were formed from women who had come out of male-dominated leftist organizations where women's roles were marginalized and they shunned hierarchical organization, relying on discussion groups for women to increase their awareness through consciousness-raising. Leading up to the 1970 elections, members of Grupp 8 protested at the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) rally outside the Parliament building. Rolling out banners with slogans, took the microphone to ask why women were forced to work as part-time employees and thus were ineligible for pensions. Members of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation forced the activists away, threatening them with their fists. That same year two members, Maud H√§gg and Barbro Werkm√§ster published ' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood). In February 1971, the Studentafton at Lund University scheduled a meeting which was later called The Women's Camp inviting liberationists from Denmark, the United Kingdom and members from Grupp 8. Over 1,000 women and men participated in the event, the first women's meeting held in the era in Sweden, which prompted a surge of growth in Kvinnoligan, with branches forming in Malm√∂. Around the same time, Grupp 8 founded a journal Kvinnobulletinen (Women's Bulletin), outlining their aims and began publishing on a variety of issues such as employment reforms, free childcare centers, unrestricted access to abortion, and the objectification of women. Initial articles were written from a Marxist perspective, emphasizing the needs of working-class women, but by 1972, these had been replaced with feminist articles addressing such issues as pornography and prostitution. Both groups addressed issues through direct action, using demonstrations, heckling, street theatre performances, and art exhibitions, such as a demonstration held on 8 March 1971, by ten members of Grupp 8 who protested for daycare centers and unrestricted abortion in Stockholm. The following year, working with members of the (), liberationists organized the first public participation in what would become an annual International Women's Day event. A month later, on 8 April 1972, Grupp 8 hosted an exhibition \\"Women\\" at the Moderna Museet which featured various aspects of women's lives, including intimate details, like menstruation. 13,000 people visited the installation within a month, spurred by media reports which not only analyzed the exhibit, but ridiculed the liberationists as well, characterizing them as \\"ugly and sexually frustrated\\". That same year the SAP added initiatives to their platform to address women's issues, over the protests of Grupp 8, which believed that the patriarchal state was hijacking the movement. In 1973, members of the Grupp 8 in Gothenburg broke away from the organization and formed a group called Nyfeministerna (The New Feminists), as they felt the Grupp 8 branch lacked focus on feminist issues and women's solidarity. Simultaneously, a group of members left the Stockholm branch of Grupp 8 and formed Arbetets kvinnor (Women Workers), accusing their chapter of being too feminist and not focusing enough on class struggle. Grupp 8 nevertheless continued to be the main organization in Sweden advocating for women. Lesbian women were active in Grupp 8, and after 1974, in the Lesbian Front, which formed in that year. In 1975, inspired by Susan Brownmiller's Against Our Will, Maria-Pia Bo√´thius began a series of articles in the newspaper Expressen to bring the discussion of rape into the public sphere. The following year, she published Skylla sig sj√§lv (Self-blame) analyzing victim blaming by the male-dominated legal system. In 1976, the Sexualbrottsutredningen (Sexual Crimes Investigation), which had been commissioned by the government in 1971 was published. The investigating committee, composed of eight men over the age of 60 and one woman, produced an analysis which recommended that penalties for sexual violence be minimized, that victim's behavior mitigate the severity of the crime, and that age requirements concerning sexual acts involving children be lowered, in the case of sexual touching to as low as ten years-of-age. Grupp 8 immediately came out against the recommendations and encouraged other activists to follow their lead. Organizing around 500,000 women, from thirteen women's groups, the liberationists prepared a joint statement criticizing the report. The press surrounding the outcry raised awareness on the issue, forcing the government to abandon the plan to revise statutes. The Kvinnofronten (Women's Front) was formed in 1977, when a large portion of the membership of Grupp 8 left over what they saw as insufficient attention to the opposition to pornography. Those who joined Kvinnofronten branched across Sweden with focus on eliminating the objectification of women, providing free childcare, and a 6-hour work day. By 1978, participation in events was declining. There were only 2,000 participants in 8 March events that year, and by the early 1980s, the liberationist movement had given way. Spain The first liberationist group to form in Barcelona began in 1970, when Mar√≠a Jos√© Ragu√© returned from an extended stay in the United States and invited women to meet in her home to discuss Women's Liberation. A similar group was formed in the home of Laura Tremosa in 1975. The women held consciousness-raising sessions in clandestine meetings which were forbidden by Franco's regime. Underground meetings were also held in the Basque Country as early as 1974. Many feminist activists were also anti-Francoist activists and though they were politically left-leaning, none of the leftist parties had women's agendas nor policies which allowed for women's participation. The day after Franco's death, Tremosa, along with Mireia Bofil, , and N√∫ria Pompeia, among others founded on 21 November 1975 the Asociaci√≥n de Comunicaci√≥n Humana y Ecolog√≠a (Association for Human Communication and Ecology, ANCHE). The name was specifically chosen not to alarm authorities, but their stated goals were to create an autonomous women's liberation group. Liberationists in general sought to redefine women's identity in Spain. A slogan \\"sexuality is not maternity\\" became popular at the beginning of the movement and women pressed for the right to have access to contraception and abortion. In December 1975, the Communist Party provided support for a clandestine meeting of some 400 women in Madrid, who participated in the Pimeras Journadas Nacionales por la Liberaci√≥n de la Mujer (First National Conference for the Liberation of Women). The conference spawned the creation of the (), which soon had 200 subgroups around the country. Members of the FLM included Celia Amor√≥s, Elena Arnedo and Gloria Nielfa. In 1976 the Jornades Catalanes de la Dona (Catalan Conference on Women) was held at the University of Barcelona with 4,000 attendees. At the conference, ideas about women's sexuality, including the individual rights of women regarding their own bodies were introduced. Soon after the conference, Lidia Falc√≥n founded the Colectivo Feminista de Barcelona (Feminist Collective of Barcelona) and with , began publishing the journal, ' (Feminist Vindication). The arrest of eleven women regarding abortion in the Basque town of Basauri in September 1976, mobilized women throughout the country to demand control of their own reproductive rights, and led to the first demonstration held in Madrid since 1936. That same year, the Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa (Lanbroa Feminist Collective) was formed in Bilbao by . The group's main concerns were elimination of patriarchy in educational, health, judicial and political systems, with a focus on the right to divorce and control their own reproduction. In Galicia, the Colectivo grupo Terra (Collective Group Terra) was formed by members seeking liberationist ideals. In 1977, feminists in the Basque Country held the I Journadas de la Mujer de Euskadi (First Conference of Basque Women) in Bilbao, identifying two main threads of feminism‚Äîthose who saw women's oppression as rooted in sexism and the political feminists who wanted legal reform. That same year in Mallorca, the Colectivo Feminista Pelvis (Pelvis Feminist Collective) was organized. In 1978, the law restricting contraception was stricken, which was seen as a victory by liberationists. In 1979, a joint protest with members of the Colectivo Feminista Pelvis, Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona (Group for Women's Liberation) and Mujeres Independientes (Independent Women) was staged in Mallorca with demonstrators carrying funerary wreaths. The action brought attention to the recent deaths of three young women from sexual violence, calling for an end to sexual abuse and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or passion as mitigating factors for their behaviors. The liberationist element of Spanish feminism was always the smallest sector, and the 1970s drew to a close, many of the women who had been involved in the Women's Liberation Movement began transitioning into organizations which were political. Switzerland The Women's Liberation Movement in Switzerland () was formed in 1969 following student protests the previous year in Zurich. FBB groups sprang up in Basel, Bellinzona, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, and Locarno. The group became loosely affiliated with similar organizations like the Mouvement pour la Lib√©ration de la femme (MLF) in French-speaking cities in the country and the Movimento Femminista Ticinese (MFT) in the Canton of Ticino, an Italian-speaking area. Women affiliated with the movement challenged patriarchy, the position of women in society and the double moral standard imposed upon women. Calling for free abortion and contraception as well as day care centers, membership expanded rapidly. Women's liberation groups in Switzerland were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women. The groups took to the street, protesting and engaging in public controversies to bring attention to discrepancies between men's and women's lives, like the inability of women to vote, an education system which made housekeeping courses mandatory for women, and a ban on women's participating in the country's defense. Their first public action was a protest against objectification, but they also demonstrated for equal pay, revision of the marriage laws, retraining of housewives to enter the work force, and improved social benefits for women. As early as 1970, the FBB in Zurich began organizing an experimental kindergarten and unlike in other places, established a formal board. In 1971, the FBB and Progressive Women of Basel organized a petition drive to collect signatures to remove the criminal status from abortion. By 1972, the FBB-Zurich opened the first women's center in Switzerland, Information Center for Women (). The idea for the center was proposed by a consciousness-raising group which discussed sexuality and enlightenment and the center offered counseling on abortion, contraceptives, as well as giving general information on education, alternative medicine, and legal issues. In 1974, a lesbian organization known as the Homosexuelle Frauengruppe (HFG) took space in the INFRA building and affiliated with many of the goals and projects of the FBB. The HFG published a journal and founded a women's bookshop, before formally merging with the FBB in 1980. During the 1975 conference held for International Women's Year taking place in Bern, members of the FBB held a counter-conference to include issues that progressives omitted, like abortion, homosexuality, women prisoners and immigrants. FBB members were more radical than the conservative members of reformist feminist groups which emerged in their wake. In 1977, some adherents split off to join with socialist feminists. Increasingly FBB groups focused on violence against women and provided counseling services to abused women. The Zurich FBB dissolved in 1989. United Kingdom The Women's Liberation Movement in the UK was spurred not only by events occurring in the United States, but by events within the nation which forced women to think in different ways about their political lives. Two important events, the Dagenham Ford Plant strike by women machinists in 1968 over pay inequality and a campaign launched the same year by women in Hull over local fishermen's safety, led to a desire for women throughout the nation to organize. Student activists in France and the UK were involved in protests over Apartheid and the Vietnam War, radicalizing them, but many women who joined leftist movement felt relegated to the sidelines. Advertising for members to form local consciousness-raising groups, women brought other women to the movement and it grew rapidly. Using U.S. Redstocking activist, Kathie Sarachild's articles as a guide, women learned how to analyze issues impacting their own lives and question whether those challenges were broadly effecting other women, giving each woman a personal stake in the outcome of the movement. The first National Women's Liberation Movement Conference, attended by around 600 women took place in Britain, for three days, from 27 February 1970, at Ruskin College. At the conference the liberationists laid out their focus areas, which included child care, equal education and opportunity, pay equity, and reproductive rights. In 1970, British feminist Germaine Greer published her book, The Female Eunuch, which garnered international acclaim from feminists on an international scale. The following year, Juliet Mitchell's Woman's Estate was released and extracts of the book were widely disseminated and discussed in local consciousness raising sessions. Also in 1971 the British edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves, originally written by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, was edited and published by Angela Phillips and Jill Rakusen in England, becoming an important text, urging women to become familiar with their own bodies. Another important text, The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community (1972) by Selma James and Mariosa Dalla Costa examined the place of women in terms of paid and unpaid labor. The book led to several chapters of the Wages for housework (WFH) campaign in Britain and other countries. Topics of relationships, marriage and sexuality were often discussed in groups, evaluating duty, domestic life and women's sphere in ways which allowed women to build confidence and share things like homosexuality or abuse, which had previously been taboo subjects. Writing about women's history became very important during the WLM in the UK. Abortion was a unifying issue for liberationists throughout the nation, but while the focus throughout the UK included reproduction and contraception, in some localities, such as Scotland, the focus was solely on abortion. The British Abortion Act of 1967 was passed to eliminate unsupervised primitive and unhygienic procedures and had little to do with women's rights to govern their own bodies. From the emergence of the WLM in Britain activists felt the importance of shifting the debate to self-determination. In 1975, the National Abortion Campaign (NAC) was formed to organize the push toward choice. Distrust between NAC, unions and WLM activists led to several fissures, but despite the uneasy alliance the groups worked together and there was some fluidity with activists participating in multiple factions for the cause. A series of proposals were introduced in the 1970s, starting with James White‚Äôs 1975 bill to restrict abortion on the basis of gestation; Bill Benyon‚Äôs 1977 bill to not only limit abortion based upon gestation time but to give medical professionals an opt- out to refuse; and then in 1979, a bill introduced by John Corrie to restrict not only gestation but the grounds on which abortion could be attained. Further complicating the debate was the paucity of National Health Service facilities throughout the UK, giving women in southern England readily available abortion centers, which were lacking in other areas of the nation. Though there were a wide variety of views among individual liberationists on the topic, the movement was in favor of women's autonomy over their own bodies. Another critical area of work during the period focused on violence against women. Out of consciousness raising sessions, women wanted to find means to combat violence and bring the problem into the public sphere. Liberationists created the National Women's Aid Federation in 1974 and eventually branches were established in each of the four countries. The central body was critical for networking, as well as attaining government funds to assist with the work. In 1977, the British edition of Susan Brownmiller's Against Our Will was published and became an influential text, showing how rape had been weaponized throughout history. In response liberationists throughout the UK worked to shift the focus away from women's behaviour toward the perpetrator. Through establishment of Rape Crisis Centres, they led the effort to provide support to victims and campaigned for change, publishing articles to increase awareness among the public. Conferences throughout Britain occurred at varied locations, including Sheffield (June 1970), Skegness (1971), Manchester (March 1972), London (November 1972), Bristol (1973), Edinburgh (1974), Manchester (1975), Newcastle (1976), London (1977) and Birmingham (1978). Though changing the location was meant to unify the women, it led to feelings in some quarters that the long journeys to nationwide conferences were marginalizing women from other parts of the country. When publications supposedly representative of all groups and subgroups in the country appeared to be London-centric, activists in the north, felt alienated. At the 1974 conference of the WLM in Edinburgh two additional goals‚Äîeconomic and legal independence for women and the right to autonomy over their sexuality, free from discrimination‚Äîwere adopted. During the 1975 conference in Manchester, liberationists decided to create the Women‚Äôs Information and Referral Service (WIRES), which both produced a newsletter for women in Leeds and York, but acted as a news service to distribute information to the other groups and subgroups of liberationists throughout the nation. At the eighth and final conference, held in 1978 in Birmingham, liberationists added a demand for freedom from violence. By the end of the 1970s the movement had grown so large that it was difficult to sustain the personal and individual aspects which characterized the early movement. Conferences in Britain numbering near 3,000 participants made it difficult for individual activists to have a say in shaping policy or in discussions. Fragmentation on issues which were important to their personal political perspectives, was common for activists in the later part of the movement. In the drive to move from theory to action, liberationists began working on single-issue campaigns to ensure that gains which had been made were not rolled back. In addition, as the state had reformed many policies toward women and political and economic situation had shifted dramatically, activists felt a need to shift the way that they engaged with the state and public. =England= The WLM movement emerged as groups of women took part in local campaigns or more traditional lobbies and marches in support of civil rights, peace and the New Left. Their activities were triggered by a period of rapid social and cultural change in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to WLM meetup centres in private houses and community centers, magazines, leaflets and posters were published by the women who gathered there. \\"Consciousness raising\\" groups appeared in the early 1970s, where women talked about their own life experiences together in different locations throughout London. Women were also able to recognize the unpaid labor that women do every day, including housework, emotional labor and care-giving. The first national WLM conference took place in late February and early March 1970 at Oxford. There were more than 600 women in attendance where they discussed four primary issues: Equal pay, equal education and job opportunities, free contraception and abortion on demand and free 24 hour nurseries. In November 1970, protesters went to Royal Albert Hall to protest the Miss World pageant and challenge the idea of women being judged by their physical appearance. Protesters had fliers and shouted, \\"We're not beautiful, we're not ugly, we're angry!\\" This protest was organised by Jane Grant and protesters threw out \\"leaflets, bags of flour and smoke bombs\\". Several of the women, including Jenny Fortune, who had brought a \\"busload of women from Essex University\\", were arrested and conducted their own defence in court. The protesters, numbering around 50 or so women, were fined 100 pounds and the Women's Liberation Network paid the fines for the women. The Guardian called the protest a \\"galvanising moment in the women's liberation movement\\". An earlier, smaller protest of 50 women who called themselves the Women's Liberation Workshop, had taken place the year before in 1969. The Women's Liberation Network formed in north London in the early 1970s, a WLM group began in Bolton in 1970 with three members, a group formed in Norwich, as did one in Bristol. Groups started publishing newsletters to inform activists of developments and by the mid-1970s most towns and cities throughout England had a group publishing about local WLM happenings. The newsletters were critical as many families still did not have home telephones. Spare Rib was launched in July 1972 and became popular throughout the UK. Other English publications which became important included Shrew, Women's Report and Women's Voice. Women involved in the WLM in England felt that it was a time \\"of enormous innocence, enthusiasm and creative power, when small groups of women were forming across the country, talking about their circumstances, and feeling the rush of recognition as they realised they weren't alone in their frustrations\\". In 1972, one of the first shelters for victims of domestic violence was set up in England. It was called Chiswick Women's Aid and was largely steered by Erin Pizzey. The first rape crisis centre was opened in 1973 for England and Wales. The Bristol Women's Centre opened that same year and one of the services they offered was pregnancy testing, vital when no self-testing existed in the period. They also had a space to offer emergency shelter to \\"battered women\\", as victims of violence were called at the time. In other areas, women's centres became hubs for activists in the movement, for example, the centre in Norwich had meeting space for consciousness-raising groups and training, provided advice services on a variety of issues like health, housing, and marriage, as well as offering pregnancy tests. In Brighton, the women's centre, opened in 1974, was next door to the women's shelter, allowing women the pretext of going to the centre, when they were actually fleeing violence. By 1979, more than forty women's centres offered a variety of services throughout the country. In 1973, black British women organised the Brixton Black Women's Group to focus on education and contraceptive issues in their community. Women who were former British Black Panthers, such as Olive Morris, Beverly Bryan and Liz Obi, were involved in this group. The organisation was the first black women's group in the UK. Morris also helped start other women's groups such as the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative, the Black Women's Mutual Aid Group, The Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent (OWAAD) and a self-help bookstore, the Sarbarr Bookshop. OWAAD formed in 1978 and in March 1979 sponsored a conference, where around 250 met to talk about the multiple issues they faced based on their gender, race and class. Many of the members were immigrants from various British colonies and were concerned with the impact of immigration laws on their communities. Founding a journal, FOWAAD, with the purpose of keeping women involved connected and informed, one of their first direct actions was a sit-in at Heathrow Airport to protest virginity tests given to women upon entering the UK. The Women's Aid Federation of England was founded by liberationists in 1974 to specifically work on the issues of domestic violence. The following year, the National Abortion Campaign (NAC) formed to defend abortion rights, advocate for further improvements and extensions of reproductive rights, and promote awareness of family planning services and contraceptives. In June 1975, NAC staged a demonstration that attracted between 15,000 and 20,000 people. NAC fought against various House Of Commons' Bills that were intended to restrict abortion rights, creating alliances with organisations that worked with \\"other oppressed and exploited groups\\". There were conflicts within the WLM in how they approached the subject of abortion on England. Women in the WLM criticised labor unions for not going far enough in political support for free abortions on demand. Nevertheless, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the NAC along with the Committee in Defence of the 1967 Act (CoOrd) planned an October 1979 march in support of abortion rights. The march was the largest pro- abortion march in the country and was part of the Campaign Against the Corrie Bill (CACB). The differences between the organisers of the pro-abortion march led to an \\"angry clash\\" with radical feminists from the London Women's Liberation and Women's Aid holding up the parade because they felt they, not the other organisations should lead it. NAC was criticized by some feminists for working with male bureaucracies, but maintained a policy that all allies, regardless of their roots, who were working against the Corrie Bill to restrict abortion rights were critical to defeat the bill. The Women's Therapy Centre, founded to provide counseling and help with mental health issues, was established in London in 1976 by Susie Orbach and Luise Eichenbaum. To assist women with education and bring women to the movement, many WLM members taught courses with the Worker's Educational Association (WEA). Some of these began as courses on the movement and then became the foundation of university classes of women's studies. Activists in Norwich gave talks to church groups, members of the Housewives Register and at Women's Institutes, but in the conservative climate were less bold than activists in other areas. Brighton's liberationists ran a successful course on the issues of the movement in 1978 and were asked to re-run it the following year. After a serial rapist attacked and killed five women in West Yorkshire with little response from the police, liberationists in Leeds organized the Leeds Rape Crisis Centre and planned a conference to discuss violence against women. They organized the first Reclaim the Night march in 1977 to challenge the idea that women should stay inside after dark in order to avoid rape and assault. Reclaim the Night protests spread to Bolton and Brighton and a national march was held in London on 20 January 1979. The Guardian reported in 1979 that the marches had had \\"little attention except for a few sneers and weak jokes\\". However, the marches took place in 12 locations in England and involved hundreds of women. Reclaim the Night inspired the Take Back the Night movement in the United States. In the late 1970s, revolutionary feminism took off in England, with more militant feminists who were inspired by a workshop and a conference paper at the National Women's Liberation Conference of 1977. Revolutionary liberationists tended to be separatist, adhered to a doctrine of political lesbianism and directed their actions toward pornography, sexual abuse, and sexual violence. They argued that \\"male violence against women is an expression of male supremacy and political control of women\\" and conceptualized gender as class, in which all men held the power positions and all women were the exploited class. Increasingly, revolutionary feminists refused to engage with men, even those who engaged in similar social struggles. After 1977, more women's journals and documents were known to be or designated as items to be read by women only and by the 1978 nationwide conference fractures between liberationist and separatist feminists disrupted the conference and led to a collapse of the plenary session. The emotional response to the conference led to no one wanting to take on the responsibility of organizing further conferences. In 1979, the Southall Black Sisters formed to address violence against women and address issues within the black and Asian communities. Based on a liberationist model, they offered consciousness-raising discussions, counseling services and information in a multi-lingual format. Sheba Feminist Press opened in 1980, with the purpose of expanding printing services to women and translating works from other languages to English. They were accused of spreading erotica or lesbian propaganda by Conservatives in the government. Through the late 1980s, a liberationist group in Norwich was continuing direct action and protest on the issues of violence against women; however, most liberationists by the 1980s were transitioning away from direct action and recognizing that they had to find ways to engage with local, regional and national governments and agencies. =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland, the idea of Women's Liberation was often bound to the Nationalist Troubles of the era. Difficulties in advocating for women's rights when adherence to religious norms on morality and reproduction had become politicized, created a climate where advocates often had to shift focus to maintain an apolitical stance. During the period of Direct Rule, it was difficult for women to unite in a single struggle against patriarchy as the entire society was divided between whether there should be a United Ireland or a United Kingdom. Further, as men were interned, women were increasingly involved in developing coping mechanisms to care for their families and the violence surrounding them. The Northern Ireland Women's Rights Movement (NIWRM), formed in 1975, tried to achieve neutrality by focusing on employment rights and sexism. As an umbrella organization with a formal charter and a mission aimed toward reforming legislation, by bringing Britain's sex discrimination laws to Northern Ireland, it was not a liberationist organization. However, the Women's Aid Federation, which was developed by a group of women who broke away from NIWRM, in 1977, was based on a non-hierarchical structure and formed from the Liberation Movement. Groups were autonomous and were open to all women, regardless of their political affiliation. The organizational goals were to provide refuges from family violence for women and children and they established groups in Belfast, Coleraine and Derry, spreading to Newry, North Down and Omagh in the 1980s. Three London-based collectives working with women in Northern Ireland were the Women on Ireland Collective, Women and Ireland Group and the London-Armagh Coordinating Group. Each of these groups were autonomous organizations without a hierarchical organizational structure and affiliated with British WLM organizations, though they did not focus directly on patriarchal inequalities. The Women on Ireland Collective formed in 1974 and existed for one year. Members were all from Northern Ireland, members of the English WLM, and their work focused on improving awareness in Britain about Northern Irish women in working-class neighborhoods. Members worked to publicise the issues in Northern Ireland through conferences and public meetings, as well as through public demonstrations protesting prisoners' rights. After calling a hunger strike for two sisters, Marian and Dolours Price, and equating the government response of their force-feeding to suffragettes who had faced similar measures, the group drew harsh criticism from other members of the WLM. The Price sisters were seen as combatants because of their involvement with bombings and the controversy led to the dissolution of the collective in 1975. The Women and Ireland Group was formed in 1976 from some of the members of the Women on Ireland Collective. They participated in the rally held for the Peace People in Trafalgar Square in November 1976, but as opposition to the peace activists because of their support for the Provisional Irish Republican Army, as opposed to being neutral. The group, like its predecessor focused on support for working-class women in Northern Ireland and raising awareness among British WLM members. Branches formed in Bristol, Brighton, Dundee and Manchester and increasingly worked with women political prisoners, before dissolving in 1980. London- Armagh Coordinating Group, typically known as the Armagh Group, formed in 1980 and was active through 1987. Their activities focused on women political prisoners and prisoner rights. =Scotland= As in other countries within the UK, the WLM emerged in Scotland in 1970. Student protests and the challenges to authority that emerged in the 1960s, were key to the development of Scottish activists. Specifically the challenge to Malcolm Muggeridge, rector at Edinburgh University, by over his opinion regarding distributing the pill at the Student Union. In what came to be known as the Muggeridge Affair, Anna Coote, at the time editor of the campus newspaper The Student and later a prominent liberationist, wrote a series of articles calling for him to resign. Coote's position was that as rector, Muggeridge should have put his personal convictions aside to support the student pro-distribution position, as he was their elected representative. In the wake of the criticism, Muggeridge resigned. Conscousness-raising groups quickly formed and spread throughout Scotland, and though they were locally based had ties to regional and national networks of other groups. By 1970, groups had been established in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews, and among other places were founded in Dundee and Shetland in 1972. Groups continued to be formed throughout the 1970s, with establishments created in North Lanarkshire with members from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth assembling in 1978 and the Falkirk Area Women's Group forming in the Central Lowlands in 1979. The first Women's Liberation conference in Scotland was held in Glasgow in 1972 and thereafter occurred annually until 1976, when it became a twice yearly event. Conference locations shifted annually to allow women from all geographical locations to be able to participate in the events and activists donated to funds to pool monies for travel. Women's health became a focus of the WLM group from Glasgow, whereas lack of adequate childcare facilities became an important issue for groups in Aberdeen, Dundee, and Edinburgh. Other issues, such as women's objectification were addressed in direct actions, like when Edinburgh liberationists entered \\"Miss Conception\\", \\"Miss Fortune\\", \\"Miss Placed\\", \\"Miss Treated, and \\"Miss Used\\" in a mock beauty pageant staged in 1975. Similar action was taken by liberationists from Aberdeen who had been omitted from the \\"women's fayre\\" hosted at the Music Hall in celebration of International Women's Year. Activists in Dundee protested the male-only policy of the Tay Bridge Bar and sent complaints to the licensing board about the discrimination of being forced to retire to the lounge. Similar protests were held in Aberdeen, with the goal being to generate media coverage. In Shetland liberationists demonstrating against the opening of a strip club in Lerwick found themselves surrounded by religious groups who supported them, though not over their issue of women's objectification. Scottish liberationists who focused on the issue of abortion were aware that many of the challenges to the existing law came from Scottish politicians. Because of this, they focused more on abortion than the broader issues of reproduction and contraception. The lack of facilities in Scotland which performed abortions became an issue for liberationists, as for example, women from Shetland had no access and were forced to travel to Aberdeen for services. They campaigned for Area Health Boards to provide facilities in each geographical area. Members of various WLM groups published articles on how their MPs voted on the issue; distributed guides, like the Abortion Law Reform Association's booklet, A Woman's Right to Choose: Action Guide; and performed street theatre to highlight the perils of backstreet abortions. Fierce debate in the period, occurred at rallies hosted by anti- abortion and pro-abortion forces, polarizing society. Women's studies courses began in Aberdeen and Edinburgh in 1974 as part of an adult education initiative. Courses in Glasgow began in 1978 as part of an initiative sponsored by the Workers' Educational Association and the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Glasgow. Chris Aldred, a liberationist from Aberdeen and Margaret Marshall, head of the North of Scotland District WEA designed a ten-week programme to introduce women's education to Scottish working-class women. From 1975, Scottish women, who had up to that point relied on English publications for information about the movement, began their own initiatives. The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter began in 1975 and was published by WLM groups from Dundee and St Andrews. The Scottish Women's Liberation Journal began publication in 1977, changing its name to MsPrint the following year originated in Dundee and was printed by Aberdeen People's Press. Nessie, published in St Andrews, was begun in 1979. Disagreements over ideological issues with socialist feminists were prevalent from the beginning of the movement. Marxist or Maoist feminists believed that the focus should be on class struggle, with recognition that certain systems were biased towards male supremacy. Liberationists argued that socialist feminism failed to recognize the differences in class struggle and women's issues, which were often sidelined by focus on class. Socialist feminists also felt the focus on men as the enemy and the idea of women needing to separate themselves from men, led to misunderstandings and characterizations of feminists as man-haters and lesbians, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. To many, in the period where sexuality had been a taboo topic, lesbians were seen as more \\"scary than scared\\". Though the movement was fluid and aimed to incorporate all women, these types of differences often led to group fractures and by the late 1970s, separate conferences were held for socialist feminists and liberationists. From the mid-1970s liberationists in Scotland focused on violence against women and reached out to other autonomous women's groups to better understand as well as combat the problem. In 1972, activists in Edinburgh established a women's shelter to accommodate women and children. WLM members in Glasgow opened Interval House in 1974 and that same year the groups in Aberdeen and Dundee also opened shelters. Falkirk began planning a refuge in 1975 and opened a facility in 1976. Scottish liberationists, who had shunned participation in formal politics because of their patriarchal and reformist tendencies, began to develop campaigns and organizational structures which engaged with the state in the late 1970s. The Scottish Women's Aid formed in 1976 from liberationist groups, but recognizing the need to attain funding for the organization, they created a formal structure. By 1977, there were fifteen women's shelters scattered across the country, in places like Clackmannan, Kirkcaldy, Perth and Stirling. The first Rape Crisis Centre in the Scotland was established in 1976 and by 1979 a network linking the centers across the country was established. As Scottish women were not covered by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976, survivors of rape had to either have medical evidence or a witness to the violation to file charges. In addition, marital rape was not a crime. To raise awareness on the issue, WLM members wrote articles in journals and sent letters to their MPs. Beginning in 1976, liberationists participated in direct protests, such as Witching the Meadows, where Edinburg's WLM members dressed as witches and hexed a particularly dangerous section of The Meadows Park. From 1977, they staged marches known as Reclaim the Night in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow to gain publicity of the dangers to women of walking after dark. The last two WLM conferences in Scotland occurred in 1987 in Glasgow and 1989 in Edinburgh. =Wales= The Women's liberation movement in Wales was active in Cardiff and Swansea, but also had subgroups operating in Aberystwyth, Bangor, Carmarthen, Newport, and Pontypridd. The 1972 publication of The Descent of Woman by Welsh feminist and author, Elaine Morgan was influential for women involved in the movement. In 1974, the first Welsh National Women's Liberation Conference took place in Aberystyth. In 1978, the Welsh Women's Aid federation was established, which was led by Jane Hutt from its founding to 1988. Because of the WLM, the attitude of men towards women in pubs in Wales changed, becoming less taboo. The Greenham Common Peace Camp started in 1981. A group of women protesting nuclear missiles marched from Cardiff to the RAF Greenham. Women left their jobs and families in order to occupy the space and fight for peace in a direct action which recognized that men were responsible for most of the world's violence. Unaligned with political groups, the women gained wide support from the media and public for their stance to non-violence. Helen John was one of the founders of the occupation.

Biography  Charlotte Abramow was born in Brussels and made her first pictures around the age of 7. At the age of 16, she was spotted by photographer Paolo Roversi, during an internship at the 2010 Rencontres d'Arles. In 2011, Roversi wrote an article about her photos, \\"The fragility and soul of a warrior\\", published in Polka Magazine. In 2013, she joined the Gobelins School in Paris, and graduated in 2015. Her photographic work combines seriousness and absurdity. In 2017, she started making the video for the song La Loi de Murphy and Je veux tes yeux by Ang√®le. In 2018, she created a video clip for International Women's Day, using the song Les Passantes by Georges Brassens, based on an idea by Christophe Coffre, president of Havas. The metaphorical depiction of vulvae and menstruation in this clip leads a YouTube ban, for under-18. This classification was later removed after protests from users.

A cold, hard man, he was a notorious miser. Carrick Street in central Glasgow was named in his honour in 1800. Life He was born in the manse of Houston, Renfrewshire, the eldest son of Rev Robert Carrick http://www.glasgowhistory.co.uk/Books/MansionHouses/MansionChapters/Mount%20Vernon.htm and his wife Margaret Paisley. His brother John Carrick became a surgeon in Glasgow. He entered banking as an apprentice clerk in 1752 in the Ship Bank (then owned by Dunlop, Houson & Co).https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA02088 One of the partnersof the bank was Andrew Buchanan, an old personal friend of his father from their student days, and it is likely that Buchanan took him under his wing. In 1775 he became manager and partner in the Ship Bank then owned by Moores Carrick & Company.https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA02088 Around 1785 he appears to have acquired the estates of Braco north-east of Glasgow.

At the age of fourteen, he moved with his family to Mexico in 1845. In 1874 he resided in the county of San Francisco, at the southeast corner of Stockton and Francisco streets. He was married to Laura H. Gal√°n, and had twelve biological children, and two adopted sons. He was an interpreter and translator of the English, French, Spanish, and Italian languages. He resided in Mazatlan and Sinaloa, with his family until 1872. He died in Mexico City in October 1906.  Military life  At the age of fourteen, Gal√°n, attended the military academy in Chapultepec in Mexico City. While in the military academy, he became a cadet and was promoted to lieutenant for the Mexican Army. He fought with Mexico during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846‚Äì1848.  Political life  At the end of the war, Gal√°n, began to study law, was admitted to the bar and practiced on the Montgomery Block of Sinaloa and San Francisco, California. In the 1850s Gal√°n worked in the Gold fields in California. He soon discovered that the working and living conditions for Mexicans were unbearable. He was a Chief Justice of Lower California as well as a member of its congress. In September 1867, he was elected as governor of Baja California, but for one year only. He became ex-Officio governor of the same territory until May 1868. He was involved in a case concerning claims made regarding the Abra Silver Mining Company. Gal√°n gave his testimony at Washington DC on the third of January 1874. Because of his work in the newspaper and as a lawyer, he investigated happenings pertaining to this particular mining company. He translated and wrote down the depositions of several witnesses for the case regarding the claims that alleged damages had been sustained in consequence of particular acts and omissions of duty upon the part of official representatives of Republic of Mexico. Because of these claims, the Abra Company sought $1,930,000 from the government of Mexico in damages and losses suffered because of the violence committed by Mexico against the company. After all the trials and testimonies, it was determined that \\"the question stated in the act of 1892 whether the award in question 'was obtained as to the whole sum included therein, or as to any part thereof, by fraud effectuated by means of false swearing or other false and fraudulent practices on the part of the said La Abra Silver Mining Company, or its agents, attorneys, or assigns'‚Äîmust be answered in the affirmative as to the whole sum included in the award. That company placed before the commission a state of facts that had no existence, and which we are constrained by the evidence to say its principal representatives must have known had no existence, but which being credited by the commission under the evidence adduced before it brought about the result complained of in the bill. The whole story of losses accruing to that company by reason of wrongs done by the authorities of Mexico, is, under the evidence, improbable and unfounded. We do not wish to be understood as saying that the company did not meet with losses on account of its investments in this mining property. But we do adjudge that it had no claim which, upon any principle of law or equity, it was entitled to assert against the Republic of Mexico.\\"  Prominent works  In 1870, he moved back to California. He founded the first English and Spanish newspaper in lower California, called La Baja California. He published the first large weekly in Sinaloa, called the Occidental . From 1869 to 1872, Gal√°n was also involved in another newspaper called La Voz de Pueblo, in Maztalan. Gal√°n was a well educated man, and used his skills to edit several newspapers in Baja California and Sinaloa. He showed a predilection as a contributor for both an editor and a writer. Galan became editor of the newspaper La Voz del Nuevo Mundo in 1881 for one year. Gal√°n wrote a series of sketches called \\"Recuerdos de California\\", (Memories of California), that were published on May 21, May 28, and June 11, 1881, in La Voz del Nuevo Mundo. These stories are narrated by the perceptive of a former Sonora mining camp resident.  Significance in American Literature  As a Latino/a writer, Carlos F. Gal√°n contributed to American literature through his short prose narratives in Spanish print culture coming out of California. His works show the cross-roads of U.S. and hemispheric U.S. literary history. Specifically, his three sketches titled \\"Recuerdos de California\\" (Memories of California) provide a look at the multinational working class community in California and a look at how the Latino/a community without privilege experienced the new order of U.S. dominance. Since the work dates to the late 19th Century, the focus on the region of California allows for a demonstration of the Latino/a community only a couple of decades removed from the aftermath of the U.S.-Mexican War. (See Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo) Additionally, as editor of La Voz del Nuevo Mundo, Gal√°n focused the newspaper on themes of Latino/a modernity and cosmopolitanism in order to demonstrate the participation of the Latino/a community in the U.S. to modernity.

Background  Most e-commerce sites rate sellers by multiple criteria and display these seller ratings to customers. Since a good rating can boost sales, these ratings are very important to sellers. The number of items sold is usually an important factor in that rating. Brushing consists of generating fake orders to boost the rating. A seller can do this by paying someone a small amount to place a fake order, or just using another person's information to place an order themselves. Because a shipment usually has to take place for an order to be considered valid by the e-commerce site, the seller will frequently ship an empty box or some cheap item. These fake orders, if unnoticed, can boost the seller's rating, which can make it more likely that their items will appear at the top of search results on e-commerce sites. Many e-commerce sites have recognized the problem and claim to actively combat brushing. One company that has received a lot of attention is Alibaba, and in the prospectus they published before their initial public offering they even mentioned the problem. Brushing also inflates the numbers reported on a company's financial statements, and therefore it also attracts the scrutiny of investors and market regulators. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission opened a probe to investigate the validity of their data when Alibaba reported revenue of more than $14 billion on Singles Day.  Past incidents  APHIS Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) botanists at the National Identification Services (NIS) Lab in Beltsville, Maryland. In July 2019, consumers were warned to be wary of unsolicited Amazon packages following reports of individuals receiving packages they never ordered as part of such brushing schemes. In Amazon's system, those making the original purchase are allowed to leave a verified review for the product, thus boosting the rating by posting a fake five-star review. The customer's address may have been previously obtained by a third-party seller, or even through a simple Internet search. While receiving such packages may not necessarily indicate any greater problem, they could in some cases be indicative of a data breach. Customers who believed they may have been the victim of brushing scams were advised to immediately notify the retailer in question, as well as change their password and possibly utilize credit-monitoring services. In July 2020, thousands of packages of seeds marked with false descriptions such as earrings were received all over the world from China. The mysterious seeds caused biosecurity concerns but were thought to be another brushing scam. Authorities such as DEFRA and USDA investigated and Kentucky agriculture commissioner Ryan Quarles said: \\"We don‚Äôt have enough information to know if this is a hoax, a prank, an internet scam or an act of agricultural bioterrorism\\". China Post said that the mailing labels had been forged while Taiwan intended to fine a Chinese logistics company for transshipping contraband. In September 2020, an article by Motherboard which summarized the result of Freedom of Information Act requests relayed that a Utah lab reported, \\"Our seed lab has identified the following: rose, amaranth (not Palmer), 2 mints, False Horse Balm, Self Heal, Lespedeza and Sweet Potato.\\" References Category:E-commerce Category:Scams ","title":"Brushing (e-commerce)"},{"id":"57295768","text":"The Porto Tram Museum is a museum operated by the Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto. It was inaugurated in 1992 and is installed in a former thermoelectric power station next to the River Douro in Massarelos, Porto, Portugal. It exhibits material related to the history of trams in Porto. The collection contains 16 electric cars, 5 trailers, and two maintenance vehicles as well as the former equipment of the power plant, which provided electricity for the tram lines.  The building  The construction of the building as a power plant was completed in 1915. It consists of two large halls that were, respectively, the hall for the steam generators (boilers) and the engine room. Until the 1940s the power station produced enough energy to power the tram network. However, with the increase in the number of electric cars in circulation, the trams became partially dependent on the city‚Äôs power supply and in the 1960s energy production at the plant ceased, although it continues to operate as a substation for the three remaining tram lines. The museum was opened on the site in May 1992. One hall of the building houses the trams and the other the electrical equipment. An additional shed houses the trams that are still used on a daily basis. The museum closed in December 2012, re- opening in November 2015 after repairs costing around one million Euros.  The collection  The museum‚Äôs collection consists of the following cars. A parade of many of the cars in the collection is held in Porto annually. *Trailer Car 1.

This is a 1995 replica of a vehicle built in the first decade of the 20th century, which was destroyed in a large fire at Boavista station in Porto in February 1928. This, and car No. 104, can be hired for social events. *Electric Car 104. This vehicle is a replica with the same numbering and characteristics of an electric car that circulated initially as a trailer but, after 1895, was motorized. It was used until 1980. The construction of the replica was done in 1994. *Electric Car 163. This car features characteristics similar to those of the cars that were produced by the American J. G. Brill Company. However, its origin and date of manufacture are unknown. *Electric Car 247. This car was known by the name of \\"English car\\" because it was manufactured by the British United Electric Car Company of Preston. It was acquired by Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto in 1909 and underwent several changes that removed some of its original characteristics. Tram Number 250 *Electric Car 250.

This vehicle belonged to a series of 10 electric cars that were acquired by Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto from the Belgian company \\"Societ√© Anonyme des Ateliers de Construction d'Etablissements Famileureux\\" in 1928. Therefore, the cars of this series became known as the \\"Belgian cars \\". *Electric Car No. 315. This car belonged to a series of 16 cars, numbered from 300 to 315, built in the workshops of Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto between 1929 and 1930. *Electric Car 373. The electric cars of this series were designed and manufactured in the workshops of the Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto between the years 1947 and 1949. *Electric Car 500. This car was designed and built in the workshops of the Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto between the years of 1951 and 1952. This vehicle was the prototype of a series of cars that never were built. Its technical innovations included providing greater comfort to passengers and improved braking. *Hansa-Lloyd Tower Car (green). This car, for the repair of the overhead lines, was acquired in Germany in 1929 by Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto. It allowed a greater flexibility in the repair of the cables, providing an alternative to the cars previously used for type of repair. *Hansa-Lloyd Tower Car (grey). This was also acquired in 1929. Car Tower repair wagon 49 *Car Tower Wagon 49. This electric repair car was built by Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto in 1932. Equipped with a manual lift platform and a small workshop, it was intended to make minor repairs to the overhead lines and to electric cars while they were in service in the city. *Wagon 80. This type of wagon was used for the transportation of fish. It was used on a route between the fish market on the Atlantic at Matosinhos and the markets of Porto. It was towed by the trams that carried the fishmongers. *Dolly 58. Since the end of the 19th century, this type of dolly was used by the Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto to transport coal from the mines of S. Pedro da Cova, on the outskirts of Porto, to the power plant at Massarelos. *Dolly 66. This electric car, with open platforms, mainly aimed at the transport of coal, goods and materials for road works, was built in the workshops of Companhia Carris de Ferro do Porto in 1915. Because of exposure to rain the brakeman had to wear a large cloak, wide-brimmed hat, rubber boots and insulated gloves to protect him from water and contact with electricity. *Wagon for Immediate Relief 76.

His diss track \\"Asian Jake Paul\\" charted and peaked at number 24 on Billboard's US R&B;/HH Digital Song Sales chart.  Career  = Content Cop = Carter's Content Cop series highlights other YouTube channels, critiquing their content as well as their owner's behavior on social media. Each episode of Content Cop has been dubbed as an \\"event\\" by fellow YouTube commentators, with every new episode sparking controversy. Fellow YouTube personality Philip DeFranco has stated that he is a fan of Carter and that \\"no one does hit-pieces better than Ian\\", referring to his thorough but also entertaining style of criticism. Carter has produced Content Cops on a wide variety of YouTube personalities such as Daniel \\"Keemstar\\" Keem, Calvin \\"LeafyIsHere\\" Vail, Tana Mongeau and Bryan \\"RiceGum\\" Le. Carter's first Content Cop was released in December 2015 and targeted reaction YouTuber Jinx Reload. In the video, he criticizes his original videos being cringeworthy (namely How to get YouTube Famous, his parody interviews where he interviews pop stars and their responses are the vocals to the interviewee's songs, and Cartoons in the Hood), the fact that he hasn't improved the visual quality beyond 720p (claiming it was so he could upload more frequently), and his non-transformative reaction videos. In May 2016, Carter released a Content Cop on Daniel \\"Keemstar\\" Keem of DramaAlert, which has over 30 million views on YouTube as of May 2020. In the video, he accused Keem of threatening big YouTubers with negative coverage and promoting small channels or accusing them of hiding something. Carter called Keem a \\"very rash decision maker\\" and showed clips of Keem saying what he called \\"really regrettable shit\\". In response, Keem called the Content Cop video \\"entertaining\\" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has \\"no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews\\". He also apologized for the comments and incidents he caused, but \\"justified\\" saying 'nigger' by (jokingly) using a genealogical DNA test to prove he is nine percent black. On April 6, 2017, YouTuber and rapper Bryan \\"RiceGum\\" Le stated in a video that he would like to have a Content Cop made on him, stating: \\"I don't really care, but I kind of really want him to make one on me\\". In October 2017 Carter uploaded a video titled \\"Content Cop ‚Äì Jake Paul\\", which has over 48 million views as of May 2020. The 31-minute video, however, was not about former Disney actor and YouTube personality Jake Paul, but about Le. In the video, Carter called him \\"Asian Jake Paul\\", explaining that he didn't want to give Le the satisfaction of having his name in the title or his face in the thumbnail. Then he proceeded to analyze and criticize Bryan Le in a format resembling the seven deadly sins. To coincide with the episode of Content Cop, Carter released a music video for a new diss track titled \\"Asian Jake Paul\\", which has over 80 million views as of May 2020. The song was produced in collaboration with British YouTube personality and musician Dave \\"Boyinaband\\" Brown with cameos by prominent YouTube personalities such as PewDiePie, Jack Douglass, and Ethan Klein. The song peaked at number 24 on the R&B;/Hip-hop Digital Song Sales chart. RiceGum responded with several videos, including \\"Frick Da Police\\", a response diss track, and a 22-minute video response. The Content Cop video gained 20 million views in the first two weeks from its release, leading to backlash on Le for past comments towards a rape victim, to whom he apologized. Carter responded with a follow-up video titled \\"Content Deputy ‚Äì AJP\\" rebutting RiceGum's responses, featuring a comedic cameo by rapper Post Malone, and stating that this would be his final response to the situation. Carter has been credited for making several videos and cameos that became Internet memes. = Controversy = Referring to Carter's controversial past use of the word \\"nigger\\", YouTuber Tana Mongeau criticized him on Snapchat, and controversially wrote to Carter on Twitter, \\"so 3 million ppl subscribe to u and u openly say the n-word and retard???? Kill yourself.\\" Mongeau also said she would be \\"genuinely happy\\" if Carter were to \\"break both of his legs and lose all of his subscribers\\". On January 21, Carter confronted Tana Mongeau at a VIP meet-and-greet session in San Francisco. Carter posed for a photo with Mongeau while wearing her merchandise, put his arm around her shoulder, and instead of saying \\"say cheese\\" said \\"say nigger\\". Carter was escorted off the premises by security. Three days later, Mongeau uploaded a video titled \\"The N Word\\" describing her version of the encounter. Carter subsequently published a Content Cop episode on Mongeau, accusing her of hypocrisy by showing videos of Mongeau using the word \\"nigger\\" in the past. He also defended his use of the word, claiming the significance of the context in which the word is used. On March 28, 2020, Carter uploaded a video defending the adult entertainment industry and responding to the remarks of fans accusing him of being a \\"simp\\" because of his support for his girlfriend starting an OnlyFans account.

Seeking to possibly resurrect the contest, Blachman and MSRI development director Jim Sotiros reached out to colleagues in the educational community. One response was from local high school math teacher Joshua Zucker, who also remembered the contest and even had saved a book of problems from it. Sotiros suggested that Blachman and her husband David desJardins fund MSRI in order to hire Zucker to recreate a program in the style of the Saint Mary‚Äôs Math Contest. Blachman and Zucker became co-founders and organized their first event in 2007.Joshua Zucker Math Forum They called it a festival rather than a contest because they wanted to emphasize collaboration, creativity and fun rather than competition. They named the festival after Julia Robinson, a mathematician renowned for her contributions to decision problems. In fact, her work on Hilbert's 10th problem played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution. Blachman felt that such a woman would provide a role model for young girls and would show that one need not be male to be a great mathematician.\\"Getting Kids Excited About Mathematics, One Festival at a Time\\" By Colm Mulcahy, Huffington Post Blog, December 6, 2017 When they sent out invitations to local schools, the response was so overwhelming that, in order to have enough space, they prevailed upon Google in nearby Mountain View to host the first festival.The 2007 Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at Google was the founding of this event for middle school and high school students. video A second festival was hosted in 2008 by Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville.History of JRMF By Nancy Blachman, JRMF Founder Enthusiasm and interest have spurred strong growth, and since then, there have been festivals at Princeton University (and its greater community); Stanford University; and University of California, Berkeley,julia robinson mathematics festival at past and throughout the United States,UK Mathematics Hosts Julia Robinson Math Festival By Jenny Wells, University of Kentucky, October 30, 2017 as well as in Europe and Asia.The Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival in Hong Kong, March 24, 2018 As of December 2019, JRMF will have hosted nearly 500 events in 25 states, the District of Columbia, one territory (Puerto Rico), and 15 foreign countries.

Retrieved May 1st, 2018. = Research on multinational firms= One major area of G√∂rg's research regards the behaviour of multinational firms. Therein, he has in particular researched - often with Strobl - how productivity spills over from multinationals to a host country's domestic firms, e.g. through worker mobility, demonstration effects, and technological competition.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2001). Multinational companies and productivity spillovers: A meta-analysis. Economic Journal, 111(475), pp. 723-739. In the Irish manufacturing sector, which a substantial part of G√∂rg's research focuses on, G√∂rg and Strobl find that multinational companies support the development of indigenous firms through linkages with local suppliers.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2002). Multinational companies and indigenous development: An empirical analysis. European Economic Review, 46(7), pp. 1305-1322. Therein, they also find that the multinationals are indeed more \\"footloose\\" than indigenous firms in terms of having plants with lower survival rates, though new jobs generates in multinationals appear to be more persistent than those created in indigenous plants.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2003). 'Footloose' multinationals? Manchester School, 71(1), pp. 1-19. Relatedly, they observe that the presence of multinationals is associated with higher survival rates of domestic plants in high-tech industries, likely due to technology spillovers, whereas multinationals in Ireland's low-tech sectors simply compete with each other.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2003). Multinational companies, technology spillovers and plant survival. Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 105(4), pp. 581-595. Investigating whether productivity spillovers from multinationals can be attributed to multinationals' previous employees using their acquired know- how to start their own enterprises, they find that firms managed by owners who used to work for multinationals in the same industry immediately prior to opening up their own firm are more productive than other domestic firms.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2005). Spillovers from foreign firms through worker mobility: An empirical investigation. Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 107(4), pp. 693-709. In another study on the Irish manufacturing sector, G√∂rg and Strobl find that public R&D; subsidies of any size don't affect establishments' private R&D; spending if they belong to a multinational, whereas large R&D; grants to domestic plants are found to crowd out private R&D; spending and small ones to promote it.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2007). The effect of R&D; subsidies on private R&D.; Economica, 74(294), pp. 215-234. Together with Salvador Barrios, G√∂rg and Strobl also argue that Irish regional policy successfully attracted low-tech firms to disadvantaged areas when using a more indirect approach, though overall policy incentives seem to have been a less important determinant of multinationals' location choice than agglomeration economies.Barrios, S., G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2006). Multinationals' location choice, agglomeration economies, and public incentives. International Regional Science Review, 29(1), pp. 81-107. Finally, in the UK, G√∂rg finds together with Sourafel Girma that the effect of acquisition by a foreign firm on workers' wages (the \\"foreign ownership wage premium\\") depends on the nationality of the foreign acquirer and the skill group of workers, with e.g. substantial post-acquisition wage effects on skilled and unskilled wages if a firm has been acquired by a multinational from the U.S., no such effects in the case of an EU acquirer, and a positive wage effect for unskilled workers if acquired by multinationals from the rest of the world.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H. (2007). Evaluating the foreign ownership wage premium using a difference-in- differences matching approach. Journal of International Economics, 72(1), pp. 97-112. In later work with Strobl and Frank Walsh, G√∂rg finds that this foreign ownership wage premium can likely be attributed to the higher gain in productivity and firm-specificity of foreign-owned firms' on-the-job training, as the wage premium of foreign-owned firms' workers is only earned gradually and by those who receive on-the-job training.G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E., Walsh, F. (2007). Why do foreign-owned firms pay more? The role of on-the-job training. Review of World Economics, 143(3), pp. 464-482. = Research on foreign direct investment= A second area of G√∂rg's research is foreign direct investment (FDI). In particular, G√∂rg argues that a firm entering a foreign market via FDI is generally best off by acquiring an existing indigenous high-technology firm in order to form a duopoly with an indigenous low-technology firm instead of setting up an entirely new plant (greenfield investment).G√∂rg, H. (2000). Analysing foreign market entry - The choice between greenfield investment and acquisitions. Journal of Economic Studies, 27(3), pp. 165-181. Together with Strobl and Frank Barry, he moreover finds that both \\"efficiency agglomerations\\", i.e. increases in firms' efficiency due to reductions in the distance between them, and \\"demonstration effects\\", i.e. firms' signals to new investors that the host country is reliable and attractive, were important determinants of U.S. firm entry into Ireland.Barry, F., G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2003). Foreign direct investment, agglomerations, and demonstration effects: An empirical investigation. Review of World Economics, 139(4), pp. 583-600. Reviewing the literature on FDI and intra-industry spillovers with David Greenaway, G√∂rg and Greenaway conclude that empirical evidence for a positive impact of foreign direct investment through productivity, wage and export spillovers from the pre-2000s is at best mixed and warrants further research.G√∂rg, H., Greenaway, D. (2001). Foreign direct investment and intra- industry spillovers: A review of the literature. Nottingham: Leverhulme Centre for Research on Globalisation and Economic Policy.G√∂rg, H., Greenaway, D. (2004). Much ado about nothing? Do domestic firms really benefit from foreign direct investment? World Bank Research Observer, 19(2), pp. 171-197. In another study with Strobl and Barrios, G√∂rg finds that while inward FDI in Ireland may have initially deterred the entry of local firms by signalling an increase in competition, this initial effect has been exceeded by positive externalities fostering the development of local firms, resulting in an overall strongly positive impact of FDI on the local economy.Barrios, S., G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2005). Foreign direct investment, competition and industrial development in the host country. European Economic Review, 49(7), pp. 1761-1784. With Girma, he also finds that British establishments' ability to benefit from productivity spillovers from FDI depends on their absorptive capacity.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H. (2005). Foreign direct investment, spillovers and absorptive capacity: Evidence from quantile regressions. Bundesbank Discussion Paper Series 1: Economic Studies, No. 13. Finally, G√∂rg and Paolo Figini argue that the impact of FDI on wage inequality depends on countries' economic development: In developing countries, inward FDI degressively increases wage inequality, whereas inward FDI in developed countries decreases wage inequality.Figini, P., G√∂rg, H. (2011). Does foreign direct investment affect wage inequality? An empirical investigation. World Economy, 34(9), pp. 1455-1475. = Research on firm exports= A third research area in G√∂rg's work studies the exports of firms. Together with Barrios and Strobl, G√∂rg observes that, in the 1990s, own R&D; activity made Spanish firms more likely to export, while R&D; spillovers increase firms' export ratios, especially if they are exporting to other OECD countries; by contrast, there is little evidence for export spillovers.Barrios, S., G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2003). Explaining firms' export behaviour: R&D;, spillovers and the destination market. Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 65(4), pp. 475-496. In research with Girma and Strobl, he moreover finds that multinational plants in the UK perform better than domestic exporters and non-exporters, which perform roughly about the same.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H., Strobl, E. (2004). Exports, international investment, and plant performance: Evidence from a non- parametric test. Economics Letters, 83(3), pp. 317-324. G√∂rg, Girma and Mauro Pisu argue that the effects from productivity spillovers from FDI on domestic firms are very complex and differ substantially depending on whether the domestic firm operates in the export market as well as on the type of inward FDI.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H., Pisu, M. (2008). Exporting, linkages and productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment. Canadian Journal of Economics, 41(1), pp. 320-340. Additionally, G√∂rg, Girma and Aoife Hanley find that previous exporting experience enhances the innovative capability of Irish firms, whereas British firms don't display strong learning-by-exporting effects, with differences being partly attributable to Irish firms' greater interface with OECD markets.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H., Hanley, A. (2008). R&D; and exporting: A comparison of British and Irish firms. Review of World Economics, 144(4), pp. 750-773. Finally, G√∂rg, Strobl and Michael Henry assess that if export grants are large enough, they can encourage already exporting firms to compete more effectively on the international market, though grants don't appear to encourage nonexporters to start exporting.G√∂rg, H., Henry, M., Strobl, E. (2008). Grant support and exporting activity. Review of Economics and Statistics, 90(1), pp. 168-174. = Research on international outsourcing= A fourth area of G√∂rg's research concerns outsourcing, which he has intensively studied in Ireland and the UK. Together with Hanley, he finds that the international outsourcing of the production of intermediate materials increases the productivity of plants in the Irish electronics sector only if these have low export intensities,G√∂rg, H., Hanley, A. (2005). International outsourcing and productivity: Evidence from the Irish electronics industry. North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 16(2), pp. 255-269. but that the oursourcing of services inputs only increases the productivity of domestic or foreign owned plants which export.G√∂rg, H., Hanley, A., Strobl, E. (2008). Productivity effects of international outsourcing: Evidence from plant-level data. Canadian Journal of Economics, 41(2), pp. 670-688. The impact of outsourcing on profitability appears to depend not only on the type of outsourced input but also on plant size, with e.g. large plants benefitting from outsourcing materials whereas small plants don't.G√∂rg, H., Hanley, A. (2004). Does outsourcing increase profitability? Economic and Social Review, 35(3), pp. 267-288. With regard to labour demand, outsourcing appears to decrease plant-level labour demand in the short run, especially for the outsourcing of materials.G√∂rg, H., Hanley, A. (2005). Labour demand effects of international outsourcing: Evidence from plant-level data. International Review of Economics & Finance, 14(3), pp. 365-376. In British manufacturing, G√∂rg and Girma find that outsourcing might be motivated by cost savings as wages increase as outsourcing increases, that foreign-owned firms have higher levels of outsourcing, and that establishments' labour productivity and total factor productivity growth increases in establishments' outsourcing intensity, especially among foreign-owned ones.Girma, S., G√∂rg, H. (2004). Outsourcing, Foreign Ownership, and Productivity: Evidence from UK Establishment-Level Data. Review of International Economics, 12(5), pp. 817-832. Moreover, together with Alexander Hijzen and Robert Hine, G√∂rg finds that international outsourcing strongly decreased the demand for unskilled labour in the UK while R&D; increased the demand for skilled labour.Hijzen, A., G√∂rg, H., Hine, R.C. (2005). International outsourcing and the skill structure of labour demand in the United Kingdom. Economic Journal, 115(506), pp. 860-878. Similarly, in Germany, G√∂rg and Ingo Geishecker observe that a 1 percentage point increase in an industry's outsourcing reduced the wages of low-skilled workers within that industry by up to 1.5% whereas it increased those of high-skilled workers by up to 2.6%.Geishecker, I., G√∂rg, H. (2008). Winners and losers: A micro- level analysis of international outsourcing and wages. Canadian Journal of Economics, 41(1), pp. 243-270.

Since its inception in July 2012, the company has insured more than $65 billion in par amount for more than 3,300 member-issuers. In 2018, it insured $8.36 billion par across 653 new-issue insured transactions. BAM also publishes a credit profile for every transaction it insures and updates them. More than 6,000 are now available. The company is the preferred provider of financial guaranty insurance on debt for member municipalities of the National League of Cities. NLC endorsed BAM upon its launch. Key people Build America Mutual's leadership consists of a seven-member board of directors, including its co-founders, board chairman Robert Cochran and chief executive officer Se√°n McCarthy. Previously, Cochran co-founded Financial Security Assurance and was its CEO from 1990 to 2009. McCarthy was president and chief operating officer of bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp. following its acquisition of Financial Security Assurance in July 2009. Its seven-member board includes three designated representatives of the public-sector issuers who used BAM to insure their bonds. The original public representatives included former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and former New York Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch. Ravitch left the board in September 2016 and was replaced by longtime municipal advisor John White. Rendell left the board in April 2019 and was replaced by municipal analyst Natalie Cohen. On Jan. 17, 2018, the company formed a strategic advisory committee that will advise management on opportunities to build on the company's track record. Its charter members include Dan Keating, former chief operating officer of Samuel A. Ramirez & Co.; Chris Hamel, former municipal finance head at RBC Capital Markets; Thalia Meehan, who sits on the board of the Boston women in public finance and is a past member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board investor advisory group; and Ken Williams, the retired head of municipal securities for Stifel Financial Group. In February 2018, the company named Grant Dewey, a former managing director at Citigroup‚Äôs municipal bond division, as head of municipal capital markets. On 9 May 2020, Build America Mutual and Assured Guaranty have accounted for $7.30 billion in 563 sales, up from the $5.99 billion spanning 490 transactions that wreak havoc on governmental and local income due to COVID-19. Inception The financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 effectively devastated the once-thriving industry. While few insured municipal bonds defaulted, bond insurers who had expended into structured finance were ravaged by losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. Build America Mutual opened in July 2012, with the once-thriving bond insurance industry still reeling. While insured bonds accounted for more than half of the market in 2005, merely 4% percent of muni issues were insured in the first half of 2012. BAM began writing coverage that September, after the New York State Department of Financial Services issued its license. The company‚Äôs initial focus was issues of less than $75 million. According to the state, the company was initially capitalized with $600 million in financing. It subsequently expanded to insure some larger issues, and added $100 million to its claims-paying resources through a reinsurance agreement with Fidus Re Ltd. Additionally, its mutual model generated capital growth to support growth in the insured portfolio, thus eliminating the need to ‚Äúgo public‚Äù to raise capital or to assume risks beyond the core municipal market; and it cited the benefit of collateralized first- loss reinsurance protection for losses up to the first 15% of par on each policy written. Ratings At BAM's inception, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (later S&P; Global Ratings) assigned BAM an initial bond rating of 'AA' ‚Äì its third highest‚Äîwith a stable outlook. On June 6, 2017, S&P; placed BAM and National Public Finance Guarantee Corp., the third bond insurer, on credit watch with negative implications, saying it ‚Äúmay adjust certain ratings based on a company's competitive strengths or weaknesses relative to its peers.‚Äù S&P; removed the company from credit watch and affirmed its AA rating on June 26, 2017, citing the end of BAM's first five years. ‚Äú[It] reflects the company‚Äôs transition from a ‚Äòstartup‚Äô to a ‚Äòmature company‚Äô under S&P;'s rating criteria for financial guaranty insurers,‚Äù said S&P.; Transparency BAM posts a credit profile on every issue it insures in the primary or secondary market. They include fundamental information about the bond, economic and demographic information about the credit, and financial information and key ratios. Profiles noted with a \\"PRE\\" in the Cusip field are provided before the pricing of an issue where BAM has been selected as the insurer, and are intended for use by purchasers of the BAM-insured bonds. The company supersedes these with final profiles when the transaction closes. BAM updates profiles annually after it receives the obligor's audited financial statements.

She began her career as a teacher in 1859 and then married a whaling captain. As he missed his wife, he sent for her to join him and she met him in Honolulu, at that time, within the Sandwich Islands. The two sailed back to New Bedford aboard the Oriole arriving in 1866. Two years later, she went aboard ship with her husband and children, and lived in Honolulu and aboard his ship the Roman until 1871. She sailed twice around Cape Horn and was possibly the first white woman on Tahuata in the Marquesas Islands. After a mutiny on their second voyage, she returned to live on Martha's Vineyard. One of the accounts was written by her young daughter Laura Jernegan Spear. Early life Hellen Meriah Clark was born on September 8, 1839 in Gorham, Cumberland County, Maine to Eveline D. (n√©e McLellan) and Aaron Clark. She was raised in Maine until the age of twelve, when she began living with her mother's sister, Charlotte (n√©e McLellan) Coffin and her family to Edgartown, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard. She attended school on the island and worked as a teacher after her graduation at North Primary School, starting in 1859. In 1861, she met the ship captain Jared Jernegan, a widower with a son, Aylmer, who had been born in 1854. Though Jared was fifteen years older than she, they married that June in Maine. Adventuring Within a year of the marriage, in June 1862, Jared set sail for the Sandwich Islands, as Hawaii was known at the time. Within weeks of his leaving, Jernegan gave birth to their first child, Laura on June 29, 1862. Missing his family, Jared wrote asking Jernegan to meet him in Honolulu to make the return voyage with him. She left their daughter with her Aunt Pierce took a train to New York and boarded a steamship in September 1865. After an eight-day sea journey, she arrived in Aspinwall, Panama and boarded a train to take the fifty mile journey to Panama City. Boarding another steamer, Jernegan sailed for ten days to reach San Francisco, where she was delayed two weeks awaiting passage to Honolulu. When she arrived in Honolulu, the couple spent a month there before starting the return voyage. Sailing aboard the Oriole for Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, they made their way back to New Bedford, Massachusetts, after passing Cape Horn, arriving in September 1866. Three months later, on December 17, 1866, the couple's second child, Prescott Ford was born. Jared had earned enough from the trip aboard the Oriole to support the family for the next two years, but in 1868, he decided to take command of the Roman and sail with the entire family. Jernegan spent her days aboard ship watching the children and piecing by hand a lob cabin quilt, which would contain 2310 strips of fabric. While on board the ship, Jared chalked out an area for the children to run freely but be away from the men working with the whales. He also made a schoolhouse on deck for Jernegan to give lessons to Laura. To practice her writing, Jernegan had Laura keep a diary of the trip. They sailed around Cape Horn and made landfall on the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. From there, they proceeded to Cecorius Island where they met Jared's brother Nathan to exchange news and trade salt. On March 29, 1869, the Roman made landfall at Honolulu and Jernegan and the children disembarked. They lived in a rented cottage on Fort Street while Jared continued north to the Arctic. Helen Clark Jernegan, her daughter Laura, her grandson Carleton and her mother Eveline D Clark By October, Jared had returned and unwilling to be separated longer from his family, they joined him aboard ship when he sailed in November to hunt whales near the equator. The family spent five months at sea making stops at Ohitahoo, where Jernegan was reported to have been the first white woman to land on that Marquesas Island and Nuku Hiva. They spent eight days on Ohitahoo and the children encountered bananas, breadfruit, coconuts, guavas, lemons, limes, mamey apples, oranges, pineapples and plantains, writing home about the variety of fruit. By March 1870, they were back in Honolulu, where they rented another small cottage on Fort Street. All the meals for the family were purchased from the Chinese proprietor of a nearby hotel and Prescott had a native woman who served as his nanny. Jernegan reported watching native surfers ride the waves, while Jared returned to the Arctic for the season. Returned from the north by December, once again Jared took the family aboard and made for the equator by way of Maria Island (also known as the Peru atoll) in the between season of 1870. Soon, they struck a reef, but emerged unscathed. Returning to Ohitahoo, they anchored in Resolution Bay with the intent of restocking supplies and repairing some rot on the topsail. As they were preparing to sail back to Honolulu, seventeen crewmen, who had gone ashore and returned drunk, mutinied. The second mate and second officer were badly injured. Jared, armed with his Henry rifle, locked Jernegan and the children in the stateroom and took up a position in the saloon. Soon the mutineers lowered three whaleboats and left the whaler under threat that they would return and burn it. During the mutiny, the fourth mate and his party were en route to the Roman and arrived in time to release the second mate and Jared. Though only nine sailors remained on board, Jared slipped anchor and put to sea. Arriving in Honolulu in March 1871, Jared returned to the Arctic, but sent Jernegan and the children back to Edgartown by way of San Francisco. Jared's ship was lost on the voyage, but he returned to join his family in Edgartown, where the couple's youngest child Marcus was born in 1872. Jernigan did not return to sea, though Jared completed seven more whaling voyages before he retired in 1888. After his death in 1899, Jernigan lived with her son Marcus until 1900, but thereafter supported herself from her own income. Death and legacy Jernigan died on February 26, 1934 in Edgartown. In 1954, the NBC Radio program Inheritance featured an episode, \\"The Whale Hunters\\" which was narrated by George Lefferts about the Jernigan family voyage of 1870‚Äì1871.

Derived from the civil rights movement, student movement and anti-war movements, the Women's Liberation Movement took rhetoric from the civil rights idea of liberating victims of discrimination from oppression. They were not interested in reforming existing social structures, but instead were focused on changing the perceptions of women's place in society and the family and women's autonomy. Rejecting hierarchical structure, most groups which formed operated as collectives where all women could participate equally. Typically, groups associated with the Women's Liberation Movement held consciousness-raising meetings where women could voice their concerns and experiences, learning to politicize their issues. To members of the WLM rejecting sexism was the most important objective in eliminating women's status as second-class citizens. In North America, the movement began in the United States and Canada almost simultaneously with the first articles articulating their aims appearing around 1965. By 1967, organizations had formed in major US and Canadian cities spreading within a year throughout both countries. In Mexico, sparked by the movement in the north, groups began to form in 1971. Characterized as man- haters and radicals, the movement in North America gave way to more liberal reformers by the mid-1970s in the United States and Canada and by the early 1980s in Mexico.  Canada  The Women's Liberation Movement in Canada derived from the anti-war movement, Native Rights Movement and the New Left student movement of the 1960s. An increase in university enrollment, sparked by the post-World War II baby boom, created a student body which believed that they could be catalysts for social change. Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, ethnic empowerment, and peace, as well as gay and women's liberation. The Canadian magazine, Chatelaine serialized Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique and published articles on birth control, modifications needed for the divorce laws, and other women's issues, making them public concerns. Institutionalized feminists, (liberal feminism) focused efforts on forming a royal commission to evaluate women's status and address them through reforms, but grass-roots feminists desired more radical change. As early as 1967, women in Toronto had formed a Women's Liberation Group and in July 1968, a group of women students at Simon Fraser University (SFU) organized the Feminine Action League (FAL). Faculty, like Margaret Benston supported Women's Lib encouraging studies to gain an understanding of women's societal roles and the perception of women's place both by themselves and by men. In that year, the U.S. organization SNCC barred whites from participating in leadership positions, influencing the founders of FAL to ban men in their organization. Though often depicted in media as a sign of \\"man-hating\\", separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women's inequality as child-rearers, citizens, sexual objects, wives, workers, etc. were commonly experienced by women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status. Politicizing personal issues was done in consciousness-raising sessions aimed at eliminating the need to rally support for abstract causes, because the issues were those impacting women's daily lives. Soon after their forming, the group changed their name to the SFU Women's Caucus and initially focused on contraception and pregnancy prevention for students. In July 1969, the group moved off-campus, to downtown Vancouver, opening offices as the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC). They began publishing a newspaper, Pedestal, focused on women's liberation and protesting sexist hierarchy and male-domination in the student movement. Women's Caucuses also formed at the University of Alberta and the University of Regina, as offshoots of the Students for a Democratic Union (SDU) and at the University of Toronto aligned with the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA). As in the U.S. a network of women's centers, which included spaces like the Ste-Famille Women's Centre in Montreal and the Prince George Women's Centre in northern British Columbia developed to facilitate meetings of women and provide them with services. WLM groups sprang up throughout Canada, though in Quebec there was a struggle over whether women's liberation or Qu√©b√©cois liberation should be the focus for women radicals. Advocating public self-expression, such as participating in protests and sit- ins, organizations affiliated with the movement tended to operate on a consensus-based structure and participated in consciousness-raising, like their U.S. counterparts. However, Canadian Women's Lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from U.S. liberation theory. For example, Frances Wasserlein, a prominent LGBT and feminist activist who chronicled the history of the Abortion Caravan, argued that to be involved in the WLM in Vancouver equated to being a socialist. Some of the first actions of the VWC were to protest discriminatory hiring and wage practices of the Civil Service Commission against women. Other direct actions included the occupation of a building on the University of Toronto campus by the Toronto Women Liberation Movement. Having tried to negotiate with the university to establish day care centers and failing in their efforts, they took over a university-owned house, cleared out the squatters, and renovated it for their children. In response to the passage of a reform to the civil code on abortions in 1969, the VWC began a series of protests focused on abortion. Marge Hollibaugh and other liberationists organized the Western Regional Conference on Women's Liberation, which was held during the Thanksgiving weekend at the University of British Columbia campus to spread the word about the upcoming caravan. Betsy Wood organized a guerrilla theatre performance on Valentine's Day 1970 at the Vancouver Courthouse to illustrate the inequalities which could emerge from allowing Therapeutic Abortion Committees to make decisions for women and the consequences of denying procedures which could be suicide or back-alley abortions. It was also Wood's idea to organize the caravan, which she had proposed at the October conference. Members of the VWC left Vancouver on 27 April performing guerrilla theatre along the way. They reached Ottawa on 9 May and assembled with other WLM groups from throughout Canada at Parliament Hill. Over the next three days, they managed to stage a protest at the home of the Prime Minister and disrupt the House of Commons, shutting it down for the first time in history. In Quebec, 1969 was also pivotal, with the establishment of the Women's Liberation Front (). Their slogan was \\"Pas de lib√©ration des femmes sans lib√©ration du Qu√©bec! Pas de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec sans lib√©ration des femmes!\\" (No liberation of women without liberation of Quebec! No liberation of Quebec without women's liberation!) and they supported changes to gain socio-economic and political equality, but also pressed for Quebec's autonomy and a recognition of the unpaid labor of women working in the home and in family businesses. One of their first demonstrations was against the prohibition of public protests put forth by the administration of Montreal's mayor, Jean Drapeau. In 1970, Nicole Th√©rien and Louise Toupin set forth a manifesto proclaiming that in a society defined by exploiters and the exploited, woman and Qu√©b√©cois citizens were slaves of the exploited. That same year the FLF founded a newspaper called Qu√©b√©coise deboytte! (Quebec women standing up!) in protest to mainstream media's curtailment of women's voices. In November 1970 the first national conference of the WLM was held in Saskatoon. Marlene Dixon, a sociology professor teaching at McGill University debunked the idea of an autonomous women's movement, encouraging women to join extant movements fighting racism and classism. The radical movement in Canada was shaped by these opposing views of whether women could gain equality within the existing socio-economic/political system or whether capitalism had to be overturned to create human equality. In 1973, Rosemary Brown, the first Black Canadian woman elected to a provincial legislature in the country, spoke at the national congress of the Canadian Negro Women's Association. She embraced the ideas of the WLM and rejected the idea that black women were needed in the struggle for black men to achieve equality. Rather than being an anti-male position, she believed that black men were not weak and in need of women propping them up. She saw the movement as one which validated the human import of males and females. In 1971, Lisa Balcer, called as a witness for the trial of Paul Rose in the kidnappings perpetrated by the Quebec Liberation Front the previous year, refused to testify because women were not allowed to serve as jurors. She was declared to be in contempt of court. Seven women from the courtroom who were members of the FLF stood and protested legal discrimination of women. All seven were arrested and served from one to two months in jail, but their action brought attention to the problems of inequality. A few months after their protest, women gained the right to serve as jurors in Quebec. By the late 1970s, the Marxist and liberationists' alliance fractured in part because of media characterization of radicals in the grass-roots movement as \\"crazy\\", but in part because the radical grass-roots groups had difficulty mobilizing women under abstract theories. Bonnie Kreps, who wrote \\"Radical Feminism 1\\" which was published in 1973 in the anthology Radical Feminism: The Book portrayed Canadian feminists as falling into three categories: socialist feminists, who were opposed to capitalism; liberal feminists, who were concerned with equal rights and equal pay; and radical feminists who focused on \\"the oppression of women as women\\" or sexism. Activists who had been involved in the WLM turned their efforts toward violence against women, when the liberal feminists gained the dominant position and public perception that legal change to the existing systems were the legitimate concerns of the women's movement. In 2007, Marjolaine P√©loquin, published a history of the movement in Quebec, En prison pour la cause des femmes: la conqu√™te du banc des jur√©s (In prison for the cause of women: the conquest of the jury box), critically analyzing the short- lived but significant impact of the FLF.  United States  Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective on roof of Westbeth in NYC 1971 Just as the Women's Suffrage movement grew out of the Abolition Movement, the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights. Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of second-wave feminism. Rather than simply desiring legal equality, members believed that the moral and social climate in the United States needed to change. Though most groups operated independently‚Äîthere was no national umbrella organization‚Äîthere were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate, participants in the movement believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society. One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced. They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions. Among the issues were the objectification of women, reproductive rights, opportunities for women in the workplace, redefining familial roles. A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism. The publication of The Feminine Mystique by Friedan pointed to the dissatisfaction of many women in American society and was seen as a catalyst for the movement, though after she co-founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966, Friedan was seen by radicals as too mainstream. NOW's stated purpose was to work within established social and legal systems to gain equality, which clashed with radical feminists who believed that traditional power-structures had failed women and needed to be reformed. In 1964, an anonymous paper (later revealed to have been written by Elaine Delott Baker, Casey Hayden, Mary King, and Emmie Schrader), \\"The Position of Women in SNCC\\" (the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) was presented by Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson at the Waveland conference. The paper discussed the analogous relationship between sex and race discrimination within the context of the work environment and was seen as a critically important document for evaluating gender and women's issues. Stokely Carmichael's response to the paper, \\"The only position for women in SNCC is prone\\", has been taken by some to have been condescending, but Carol Giardina argued in her work Freedom for Women: Forging the Women's Liberation Movement that the statement was made jokingly and that focus on the controversy about Carmichael's remark deflects the positive reinforcement and leadership opportunities that many women found within the SNCC. Between 1965 and 1966 meetings, at which papers and conversations about women's place in society were discussed, became more prevalent. An article published in Random, a Canadian journal, advocated that women should participate in self-examination without male scrutiny or advice to embark on their own path of self-discovery. In the summer of 1967 at the Students for a Democratic Society‚Äôs national conference, a manifesto drafted by the Women‚Äôs Liberation Workshop defined the relationship of women to men as one that a colonial power had toward its colonies. The document demanded that men take responsibility for their male chauvinism and that women demand full participation in all activities of the organization. Following the meeting, women's groups such as the Bread and Roses in Boston and Women's Liberation Group of Berkeley were founded. In Chicago, at a women's workshop held over Labor Day weekend that same year during the National Conference of New Politics (NCNP), Jo Freeman and Shulamith Firestone presented demands from the woman's caucus to the plenary session. The moderator advised that the points of their resolution were insignificant and did not merit discussion on the floor. Over their protests and refusing to discuss the demands further, NCNP Director William F. Pepper moved the topic toward a discussion of Native Americans, but agreed to tack on their concerns to the end of the agenda. Dismissively, Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \\"Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation\\", or possibly, \\"Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\\" Soon after the meeting Freeman, Heather Booth, and Naomi Weisstein founded the Women's Radical Action Project (WRAP), as a vehicle for consciousness-raising. At these meetings, women met regularly to discuss personal dilemmas and to analyze how politics shaped and impacted women's lives. Consciousness-raising discussions were wide-ranging from intimate relationships to social justice issues, with participants stressing the importance of not only having choices but being free to make them. Their discussions recognized that legislation could not change many of the issues which confronted women, but that education and redefining societal roles would be required to change attitudes and mores. Within six months, the voice of women's liberation began publication by Freeman as the first radical newspaper of the movement. Firestone left the Chicago conference and returned to New York to found the New York Radical Women (NYRW) with Pamela Allen, among others. It was the \\"first women's liberation group in New York City\\", and followed a radical feminist ideology that declared that \\"the personal is political\\" and \\"sisterhood is powerful\\"‚Äîformulations that arose from these consciousness-raising sessions. Within the year, women's liberation groups sprang up all over America. In 1968, the first American national gathering of women's liberation activists was held in Lake Villa, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. That same year, at the University of Washington, a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) organizer reflected on a meeting about white college men working with poor white men, and \\"noted that sometimes after analyzing societal ills, the men shared leisure time by 'balling a chick together.' He pointed out that such activities did much to enhance the political consciousness of poor white youth. A woman in the audience asked, 'And what did it do for the consciousness of the chick?'\\" After the meeting, a handful of women formed Seattle's first women's liberation group. In June 1968, Notes from the First Year, containing essays, speeches and transcripts of consciousness-raising sessions was distributed by the NYRW. The mimeographed booklet, which covered topics on sex, including abortion and orgasm, became the \\"most circulated source material on the New York women's liberation movement\\". Liberationists gained nationwide attention when they protested the Miss America beauty pageant on 7 September 1968. Though cameramen were prohibited from showing the protesters on television, newspapers headlined the story the following day. Because the pageant promoted beauty as the ideal for measuring women's worth, NYRW activists targeted the iconic event. Gathering items they considered to be objects of female oppression, such as bras, curlers, typing textbooks and copies of Ladies' Home Journal, among other items, the activists intended to set fire to the trash cans containing them. They were prohibited from doing so, but the myth of \\"bra-burning\\", led to liberationists being called \\"bra- burners\\". By 1969, NYRW had split into two factions‚Äîpoliticos and feminists, dividing over whether the oppressor of women was the political and economic system or whether it was patriarchy. Politicos, who were tired of being labeled as man-haters and who believed the capitalist system was the root of the problem, formed the Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H), which focused on achieving equality through leftist politics. Feminists, who remained committed to fighting sexism, formed the Redstockings. Poster for the Second Congress to Unite Women in 1970. The split did not slow activity down. W.I.T.C.H. protested the 1969 Miss America pageant and the Redstockings demonstrated at a hearing of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee considering a reform of abortion law. Angered that of the 15 experts called, 14 were men, the group held their own \\"public hearings\\" at the Washington Square Methodist Episcopal Church, allowing only women to \\"testify\\". By 1969, Women's Liberation was being featured in national magazines, like Life, Newsweek and Time. Vernita Gray, along with Michelle Brody, E. Kitch Child, Margaret E. Sloan and other women formed a group called the Women's Caucus of the Chicago Gay Liberation in 1969. Within a year, the multi-racial group, renamed the Chicago Lesbian Liberation (CLL), had established regular consciousness-raising events, known as \\"Monday Night Meetings\\". That same year, at a NOW meeting, Friedan, who feared feminists being associated with lesbians, referred to lesbian activists within the movement as the \\"lavender menace\\". Subsequently, Susan Brownmiller wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine describing the perceived threat to the movement. Lesbian activists responded by embracing the term, staging a protest at the Second Congress to Unite Women held in 1970, in which they revealed lavender t-shirts emblazoned with the term. Groups such as Columbia Women's Liberation, Daughters of Bilitis (which was a member of NOW) and RadicaLesbian pushed the drive for women to gain autonomy. 1969 was a pivotal year, in that it marked the beginning of mainstream incorporation of the liberationsists' focus on sexism. Gloria Steinem, a member of NOW, wrote an article for New York magazine, After Black Power, Women's Liberation, which was recognized with the Penney-Missouri Journalism Award as one of the first treatments of the women's movement. The Female Liberation Newsletter, was founded that same year by Julie Morse and Rosina Richter in Minnesota, with the intent of centralizing publications on the varying views of the movement in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metro area. By 1970, they had formed the Amazon Bookstore Cooperative, hoping to provide a physical space for women-centered dialogue. Influential texts written by liberationists and published in 1970 included The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm by Anne Koedt, The Political Economy of Women's Liberation by Margaret Benston, The Politics of Housework by Pat Mainardi, Sexual Politics by Kate Millett, and Sisterhood Is Powerful, An Anthology of Writings from the Women's Liberation Movement edited by Robin Morgan By early 1970, \\"Women's Lib\\" was featured as a cover story in Saturday Review written by Lucy Komisar, vice president of NOW. Atlantic Monthly and Mademoiselle devoted sections to the subject, some of which were written by feminists. Brownmiller, a member of New York Radical Feminists, wrote one of the articles in the February Mademoiselle issue and followed it up with an article in March, published in the New York Times Magazine. Network news followed print media in a rush to cover the \\"story of the year\\". CBS was the first major network to cover women's liberation when it aired coverage on 15 January 1970 of the D.C. Women's Liberation group's disruption of Senate hearings on birth control as a small item in their broadcast. Within a week, the women's protests became leading stories on both CBS and ABC. Early stories focused on behavior, rather than motivations, but NBC broke with the tradition when it aired a story on 23 January evaluating the underlying causes of concern were that the side-effects of the pill had not disclosed safety hazards. In March, CBS televised a series, with all-male correspondents, focused on radicals in the feminist movement, highlighting liberationists' tactics, rather than their underlying issues and portraying sexism as an unsubstantiated claim, which should be treated with skepticism. It was followed by a 6-part series broadcast by NBC anchored by four women, who presented an analysis of the issues with sexual discrimination portrayed as a reality in women's lives. These various treatments, served to undermine the radical message, as on the one hand they were portrayed as extremists and on the other, their sexual politics were assimilated into the mainstream liberal feminist view to present a unified vision for women's equality. In May Marlene Sanders, a member of NOW and one of the two women journalists working for ABC at the time, produced a documentary on the WLM for ABC. The timing of her report was calculated, to curtail the view of advocacy, as it had been approved in 1969, but it did not air until other media outlets had covered the topic, paving the way for an objective presentation. Sander's production attempted to add legitimacy to women's claims and shed a homogenized evaluation of the movement, \\"edging lesbians, women of color and the movement's most radical\\" elements out of the portrait. By redefining the movement, Sanders attempted to legitimize the need for social justice and present the demands of women as socially acceptable goals. The media coverage brought forth one of the problems of the WLM's loose organizational structure. Though thousands of organizations had formed in the 1960s and 1970s and there were chapters from coast to coast and throughout the Heartland, finding an organization to join was difficult for many. Unable to locate organizations in the phonebook, many felt that the movement was invisible, while still others embraced the ideals without actually joining formal institutions. There were few public spaces where unattended women could gather freely and urban settings with racially segregated spaces were ingrained in the culture. The problem of finding spaces to meet was compounded by the practice of denying women credit without men's consent, thus renting a visible meeting place for women to come together was complicated, forcing women to gather in unconventional settings. For example, the Chicago Lesbian Liberation solved their meeting problems by gathering on a \\"slow night\\" at a local bar known as King's Ransom, which welcomed their multi-racial composition. The proprietor was happy for the business and ladies night became a regular feature of the establishment. Women's centers began to be created all over the country as a place for women to meet outside the home. Most of them were run as collectives and spaces for consciousness-raising groups to meet in a non-competitive environment, where women could discuss the intersection of their personal lives, as well as politics and the economy. By 1972, the New York Radical Feminist had prepared a set of instructions for developing consciousness- raising groups. The analysis that went on in these sessions was not therapeutic, but instead an evaluation of how one's personal experience had been shaped by cultural norms. \\"Meetings were designed to turn the personal into the political\\", by making women aware that the personal experiences were not unique and had social constructs. It soon became apparent that small groups and loose cooperative organization was effective for building awareness, but to turn awareness into action more efficient structures were required. For example, the Crenshaw Women's Center in Los Angeles initially opened in 1970 with participants bringing their own pillows as seats. Eventually they collected second-hand furniture and developed a playground, assuming that their evening functions would be attended by women with children. Nine groups‚Äî‚ÄúHaymarket Liberation, the New Adult Community of Women, NOW, Socialist Women‚Äôs Organizing Project, the Union of Women‚Äôs International Liberation, the Venice-Santa Monica Women‚Äôs Liberation, Women‚Äôs Liberation Front‚ÄîUCLA, Women‚Äôs Liberation One and Working Women's Group‚Äù‚Äîcame together to offer services to some 1500 women. They offered abortion and contraceptive counseling; personal and vocational consultations; ran a suicide hotline; published a monthly newsletter, The Women‚Äôs Center News; maintained a library of feminist writings; provided lectures on legal rights; and taught courses on self-defense. Following their ideal that new structures were needed to build women-only spaces, the center was open to all women and their children. Within a year, NOW withdrew from the collective and established an almost identical center which was open only to their members and invited guests, which included men. By 1973, with the oil crisis and in reaction to 1960s radicalism, the US environment became more politically conservative. Combined with economic stagflation, radicalism lost favor. The fragile solidarity which had existed between various WLM groups began to fracture as the movement had developed no mechanism for political action other than direct confrontation. Though leftist, they did not adhere to any specific political alignment. The drive to create women-only spaces eliminated the need to confront sexism, as it allowed women to simply evade patriarchal organizations. Thus, rather than rendering gender irrelevant, for which liberationists argued, the cultural feminists, who evolved from them, created a counter-cultural movement to celebrate female difference. For example, Ms. began publication in 1972 co-opting the radicals' ideas of women's oppression and personal introspection, but blamed systemic causes for the issues, rather than men, and promoted self-improvement as a means to change women's lives, rather than politicization. Other groups embracing the idea of a utopian society composed solely of women were inspired by Jill Johnston's 1973 publication of Lesbian Nation. Johnston promoted the idea of a complete break from men and patriarchal institutions arguing for women's separatism. Believing that lesbianism was a political stance, she argued that regardless of who they slept with, whether they knew it or not, \\"all women were lesbians\\". In 1974, the Combahee River Collective was founded in Boston by twins Barbara and Beverly Smith, and former Black Panther activist Demita Frazier. Formed as a consciousness-raising group for lesbian feminists, it soon attracted members including Akasha Gloria Hull and Audre Lorde and began hosting retreats across the Northeastern United States. At the retreats intersectionality and overlapping identities were explored. The group continued meeting through 1980. By 1975, the Women's Liberation Movement had become simply the women's movement with liberals, who were pursuing reformist cultural feminism prevailing as the dominant group. Radical groups became marginalized and those that did not support the reformist climate splintered. However, in the short history of the WLM the movement exploded into a world- wide awareness of sexism and pushed the liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims.  Mexico  The first group affiliated with the ideas of the Women's Liberation Movement in Mexico was the Mujeres en Acci√≥n Solidaria (Women Acting in Solidarity, MAS) formed informally in Mexico City in 1970. The student movement and women's movement in the United States called into question not just needed educational reforms and social imbalances, but led to the realization that the political system and the structures of power were authoritarian and coercive and needed restructuring. Initially members of MAS met informally to question the roles of women in Mexican society. In April 1971, Magdalena Zapi√°n attempted to get a permit for a protest to be held at the Monument to the Mother, but was denied permission. Deciding to go ahead with the demonstration, MAS' first public action was to hold a protest on Mother's Day 1971 to question why motherhood was required for all women. At regular consciousness-raising sessions, the women met to discuss collective solutions to politicize their personal issues. That same year, Susan Sontag gave a presentation on feminism at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and so many women began wanting to participate that the group split into a north and south group. Their ideas spread in 1972 after publication of an article \\"La situaci√≥n de la mujer en M√©xico\\" (The Situation of Women in Mexico) was published in the magazine Punto Cr√≠tico and members began organizing events at universities in Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalapa, Morelia, San Luis Potos√≠, and Zacatecas, to discuss topics like child care centers, employment inequality, and reproductive rights. By 1973, the group was known throughout Mexico and hosted conferences at UNAM on abortion, sexuality, feminism and politics, as well as other topics. They also established a day care center, where meetings could be held, but increasingly the diverse points of view fractured MAS. In February 1974 a group of former MAS members split off and formed the Movimiento de Liberaci√≥n de la Mujer (MLM). The more radical members of the MAS did not join MLM, which incorporated class struggles with the struggle against sexism. To expand their membership, they wanted to embrace a wider definition of women's issues, but in effect, it had the opposite effect, as small interest groups formed in the new organization focusing on specific goals. The small interest groups worked collectively on issues like abortion and a plan to host a counter-conference during the World Conference on Women hosted by Mexico in 1975. The planning of the conference again the official UN conference created discord, and yet another split occurred, when a group of women split off to form the Colectivo La Revuelta (Collective Revolt) with the purpose of establishing a magazine to disseminate their ideas on the movement. The remaining members of the MLM continued to change and evolve, with groups splitting off such as the Movimiento Feminista Mexicano (Movement of Mexican Feminists, MFM), which in 1976 became the main members of the Coalici√≥n de Mujeres Feministas (Coalition of Feminist Women, CMF) The CMF focused mainly on voluntary maternity and violence against women and began to establish women's shelters. The Lucha Feminista (Feminist Struggle), which formed in 1978, reformed into the Frente Nacional por los Derechos y la Liberaci√≥n de las Mujeres (National Front for the Rights and the Liberation of Women, FNALIDM) in 1980, but it would dissolve a year after formation. That same year, the remaining MLM members formed the Colectivo de Acci√≥n Solidaria con Empleadas Dom√©sticas (Collective of Solidarity Action with Domestic Employees, CASED), to support women working as housekeepers. The Colectivo began publishing in 1977, a journal titled with the same name as their group to discuss the topics ranging from abortion to domestic obligation and including rape, sexuality, and prostitution. They were the most radical group which formed in Mexico, supporting separation from hierarchical structures, such as political parties and unions, and even other feminist groups. After publishing nine issues of Colectivo La Revuelta they started a newspaper with the name Unom√°sLlno (One plus one) in 1980, disseminating ideas about women's autonomy and living collectively with other women. In 1983, the group dissolved after their publication of Revuelta, reflexiones, testimonios y reportajes de Mujeres en M√©xico, 1975‚Äì1983 (Revolt, reflections, testimonies and stories of women in Mexico, 1975‚Äì1983), which gave the history of the group and summary of their objectives. By the early 1980s, the dominant feminists in Mexico had become the Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres (National Movement of Women, MNM), which had been founded in 1973 following the model of the United States' organization National Organization for Women. Like its US counterpart, the MNM were mainly middle-class women who were interested in reforming existing civil codes as a means to attain women's equality.

Women's liberation movements in Asia sought to redefine women's relationships to the family and the way that women expressed their sexuality. Women's liberation in Asia also dealt with particular challenges that made the liberation movement unique in different countries. Several countries were influenced by Western women's liberation movements, and in the case of China, ideas from the Cultural Revolution actually helped shape women's liberation in the West. Many Asian feminists had to straddle the line between being feminist or being \\"Asian.\\" In India, the caste system affected the way that women's liberation was approached in that gender and class could rarely be separated. Similarly in Israel, the plight of Palestinian women became important in molding the views of oppression. In Japan, the movement focused on sexuality rather than equality, in an attempt to gain recognition for women's autonomy and freedom to choose their own social roles. In Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, the liberationist movement was inspired by the worldwide movement for women's liberation and typically combined the fight against sexism with the struggle against colonialism and economic exploitation. Turkey came to the women's liberation movement later than other countries and was influenced by feminists from other countries and also by Islamic women. Turkey's struggle for women's liberation was centered around the issue of domestic violence.  China  Women's status in China during the twentieth century were tied closely to the Communist Revolution there and women's social status rose quickly. Initially, Chinese people believed that the Communist Revolution would end patriarchy. During the Cultural Revolution, women were celebrated through slogans like \\"Women Hold Up Half the Sky\\", while simultaneously they were discouraged from discussing gender issues, which was seen as \\"reactionary\\". In the 1970s, new institutions that benefited and were staffed by women were created, including cafeterias, kindergartens, and nurseries. Women's rights were managed by the state itself and there was no independent feminist movement during the period. However, many of the ideas created during the revolution went on to influence women's movements in the West, as radical feminists often were politically aligned on the left. In the polarized camps of the Cold War period, socialists turned from emulating Soviet communism in the wake of Stalinist purges and invasions. Western feminists after 1960 based key ideals on Maoist theory. Slogans such as \\"workers of the world unite\\" turned into \\"women of the world unite\\" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies \\"were inspired by similar techniques used in China\\".  India  Politics in India became radicalized in the late 1960s with numerous special interests groups forming to address corruption and the economic crisis brought about by destructive development. By the 1970s, drought in the Maharashtra state worsened conditions for many. Peaking in 1974 with encouragement from the Navnirman Movement, women in diverse classes began to engage in direct actions to challenge leadership. The idea of \\"women's liberation\\" became a \\"respectable topic\\" in India starting in the 1970s. Women began to see that legal protections were doing very little to change the reality of their lives. Rural women who lived in poverty began to see themselves as doubly disadvantaged: both economically and through their lower social status. Women in lower castes, such as Dalits, realized that they had to fight a class battle, as well as a battle against sexism. However, most women participating in the women's liberation movement in the 1970s were middle class or part of the upper caste, and were urban and educated. The Women's Federation of Kerala had grown to 100,000 members by 1970 and the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti (Democratic Women's Organization) held a state conference in April 1973 in West Bengal that drew 121,632 members from nearly every district. In 1974, organizations such as the Women's Anti-Price-Rise movement in Maharashtra, the Progressive Organization of Women (POW) of Hyderabad, and the Stree Mukti Sanghatana of Bombay formed, with women joining these leftist organizations in greater numbers. The first Democratic Women's Union conference was held in Tamil Nadu in December 1974. Student unrest and protest in Delhi sparked women to create their own human rights movement. Creating small groups in such places as Bangalore, Bombay, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madras, and Pune, the women's groups that formed in the period were averse to authoritarian structure and utilized a collective approach to decision-making. To challenge patriarchal power in personal and political spheres, they published and reproduced articles from other countries on Women's Liberation developments throughout the world. These loosely affiliated groups networked by circulating their publications in English, as well as regional languages. In Maharashtra, differing from other areas, meetings crossed caste and class divides, including students, laborers, blue collar workers, and white collar employees. Focusing on direct action, women in these groups protested official policy in various ways. For example, an influential street performance Om Swaha enacted by Stree Mukti Sanghatana members became iconic, galvanizing women to work against dowry deaths. Publication of the report Towards Equality in 1974 and 1975 as part of the United Nations survey on the Status of Women, revealed that women's participation in economic and political life had declined in post-Independent India. Unlike the western counterparts of the WLM, sexuality was a taboo topic in the era, though sexual violence became a focus. As such, lesbians were part of the movement, but sexual orientation was largely a private matter. In like manner, liberationists were characterized as disruptive to class-based activists who firmly believed that elimination of class differences would solve women's problems. In 1981, a group Sachetana was formed by activists in Calcutta with the goal of raising the consciousness of its members and other women. Their initial public protest was production of a play, Meye Dile Shajiye, written by member Malini Bhattacharya to protest selling brides. Unaffiliated with any political party, the group became a safe space for women of varying beliefs and political ties to openly express and discuss issues criticizing government policy and patriarchy. After The Emergency ended in 1977 in India, membership in the women's movement swelled, which predominantly consisted up to that time of the organized, disciplined, hierarchically-structured, party-affiliated groups or the leaderless, inclusive and chaotic, but autonomous groups loosely affiliated with the political left. The 1980 Forum Against Rape, held in Bombay at Cama Hall, marked a point where activists realized that multi-dimensional struggle focusing on both legal reform and raising awareness was necessary to combat systemic issues and different factions of feminists began to come together to solve issues. Israel The women's liberation movement in Israel was initiated in the early 1970s by two American immigrants at the University of Haifa, Marcia Freedman and Marylin Safir who had both been involved in feminist activities in the United States. Seminars they held in Haifa on how women suffered from a male-dominated society quickly inspired radical activities in Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem. The first liberationist group formed in 1972, spawning formation of consciousnesses-raising groups which used direct actions as a means of addressing women's issues. Women's studies emerged which highlighted the historical contributions of Israeli women. Freedman commented: \\"It really wasn't that difficult translating American feminism to Israel, with many of the same issues: the ability of women to work outside the house, abortion and issues of women controlling their bodies, although on Israel a very common response was that no women's movement was needed because Israeli women were already 'liberated'.\\" In 1972, the radical Nilahem movement (based on an acronym meaning Women for a Renewed Society) was formed, attracting interest throughout the country with stands against legal inequality and the suffering of the Palestinians. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, women found themselves excluded from the civilian administration, and both the military and war production efforts, being relegated to treating the wounded and supporting families. Though short in duration, the conflict brought into focus an awareness of the segregated roles of women and men in society. That same year, Freedman became the first openly feminist member of the Knesset, supporting the Civil Rights Movement. Jerusalem liberationists saw in the movement a way to fight against all oppression, including that of the poor and Palestinians. They led actions over poor wages, women working at night, and violence against women, as well as the right to control decisions over reproduction, as did activists in Haifa and Tel Aviv. Women's centers sprang up in metropolitan areas and by 1975, translated anthologies of US and European texts were appearing regularly in Israel. Various feminist publications appeared in the mid-1970s including Women as Human Beings by Shulamit Aloni. The feminist periodical Nogah began publication in 1980. In 1976, WLM members, led by Freeman, made headlines when they invaded a gynecological conference at the Hilton Tel Aviv to protest the position on abortion and were evicted by police. In 1977, the first women's shelter in Israel was founded in Haifa and the first rape crisis center was opened in Tel Aviv. That same year, a feminist publishing group The Second Sex was created and the lesbian liberationist group Aleph was founded, which led to the hosting of the first lesbian feminist conference the following year in Beersheba. By the end of the 1970s, the movement was fracturing in Israel and Aleph disbanded in 1980.  Japan  In Japan, the woman's liberation movement was known as ≈©man ribu, marking a new social and political direction for women in Japan. The name ≈©man ribu was itself a transliteration of English for \\"women's lib\\" and was meant to show \\"both the activists' solidarity with other women's liberation movements around the world and their specificity as a new Japanese women's movement\\". ≈™man ribu differed from Western women's liberation movements in that the goals were not about equal rights, but more focused on women's roles in Japan and \\"called for liberation from their sex,\\" which is known as sei no kaih≈ç. Women in the movement felt that dealing with sexual desire (seiyoku) was important and defining for the movement itself. Women such as Iwatsuki Sumie (also known as Asatori Sumie), wrote about menstruation taboos. She was also instrumental in creating women's spaces and was known for her advocacy of lesbian relationships. Activist, Yonezu Tomoko, started Thought Group SEX, which also explored disability and sexual liberation. Sexual liberation for Tomoko and Tanaka didn't mean \\"free sex\\" (furii sekkusu), but instead focused on a liberation of women's sexuality. In addition, the sense of autonomy over their own bodies meant that ≈©man ribu activist opposed efforts to restrict abortion and which emphasized creating a society where women \\"want to give birth\\". Women in Japan were considered \\"second-class citizens in society in general, within social movements [...], and in the family\\". Women involved in the movement were critical both of the literal modern family system and also of political movement that attempted to frame women's roles in politics in familial terminology. Within the movement, Japanese women also attempted to rehabilitate the word, onna, for woman, which had become a derogatory way to refer to women, but one that did not have familial connotations. Women involved in this women's liberation movement felt that they were different from people who were feminisuto (feminist) which they felt only applied to academics involved in women's studies. Many of the women involved in the ≈©man ribu movement were young and had been involved in New Left groups in the 1960s. Groups began to appear in cities throughout Japan in April 1970. These groups were not hierarchical and had no central leadership. Starting in late 1970, an organization called Gur≈©pu tatakau onna (Group of Fighting Women) began to work towards women's liberation throughout Japan. Women met to discuss Tanaka Mitsu's work, Liberation from the Toilet and also to advocate for a change in laws. Tanaka chose to use the word \\"toilet\\" because women could be described as \\"little more than repositories of men's bodily fluids,\\" or metaphorically speaking, as a convenience to men. Another ≈©man ribu publication was Onna erosu, which started in the 1970s and had a diverse perspective on social movements. The ≈©man ribu anthology for women in Japan came out in 1972 and was called Onna's Thought. The first public rally for ≈©man ribu took place on International Anti-War Day, October 21, 1970. In 1973, Tokyo activists created a public demonstration against Mother's Day. The activists had a banner that read \\"Mother's Day, what a laugh!\\" and critiqued the value of mothers, wives and children in Japanese society. Communes were started by ≈©man ribu activists in the early 1970s throughout Japan, including the best-known commune of Ribu Shinjuku Centre in Tokyo. Various groups, including the Gur≈©pu tatakau onna, Thought Group SEX, Tokyo Komu-unu, Alliance of Fighting Women and Scarlet Letter helped establish the Ribu Shinjuku Centre. The Centre was not only a central location for organizing and communicating, but also served as women's shelter. The women's liberation movement in Japan continued past the 1970s, but not with using the same terminology and methods.  Singapore  Nalla Tan called for a council of women to be formed to advocate for women's rights in Singapore in 1972. The women's liberation movement in Singapore was energized in 1975, during the observance of the International Women's Year. That same year the National Council of Women (NCW) was formed in order to coordinate the activities of women's groups in the country and to help end discrimination against women. In 1983, the \\"Great Marriage Debate\\" began a conversation about eugenics, motherhood and the need for feminism in Singapore. Young people were encouraged to marry and have children by the government which was worried about the falling fertility rate in the country. The National University of Singapore Society held a forum in November 1984 that responded to the issues raised in the \\"Great Marriage Debate.\\" Zaibun Siraj and Vivienne Wee organized the forum called \\"Women's Choices, Women's Lives\\" and brought speakers such as Kanwaljit Soin, Hedwig Anuar and Margaret Thomas. The first feminist organization in Singapore, the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) was created in 1985 in response to the issues raised at the \\"Women's Choices, Women's Lives\\" forum. Members of AWARE were concerned about not being associated with negative stereotypes of feminism and balanced their feminism with \\"Asian values.\\" AWARE publicly focused on issues they called \\"women's rights\\" and \\"gender inequality\\". They did not explicitly or publicly blame women's roles in society on men, but rather as \\"product of history and tradition,\\" and that gender inequality affected both men and women in society. Privately and in unpublished reports, members thought of themselves as feminists.  South Korea  The first women's organizations in South Korea arose from worker's struggles under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee and were focused on poor working conditions and exploitation of women in the family under a system which required women to work to pay for their brothers' educations and support their families. In 1975, Yi Hyo-jae (), a professor at Ewha Womans University (EWU) began to criticize existing women's organizations in Korea as being too focused on legal change for women rather than liberation of women from societal ideas of what women should be. As western literature, like The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir and then The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan and Sexual Politics by Kate Millett were translated into Korean in 1973, followed by Woman's Estate by Juliet Mitchell, Korean intellectuals had become aware of the ideas of radical feminists. By 1977, a women's studies department was established at EWU. The development of the course utilized students' input and also requested material relating to the courses from 150 universities in the United States with women's studies classes. The women's studies department was criticized for relying too heavily on Western ideas, but there was a \\"strong interest\\" from students in the classes. The feminist movement, known as Minjung feminism, which developed in South Korea in the 1980s merged worker concerns with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship.  Taiwan  One of Taiwan's feminists, Hsiu-lien Annette Lu, was inspired by the women's liberation movement in the United States. In 1974, Lu published New Feminism which advocated for women to come together to end \\"the dominant patriarchal paradigm\\". Yang Mei-hui translated Margaret Mead's Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies (1935), which introduced the concept of gender role formation to Chinese-speaking women in Taiwan. This translation was also an influence on Lu, whose followers established the Awakening Foundation and began publishing the Awakening Magazine in 1982. Lu also wove Confucian philosophy into her feminist discourse to promote a cultural basis for addressing double standards for men and women. By utilizing maxims such as \\"Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire\\", she developed the theme of mutual respect for women.  Turkey  Student movements focusing on anti-imperialism began to appear in Turkey in the 1960s and leftist movements began to form in the 1970s. However, women's concerns were not dealt with by many of these groups and women were actively discouraged from discussing them. The women's liberation movement really began to flourish in the 1980s. Women who had been involved in these leftist groups started to talk about feminism and created consciousness- raising groups where they shared their own experiences as women with one another. Many of the early feminists in Turkey were educated, often professional, middle class and who had links to feminists in other countries. Because of women's very marginalized position in Turkey, the movement went unnoticed until \\"a substantial, organized feminist movement grew out of these small groups.\\" One of the significant groups was called Kadin √áevresi (Women's Circle). Kadin √áevresi translated and published books by significant feminist writers. Translations were also published on the feminist page of Somut, a weekly magazine, which began in 1983. As the books become translated, women would form book clubs and hold book discussions. In addition to translating, women were also bringing new words into the Turkish language to describe issues they dealt with, such as \\"male domination\\" (erkek egemenliƒüi), creating a feminist language that could help the movement grow. Women in the movement criticized the Kemalist model of modernity in Turkey and focused on how women are forced to play roles within this modern world. Muslim women were also involved in the movement, encouraging women of the Islam faith to speak out about their experiences. Secular feminists and Islamic women in Turkey had an influence on each other during this time. Some, like described herself as \\"a feminist with faith.\\" Secular feminists who were involved in the journal, Pazartesi, were supportive of Muslim women \\"who wanted to redefine their identities as women.\\" By the mid 1980s, women were holding WLM protests in Istanbul and Ankara. These feminists were united around the issue of domestic violence instead of abortion, since abortion was already legal in Turkey. Activists kept track of court proceedings that \\"gave explicit legitimacy to domestic violence\\" and protested either by sending letters to the judge or by setting up rallies. There was \\"enthusiastic turnout\\" for a protest organized in May 1987 against domestic violence and the government's lack of action towards the issue. A following event, a \\"1 day festival in October of the same year\\" helped boost women's confidence in their actions. The women's movement of the 1980s allowed feminist policies and groups to continue to grow in the 1990s and 2000s. The Women's Library and Information Center and the Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation were both founded in 1990. Purple Roof worked hard to maintain autonomous control and rejected attempts of the state to \\"subvert the feminist meaning of their endeavor.\\" One of the major contributors and founders of Purple Roof is Canan Arin.

The branches in Bremerhaven were labeled as Dresdner Bank. The base of customers and staff was added to the Commerzbank when the Commerzbank AG bought the Dresdner Bank. Since 2010, according to a writ by the acquiring company, the brand Dresdner Bank is only used in Dresden and the brand Bremer Bank is not used at all anymore. However, a trademark protection exists until November 30, 2019. The painting of founder Heinrich Maier was removed and is owned by the Commerzbank. In its place (see photo) is now a door leading to the lower level of the Manufactum. The name Bremer Bank is now used for the landmarked building at the Domshof. The Commerzbank AG was represented there with a branch until mid-2015. Due to reasons of landmark tradition the copper lettering 'Bremer Bank' remained on the gable of the building. Above the entrance used to be green luminous advertising reading 'Bremer Bank' which was replaced according to landmark requirements by a copper sign now reading 'Commerzbank' including the logo also in brown copper. The color of the copper writings through weathering in time will turn into a green basic copper(II)-carbonate color which will match the building's roof. History of the bank Nameplate 2010‚Äì2011 Portrait of the company founder In 1856 the Bremer Bank was founded by tradesmen and ship- owners and with a significant contribution of Hermann Henrich Meier (founder of Norddeutscher Lloyd). Forerunner of the Bremer Bank is the Bremer Discontokasse, founded in 1817. Until the foundation of the German Reich in 1871 the Bremer Bank was a private bank for Bremen. In 1895 negotiations for a merger with Eugen Gutmann from the Dresdner Bank were also led by Hermann Henrich Meier. The merger was a profitable business for the Bremer tradesmen; the name Bremer Bank was still used in Bremen. After the Commerzbank acquired the Dresdner Bank in 2008 the name Bremer Bank was kept at first. In August 2010 the Commerzbank installed a sign in the entrance area reading: Bremer Bank ‚Äì Branch of the Commerzbank AG. The sign was replaced in the beginning of 2012 by a company sign which only had the Commerzbank's name on it. This final rebranding was due to a decision made by the Commerzbank in March 2010. History of the building Domshof 10‚Äì12 with neoclassicistic house fa√ßade From 1902 until 1904 the bank building was built according to plans by architects Albert Dunkel and Dietrich T√∂lken in the Neo-Renaissance style in the Domshof (Cathedral Court). Until 1902 the St.Petri-Orphanage was located in that spot. In 1979 the building was significantly expanded by a north-east extension according to plans by Dietrich and Herrmann. A building located next to the old bank building was enclosed by the extension, only a white front in the style of classicism remained. The old bank building was mostly preserved especially the entrance area towards the Domshof. From 1980 until 1990 the building was also home of the Bremen Exchange. The old bank building on the corner Domshof / Sandstra√üe is listed as landmark since 1994 and still represents the tradition of the Bremer Bank ‚Äì now as branch of the Commerzbank. The entrances in other parts of the building ensemble are designed as official access to offices and other institutions. For example, the Bremer branch of the Barmer GEK is located behind the white, classical front. In 2016 a branch of manufactum was opened in the counter hall. Today the \\"Markthalle Acht\\" (Market hall 8) is located in the atrium of the building ensemble which was roofed, because of the address Domshof 8.

She showed promise as a juvenile when she won twice and finished second in the Prix Thomas Bryon. She reached her peak in the following spring when she took the Prix Vanteaux and was then sent to England where she recorded her biggest victory in the 1000 Guineas. She ran unplaced when favourite for the Epsom Oaks and was retired from racing. She had little success as a broodmare. Background Camaree was a grey mare bred and owned by Jean Ternynck. As a young horse her grey colouring was not apparent and during her racing career she was officially described as brown. She was trained in France by Alexandre Lieux. She was sired by Maurepas, a top-class racehorse whose wins included the Grand Prix de Paris, Prix du Cadran and Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. As a breeding stallion, the best of his other foals included Burgos who won the (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud) and Grand Prix d'Automne. Her dam, Couleur was a winner over hurdles and later produced Camaree's full-sister Marmelade, the grand-dam of Sea-Bird. Racing career =1949: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old Camaree produced her best effort when finishing second to the colt Fort Napoleon in the Prix Thomas Bryon over 1500 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in November. She had previously won two minor races but ended the season ranked about eighteen pounds behind the top juveniles in France. =1950: three-year-old season= Camaree began her second season in the Prix Vanteaux at Longchamp Racecourse in April and won despite her jockey, Rae Johnstone, being hampered by a slipping saddle. At Johnstone's urging, the filly was then sent to England to contest the 137th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 28 April. The July Stakes winner Diableretta started favourite ahead of Stella Polaris (Cornwallis Stakes) with Camaree next in the betting on 10/1. With Johnstone in the saddle she came home three lengths clear of Catchit and Tambara, who dead-heated for second place. Her winning time of 1:37.0 was a new record for the race. As Rae Johnstone chose to ride another French filly, Asmena, Gordon Richards took the ride when Camaree was stepped up distance and started favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 25 May. Camaree took the lead three furlongs out but faded in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind Asmena. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Camaree an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Camaree became a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least two foals, neither of whom made any significant impact: *Mea Culpa, a grey filly, foaled in 1954, sired by Bozzetto *Peticama, grey filly, 1958, by Petition Pedigree *Camaree was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Rabelais, meaning this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

Indian media reported the casualty figures variously from 35 to 70. Pakistan rejected India's claim, and instead claimed that Indian troops did not cross the Line of Control and had only skirmished with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and nine wounded. Pakistan rejected India's reports of any other casualties. Pakistani sources reported that at least eight Indian soldiers were killed in the exchange, and one was captured. India confirmed that one of its soldiers was in Pakistani custody, but denied that it was linked to the incident or that any of its soldiers had been killed. Pakistan said India was hiding its casualties. Media outlets noted that the details regarding the attack were still unclear. Earlier that month, four militants had attacked the Indian army at Uri on 18 September in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, and killed 19 soldiers. India's announcement of the raid on 29 September marked the first time that the government had publicly acknowledged its forces crossing the Line of Control, amidst skepticism and disputing accounts. Background On 18 September 2016, a fedayeen attack was made by four armed militants on an army base near the town of Uri. Nineteen Indian Army soldiers were killed. India accused Jaish-e- Muhammad, a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation.. Having come after similar fidayeen attacks in Gurdaspur and Pathankot, the Uri attack gave rise to high degree of concern in India. The following day, the Indian army said that it had displayed considerable restraint in the wake of the attacks, but it reserved the right to respond \\"at the time and place of our own choosing\\". The Guardian said that Indian patience had run out due to Pakistan's inaction in curbing the activities of terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. On 21 September, India summoned the Pakistan High Commission Abdul Bassit and gave a protest letter detailing the involvement of a terrorist group based in Pakistan. Pakistan later said that India had provided no evidence that the Uri attack was launched from Pakistan. Pakistan's defence minister suggested that India had carried out the Uri attack to deflect attention from the popular protests in Jammu and Kashmir. The Hindustan Times reported that the minister's comments made up an \\"inflection point\\", after which India decided to respond militarily. Indian officials said that the cross-border infiltration across the Line of Control had surged since the unrest began in Kashmir. The persons crossing the border showed evidence of military training. According to a government source close to Home Minister Rajnath Singh, a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security was held on 24 September, at which \\"broad details of targeting terrorists\\" were discussed. Surgical strikes On 29 September, eleven days after the Uri attack, the Indian Army conducted surgical strikes against suspected militants in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), said that it had received \\"very credible and specific information\\" about \\"terrorist teams\\" who were preparing to \\"carry out infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other states\\". The Indian action was meant to pre-empt their infiltration. India presented its operation as preemptive self-defence against terrorism, striking against terrorist infrastructure along with \\"those who are trying to support them.\\" Columnist Ankit Panda thought the latter included Pakistani soldiers or the elements of Pakistani state. On 30 September, Indian minister for information and broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that there had been no aerial strikes and that the operation had been conducted \\"on the ground\\". Ranbir Singh said that his Pakistani counterpart had been informed. The Pakistani military said the DGMO communications discussed only the cross-border firing, which was part of the existing rules of engagement. Pakistan denied that such surgical strikes occurred. The Inter-Services Public Relations said that there had been only \\"cross border firing\\". Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the \\"unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces\\", and said that Pakistani military was capable of thwarting any attacks by India. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said that the UN Observer Group in Pakistani Kashmir did not directly observe any \\"firing across the Line of Control\\" relating to the incident.UN chief Ban Ki-moon offers to mediate between India, Pakistan , Hindustan Times, 1 October 2016. India snubs UN for saying didn't ‚Äòobserve‚Äô LoC firing , The Indian Express, 2 October 2016. The Indian envoy at UN Syed Akbaruddin dismissed this statement, saying \\"facts on the ground do not change whether somebody acknowledges or not.\\" Analyst Sandeep Singh, writing in The Diplomat, said that the operation is better characterised as a cross-border raid because \\"surgical strikes\\" involve striking deep into the enemy territory and typically using air power. Shaun Snow writing in The Diplomat questioned whether India had the capacity to conduct a \\"surgical strike\\", noting that Pakistan has a very comprehensive and modern air defence system. A cross border raid, if it occurred 1 km into Pakistani administered territory, is routine on either side with over a dozen incidents having occurred both ways, and does not qualify as a \\"surgical strike\\" which by definition requires deep striking and air power as Sandeep Singh, cited earlier, attests to. =Indian version= Indian officials said the strike targeted areas close to the Line of Control (LoC), where it believes militants congregate for their final briefings before sneaking across the LoC. An Indian security source said the operation began with Indian forces firing artillery across the frontier to provide cover for three to four teams of 70‚Äì80 soldiers from the 4th and 9th battalions of the Parachute Regiment (Special Forces) to cross the LoC at several separate points shortly after midnight IST on 29 September (18:30 hours UTC, 28 Sep). Teams from 4 Para crossed the LoC in the Nowgam sector of Kupwara district, while teams from 9 Para simultaneously crossed the LoC in Poonch district. By 2 a.m. IST, according to army sources, the special forces teams had travelled 1‚Äì3 km on foot, and had begun destroying terrorist bases with hand-held grenades and 84 mm rocket launchers. The teams then swiftly returned to the Indian side of the Line of Control, suffering only one injury, a soldier wounded after tripping a land mine. The Indian Army said the strike was a pre-emptive attack on militant bases, claiming that it had received intelligence that the militants were planning \\"terrorist strikes\\" against India. India said that, in destroying \\"terrorist infrastructure\\" it also attacked \\"those who are trying to support them\\", indicating it attacked Pakistani soldiers too. India later briefed opposition parties and foreign envoys, but did not disclose operational details. Some Indian media claimed that the Indian army infiltrated 2‚Äì3 km into Pakistani territory, but the Indian Army did not say whether its troops crossed the border or had simply fired across it. India said that none of its soldiers were killed though two soldiers were injured. It also stated that one of its soldiers, from 37 Rashtriya Rifles, was captured by Pakistan after he \\"inadvertently crossed over to the Pakistan side\\", though not during the \\"surgical strikes.\\" Initially, Indian media claimed that the army used helicopters during the skirmish. On 30 September, an Indian minister denied that there were any helicopters used, stating the operation was conducted \\"on the ground\\". =Pakistani version= Pakistan rejected claims that any surgical strikes occurred. Pakistan's Foreign Office said the claim as \\"baseless\\" and said India was \\"deliberately\\" escalating conflict. The Pakistan Army claimed that there had only been \\"cross border firing\\". Pakistan warned that it would respond militarily should any surgical strike actually occur. The two soldiers killed were identified as Naik Imtiaz and Havildar Jumma Khan. Pakistani sources claimed that hours after the strike, up to fourteen Indian soldiers were killed in retaliatory firing across the LOC and one was captured, Chandu Babulal Chavan. It further stated that India was concealing its casualty figures from the cross-border firing. It was later reported that the captured India soldier had wandered across the border in a different sector of the Line of control, where no conflict was reported. He was later returned to India. Defence analysts in Pakistan said it was not possible for Indian forces to breach the heavily armed and fenced LoC border undetected, perform operations at multiple sites over several hours, and return without casualties and military resistance. According to one source, the Indian narrative matched a \\"fantastic movie script\\" created for public consumption. Ejaz Awan dismissed Indian claims of paratrooper involvement, stating: \\"For pulling out these troops, you need helicopters on the ground.\\"  Media reports  Lieutenant general Ranbir Singh, the Indian Army DGMO, only stated during his press conference on 29 September that the number of casualties inflicted had been \\"significant.\\" Most accounts in the Indian media varied as to the number of militants killed, with most publications giving estimates of 35 to 50 killed. On 9 October, the Indian army said that it had intercepted radio messages of the Pakistan army and claimed that \\"around 20\\" Lashkar-e-Taiba militants had been killed, including at least 10 during the surgical strikes and nine killed at Balnoi (opposite of Poonch). On 1 October, the Pakistani army gave international media outlets including BBC, CNN, VOA, Reuters, AP, AFP and Newsweek a tour of the sites which India claimed to have hit on 29 September. The Pakistan army claimed that had there been a \\"surgical strike\\", there would have been more damage. The journalists confirmed that the \\"area seemed intact\\", but added that they only saw what the Pakistani army showed them. The Economist remarked that they were taken to the border \\"under strict supervision, naturally\\". On 5 October, The Indian Express stated it had managed to conduct covert interviews with eyewitnesses living across the Line of Control (LoC). The Express claimed that eyewitnesses corroborated the Indian account by describing fire engagements with militants and the destruction of some makeshift buildings that housed militants; but that there was little damage to infrastructure. However, the Express said that according to eyewitness accounts, and classified documents, the number of militants killed was lower than the 38‚Äì50 number reported by Indian officials; there were reports that \\"five, perhaps six\\" bodies had been trucked out the morning after the raids from Dudhnial (4 km from the LoC), while three or four militants were killed near Khairati Bagh. The Express said that the militants, many of whom belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba, were caught by surprise. Other accounts reported \\"fire and explosions\\" from the east bank of the Neelum River in Athmuqam. On 5 October, India's CNN-News18 claimed that it conducted a \\"sting operation\\" where their news correspondent posing as an Inspector General of Police made a phone call to a Superintendent of Police (SP) Ghulam Akbar in Mirpur. In an audio conversation aired on the news channel, a voice claiming to be Akbar reveals details about the military action of 29 September including the places of strikes and the number of Pakistani casualties, quoted as 12 people including 5 military personnel. The voice says that the bodies were said to have been carried away in coffins and buried in the villages, and that an unknown number of militants (\\"jihadis\\") had also died.Surgical strikes: Five Pakistani soldiers among 12 killed, Mirpur SP tells CNN-News18 , Firstpost India, 5 October 2016.Surgical Strikes: Full Text of Conversation Which Exposes Pakistan's Lies , CNN News18, 5 October 2016. On 6 October, Pakistan's Foreign Office said that the voice in the audio conversation did not belong to Ghulam Akbar, and that Akbar had denied the alleged phone conversation. The ministry called the story a fabrication, and hoped that CNN International would take action against its Indian affiliate. On 23 October, a BBC News article by M. Ilyas Khan quoted unnamed police officials and locals stating the Indians appeared to have crossed the LoC, in some cases by more than a kilometer, to attack Pakistani border posts. The article said the Indian Army had conducted a ground assault in the Pooch sector, destroying a Pakistani post and killing a soldier; setup their guns on a ridge in Leepa valley, hitting three posts and killing four Pakistani soldiers; and advanced in the Dudhnial sector injuring a Pakistani soldier, but were beaten back after their movements were detected. The report also took statements from villagers at Madarpur (Poonch District) and Leepa Valley (Bagh District) and Dudhnial (Neelam District) who confided that Indian troops directed heavy fire at several Pakistani border posts. The BBC News could not verify if any militants were hit. Villagers in Dudhnial said that they saw one or two damaged structures close to a Pakistani border post. The villagers in Leepa Valley said that, following the attack, there was an increased influx of militants to the valley. The Economist wrote that by interviewing eyewitnesses and anonymous officials, journalists in both Pakistan and India have pieced together an account of what happened: Aftermath Indian intelligence sources claimed that, immediately after the raid, the Pakistan military had buried the corpses of the slain terrorists to erase any evidence and to maintain Pakistan's version of a \\"skirmish\\" along the Line of Control. However, Pakistan rejected that any such casualties occurred, questioning: \\"Where did all the dead bodies go?\\" Pakistan's military also pointed to the lack of damage or losses in the site, and welcomed UN observers and journalists to conduct an independent inquiry. Increased firing along the Line of Control was reported the following day. A senior Indian Home Ministry official subsequently claimed that in the wake of the raid, at least 12 training camps belonging to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen and Jaish-e- Mohammad had been swiftly moved from their locations at Pir Chanasi, Aksha Maskar and Tabuk near Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Based on satellite images, inputs from foreign intelligence agencies and unnamed \\"sources in Pakistan,\\" according to the official, the training camps had been relocated \\"near crowded towns deep inside Pakistan,\\" in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, to \\"minimise casualties to their assets.\\" According to the Indian official, the camps had housed around 500 militants, 300 of whom belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba alone. An Indian newspaper, Indian Express, alleged that they had covertly interviewed five people across the LoC. One of the five eyewitness reported that on 30 September, a day after the surgical strikes, several members of Lashkar-e-Taiba had met for Friday prayers at a Lashkar-affiliated mosque in Chalhana. \\"The Lashkar men gathered there were blaming the Pak Army for failing to defend the border\\", he said, \\"and [were] saying they would soon give India an answer it would never forget.\\" Several days after the raids, a leading Indian security official who had been closely involved in their planning said that Pakistan's continued denial that any surgical strikes took place was a \\"stance that suits us.\\" He further stated ‚Äì \\"The surprise element in such an operation is key to its success and there will be no predictable repetition. If provoked yet again, we will amend our operational tactics.\\" Both Indian Defence Minister Parrikar and National Security Advisor Doval were shown original, unedited footage from the military raids on 1 October. After viewing it, Parrikar informed Prime Minister Modi that he was satisfied with what he had seen, and that there was no need to publicly release any footage. In response to calls from members of opposition parties to release the footage, a senior government official stated, \\"The Opposition should understand the difference between a covert and overt strike. And it is not incumbent on the Indian Army to release video footage every time they do their duty.\\" On 5 October, two senior ministers in the Indian government said the Indian Army had submitted the footage to the government, but that the government, with the concurrence of the army, felt there was no need to release it to the public. After India's operation, India and Pakistan increased their exchanges of small arms and mortar fire across the Line of Control, resulting in frequent reports of Indian and Pakistani casualties. In 2017 the Indian government conferred gallantry awards to nineteen soldiers who had participated in the strikes. Among those who received awards include Major Rohit Suri, the leader of the operation who was honored with the Kirti Chakra, the second highest peacetime gallantry award. On 27 June 2018, an alleged partial footage of the strikes was released by the Indian government to the Indian media as proof to the strike. Pakistan's foreign office spokesman, however, rejected the alleged video and termed Indian claims as farcical. Reactions =India= Across India, the military raid was widely praised. The opposition initially raised doubts that the surgical strike actually took place, but later the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi lauded Prime Minister Modi commenting- \\"for the first time in his tenure, he has taken an action that is worthy of the status of a Prime Minister.\\" Following the military raid, in anticipation of cross-border shelling from Pakistan, Indian authorities evacuated 10,000 residents of villages located within ten kilometres of the border, in the states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Military surveillance was also stepped up along the Line of Control. =Pakistan= Pakistan rejected the claim of a surgical strike, stating that Indian troops had only engaged in firing upon Pakistani soldiers, killing two Pakistani soldiers and wounding nine. The spokesperson for the Pakistani Army asked: \\"Where is the damage?‚Äù, referring to the lack of any evidence of surgical strikes. ISPR spokesman Asim Bajwa termed the \\"surgical strike\\" claim an \\"illusion being deliberately generated by India to create false effects\\" and a \\"fabrication of the truth\\". Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif convened an all-parties conference and an emergency cabinet meeting. He stated Pakistan would take any steps necessary to safeguard its territorial integrity. \\"We will defend our homeland against any aggression. The entire nation is standing shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces.\\" Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif termed the Indian claim a \\"drama\\", adding that \\"If Pakistan were to conduct a surgical strike, it would become a chapter in Indian textbooks.\\" International Reactions =Countries= * ‚Äì Shaida Abdali, Afghanistan's ambassador to India, expressed support for the military raids by India, stating the actions in Pakistan-administered Kashmir had been conducted in \\"self-defence.\\" He added his hopes that \\"no one will allow safe havens for terrorists to be used against neighbours.\\" * ‚Äì Iqbal Chowdhury, the advisor to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, stated India had the \\"legal, internationally accepted right\\" to take action. \\"Bangladesh always believes that any aggression or attack on the sovereignty of the independence and legal right of a country is not acceptable and Bangladesh always feels that any country must honour and respect the sovereignty of a third country.\\" * ‚Äì Bhutan have backed India on cross-border stand. * ‚Äì Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Sheung stated that China, \\"as a shared neighbour and friend to both India and Pakistan,\\" was concerned about the \\"continuous confrontation and tensions\\" between the two nations. He said China called on \\"all relevant parties to exercise restraint and refrain from actions that would escalate tension,\\" and expressed hopes that both parties would address their differences through dialogue. * ‚Äì Martin Ney, the German ambassador to India, expressed Germany's support for the military raids and that it stood beside India in its counter-terrorism efforts. Stating that under international law, every nation was obliged to ensure that terrorism did not emanate from its territory, he said there existed a clear international law \\"that any state has the right to defend its territory from any form of global terrorism.\\" * ‚Äì The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed concern over \\"aggravation\\" of the situation along the Line of Control, and stated it expected Pakistan to take \\"effective\\" steps in stopping the activities of terrorist groups operating from its territory. \\"We are calling on the parties not to allow any escalation of tension and to settle the existing problems by political and diplomatic means through negotiations. We stand for decisive struggle against terrorism in all its manifestations.\\" Russian Ambassador to India Alexander Kadakin subsequently said that the Russian Federation was the only country to directly state that terrorists came from Pakistan; he called upon Pakistan to end cross-border terrorism and welcomed India's surgical strikes. \\"[The] greatest human rights violations take place when terrorists attack military installations and attack peaceful civilians in India. We welcome the surgical strike. Every country has [the] right to defend itself.\\" * ‚Äì White House spokesman Josh Earnest encouraged continued talks between India and Pakistan, to avoid further escalating the situation. =International Organisations= * ‚Äì Vice President of the European Parliament Czarnecki said that it was necessary for India to maintain pressure on Pakistan for eliminating cross-border terrorism. He praised Indian army and Indian government for its professional approach to the situation. * ‚Äì Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, stated the Secretary-General was following the developments \\"with great concern,\\" adding that the United Nations \\"calls on the governments of India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and encourages them to continue the effort to resolve their differences peacefully and through dialogue.\\" In a press conference on 3 October, Vitaly Churkin, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations and the President of the UN Security Council for that month, refused to comment on the India-Pakistan situation, stating the Security Council had not been discussing the matter. De-escalation Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs was confirmed to be attending the 7th Heart of Asia Conference, the first visit by a high-level Pakistani official since December 2015. This was seen as a move to help de-escalate tensions by the Indian media. The situation de-escalated after 23 November, with no incident being reported except the injury of a BSF personnel in Pakistani firing on 2 December. Pakistan's High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit also offered hosting bilateral dialogue at Heart of Asia Conference. But the conference ended without any peace talks and the delegates returned to their countries. Media said that there was a short conversation between Aziz and Indian leaders as soon as he landed. But it was denied this was not billed a de-escalation of border tensions.

Features Typical features of access journalism include: * absence of demanding accountability towards the questioned respondent * avoiding controversial topics so as to maintain access to the respondent * pre-approved questions, no gotcha questions, softball questions * sometimes even respondent's control over how the interview will be edited and which parts will be aired Access journalism, in some cases, is similar to infomercials, or advertising disguised as news. The venture of doing the interview can be symbiotic‚Äìbeneficial for both the journalist and the celebrity, since it can synergically bring more attention to both of them, and further notability, influence, media exposure, current relevance, etc. for both of them. Access journalism has been contrasted with accountability journalism. A similar contrast is between lapdog journalism and watchdog journalism. Criticism Access journalism has its critics (e.g. Cenk Uygur, Jimmy Dore, Kyle Kulinski) who point out that trying to be friends with important figures for access betrays the original and fundamental role of journalism. Uygur criticised several times the reluctancy of the mainstream media reporters in press conferences to fact-check and challenge a government official on their bias or straight-up propaganda for the reprisal of not being invited to the press conference again. The practice was mentioned tangentially in the Outfoxed documentary, which pointed out that the most recognized journalists of the flagship programs of the mainstream media, over the time, themselves become celebrities and occasionally mingle with other celebrities, including political ones, on cocktail parties, fancy dinners, banquets, etc. and create the kind of relationship that they, as journalists, should not have. One of the most recent examples of access journalism, in conjunction of gaining views and attention, was the attempt of the media to get access and media time with Donald Trump, during the 2016 presidential cycle. His media attractiveness resulted in free media time, worth (according to estimates) between 2https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps- mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html and 5https://www.thestreet.com/story/13896916/1/donald-trump-rode-5-billion-in- free-media-to-the-white-house.html billion USD. At the height of the run, some media outlets were calling Trump daily without specific issues to ask him about, just to get his voice on air and eyeballs of curious Americans in the process.

The Theodore Roosevelts captain, Brett Crozier, urged to have most of the sailors immediately removed from the ship, quarantined ashore, and tested for the virus to prevent the spread of the disease. Baker, his superior officer, disagreed, feeling such an action was impractical and too drastic. On March 29, after four days of his pleas being rebuffed by Baker and other superiors, Crozier sent a four-page memorandum to ten Navy officers including Baker and his two immediate superiors, Admiral John C.

Among the first Latvian artists to apply different auxiliary materials, she is best known for her extraordinary assemblages and abstract paintings. Throughout her career, she became a remarkable figure in Latvian art releasing it from the official rules of socialist realism which encouraged other artists to remain true to their beliefs during the Soviet period.  Biography  Lidija Auza was born on February 24, 1914 in Vitebsk, Belarus, in a peasant family of Latvians. She lost her parents early and was brought up by her stepfather in Riga, Latvia, where she was able to get an education at Riga French Lyc√©e. In early life, Lidija lived and worked mostly in Riga during the 1930s and 1940s. She graduated from Riga Pedagogical Institute and enrolled at Art Academy of Latvia in 1936, but with the onset of World War II, she postponed her studies and completed a degree of Fine Art only in 1949. From 1934‚Äì1943 she worked as a teacher at Riga Elementary School Nr.16 but later started to work as artist-decorator at Riga Medical Workers House (1946‚Äì1947), Institute of History of Latvia (1947‚Äì1950) and government buildings in Talsi. Since 1949, having graduated from Art Academy of Latvia, Lidija exhibited regularly at galleries and museums in Soviet Latvia. While her works had been successfully featured at exhibitions, in 1951 she was refused membership in the Latvian Artists' Union, accused of formalism in her works, and did not receive the privilege to use a studio. After the Khrushchev \\"thaw\\" brought important changes to political and cultural life in the USSR, although the socialist realism was still being cultivated, in 1956 Lidija was finally accepted into the ranks of union. From 1973‚Äì1980 Lidija took an active part in creative and cultural events in Talsi which has earned her the award of honorary Citizen of Talsi (1983). Her works have been presented at the exhibitions in Soviet Union and Latvia, and featured in collections of the Latvian National Museum of Art, Artists' Union of Latvia and private owners. Lidija Auza is the mother of two children, son Leonƒ´ds Mauri≈Ü≈° and daughter Baiba Mauri≈Üa, both painters. She died on December 13, 1989 in Riga at the age of 75, buried at the Riga Forest Cemetery.  Artistic career  =Ballet dancers= At the beginning of career and during her studies in Art Academy of Latvia, Lidija painted ballet-devoted works and psychological portraits (Velta Vilci≈Üa, Haralds Ritenbergs, Inta Karule, Mudƒ´te ≈†neidere). Works of this period are allocated with strong construction of compositions and thin colour. The great value in her works is betrayed to movement and gesture. During the final year of studies, she completed her graduating thesis piece, a scene from the ballet entitled Ballet Rehearsal, under the guidance of JƒÅnis Liepi≈Ü≈°, professor and the head of figurative painting studio. The painting has been displayed in Art Academy of Latvia and served as an example for other students for more than ten years. Having graduated with a degree of Fine Art, Lidija continued the dance theme in her work, and her style, characterized by its warm, subdued colours and the mild transitions of light and shadow, developed to the vivid painted abstract compositions with rich textural effects. =1960s and onward= In the middle of 1960s Lidija has sharply changed the style, addressing mainly to decoratively abstract compositions where small value is given to a plot, and the special attention is given to an expression, a rhythm and mood. As one of the first in the Latvian painting starts to apply not only paints but also different auxiliary materials - metal shavings, labels from a paper and a fabric, glass splinters (Decor, ca. 1970). In 1980s her work became easier and has got certain symbolical value. Before the independence movements started to rise in Latvia, she was concerned with the impact of systems and avoided catering to what was considered acceptable. Instead of producing socialist realism art, Lidija created radical tectonic- oriented pieces with folk art motifs and symbols to highlight national identity (Nation‚Äôs Free Spirit 1969, Short, Short Midsummer's Eve 1968). The Latvian art historian and critic Laimonis Mieri≈Ü≈° described her as ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù and ‚Äúgifted innovator‚Äù. =Monumental painting= The artist turned to murals and landscape painting as well, and created large-sized panels that are included in the list of Latvian art heritage. When the canvas became too small for her imagination, she worked as a muralist and portrait painter, dealing with themes of ecology, ancient history and topical problems of her time. The decorative landscapes she did during the ‚ÄúTalsi period‚Äù (1973‚Äì1980) feature the characteristic architectural motifs of the city Talsi (triptych Kurland, The City of Nine Hills, Encounter, Unite). From 1980‚Äì1982, she also did an order to draw sketches for the stained-glass windows at LiepƒÅja fishermen kolkhoz Boƒº≈°eviks (The Bolshevik) house in BƒÅrta.

There were more foreign-born Jews present in Leipzig than the majority of cities in Germany, and this made conditions for Leipzig Jews worse. Harsh conditions towards Jews in Leipzig began earlier than Kristallnacht because of this, and made Kristallnacht especially harmful. Kristallnacht destroyed much of the Jewish life in Leipzig. The events of Kristallnacht in Leipzig were described by United States Consul David H. Buffum, who reported what he saw to the State Department and published his 16-page report, Anti-semitic Onslaught in Germany as Seen from Leipzig, shortly after the events. A 5-page excerpt from his report was published in the Nuremberg Trial documents and was subsequently quoted at length in several English-language source collections on German history. Destruction by fire In the early morning of November 9, 1938, Nazi party Kreisleiter, Ernst Wettengel, commanded the Leipzig SA to instigate a pogrom ordered by the Nazi national party. By 3:51 am that day, SA members dressed in regular clothes, had put the Gemeinde synagogue in the town of Gottschedstra√üe in flames. Still in the morning, the Ez-Chaim synagogue, the Bamberger and Hertz department store, the Ury‚Äôs department store, the H√∂here Israelitische Schule, and the chapel at the Jewish cemetery were all defiled in flames. The Leipzig fire department listed the causes of all the fires to be ‚Äúunknown,‚Äù and only attempted to prevent the spreading of the fires in order to protect Gentile property. The Nazi officials ordered the fire department and police to only aim to protect Gentile property. In the afternoon, two Jewish cafes were attacked, but no one was injured because they were tipped off by circulating rumors. At night, the buildings on the land of the new Jewish cemetery in Delitzscher Landstra√üe were set on fire. Three synagogues in Leipzig suffered damage from incendiary bombs. All of the sacred artifacts and records were desecrated, and in many cases thrown onto the street to be burned. The living quarters were completely destroyed, and the large and small cemetery halls were burnt down. Black flames were one of the biggest attractions for baffled crowds in Leipzig. While the loss of goods was substantial, it was second to the destruction of property. Many Jews were forced to clean up the damage from the burnt buildings. Destruction by hand Shattered storefront of a Jewish-owned shop in Berlin destroyed during Kristallnacht Partakers in the pogrom smashed Jewish shop windows by the hundreds. Jewish homes and synagogues were also torn apart in search of valuables, and so Nazis could achieve the joy of ruining a Jew's home. Raiders of synagogues took files and scrolls, silver shields from the Torah, and some bells and coins. Families reported the loss of jewelry, silver, decorations, furniture, and cash from their homes. In one of the Jewish sections of Leipzig, and eighteen-year-old boy was thrown from his own three-story apartment. He landed on a street filled with burning furniture from his and his neighbors‚Äô apartments, and both of his legs broke. A Jewish family's dog was also thrown from a four-story apartment, and broke its spine. The Nazi officers disinterred ten corpses at the Jewish cemetery in Delitzscher, and left them unburied while arresting the gravediggers and cemetery attendants. During the first night of Kristallnacht, 193 businesses, 34 private homes, 3 synagogues, 4 smaller temples, the cemetery chapel, and the Ariowitsch old age home were destroyed. The damage to Leipzig cost several million marks.  Arrests  Nazi propaganda and anti-Semitic acts became much more frequent and severe during and after Kristallnacht. Arrests were common. They began early in the morning of the ninth. Arrests were carried out by officers of the Gestapo and/or the Kriminalpolizei. These groups collaborated with the SA and SS, but mobs of gentiles in Leipzig also dragged Jewish men out of their homes and brought them to the police. Rioters would split into small groups and march through the neighborhoods, banging on the doors of Jewish homes shouting ‚ÄúJuden heraus!‚Äù (‚ÄúGet out here, Jews!‚Äù), and ‚ÄúRaus ihr Judenschwein!‚Äù (‚ÄúOut, you Jewish pigs!‚Äù). They broke down many doors of homes and dragged Jews out if they did not act promptly to the commands. They then proceeded to violate the Jews on the streets. They did this very early in the morning or late at night during both days of Kristallnacht. Three Aryan professors of the University of Jena were arrested and brought to concentration camps because they voiced disapproval of the occurring events. German Jews between the ages of sixteen and sixty, as well as Jewish men without citizenship were taken to concentration camps in Germany. There were several thousands of these arrests. = Torture = Of the first people arrested that day, some were taken to the court prison and some to the local homeless shelter. A work lieutenant tortured those at the homeless shelter. They were forced to stand the entire time and set up a long-distance obstacle course in the hall. Even the elderly men that had been arrested were forced to partake, but those evidently unable to complete the course had a different task. They were ordered to form a circle and sing a lullaby that went like: ‚ÄúDo you know how many stars there are?‚Äù. Men were verbally abused and called pimps, fraudsters, talmud, crooks, and others. The SS men would try to make fun and have a conversation with prisoners, and every silent reply of a prisoner led to being hit by a rifle butt. Almost all prisoners bled. Others arrested in Leipzig during Kristallnacht would be told to go to a curved tunnel in the prison and line up, and then ordered by SS men to perform military exercises; all while being beaten, verbally abused, and having razors thrown behind them. In the Zoo district of Leipzig, people were chased to the Parthe and forced to go into the water. The prisoners were tightly packed together in the river. Some of these prisoners were permitted to go back to their homes later in the day, but most were transferred to a concentration camp. Another group of prisoners were forced to walk to a concentration camp on a path for fourteen hours without food. Once they got to the camp, conditions were miserable. The water was impotable. A makeshift river was established for water, but only the dying or the mentally ill would go to drink from it. The SS set up an outhouse at the concentration camps, but it was simply a pit with a couple of bars placed over it. Several drowned in the outhouses by either falling in or being pushed in by SS members. In the Buchenwald Concentration Camp there were 12,000 people from different areas of Germany who had been arrested on the first day of Kristallnacht. One thousand of these prisoners were from Leipzig. In a group reported to have 250 prisoners, twenty-six died during Kristallnacht, seventeen due to the cold. Women and children Throughout Kristallnacht in Leipzig, Women and children were not targeted for arrest like military-aged Jewish men, but they were affected. SS guards and Nazi storm troopers raided Jewish homes and brutalized the women and children present. In the town of Eutritzsch in Leipzig, women were the first to be taken from their homes on the first day of Kristallnacht. Later they were reunited with the men in a public square. They were stripped of their belongings, but released later that day. Many women and children were deported from Leipzig. Many of the younger children died from the cold and poor nutrition while being transferred.  Aftermath  = Post November 10th, 1938 = The effects of Kristallnacht persisted after November 10. Arrests of German Jewish men between ages sixteen and sixty, and Jewish men without citizenship continued. Many Jews left Leipzig completely. Those that stayed faced many challenges. With their homes destroyed, many were forced to find a new place to live. Men continued to be arrested, and in order to avoid being targeted, families split and lived separately with gentile friends and neighbors. Many Jews were fired from their jobs at ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù institutions, and with so many Jewish institutions destroyed it became extremely difficult to find work. This problem was especially acute for Jewish men, who were unable to find the same opportunities still available to women. For example, women could still find work as teachers in Jewish schools, social workers, nurses, and clerical workers for Jewish communities and ghettos. = Revival = Although in the post World War Two era, a modest Jewish cultural revival in Leipzig occurred. Still, the Jewish community never regained its pre-Kristallnacht vitality.  Bibliography  * Kaplan, Marion A. Between dignity and despair: Jewish life in Nazi Germany.

He was consul in AD 17 with Gaius Caelius Rufus as his colleague.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 459 Flaccus was the brother of Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, consul the year before in 16. Either he or his brother may have married Vistilia, mother of Milonia Caesonia, the wife of Caligula, and had two sons: Publius Pomponius Secundus and Quintus Pomponius Secundus.  Life  The earliest mention of Flaccus was by the poet Ovid, who addressed one of the earliest poems from Epistulae ex Ponto to Flaccus;Ovid, Ex Ponto, I.10 Ronald Syme dates the first three books of Ex Ponto \\"before the autumn of 13\\".Syme, History in Ovid (Oxford: Clarendon Press: 1978), p. 77 More information about Flaccus comes from a poem Ovid addressed to his brother Graecinus: Syme uses the evidence of that poem to argue that Flaccus was legatus or assistant from either the year 11 or 12 to Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus, then governor of Moesia.Syme, History in Ovid, p. 83 He is mentioned several times by Tacitus in his Annales. The first time is in the year 16, after the successful prosecution of Marcus Scribonius Libo for treason and his subsequent suicide. Flaccus made the motion in the Senate that days of public thanksgiving be appointed to commemorate the quashing of this act of treason.Tacitus, Annales, II.27-38 The following year Flaccus was appointed governor of the imperial province of Moesia. There, according to Syme, he demonstrated his diplomatic craft.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 425 Flaccus outwitted Rhescuporis, king of Thrace, who had slain his nephew Cotys III and seized his lands. Flaccus convinced Rhescuporis to leave his kingdom and enter Roman territory; there he was surrounded by what was first described to him as an \\"honor guard\\", but was soon revealed a detail of soldiers to hold him prisoner. Rhescuporis was escorted to Rome where he was tried for the murder of his nephew.Tacitus, Annales, II.64-67See also His tenure as governor of Syria, from the year 32 to 33, although brief, is the best documented portion of his life. According to Suetonius, Flaccus and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus joined the emperor Tiberius in a combined feast and drinking bout that lasted two entire days and the intervening night. At the conclusion of this debauchery, Tiberius appointed Flaccus governor of Syria and Piso Urban Prefect.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"Tiberius\\", 42. While governor, Flaccus provided sanctuary to Herod Agrippa, who had been driven out of the Tetrarchy by king Herod Antipas.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 18.150-154 Tacitus notes in passing his death in office the following year.Tacitus, Annales, VI.27  References  Category:1st-century Romans Category:1st-century Roman governors of Syria Category:Roman governors of Moesia Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Syria Category:Pomponii Category:33 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Lucius Pomponius Flaccus"},{"id":"57296565","text":"Khat is a flowering plant chewed for its stimulant effects.

Origins  The project started in 2010 to research fungi that could potentially help create a type of compound known as a natural product. This is done by obtaining the fungi from a soil sample collected from a volunteer who mailed it to the program. The program was created at the University of Oklahoma and works with biomedical science researchers as a part of the Natural Products Discovery Group. The goal of this program is to create a natural product with ingredients obtained from various fungi, found in soil, that will help fight against cancer. This program gained traction on social media in 2015 when a member of the site known as Reddit made a post about the program. Since then, users have been sending in their soil samples and sharing updates about the project through comments on the post.  Discoveries  The program has had one major discovery from the samples that have been submitted. The program found the natural product maximiscin. The sample came from a fungus named Tolypocladium. The sample has shown useful anticancer properties, and has inhibited cancer cell growth in mice.  Methods  The samples are obtained through a method commonly referred to as crowdsourcing in citizen science, where citizens gather resources and submit them to researchers. After receiving the soil collecting kit, the volunteer can then go into their backyard and pick a spot where they would like to get their sample from. Once the sample has been collected it is sent back to the soil collecting team who grows the fungi by putting the sample on a petri dish and feeding it food such as grounded worms, tea, and simple sugars. The fungi are later identified by their internal transcribed spacer or ITS found in the DNA that identifies the species and distinguishes it from others. Separated from the soil, the fungus continues to grow in test tubes by feeding on cheerios. Later, the fungus samples are tested against cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria. The whole process varies from a few days to even years. The desired natural product of the fungi is then extracted through purification using chemical techniques when the sample is moved to grow in a larger bag of cheerios. Once extracted it takes up to weeks or even months to find the chemical structure after which the study and findings are shared with collaborators, typically pharmacologists who specialize in cancer and infectious disease biology. Public involvement This program has gained users through multiple crowd-sourcing projects. The first attempt to crowd-source was through program members' family and friends. The program then gained national recognition from a \\"You Should Know\\" thread on the Reddit news sharing and discussion website. The program created a website hub for users to show interest in the project and to allow participants to obtain the collection kits. In December 2017, The program was featured in the Science Museum Oklahoma‚Äôs smART Space gallery for visitors to see the program's fungi on display and to show how fungi shape the Earth.

During his studies at Kibbutz Kabri High School, he set up a vocal quintet with fellow scholars. This ensemble went on to become the international ensemble known as \\"Profeti della Quinta\\" which now performs regularly throughout Europe, North America, Israel and further abroad. Rotem studied for a bachelor's degree in harpsichord at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and studied for advanced degrees basso continuo, improvisation and composition at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. He went on to complete his PhD in 2016 through Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in a joint programme with the University of W√ºrzburg, Germany. Rotem specializes in the musical style of the 16th and 17th centuries in Italy, and his ensemble, Profeti Della Quinta, is known worldwide for their performances of the music of Jewish composer Salomone Rossi, who was the first composer to use the Western-Christian musical language to compose Hebrew prayers and psalms (\\"The Songs of Solomon\\", 1623). Compositions Rotem has composed major works in the Italian style of the turn of the 17th-century based on biblical texts in the original Hebrew. Hebrew works were composed at that time by the Mantuan composer, Salomone Rossi Whilst countless compositions have been written based on biblical texts, Rotem's works are unique, both in his use of the late Renaissance style in the 21st century and in his adherence to the original Hebrew texts. * Rappresentatione di Giuseppe e i suoi Fratelli (Joseph and his Brethren) : Musical drama in three acts, composed in the spirit of the early operas. 2014. * Quia Amore Langueo : Song of Songs and Dark Biblical Love Tales. 2015.

Founded in 1995 by Tim O'Leary and Suzy Rizza, the company has grown from a single taproom to two taprooms in Missoula and a major production facility in Bonner, Montana on the Blackfoot River. In 2017, the company, in collaboration with Top Hat Entertainment, opened the KettleHouse Amphitheater near the new facility in Bonner.  History  Founders Tim O'Leary and Suzy Rizza discovered a growing community of craft brewers while living in Colorado in the 1990s and began brewing beer. After experimenting with homebrewing in their kitchen, they quickly moved their production to a brew-on-premises in Boulder. The couple moved to Montana and opened the first brew on premise in Missoula, with the state only requiring them to obtain a brewer's license. They established KettleHouse with the idea of beer and recyclable packaging as a guiding point for success. In 2006, KettleHouse became the first brewer in Montana to can its beer, fulfilling O'Leary's original goal of an environmentally friendly brewhouse. After occupying its original Myrtle Street location since opening, the canning required a move to a bigger facility to accommodate higher production numbers and larger equipment. Moving into a Northside location in 2009, the company did not think they would reach the production limit as laid out by the state of Montana.Ryan Newhouse, Montana Beer: A Guide to Breweries in Big Sky Country (Charleston, SC: American Palate, 2013), 63-67; Tim O'Leary. Oral Interview, April 4, 2018, by Meaghan Fernandes and Joseph Serido at KettleHouse Brewing Co. in Missoula, MT. Digital recording and transcription in the possession of Kyle J. Volk, University of Montana Despite two facilities working at full production, the company could not meet demand for their product and still remain under the 10,000 barrel cap. Starting in 2012, the company began to move out of markets in response to the demand in the Missoula area. O'Leary stated he was unwilling to \\"close down our taprooms and risk alienating ourselves from our core market\\", but that he hoped he could help \\"remove this 10K (barrel) hurdle\\", (something he had helped put in place in 1999) and increase the barrel limit. In 2017, the increase in barrel production limits O'Leary sought was passed in the Montana State Legislature. Production limits were raised to 60,000 barrels with a 2,000 barrel limit on taproom sales for breweries in Montana. In 2017, KettleHouse expanded outside beer production and its related products for the first time. In January 2017, the company opened a brand new canning and brewing facility in Bonner to prepare for the increase in barrels allowed as passed in the legislature. The new facility has the ability to brew 30,000 barrels per year, surpassing the production of both other taprooms. In the summer of 2017, KettleHouse opened the new KettleHouse Amphitheater in Bonner, Montana with inaugural act Lyle Lovett.  Products  KettleHouse has four mainstay beers available at its tap houses: Cold Smoke Scotch Ale, Double Haul IPA, Eddy Out Pale Ale and Fresh Bongwater Hemp Ale. Cold Smoke is KettleHouse's best seller and most awarded beer with four Golds at the North American Beer Awards as well as a popular ice cream version served in Missoula. Bongwater Hemp Ale attracted some controversy with its initial offering that culminated with an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. = Seasonals = In addition to its mainstays, the brewery offers a rotating selection of seasonals that differ based on the tap house and the time of year. Some of the more popular offerings are the Garden City Pale Ale and the various cask aged beers released throughout the year. Included at the tap houses are nitro-served beers, with Cold Smoke on nitro being a popular choice by consumers as it creates a smoother drink. Te Bonner Lager, a beer designed to be consumed at the KettleHouse Amphitheater was brewed to celebrate the venue's opening in 2017.

Popular in the 1930s and 1940s, it was an all-female orchestra in an era when most orchestra members were male. The group was also known as Phil Spitalny's All-Girl Orchestra.  Background  Inspired by witnessing a 1932 concert that featured \\"an electrifying performance by a brilliant female violinist,\\" Spitalny disbanded a male orchestra that he directed and began a tour of the United States, seeking female musicians for a new orchestra. His expenditure of $40,000 and auditions of 1,500 women produced a 32-member orchestra that debuted at the Capitol Theatre in New York City in 1934. The musicians usually ranged in age from 17 to 30, and most were single. A retrospective newspaper article about Spitalny published in 1958 noted \\"ridicule from all sides in show business and ... sour comments from his musician brothers that he was 'crazy'\\" as he created \\"the first all-girl band of any consequence ever organized.\\" Style The orchestra's specialty was music familiar to its audiences. In an article in the January 7, 1945, issue of Radio Life magazine, Spitaly described the group's style as \\"between symphonic and popular.\\" Arrangements, which were done by three members of the orchestra, usually featured piano, harp, and strings more than saxophones, trombones, and trumpets. Sherrie Tucker, in her book, Swing Shift: ‚ÄúAll-Girl‚Äù Bands of the 1940s, described \\"the orchestra's trademark effects of quivering strings, dramatic brass fanfares, galloping rhythms, and sweeping flurries from the harp.\\" Spitalny stressed class and decorum in the group's performances, in contrast to the \\"blatant sex appeal\\" of a contemporary all- female orchestra, Ina Ray Hutton's Melodears. He required the musicians to dress in formal evening gowns. The dresses, usually white, were uniform in design. The purchase of one lot of dresses in the mid-1940s cost $18,000. Personnel Evelyn Kaye plays with the Hour of Charm Orchestra in this screen capture from Army-Navy Screen Magazine Number 22.Nearly all of the musicians were single, and their contracts required them to give six months' notice if they planned to marry. Most of them were graduates of conservatories. Versatility was a key element of the orchestra. Some members sang solos, and all of them formed a vocal chorus. Each was proficient on at least two instruments; one, Jan Baker, could play 12. Evelyn Kaye, whom Spitalny met at the Juilliard School in New York, became the orchestra's first violinist and concertmistress. She joined him on the audition tour, seeking other members for the group. She was billed as \\"Evelyn and Her Magic Violin\\", with the violin being a Bergonzi. made in 1756 and given to her as an award from the Arts Club of America upon her graduation from Juilliard. The core orchestra that played in the studio for radio broadcasts consisted of 45 women. On tour, however, Kaye noted in a 1978 interview, \\"we added 25 players because we needed a bigger sound for the auditoriums and halls where we played.\\". Spitalny had a policy of billing the orchestra's members only by first name.  Organization  The orchestra was set up as a stock company, with each member owning a number of shares of stock based on her role. At year's end, profits were distributed based on each person's shares in addition to their regular salaries. A five-woman committee governed the group, making decisions on matters such as whether or not member were allowed to go out on dates. Film Spitalny and the musicians from The Hour of Charm appeared in two feature films. In When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1942), the group portrayed substitute musicians who filled in for male musicians who were abroad during World War II. In Here Come the Co-Eds (1945), the women portrayed residents of a girls' dormitory who played and sang music. The group also made short subjects, mostly for Universal Pictures  \\"more short subject films than any other all-girl band except for Ina Ray Hutton and her Melodears.\\" The productions included Moments of Charm (1939), Musical Charmers (1936), Big City Fantasy (1934) and Phil Spitalny and His Musical Queens (1934). Critical reception Paul Denis, in a review published in the October 25, 1941, issue of the trade publication Billboard, noted that the orchestra's performance at the Strand Theatre in New York, was \\"strong on fine melodious singing and instrumental music, but weak on comedy and surprise.\\" Recognition In 1937, the Radio Committee of the Women's National Exposition of Arts and Industries recognized the orchestra with its third annual Achievement Award for the most distinguished work of women in radio.

Previously, he held various posts in the royal chancellery. Early life Benedict was born into an unidentified family from Zala County, whose nobility was confirmed shortly after the First Mongol invasion of Hungary. According to 19th-century clerical historian Antal P√≥r, he belonged to the gens N√°dasd (ancestor of the wealthy N√°dasdy family), while M√≥r Wertner identified him as a member of the L≈ërinte kindred, but other historians do not share either viewpoints. Benedict had three brothers, Dedalus, isp√°n of Zala County (1273‚Äì1274), Beke and Stephen. When Atyusz V Atyusz was charged disloyalty by Ladislaus IV of Hungary, the king donated the Szentmikl√≥s Castle and its surrounding villages to them in 1276, not long before Benedict's death. In contemporary records, his name is referred to with the honorary title of \\"magister\\", demonstrating his education and skills in science. He first appears in sources in 1255‚Äì56, when participated in determination of a border along the Drava on behalf of B√©la IV of Hungary. Soon, he joined the court of the king's eldest son Duke Stephen, where he was mentioned as a notary in 1257. Stephen attained the age of majority in that year and became Duke of Transylvania. Two years later, he was appointed Duke of Styria, which he governed with the help of local lords and bureaucrats, who originated from near the Austrian border. Benedict elevated into the position of vice- chancellor in the ducal court by 1259, while he was also titled provost of Friesach and archdeacon of Valk√≥, which belonged to the Diocese of Veszpr√©m. After B√©la IV was forced to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II, Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260. Benedict escorted his lord to the eastern province and retained his position of vice-chancellor. He was styled as provost of Szeben (today Sibiu, Romania) from 1261 to 1262, then as provost of Arad since 1262. He held the latter clerical dignity until the end of 1273. Stephen's relationship with B√©la IV deteriorated by the early 1260s. After a brief civil war between them, Benedict of Szeben mediated the reconciliation between father and son at Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) in the autumn of 1262, alongside other prelates. Initially, Benedict remained loyal to the duke, but just before the emerging civil war between father and son, he escaped from Transylvania and defected to the royal court not long before October 1264. He was replaced as vice-chancellor by Lodomer still in that year. It is possible that Benedict actively participated in the conflict with his troops, as two of his familiares, brothers Simon and Synke were granted a land in Zala County in April 1265 by B√©la for \\"their loyalty in various military campaigns\\". When Stephen V succeeded his father as King of Hungary in May 1270, B√©la's numerous partisans were forgiven, including Benedict, who took the role of royal vice- chancellor immediately after the death of the old monarch. He held the dignity until the sudden death of Stephen V in August 1272. In August 1271, after Ottokar II invaded the lands north of the Danube and destroyed the archives of the Diocese of Nyitra (Nitra), Benedict, alongside vice-isp√°n Michael and Sixtus of Esztergom, were mandated by Stephen V to determine the borders of the diocese, cataloging its existing estates and churches. Archbishop- elect After the death of Archbishop Philip T√ºrje in December 1272, the episcopal see of Esztergom became vacant. During the rule of the minor Ladislaus IV, the kingdom fell into constant anarchy, when many groupings of barons fought against each other for supreme power. The archbishopric of Esztergom and its revenues became an important subject of this confrontation. Nicholas K√°n, Dowager Queen Elizabeth's protege arbitrarily and forcibly took the dignity in February 1273, but his election with doubtful legality was rejected by both Pope Gregory X and the majority of the canons. After Elizabeth and her league was expelled from power and lost political influence for a while around June 1273, the see was declared vacant again. Succeeding K√°n, Benedict was appointed vice-chancellor again, held the dignity until his death. He was also styled as provost of Buda since the end of 1273, replacing chronicler √Åkos. The cathedral chapter of Esztergom elected Benedict as archbishop on 22 February 1274. Subsequently, he sent his two emissaries Roman, archdeacon of Bars and Fulcus, a canon of Esztergom to the Holy See for confirmation of his election, but they had to turn back at Senj due to recent piracy on the upper Adriatic coast. Despite the lack of official confirmation, Benedict maintained a good and regular relationship with the Roman Curia. In accordance with the resolution of the Second Council of Lyon, which drew up plans for a crusade to recover the Holy Land, Pope Gregory X sent his vice- dean Gerardus de Mutina in 1274 to Hungary to collect tithe imposed for 6 years on all the benefices of the Hungarian Catholic Church. Benedict also supported the efforts of Ladislaus IV in order to restore strong royal power. The king was trying to reward his support; for instance, he donated the St. Nicholas chapel and its right of patronage in Bana to the Dominican Order, upon the request of archbishop-elect Benedict and canon Reynold. He also confirmed the privileges of the Buda Chapter, donated by his great-grandfather Andrew II of Hungary. Ladislaus IV granted the land of Gyarmat (today ≈Ωitavce, Slovakia), belonged to Szolgagy≈ër Castle, to the Esztergom cathedral chapter in 1275. A contemporary record described him a \\"colorless person\\". His election was temporarily right choice from the chapter in order to avoid the penetration of the secular conflicts within the church. Benedict transferred the Tihany Abbey under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Veszpr√©m on 3 September 1276. Benedict was last mentioned by sources on 18 November 1276. He died shortly thereafter, as his rival Nicholas K√°n was already referred as archbishop-elect in December 1276.

It was published on May 1, 2018, and is the third book in The Trials of Apollo series, the second spin-off of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The story follows the Greek god Apollo, turned into a human teenager named Lester Papadopoulos, in his quest to free five oracles of Ancient Greece from Triumvirate Holdings, a group of three evil Roman Emperors, in order to regain his immortality. Joined by the demigod Meg McCaffrey and the satyr Grover Underwood, Apollo goes to the Labyrinth in search of the Oracle of Erythraea, the next Oracle to be rescued. The novel was published in hardcover, audiobook, ebook, and large-print editions and the cover was illustrated by John Rocco. The Burning Maze received positive reviews from critics, who praised Apollo's narration and the book's humor. It was a bestseller on Amazon. Plot summary The story begins a few days after the events of the previous book, \\"The Dark Prophecy\\". Apollo, in the body of the 16-year old Lester Papadopoulos, ventures through the Labyrinth with 12-year old Meg McCaffrey and the satyr, Grover Underwood in a bid to find the third emperor of the Triumvirate Holdings. As the trio face a continuous attack of strigae, Grover unleashes the cry of Pan, the lost god of the wild, and brings them to Aeithales, which is later revealed to be Meg's former home. Mellie, the wife of the satyr Hedge, asks Apollo and Grover to go and check up on Hedge, who is in an army surplus store nearby. The duo goes there, only to face Naevius Sutorius Macro. They escape, when seemingly, a centaur, comes and contacts somebody. They head back, and Apollo reveals that the \\"centaur\\" is a horse, Incitatus, and the third emperor is Caligula, the most feared Roman emperor, famous for his murderous reign and insanity. Mellie reveals that Jason Grace and Piper McLean had gone into the Labyrinth. Apollo and Meg pick up Piper, who is moving away to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and Jason, who is at school and occasionally has fights with monsters disguised as teachers. Jason secretly tells Apollo that he had met with Herophile, the sibyl inside the Labyrinth, who told him that when the next time the duo comes, one of them will die. Fearing Piper's demise, Jason keeps this to himself. Apollo, Meg, Jason, and Piper sneak into Caligula's ship to steal his shoes, which are a priority according to the Dark Prophecy. All of them are captured by Pandai, loyal servants to Caligula. They escape with the help of Crest, a friendly Pandai and Apollo find the shoes, but then they are captured by Incitatus and taken to Caligula. Jason engages Caligula in a one-sided battle, only to be stabbed twice by Caligula. Jason calls his venti (air spirit, usually a horse) before dying, helping the others escape. Upon reaching Piper's home in Malibu, Piper blames Apollo as the reason for Jason's death. Apollo, Meg, Grover, and Crest enter the Labyrinth and are faced with riddles that seemingly lead to Herophile's prison. However, Apollo gives the wrong answer to one of them. Facing certain death, Apollo decides to find the cause of the flames that have been engulfing the southern lands for a long time and discovers the dead but still burning body of Helios, the lost former god of the sun being used by Medea, a witch whom they had a short run-in with, and Apollo promises to exact revenge for Helios. The trio reaches the Herophile and is faced with another prophecy. They get out with the help of Meliai, ash-tree spirits Meg had earlier planted. They kill Medea, Incitatus but lose Crest's life. Apollo and Meg entrust Aiethales's safety with the Melai and continue their journeys. Piper moves away, Jason's body is given to Apollo for burial at Camp Jupiter, and Leo takes Hedge, Mellie, and Piper to Oklahoma. =Characters= * Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos ‚Äì one of the Twelve Olympians, Apollo was cast down from Olympus and turned into a human named Lester by Zeus after the war against Gaea in The Blood of Olympus.

In 2016, at 68 years old, Burger became the oldest person to win a World Championship in either the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) or the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), setting a new record. She broke the existing record set by Ike Rude of 59 years old in steer roping set back in 1953. She also broke the record set by Mary Walker in 2012 at 53 years old in the WPRA. Also In 2016, she became the third WPRA barrel racer to wear the No. 1 back number at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). She set a new record for season earnings, and she set a new record by becoming the oldest WPRA qualifier to the NFR at 68 years. Her horses, Mo and Fred, whom she used to win her titles with, she trained in barrel racing herself. In 2017, she was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame. Early life Mary Burger was born Mary Lichtle in Decatur, Indiana, on August 18, 1948. Burger is one of three girls and three boys born to the Lichtles. She grew up riding horses. As a young girl, she was diagnosed with Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes disease, a rare childhood hip disorder. Her condition made walking difficult. As a result, her father bought her a pony, and she took to riding agilely. She attended every 4-H horse show near her home that she could. After she outgrew 4-H shows, she competed in American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) shows. She mastered this sport, winning 9 championships. During this time, she met and married her husband Kerry Burger, an esteemed farrier. They have two sons, Todd and Joey. In the 1980s, the family moved to Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. Through training horses, she encountered some winners on the futurity horse race circuit. Soon, she was competing in amateur rodeos. She first started competing professionally in barrel racing in 1984.  Career  As an amateur, Burger competed in the AQHA in barrel racing, and won World Champion in 1974, 1985, 1986, 1995, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005. She also competed in pole bending, and won one World Champion title in 1974. Burger turned professional by joining the WPRA in 1985. Barrel racing is sanctioned by the WPRA, while other rodeo events are sanctioned by the PRCA. The barrel racing events, however, take place at PRCA rodeos, alongside events such as bull riding and tie-down roping. All of the championship rodeo events are held together except steer roping which has its own finals event, the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR), at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) held at the Thomas & Mack Center, in Las Vegas, Nevada in December. When Burger and her daughter-in-law, P.J., qualified together for the NFR in 2009, they became the first mother-in-law and daughter-in-law duo to achieve that feat. = Seasons 1985 through 2005 = Although Burger turned professional in 1985, she only went to rodeos in her local area until the early 2000s. In fact, in 1987, she won her regional RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo (RNCFR) and became the Prairie Circuit Finals champion. Burger went to quite a few rodeos in 2004 and 2005, but only regional ones. It was in the year 2006 when she expanded out to rodeos throughout the country. She won her first world champion title that year. She achieved this after placing in 9 of 10 rounds at the NFR. = Season 2006 = Her third qualification to the NFR brought Burger her first World Barrel Racing Championship. She and her horse, Fred, placed in nine out of ten rounds. She finished the year with total earnings of $189,185, and $78,588 of those earnings was won at the NFR.

They competed at rodeos at Reno, Nevada, St. Paul, Oregon, and Molalla, Oregon, earning $22,126 and qualifying Burger for her second NFR. In Las Vegas, the pair hit two barrels in the first two rounds. They ended the season fifth in the average. She finished the year ranked 30th in the World Standings with earnings of $26,144. = Season 2008 = In 2008 Burger finished ranked seventh in the World Standings with earnings of $116,518. She finished fifth in the NFR Average and won a total of $30,018 in NFR earnings. She placed in 3 out of 10 rounds at the NFR.

She was also the co- champion at the Young County Rodeo in Graham, Texas. = Seasons 2010‚Äì2015 = In the 2010 season, Fred's owner Ron Martin became obligated to sell the horse, leaving Burger without a ride. In the 2011 season, she finished 33rd in the World Standings with $35,385 in earnings. She won the Scotts Bluff County Fair and Rodeo in Mitchell, Nebraska, and the Hugo Pro Rodeo in Hugo, Oklahoma. In the 2012 season she finished 161st in the World Standings with $5,347 in earnings. In the 2013 season, she finished 337th in the World Standings with $2,166 in earnings. Also in this season, Burger and Mo competed in the WPRA Futurity Division. They earned 154 points and earned $22,283. In the 2014 season, she finished 84th in the World Standings with $12,029 in earnings. Mary and Mo finished the 2015 season ranked 77th in the World Standings, not high enough to get into many of the big rodeos. She earned $17,641 in the 2015 season. = Season 2016 = Burger had 39 rodeos and almost $100,000 in earnings this year prior to attending the Calgary Stampede in March. Burger and Mo got into RodeoHouston and the Calgary Stampede this season and won them both. In fact, she won the maximum amount of money available to any given contestant at Calgary, $122,000, of which $72,000 counted towards the World Standings.  RodeoHouston  On Saturday, March 19, at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, in Houston, Texas, in the NRG Stadium, Burger competed so well in the Super Series she won her second title there with a 14.15-second run on Mo. Burger said it was her main goal this year just to get to this rodeo \\"RodeoHouston has always been one of my favorite rodeos,\\" Burger said. \\"It‚Äôs the prestige and the money, and I just feel like I‚Äôm on cloud nine.\\" She won $54,750 total for the entire competition. She won her first title here back in 2009.  Calgary Stampede  For three days in a row of competition at the Stampede, the 67-year-old Burger has taken the top prize in the barrel racing competition, winning herself a total of $16,500 and a spot in Sunday's finals. On Sunday, March 20, Burger and her horse Mo ran the barrels in the finals at Calgary Stampede. Despite the mud, they completed the course in 17.99 seconds to win the six- digit grand prize. Burger claims she knew it was going to rain before they even got to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and she had run him in the mud beforehand a few times to prepare him. She took home a check for $100,000 that weekend,her largest prize ever. She became the oldest winner of the grand prize. She said that when she came through the alleyway and the audience started cheering, she thought, \\"I hope this turns out.\\" When she won the finals on Sunday, she got a standing ovation. Burger won against other barrel racing notables Mary Walker, Lisa Lockhart, and Jackie Ganter in the Championship Round around to win the grand prize. She had qualified for the Stampede through her showing in RodeoHouston. For the remainder of 2016, Burger and Mo were assured of qualifying for the NFR for 2016. Of Burger's $122,000 total Stampede payout this weekend, $72,000 of it counts in her WPRA standings. The 67 year old barrel racer is constantly told by her fans that she is an inspiration to them due to her age. On Friday, July 28, at Cheyenne Frontier Days, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, at the Cinch Shootout Rodeo, Burger and her horse Mo, competed at Frontier Park and won the barrel racing event. There were eight contestants including Burger. In the first round, Burger had the fastest round of the day at 17.047 seconds. The top three advanced to the final round. Burger and Mo also won that round with a time of 17.114 seconds which garnered them the $10,000 prize. Burger is quick to credit Mo, but it's really her training as well as the horse.  2016 NFR  Burger entered into her fourth NFR as No. 1 in the World Standings. Burger was leading with the most money ever won by a barrel racer in the regular season. However, enough money can be won at the NFR that even the competitor in 15th place has a shot to win. Amberleigh Moore was in 15th coming into the NFR and left in second place. Competition at the NFR is between the top 15 competitors in the World Standings. When Burger and Mo tipped a barrel in the 10th Round on the final day, they left the door open for three other competitors: Moore, Sherry Cervi, and Lisa Lockhart. However, none of three stepped up. Lockhart won the Average, Cervi won her first round of the rodeo, and Moore won second in the Average. Moore placed in eight of ten go-rounds winning $180,000 in NFR earnings. She gave Burger a major run for gold with three go-round victories, including an arena record tying run of 13.37 seconds in Round 8. She managed to take second place from the last spot of 15th.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Challenger, p. 3. Through 10 rounds of competition in 10 days, she remained in that position. Since on the 10th day in the Championship round she and Mo tipped a barrel, Burger had no idea what the final standings, she was clueless that she had won, so she went to the barn to unsaddle Mo. They had to send someone after her to inform her she had won and to bring her back to the arena. Burger placed in five rounds at the NFR. She finished sixth in the Average. She slid by reserve world champion Amberleigh Moore by less than $11,000, which would typically be \\"a fourth-place check in any go-round\\" in Las Vegas. Burger's performance at the NFR plus her large season winnings, namely $50,000 from RodeoHouston and the $72,000 of her Calgary Stampede winnings that counted, brought her the success in a very close race. Even with Mo having a soft tissue injury, the horse came through for her as his vet was at the event and monitoring him every day.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Placement at NFR, pp. 2-3. Mo was recognized when he was named the runner-up to AQHA/WPRA Horse of the Year CFour Tibbie Sinson. Mo was also named the Scoti Flit Bar Rising Star Award which was awarded on December 1 prior to the first performance.PRCA Awards, Stock of the Year ‚Äì AQHA/PRCA Horse of the Year, pp. 613-615. She gives credit for winning to Mo and her supportive family.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Credit, p. 4. She won $86,577 total in winnings at the NFR. Her total winnings season and NFR combined were $277,554 which were the most of any barrel racer that year which made her the WPRA World Barrel Racing Champion. This was her second champion title at the age of 68. = Records set = Oldest world champion In 2016 Burger won her second World Barrel Racing Champion title at the NFR and set a record for being the oldest world champion in the WPRA and the PRCA at 68 years, 4 months old. The record holder at that time was still 59-year-old Ike Rude, who won the steer roping championship in 1953.ProRodeo Records and Stats, Other World Title Records ‚Äì Oldest World Champion, p. 252. In 2006, Burger won her first World Barrel Racing Champion title at the NFR and set a record for the oldest WPRA champion at 58 years old, breaking the record set by Mary Walker in 2012 of 53 years old. Oldest NFR qualifier Burger set a new record in 2016 by becoming the oldest WPRA qualifier to the NFR at 68 years, 4 months old. She broke the record set by June Holeman in 2005 who was 62-years old.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Oldest World Champion, p. 6.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Oldest NFR Qualifiers, p. 6. Back No. 1 The rodeo contestant with the highest season earnings is honored with wearing the No. 1 back number at the NFR. The year 2016 is only the third time since 1967, when barrel racing was added as an event to the NFR, a WPRA barrel racer has achieved this feat. At the end of September, when Burger realized she had a good chance to win the back number, she decided that she would go to more rodeos to try to win it. She had been planning to skip some rodeos at that time. In 2016, Burger became the third WPRA member to wear the coveted No. 1 back number in NFR history. Charmayne James was first in 1987. Sherry Cervi was second in 1995.  Most money won in the regular season (Prior to the NFR)  As of August 8, 2018, Burger's regular season earnings eclipsed the record set by Lindsay Sears set in 2008, whose earnings were $184,567. She set the new record with a bit more than two months left before the regular season ended on September 30. In fact, she and her horse, Mo, won more money than any other competitor in the PRCA or the WPRA in the 2016 season. She was leading the race for the No. 1 back number by almost $30,000. Her 2016 winnings of $187,527 nearing the end, were almost $30,000 over saddle bronc rider Jacobs Crawley. On August 8, 2016, Burger set a new earnings record for the regular season by earning $190,977.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì Most Money Won, Regular Season, p. 6. = Season summary = Burger headed into the NFR with a lead of $74,590. Burger set the new season earnings record by earning $190,977 for the 2016 season. Winning RodeoHouston and the Calgary Stampede were big contributors to that record. She set several new records in the WPRA and the PRCA. She claimed multiple rodeo wins this year, some notable ones include: Hugo Pro Rodeo Hugo, Oklahoma; Flint Hills Rodeo, Strong City, Kansas; Frontier Hills Rodeo, Abbyville, Kansas; Wichita Falls Rodeo; Wichita Falls, Texas; San Patricio County Rodeo & Dance, Sinton, Texas, and the Card Holder race at the 2015 WPRA World Finals in Waco, Texas, where the money counts towards the 2016 standings.  Career summary  As an amateur, in 1974 she holds one AQHA world champion title. As of the end of 2016, Burger had $950,785 in career earnings. She had $277,554 in earnings for the entire year of 2016, including NFR earnings. Her total NFR earnings totalled $86,577. She ended the year 1st in the WPRA World Standings.

In 2017, she was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 2016 World Champion, p. 9. Award winning horses The horse who Burger won her first World Barrel Racing Champion title on in 2006 was a sorrel gelding whose registered name is Rare Fred, nicknamed Fred, and he was 12 years old at the time of her world championship in 2006. Mary trained and rode Fred, but he was owned by Ron Martin of Seal Beach, California. Rare Fred was the AQHA/WPRA Barrel Racing Horse of the Year in 2006 and 2009.PRCA Awards, Stock of the Year ‚Äì AQHA/PRCA Horse of the Year, pp. 614. Fred, who is by Jet Radar, has a notable pedigree. The stallion is double-bred Jet Deck-on the top through the Depth Charge/Go Man Go-bred Rare Jet. On the bottom, he is through Easy Jet and mixed with a Lady Bugs Moon daughter. Fred's dam is Sleek Glass, who is a granddam of both Secretariat and Johnny Dial. In 2010, Burger's rodeo season was disrupted when Fred's owner, Ron Martin, was obligated to sell him to another party. The horse who Burger won her second World Barrel Racing Champion title in 2016 on was a buckskin gelding whose registered name is SadiesFamousLastWords, nicknamed Mo. Mo's sire is Sadies Frost Drift. His dam is Porky and Bess. When Burger saw Mo, she recognized his talent and made an open trade for him with Brad Leiblong, a futurity trainer and horse trader. Mo was 2 years old when she found him, and she quickly traded for him with the registration papers coming straight to her. Burger was 62 and very busy, so she sent Mo out for 30 days of initial training. However, all of his remaining training has been done by Burger herself. Burger and Mo have some notable wins at some large rodeos such as the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and the Calgary Stampede, for example, when he was 7 years of age. \\"The sky is the limit with him,\\" Burger said. \\"As an eight or nine-year-old, he should be a little more solid and more mature. He started running even harder last spring and summer. I don‚Äôt think he even knew that he could run harder. He just covers the ground so easily.\\" Mo finished second to the AQHA/WPRA Barrel Racing Horse of the Year CFour Tibbie Stinson in 2016.PRCA Awards, Stock of the Year ‚Äì AQHA/PRCA Horse of the Year, pp. 610. Mo also won the Scoti Flit Bar Rising Star Award in 2016. One of her earlier horses was by the registered name of Sailors Wind, nicknamed Sailor, a 15-year-old gelding, whose sire's name is Dashin Is Easy. His dam's name is Runaway N Passem.  Personal life  Burger and her husband Kerry still live in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, where Burger started to rodeo and train horses for futurity racing. They live on 28 acres. They also own a B&B; Machine Shop near by. Their son Joey is married to P.J. Burger, who is Mary's traveling partner, along with her husband, Kerry. Joey and P.J. have a daughter who competes in the National Little Britches Rodeo Association. Burger's favorite rodeos are the Woodward Elks Rodeo in Woodward, Oklahoma, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in Houston, Texas. Burger trained her barrel horses, such as Fred and Mo, with a pole bending pattern and without any arena fences. \\"I want them automatic,\\" she said. \\"I want them using that inside back leg and for it all to be very fluid. And I go with them. It's not just 'drag and pull.'\\"  References  Bibliography  *  External links  * 68 Year-Old Mary Burger Wins Her 2nd WPRA World Championship Title * Mary Burger ‚Äì Round 7 ‚Äì 2016 Wrangler NFR * Mary Burger Barrel Racing ‚Äì Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo * 2013 Cowboy Publishing Barrel Racing Champion ‚Äì Mary Burger * All Breed Pedigree Category:Living people Category:Barrel racers Category:1948 births Category:Cowgirl Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Decatur, Indiana Category:People from Pauls Valley, Oklahoma Category:Sportspeople from Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Oklahoma Category:American barrel racers Category:American female equestrians ","title":"Mary Burger"},{"id":"57297087","text":"Margaret Gayen (born 10 July 1994) is an Australian long jumper.

Its common name reflects its glossy and nearly apunctate, in comparison to other Haemaphysalis ticks, dorsal integument. Bionomics H. luzonensis inhabits forests dominated by Dipterocarpus plants and Benguet pine at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 feet of the mountains in the central western part of the Sierra Madre Mountain range of Luzon Island. It parasitizes the Philippine deer and the Philippine warty pig in Nueva Ecija and Quezon Provinces of Luzon Island. Collection data suggest that both vertebrates are important hosts of adults and nymphs of this tick species. Males, females, and nymphs were documented to feed on their hosts between October and August, suggesting that they are active year-round. The larvae, which are very small, may feed at different seasons or on different hosts. Other tick species feeding on deer and boar included Boophilus microplus, Haemaphysalis psalistos, Haemaphysalis rusae, Hemaphysalis papuana group, Amblyomma species, Dermacentor species, Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus.

When folded and unable to fire, the pistol mimics the appearance of a smartphone. It is made by Ideal Conceal Inc., of Monticello, MN. The Ideal Conceal drew attention and criticism because of concerns over the resemblance to a smart phone and possible legal and safety issues with law enforcement. Description The Ideal Conceal is a derringer-style handgun containing two .38 caliber barrels, chambered for .380 ACP cartridges. It is black, with a plastic exterior and metal core. It is around the same size as a Samsung Galaxy S7 and has a handle that collapses to give it the appearance of a mobile phone when not in use. When folded up, it locks and so cannot be fired. The pistol grip acts as a safety and is held in place with a detent. To ready the gun, the pistol grip must be manually swung open, at which point the firearm takes on the appearance of a conventional handgun, meeting the requirements of a pistol under the National Firearms Act. Criticism The National Rifle Association described it on their website, saying, \\"The Cellphone Pistol offers a great option for self-defense along with max concealment\\" and \\"The shape will not print as a pistol, yet can be drawn and fired quickly.\\" Gun control activist Jaclyn Corin criticized the gun, saying that it will cause the police to target more people. There have also been concerns about children mistaking the Ideal Conceal for a real mobile phone. In 2016, Senator Chuck Schumer called the gun a \\"...disaster waiting to happen.\\" and said that it could be potentially illegal in the United States under the current gun laws, and would talk to the Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). In 2017, the ATF classified the Ideal Conceal design as a pistol.

She completed her PhD in 2008 at the University of Connecticut, where she worked with Matthew Rasband at the University of Connecticut Health Center. From 2008 to 2014, Schafer worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Beth Stevens's lab at Boston Children's Hospital. In January 2015, Schafer was hired as a tenure-track assistant professor of neurobiology at UMass Medical School.  Research  = Microglia-synapse interactions = Schafer has studied the phagocytic function of microglia, which is required for synaptic pruning of the connections between the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as other highly organized pathways in the healthy central nervous system. The pruning ability of microglia is dependent on complement component 3. Schafer's current research includes ablating genes of interest in microglia to determine their effects on synaptic structure as well as behavior. Microglial cytokine signaling also modulates synaptic function by regulating neurotransmitter receptor expression, which can directly impact neurotransmission. Alongside Beth Stevens, Schafer has proposed an expansion to the tripartite synapse model of neural function called the quad-partite synapse. = Neurological disease = Microglia are implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, ALS, and MS. In a MECP2-null mouse model of Rett syndrome, Schafer demonstrated that microglia contributed to disease by excessively pruning presynaptic inputs, thereby disrupting vulnerable neural circuits. Microglia functioned primarily as \\"secondary responders\\" which were excessively activated by disease, a mechanism which may be conserved in other models of neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease.

It was led by the Kabyles of the Biban mountains commanded by Cheikh Mokrani and his brother Boumezrag, as well as Cheikh El Haddad, head of the Rahmaniyya religious fraternity. Background Boumezrag el MokraniCheikh Mokrani (Mohamed Amokrane) and his brother Boumezrag were sons of a family of high rank - the Ait Abbas dynasty (a branch of the Hafsids of B√©ja√Øa), the Amokrane, masters, since the sixteenth century of the Kal√¢a of Ait Abbas in the Bibans and of the Medjana region. In the 1830s, their father Ahmed El Mokrani (d. 1853), had chosen to ally himself with the French; it was he who had allowed the Iron Gates expedition in 1839 and he had become khalifa of the Medjana under the tutelage of the French authorities. This alliance had soon revealed itself to be subordination - a decree of 1845 abolished the khalifalik of Medjana so that when Mohamed succeeded his father, as the choice of the Arab Bureaux, his title was no more than ‚Äúbachagha‚Äù (=chief commander). During the hardships of 1867, he gave his personal guarantee, at the request of the authorities, for important loans. In 1870, the creditors demanded to be repaid and the French authorities reneged on the loan on the pretext of the Franco-Prussian War, leaving Mohamed obliged to pawn his own possessions. The late 1860s were hard for the people of Algeria: between 1866 and 1868 they lived through drought, exceptionally cold winters, an epidemic of cholera and an earthquake. More than 10% of the kabyle population died during this period. On 12 June 1869, Marshall MacMahon, the Governor General, advised the French government that ‚Äúthe Kabyles will stay peaceful as long as they see no possibility of driving us out of their country.‚Äù Under the French Second Republic, the country was governed by a Governor General and a large proportion was \\"military territory\\".Murray Steele, 'Algeria: Government and Administration, 1830-1914', Encyclopedia of African History, ed. by Kevin Shillington, 3 vols (New York: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005), I pp. 50-52 (at p. 51). p.17 There were tensions between the French colonists and the army; the former favouring the abolition of the military territory as being too protective of the native Algerians. Eventually, on 9 March 1870, the Corps l√©gislatif passed a law which would end the military regime in Algeria. When Napoleon III fell and the Third French Republic was proclaimed, the Algerian question fell under the remit of the new Justice Minister, Adolphe Cr√©mieux, and not, as previously, under the Minister of War. At the same time, Algeria was experiencing a period of anarchy. The settlers, hostile to Napoleon III and strongly Republican, took advantage of the fall of the Second Empire to push forward their anti-military agenda. Real authority devolved to town councils and local defence committees, and their pressure resulted in the Cr√©mieux Decrees.  Start of the revolt  A number of origins have been suggested for the Mokrani revolt. There was a general dissatisfaction among Kabyle notables because of the steady erosion of their authority by the colonial authorities. At the same time, ordinary people were concerned about the imposition of civilian rule on 9 March, which they interpreted as imposing domination by the settlers, with encroachments on their land and loss of autonomy.Bernard Droz, ¬´ Insurrection de 1871: la r√©volte de Mokrani ¬ª, dans Jeannine Verd√®s-Leroux (dir.), L'Alg√©rie et la France, Paris, Robert Laffont 2009, The Cremieux Decree of 24 October 1870, which gave French nationality to Algerian Jews was probably another cause of the unrest. However some historians view this as doubtful, pointing out that this story only started to spread after the revolt was over. Indeed, this explanation of the revolt was particularly widespread among French antisemites. News of the insurrectionary Paris commune also played a part. Several months before the start of the insurrections, kabyle village communities began electing village assemblies (\\"tijmaa'in\\") despite the colonial authorities having banned them from doing so. The first signs of actual revolt appeared in the mutiny of a squadron of the 3rd Regiment of Spahis in January 1871, who were refusing to be sent to metropolitan France,R. Hure, page 155, , Charles-Lavauzelle 1977 claiming that they were only required to serve in Algeria. This mutiny began in Moudjebeur, near Ksar Boukhari on 20 January, spread to A√Øn Guettar (in the region of modern Khemissa, near Souk Ahras) on 23 January, and soon reached El Tarf and Bouhadjar. The mutiny at A√Øn Guettar involved the mass desertion of several hundred men and the killing of several officers. It took on a particular significance for the Rezgui family, whose members maintained that France, recently defeated by the Prussians, was a spent force and that now was the time for a general uprising. The Hanenchas responded to this call, killing fourteen colonists in their territory; Souk Ahras was besieged from 26 to 28 January, before being relieved by a French column, who then put down the insurgency and condemned five men to death. Mokrani submitted his resignation as bachagha in March 1871, but the army replied that only the civil government could now accept it. In reply, Mokrani wrote to General Augeraud, subdivisional commander at S√©tif:Lettre de Mokrani au G√©n√©ral Augerand, dans le Rapport de M. L√©on de La Sicoti√®re au nom de la ¬´ Commission d‚ÄôEnqu√™te sur les actes du Gouvernement de la D√©fense Nationale ¬ª, Versailles, Cerf et fils, 1875,  The revolt spreads  Attack on Bordj Bou Arreridj by Cheikh Mokrani ‚Äî Engraving by L√©on Morel-Fatio, L'Illustration, 1871. The spahi mutiny was reignited after 16 March 1871, when Mokrani took charge of it. On 16 March, Mokrani led six thousand men in an assault on Bordj Bou Arreridj. On 8 April, French troops regained control of the Medjana plain. The same day, Si Aziz, son of Cheikh Ahaddad, head of the Rahmaniyya order, proclaimed a holy war in the market of Seddouk. Soon 150,000 Kabyles rose, as the revolt spread along the coast first, then into the mountains to the east of the Mitidja and as far as Constantine. It then spread to the Belezma mountains and linked with local insurrections all the way down to the Sahara desert. As they spread towards Algiers itself, the insurgents took Lakhdaria (Palestro), 60 km east of the capital, on 14 April. By April, 250 tribes had risen, or nearly a third of Algeria's population. One hundred thousand ‚Äúmujahidin‚Äù, poorly armed and disorganised, were launching random raids and attacks. = French counterattack = The military authorities brought in reinforcements for the Army of Africa; Admiral de Gueydon, who took over as Governor General on 29 March, replacing Special Commissioner Alexis Lambert, mobilised 22,000 soldiers. Advancing from Palestro towards Algiers, the rebels were stopped at Boudouaou (Alma) on 22 April 1871; on 5 May, Mohamed El Mokrani died fighting at Oued Soufflat, halfway between Lakhdaria (Palestro) and Bouira in an encounter with the troops of General Saussier. On 25 April, the Governor General declared a state of siege. Twenty columns of French troops marched on Dellys and Dra√¢ El Mizan. Cheikh Haddad and his sons were captured on 13 July after the battle of Icheriden. The revolt only faded after the capture of Boumezrag, Cheikh Mokrani‚Äôs brother, on 20 January 1872. = Repression = Administrative notice (1871). Cheikh Mokrani's goods sequestered During the fighting, around 100 European civilians died, along with an unknown number of Algerian civilians. After fighting ceased, more than 200 Kabyles were interned and others deported to Cayenne and New Caledonia, where they were known as Algerians of the Pacific. Boumezrag Mokrani was condemned to death by a court in Constantine on 27 March 1873. The Kabylie region was subjected to a collective fine of 36 million francs, and 450,000 hectares of land were confiscated and given to new settlers, many of whom were refugees from Alsace- Lorraine. especially in the region of Constantine. The repression and confiscations forced a number of Kabyles to leave the country.

Born in Cape Town, South Africa, she studied history at the University of Cape Town and became a teacher. In 1942, she married Piet Duvenage, a rugby player, and had two children. He died in an accident on the rugby field in 1947. The next year, a short visit with family in Southern Rhodesia became permanent when she accepted a teaching job in Selukwe. There, she met her future husband, Ian Smith, who had recently come home from the Second World War. In 1948, the couple got married and bought a farm, and Ian was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly. In 1964, when Ian Smith became Prime Minister of Rhodesia, the family moved to the premier's residence in Salisbury. Smith split her time between state functions and managing the farm back in Selukwe. After Zimbabwean independence from the United Kingdom, her husband was defeated at the 1980 election, but remained in the Parliament of Zimbabwe until 1987. Smith continued to divide her time between Harare and the farm until her death from cancer in 1994.  Early life, education, and first marriage  Janet Watt was born in Cape Town in the Union of South Africa in 1915. Her parents were from Scotland, and her father was a surgeon. She attended the University of Cape Town, where she studied history, geology, and a bit of philosophy, and was a star field hockey player. She was quite well- known for playing hockey for Western Province. There, she briefly met her future husband, Ian Smith, who was on campus as a member of the visiting Rhodes University rugby team. After graduating, Watt earned her teaching qualification and became a history teacher. In 1942, she married Piet Duvenage, a physician and rugby player. Together they had a son, Robert, and a daughter, Jean. Piet Duvenage died in a freak accident on the field during a club rugby practice in May 1947. A young widow, she was left to support her two young children on a teacher's salary.  Move to Southern Rhodesia and Ian Smith  In 1947, Duvenage took her two children to Selukwe, Southern Rhodesia, to stay with family for a short holiday. The move became permanent when she accepted a job offer from Selukwe Primary School. That year, through her sister, she became reacquainted with Ian Smith, who had recently returned to his hometown and was taking courses at Gwebi College of Agriculture. He later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and \\"oppos[ition] on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue ... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking the easy way out.\\" In 1948, she and Smith became engaged, and she started a new position as the mathematics and geography mistress at Chaplin High School in nearby Gweru.  Farming and politics  Ian Smith, circa 1954 In July 1948, a general election was called in Southern Rhodesia after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister, Sir Godfrey Huggins, unexpectedly lost a vote in the Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month before election day, Ian Smith was approached by members of the opposition Liberal Party who asked him to run for election in Selukwe. Jacob Smit's Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Smith was astonished to learn of her husband's decision to run for the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly, having never before heard him discuss politics. She asked him, \\"Are you interested in politics‚Äîparty politics?\\" He replied, \\"I can't say that I am really interested in party politics, but I've always been most interested in sound government.\\" In addition to becoming a politician, August 1948 was important for the Smiths in two other ways: it was the month they got married, and the month they purchased their first farm. The farm was a plot of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the Lundi and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream. They called it \\"Gwenoro\\", using the name that the local Karanga people used to refer to the stream, and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize. Ian adopted her children, taking up the responsibilities of instant fatherhood, partially, as he explained, \\"because I knew [Piet Duvenage] so well\\" from playing rugby against him. After the wedding, and a few days' honeymoon in Victoria Falls, the Smiths returned home and went straight into the election campaign. On election on 15 September, Ian Smith won with 361 votes, a substantial 100+ vote majority over the second place Labour candidate. At 28 years old, he became the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. Having grown up in an area of Cape Town so pro-Smuts that she had never had to vote, Smith did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. \\"First of all I was marrying a farmer,\\" she later said, \\"now he was going to be a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'... It never dawned on me‚Äîbeing so naive about politicians‚Äîthat our lives would be affected in the slightest degree.\\" However, it soon became evident that her husband's political office necessitated that he spend a lot of time away from Selukwe working in Salisbury, meaning she would have to run the farm during his absences. On 20 May 1949, their only son, Alec, was born in Gwelo.  Wife of the Prime Minister  Ian Smith defected from the Liberal Party to the United Federal Party, and served as Chief Whip from 1958 onwards. He left in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and the following year helped Winston Field to form the all-white, firmly conservative Rhodesian Front (RF), which called for independence without an immediate shift to black majority rule. Her husband's right-wing views were no problem for Smith, whose views on race were even more hardline than his. Ian became Deputy Prime Minister following the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 election victory, and stepped up to the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. The Smiths left management of the farm to others, and relocated to Salisbury to move into State House, the premier's official residence. On 11 November 1965, in the wake of a number of failed negotiations with Britain, Ian Smith and his Cabinet unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. Smith would hold the premiership for about the next decade and a half. As the Prime Minister's wife, Smith spent much of her time involved with matters of state, so much so that her son Alec described her as \\"a trace of perfume on the air\\" to him in those days. Free from parental supervision, the teenaged Alec became a frequent partier and consumer of alcohol and drugs. Meanwhile, both Janet and Ian enjoyed his time in the premiership. Janet, a charming, intelligent, and determined woman, adapted well to her role as the Prime Minister's wife. A common, if unfounded, smear used against Ian by his domestic political opponents was that his wife was \\"the power behind the throne.\\" In the face of United Nations economic sanctions, and with the support of apartheid South Africa, and, until 1974, Portugal, Rhodesia's government endured. Several bouts of talks with the UK came to nothing, and Ian Smith and the Rhodesian Front remained in power through several more decisive electoral victories. The Rhodesian Bush War ramped up beginning in 1972, with African nationalists fighting a white government that was increasingly under siege and isolated.  Later life and death  In 1978, Ian Smith and non-militant nationalists including Abel Muzorewa signed the Internal Settlement, under which he stepped down from the premiership and the country became Zimbabwe Rhodesia effective 1 June 1979. Following the Lancaster House Agreement, Robert Mugabe and other militant nationalists came to power in an independent Zimbabwe in 1980. Though no longer premier, Ian remained Leader of the Opposition and held a seat in the Parliament of Zimbabwe until 1987. The couple still maintained a residence in Harare (the new name for Salisbury), and Smith continued managing Gwenoro Farm while her husband focused on politics. She died of cancer in Harare on the night of 3 December 1994. She was buried in her long-time hometown, Shurugwi (previously Selukwe). After her death, her husband employed a manager to run their farm.  Personal life and family  Smith had two children with her first husband, Jean and Robert. In 1967, Jean married Clem Tholet, a singer-songwriter best known for his Rhodesian patriotic songs like \\"Rhodesians Never Die\\". Janet and Ian Smith had one son, Alec, who later became chaplain of the Zimbabwe National Army. All three of their children attended Chaplin High School in Gweru. Smith's sister Helen was married to Owen Horwood, who was Minister of Finance in the South African government. Smith, like her husband, was a church-going Presbyterian, socially conservative, and an avid sportsperson.

He was the first person sent to spread Protestant Christianity in Karo, North Sumatra. His work in Karo did not last long, as he later decided to quit the mission, leaving from the Indies until his death in 1922.  Early life  Hendrik was born in Semarang, Central Java in 1922, as the second son of the missionary Jan Kruyt and his wife Dorothea Johanna van der Linden. His brother Albert Christian Kruyt became known as the developer of ethno- sociological method in spreading Christianity. Hendrik spent his childhood in Java, before being sent to the Netherlands to receive an education at the Netherlands Missionary Society (NZG) School of Mission at the age of 11.  Placement in Minahasa  After completing his education as a missionary, Kruyt was sent back to the Indies in 1884 along with his wife, Wilhemnina de Ligt. Hendrik asked to be placed in Java and expressed his desire to be \\"closer to the family\\" and to lead a congregation, just like his father. However, the NZG board could not find a suitable place for him in Java, and instead he was sent to Minahasa as a teacher and principal in Tomohon. Disappointed with this decision, Kruyt requested that his placement in Tomohon be temporary and requested that the council find him a job in Java. He eventually settled for 4 years there.  Arrival in Sumatra  In April 1889, the council informed him of the possibility of his transfer from Minahasa and decided that Sumatra was the right place for him. On the other hand, Kruyt was only willing to be placed for a temporary period, and asked the board to not override his request to be placed in Java. He also refused to be exchanged with a tobacco company which operated in Deli, Deli Company, stating that he \\"remains a missionary of the NZG.\\" The board repeatedly assured him that the company would only pay the financial wage, and they would not be his boss. Kruyt avoided alcohol, cigarettes, even tea and coffee all his life. He claimed that even if he had \\"high sense of antipathy\\" for tobacco, it does not mean he had a bad relationship with the tobacco planters there. He was not concerned with the tobacco plantations used by others, unless it involves the mission and colonization of the land of the people where he worked.

While still in the academy, Gallagher made his senior debut for Connacht on 21 October 2017, coming off the bench against Worcester Warriors in the 2017‚Äì18 Challenge Cup. His first start came on 9 December 2017 in the same competition, this time against Brive. Gallagher made his Pro14 debut away to Munster on 21 January 2018. In March 2018, it was announced that Gallagher had signed a senior deal with the province, becoming part of the first team squad for the following season. International Gallagher has represented Ireland internationally at under-age level. He was selected for the Irish under-18 schools team in 2015 on the back of his performances for Summerhill College. He made two appearances for the side before travelling to the Rugby Europe under-18 tournament, where he was injured in the first game. Gallagher progressed to play for the Ireland under-20s the following year. He was named in Nigel Carolan's squad for the 2016 Under-20 Six Nations, playing in all five games in the tournament and scoring a try on his debut against Wales. In May 2016, Gallagher was named in the team's squad for the upcoming Junior World Cup. He played in all three of the team's group games including a win over New Zealand, the first time an Irish international men's side had beaten their New Zealand counterparts. Gallagher did not appear in the knockout stages, which saw Ireland reach the final, their best ever performance in the tournament. Gallagher was one of only three players to return to the team for the following season, and was named in the squad for the 2017 Under-20 Six Nations. He played in the first two games, captaining the side against Italy. Gallagher was injured during the Italy game however, and missed the remainder of the tournament. The injury also ruled him out of the 2017 Junior World Cup.

It is led by Fabio Alberti and Diego Capusotto, and scripted by Pedro Saborido, N√©stor Montalbano and the two stars. During the program, the drivers used the pseudonyms of Mario and Marcelo, making possible reference to two Argentine television conductors and long-term rivals, Mario Pergolini and Marcelo Tinelli. The name of the program parodies the retailers of low cost, kitschy, imported objects mainly from China.  Origins  Its antecedents were shows headed by Alfredo Casero, De la cabeza and Cha Cha Cha. Alberti and Capusotto took part over several seasons. The show attempted absurd humor. Another antecedent was Delicatessen, broadcast by Am√©rica TV. It included Capusotto and Alberti along with Horacio Fontova and Dami√°n Dreizik.  Format  Sketches were presented \\"live\\" from the studio (located in Miami) by the two drivers, who were accompanied by a Chinese secretary (Irene Chong-Lin, born in Hong Kong) nicknamed Sushi Tepanaki, an older man (Alfonso Crispino), who under the pseudonym of Dr. Dyango appeared while dancing ridiculously, a dancing trio called \\"Los Carlitos Bala\\", and audience members. As of 2000 the section known as \\"The musical ranking of Todo por dos pesos\\" took shape. Throughout that year, 58 songs enriched the program, with artists such as Los 3 locos, which had the highest ranking of that year. The topic with the least turnover was Copet√≠n de Buenos Aires by Jaime Cohen.  Reception  The program started on Azul TV in 1999, without much success, and was canceled. Marcelo Stiletano, of the newspaper La Naci√≥n described it as a \\"ferocious vision of cheap TV\\", in which \\"disorder, scarcity and improvisation\\" hide a meticulous work of production with parody objectives. The following year it moved to Channel 7 until its completion in 2002. This freed the show from \\"the pressure of the rating\\". Paradoxically, from that season onwards, the program obtained a remarkable success, becoming established as the highest ratec offering of the channel in years. In 2001, its success was threatened because Tinelli dedicated that year to satirizing President Fernando de la R√∫a in his comic program El Show de Videomatch. During the year's last installment Canal 7 announced that a commemorative plaque would be placed on the door of the studio where the Program was recorded.  Sketches and characters  * The Bobo Man (Capusotto): Parody of the Werewolf. ¬´When the Moon comes out, an ordinary man is transformed into the Bobo Man, terrorizing all Humanity with his mischief.¬ª * The Musical Ranking: Recreated video clips were shown, changing the lyrics and images of classic national and foreign themes. * Total Boluda: A parody of cable programs dedicated to women, led by a clumsy Coty Nosiglia (Fabio Alberti, also the name of an Argentine politician). * Irma Jusid (Capusotto): A woman who gave advice to young people and warned of the dangers of certain situations with exaggerated examples of the reprimands they would suffer. * HP: A parody of a soap opera called PH (Horizontal Property). In it, the characters become involved in dramatic situations, and the predominant phrase in their dialogues is the repeatedly bleeped out \\"son of a bitch!\\". * El Rinconcito del Consumidor: A program conducted by Dr. Dyango (Alfonso Grispino) disguised as a woman, in which he recommended to save second-hand items with notorious flaws, parodying programs for housewives, especially 33 million consumers, led by Lita de L√°zzari. * What Happens to the Argentines ?: The program ended with demented monologue about the entertainment world and the country, where Alberti drew incoherent lines on a blackboard to illustrate the situation he described. Alberti reused this resource years later when he led Hard to Lunch. * Beto Tony and his Doll: Alberti played a ventriloquist who told lousy jokes like \\"first act, second act ...\\". At the end of each joke, after a second of sepulchral silence, someone shouted: \\"It's nice!\\" And the audience burst into applause. * Flavio Pedemonti: Alfonso Grispino played an ex-footballer who had gone through all kinds of excesses and difficult situations, preparing to return to the sport. * Tito Cossa: Parody of the detective series, with Germ√°n Navetta in the leading role of Tito Cossa (name taken from that of a well-known Argentine dramatist). The character emulated a secret spy of the SIDE displaying parodic situations by contrast: for example, weapons made with strips of chorizos or ca√±oncitos of dulce de leche, or a carriage -including horse- made with the elements of a kitchen (oven), fireplace, hot water tank, etc.). * The Column of Galloso (2000-2001): Parody of a television newscast, in which the iconic broadcaster Horacio Galloso (1933-2012) presented his \\"journalistic column\\", showing smiling cases of Buenos Aires reality. * That Friend of the Asma (2001): Parody of the musical nocturnal program That friend of the soul, of Lito Vitale. * Good News (2002): A parody of the official newscast, in which a kind of mini-president Duhalde presented \\"Argentine solutions\\" for the problems created by the lack of certain products that had vanished after the devaluation. * Gu√°lter and his Organ: Inspired by the true \\"Walter and his Organ\\"; an Argentine musician who played the electric organ. Gu√°lter made music with his sexual organ. Like Walter, he encouraged birthdays and weddings. * Vinazzi: A man who sang melodies bubbling in a wine glass.

Ein Afrika-Reisender auf den Spuren des europ√§ischen V√∂lkermords, Unionsverlag, Z√ºrich 1999, S. 62; Susanne Ku√ü, Bernd Martin: Das Deutsche Reich und der Boxeraufstand. Iudicium, M√ºnchen 2002, p. 62. The Hamburg social scientist Jan Philipp Reemtsma sees a war, \\"which is led, in the worst case, to destroy or even decimate a population\\", as the heart of the war of annihilation.Jan Philipp Reemtsma: Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz ‚Äì Ludendorff ‚Äì Hitler. In: Hannes Heer, Klaus Naumann (Eds.): Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941‚Äì1944. Hamburg 1995, pp. 377‚Äì401, hier S. 377, vgl. auch 386‚Äì398. The state organization of the enemy will be smashed. Another characteristic of a war of annihilation is its ideological character and the rejection of negotiations with the enemy, as the historian Andreas Hillgruber has shown in the example of the German-Soviet War.Andreas Hillgruber: Die ideologisch-dogmatische Grundlage der nationalsozialistischen Politik der Ausrottung der Juden in den besetzten Gebieten der Sowjetunion und ihre Durchf√ºhrung 1941‚Äì1944. In: German Studies Review 2 (1979), Bd. 3, p. 263‚Äì296. The legitimacy and trustworthiness of the opponent is negated, demoted to status of a total enemy, with whom there can be no understanding, but rather devotes the totality of one's own \\"Volk, Krieg und Politik [als] Triumph der Idee des Vernichtungskrieges\\" (people, war and politics [to the] triumph of the idea of the war of annihilation).Jan Philipp Reemtsma: Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz ‚Äì Ludendorff ‚Äì Hitler, pp. 386‚Äì398, Zitat p. 397.  Development  = Herero uprising = Social Democratic Party of Germany political communications had circulated the term Vernichtungskrieg in order to criticize the action against the insurgents during the Herero Wars.Frank Oliver Sobich: \\"Schwarze Bestien, rote Gefahr\\". Rassismus und Antisozialismus im deutschen Kaiserreich. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 2006, S. 301‚Äì305. In January 1904 the Herero and Namaqua genocide began in the German colony German South West Africa. With a total of about 15,000 men under Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha, this uprising was prostrated until August 1904. Most of the Herero fled to the almost waterless Omaheke, an offshoot of the Kalahari Desert. Von Trotha had them locked down and the refugees chased away from the few water spots there, so that thousands of Herero along with their families and cattle herds died of thirst. The hunted in the desert, let Trotha in the so-called Vernichtungsbefehl, \\"Annihilation Command\\": Trotha's warfare aimed at the complete annihilation of the Herero (\\"I believe that the nation must be destroyed as such\\"Brief an Generalstabschef Alfred Graf von Schlieffen, 5. Oktober 1904, in: Michael Behnen: Quellen zur deutschen Aussenpolitik im Zeitalter des Imperialismus 1890‚Äì1911. Darmstadt 1977, S. 292.) and was supported in particular by Schlieffen and Kaiser Wilhelm II.Dominik J. Schaller: ¬ªIch glaube, dass die Nation als solche vernichtet werden muss: Kolonialkrieg und V√∂lkermord in ¬´Deutsch-S√ºdwestafrika¬ª 1904‚Äì1907¬´. In: Journal of Genocide Research. 6:3, S. 398. His approach is therefore considered to be the first genocide of the twentieth century. Trotha's action sparked outrage in Germany and abroad; at the instigation of chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow, the Emperor lifted the order of annihilation two months after the events in the Omaheke. Trotha's policy remained largely unchanged until its revocation in November 1905. = Ludendorff's conception = The war of annihilation was a further development of the concept of Total War, as 1935 the former imperial General Quartermaster Erich Ludendorff had designed. Thereafter, in a coming war, victory must be given unlimited priority over all other societal concerns: all resources would have to be harnessed, the will of the nation had to be made available before the outbreak of the hostilities are unified by propaganda and dictatorship violence, all available weapons would have to be used, and no consideration could be taken of International law. Even in its objectives, total war is unlimited, as the experience of First World War teaching: In this conceptual delimitation of the war, Ludendorff was able to draw from the German military- theoretical discourse, which had formed in the confrontation with the People's War, the \\"Guerre √† outrance\\", which the newly created Third French Republic in the fall and winter of 1870 against the Prussian-German invaders of the Franco-Prussian War.Robert T. Foley: From Volkskrieg to Vernichtungskrieg. German Concepts of Warfare, 1871‚Äì1935. In: Anja Hartmann, Beatrice Heuser (Hrsg.): War, Peace, and World Orders in European History. Routledge, London/New York 2001, S. 215‚Äì220. Ludendorff also dealt with Carl von Clausewitz and his 1832 posthumously published work On War, in which he distinguished between 'absolute' and 'limited' wars. But even for Clausewitz absolute war was subject to restrictions, such as the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, between military and civil or between public and private. Ludendorff claimed now that in total war it is no longer a \\"petty political purpose\\", not even \\"big ... national interests\\", but the sheer Lebenserhaltung (life-support) of the nation, its identity. This existential threat also justifies the annihilation of the enemy, at least moral, if not physical.Wilhelm Janssen: \\"War\\". In: Reinhart Koselleck, Werner Conze, Otto Brunner (eds.): Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in Deutschland. Historical lexicon on the political-social language in Germany. Vol. 3, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1982, pp. 613. Ludendorffs efforts to radicalize the war (for which he was responsible from 1916) met with social, political and military barriers. In the year 1935, his advice was then, as the historian Robert Foley writes, \\"on fertile ground\\"; the time seemed ripe for an even more radical delimitation of the war by the Nazis. = Nazi warfare = The best known example of a Vernichtungskrieg is the German-Soviet War, which began on June 22, 1941 with the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Berlin historian Ernst Nolte called this the \\"most egregious Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history\\" and distinguished it from a \\"normal war\\", as the Nazi regime conducted against France.Ernst Nolte: Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche. Action francaise ‚Äì Italienischer Faschismus ‚Äì Nationalsozialismus. Taschenbuchausgabe, Piper, M√ºnchen 1984, S. 451. According to Andreas Hillgruber, Hitler had four motives in launching Operation Barbarossa, namely * The extermination not only of the \\"Jewish Bolshevik elite\\" who supposedly governed the Soviet Union since seizing power in 1917, but also the extermination of every single Jewish man, woman and child in the Soviet Union. * Providing Germany with Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") by settling millions of German colonists within what was soon to be the former Soviet Union, something that would have required a massive population displacement as millions of Russian Untermenschen (\\"sub-humans\\") would have had to be forced out of homes to make way for the Herrenvolk (\\"master-race\\") colonists. * Turning the Russians and other Slavic peoples not expelled from their homes into slaves who would provide Germany with an ultra- cheap labor force to be exploited. * Using vast natural resources of the Soviet Union to provide the foundation stone of a German-dominated economic zone in Eurasia that would be immune to blockade, and provide Germany with the sufficient economic strength to allow the Reich to conquer the entire world. Later, Hillgruber explicitly described the character of the Eastern Front as \\"intended racial-ideological war of annihilation\\".Andreas Hillgruber: Der Ostkrieg und die Judenvernichtung, in: Gerd R. Uebersch√§r u. Wolfram Wette (Hrsg.): Der deutsche √úberfall auf die Sowjetunion. \\"Unternehmen Barbarossa\\" 1941. Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt a. M. 1991, S. 185‚Äì206, Zitat S. 191. Operation Barbarossa has also found its way into the historical-political teaching of general education schools as a historical example of an extermination war.Wigbert Benz: \\"Unternehmen Barbarossa\\" 1941. Vernichtungskrieg und historisch-politische Bildung. In: Informationen f√ºr den Geschichts- und Gemeinschaftskundeunterricht. Heft 60/2010, S. 5‚Äì33; siehe auch Online-Version. The concept of the war of annihilation was intensely discussed in the 1990s with reference to the Wehrmachtsausstellung of the Hamburg Institute for Social Research, which carried the word \\"Vernichtungskrieg\\" in the title.Hannes Heer u. a. (Hrsg.): Verbrechen der Wehrmacht. Dimensionen des Vernichtungskrieges 1941‚Äì1944. Ausstellungskatalog. Hamburger Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung. 1. Auflage, Hamburger Edition, Hamburg 1996. Johannes Klotz: Die Ausstellung \\"Vernichtungskrieg, Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944\\". Zwischen Geschichtswissenschaft und Geschichtspolitik. In: Detlef Bald, Johannes Klotz, Wolfram Wette: Mythos Wehrmacht. Nachkriegsdebatten und Traditionspflege. Aufbau, Berlin 2001. That Operation Barbarossa would be a war of annihilation, Adolf Hitler had pronounced openly on March 30, 1941 before the generals of the Wehrmacht: The orientation of Operation Barbarossa as a prior planned war of annihilation proves the commands prepared according to the general guidelines cited by Hitler on 30 March 1941 before the start of the campaign, such as the Barbarossa Decree of 13 May 1941, the Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia of 19 May 1941 and the Commissar Order of 6 June 1941.Rolf-Dieter M√ºller, Gerd R. Uebersch√§r: Hitlers Krieg im Osten 1941‚Äì1945. Ein Forschungsbericht. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2000, S. 226 f. The German guidelines for agricultural policy in the Soviet territories to be conquered are one of the most extreme examples of a robbery and annihilation strategy. In a meeting of the secretaries of State on May 2, 1941, the Hunger Plan prepared: \\"This will undoubtedly starve tens of millions of people if we get what we need pried out of the country.\\" The German historian Jochen B√∂hler regarded the Invasion of Poland as \\"prelude to the Vernichtungskrieg\\" against the Soviet Union 1941.Jochen B√∂hler: Die Zerst√∂rung der Nachbarschaft. Die Anf√§nge des Vernichtungskrieges gegen Polen 1939. In: Mike Schmeitzner, Katarzyna Stok≈Çosa (Hrsg.): Partner oder Kontrahenten? Deutsch-polnische Nachbarschaft im Jahrhundert der Diktaturen. Berlin 2008, S. 77‚Äì92; Jochen B√∂hler: Intention oder Situation? Soldaten der Wehrmacht und die Anf√§nge des Vernichtungskrieges in Polen. In: Timm C. Richter (Hrsg.): Krieg und Verbrechen. Situation und Intention. Fallbeispiele. Martin Meidenbauer Verlagsbuchhandlung, M√ºnchen 2006, S. 165‚Äì172; Jochen B√∂hler: Auftakt zum Vernichtungskrieg. Die Wehrmacht in Polen 1939. 2. Auflage, Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2006.  Other examples  Other premeditated, systematic and continued genocidal behaviour carried out by organized groups of people (state or otherwise) can be considered wars of annihilation. There are many examples of this, including recent ones like the Rwandan genocide or the Pygmy genocide - Effacer le tableau - in the DR Congo, where even no woman or child was to be spared, or other ones like the Yazidi genocide where it did not necessarily entail complete physical extermination, but the destruction of the identity of an independent ethno-religious minority through actions like killing of the men and abduction and forced marriage of women and children of the targeted group. In journalism and research, many other conflicts are also known as Vernichtungskrieg. In 1876, the German writer and historian Felix Dahn used the term for the first time in the modern sense: in his novel A struggle for Rome he let the Byzantine warlord Narses aim his campaign against Goths to Ethnic group in Italy completely utterly, i.e. lead a \\"war of annihilation against their entire folklore\\".Felix Dahn: Ein Kampf um Rom , in: Gesammelte Werke (Collected Works), First Series, vol. 2, Leipzig O. J., pp. 249. Also for the Third Punic War 149 ‚Äì 146 BC,Werner Huss: Die Geschichte der Karthager (The History of Carthaginians), C.H.

Find evidence that they call war of annihilation. The ethnologist Otto Stoll wrote 1888 of a war of annihilation of the Spanish Conquistadores against various indigenous populations.Otto Stoll: Die Maya-Sprachen der Pokom-Gruppe. Erster Theil: Die Sprache der Pokonch√≠-Indianer (The Mayan languages of the Pokom group. Part One: the language of the Pokonch√≠ Indians). Alfred H√∂lder, Wien 1888 (wayeb.org: online PDF-Datei S. 7; abgerufen am 18. Oktober 2017). Known Holocaust denier and former employee of the German Military History Research Office (Germany) Joachim Hoffmann described in his book Stalin's Annihilation War (1995) the Soviet warfare against Nazi Germany as a \\"War of Annihilation\\". He cites as the motto a speech made by Josef Stalin on 6 November 1941, in which this stated: Other academics do not follow Hoffmann's interpretation of the speech, but refer to Stalin's further statements in the following months that an annihilation of Germany is by no means his goal of war.Bernd Ulrich: Stalingrad, C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2005, S. 33 f.; Jochen Laufer: Pax Sovietica. Stalin, die Westm√§chte und die deutsche Frage 1941‚Äì1945, B√∂hlau, K√∂ln/Weimar 2009, S. 205 ff.

Wolfgang Leonhard: Die Revolution entl√§√üt ihre Kinder, S. 424. Hoffmann's work as a whole was highly critically reviewed by a majority.For example Die Zeit Nr. 46, 1995 (online, abgerufen am 5. August 2010), die tageszeitung, 27. Dezember 1995, Historische Zeitschrift 263, 1996, S. 259 ff., Milit√§rgeschichtliche Mitteilungen 56, 1997, S. 186‚Äì189.

Juli 2006 (Interview mit Norman Paech, online, abgerufen am 5. August 2010). \\"Der Vorwurf des Antisemitismus wird auch als Kn√ºppel benutzt\\", in: Stern, 18.

However, this is extremely controversial and politically charged, and no scholar agrees with this description. There were Arab cries for a \\"Mongol massacre\\" and similar warnings of no mercy during the 1947-48 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and although massacres occurred in both communities, there was in practice no confirmation of truly genocidal intent apart from these outbursts of sporadic violence and heated rhetoric. The \\"Nazi comparison\\" implied in this wording is an indication of secondary antisemitism.Lars Rensmann: Demokratie und Judenbild.

Personal life V√©rac (as he is commonly known in the historical literature) was the son of Fran√ßois Olivier de Saint-Georges de V√©rac and Elisabeth Marie de Riencourt. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather were lieutenants g√©n√©ral de Province of Poitou. He himself received that rank at age 10.Under the Ancien R√©gime it was not unusual to give public offices as sinecures to underage people, so that they could enjoy the emoluments, while the work was done by someone else. He married Marie Charlotte Jos√©phine Sabine de Cro√ø d'Havr√©, the daughter of the Duke of Havr√© on 14 April 1760. They had the following children: *Charles Fran√ßois Marie Joseph 1761-1763 *Anne Louis Joseph C√©sar Olivier 1763-1838 *Alphonse Christian Th√©odoric Joseph Olivier 1765 *Anne Justine Elisabeth Jos√©phine 1767 *Olivier Armand Maximilien Fran√ßois 1768-1858 *Gabriel Louis Christian Joseph +1839Roglo Career V√©rac entered the Musketeers of the Guard in 1757. In 1761 he became Aide-de-camp of his father- in-law during the Seven Years' War. He was wounded in the arm at the Battle of Villinghausen by the same cannon ball that killed his father-in-law. In 1767 he was appointed Colonel of the R√©giment de Grenadiers de France. In 1770 he was promoted to Mestre de camp. Soon after, he was made a Chevalier de St. Louis. After this accomplished military career he entered the diplomatic service in 1772, when he was sent as an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court of Hesse-Kassel. His next posting was the court of Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1774. In 1779 he was accredited at the court of Catherine the Great, where he stayed till he was promoted and sent as ambassador to the States General of the Netherlands in The Hague in 1784. The Dutch Republic at the time was in the middle of the political upheavals of the Patriottentijd. The American Revolutionary War had just ended in 1783, but the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War, of which it was a part, only ended in 1784. There had therefore not been a British envoy for some time, but at the end of 1784 the new British envoy Sir James Harris also came to The Hague. They would be each others opponents in the coming years. Both were deeply involved in the internal politics of the country, V√©rac on the side of the Patriots, the opponents of the Orangist party of the stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange.Whom the French government no longer recognized as Prince of Orange, since the principality had been ceded to France in 1713; V√©rac therefore always referred to the Prince as \\"Prince de Nassau.\\" Harris became the de facto leader of the Orangists. Both engaged in espionage and covert political operations against their political opponents. V√©rac actively supported the aspirations of the \\"democratic\\" wing of the Patriots, latterly also against the Patriot regenten, when the two factions became each others enemies. During the Patriot Revolt of 1785-1787 V√©rac financially supported the Free Corps that occasionally fought the Dutch States Army troops of the stadtholder.Cobban, pp. 110-120 After the incident on 28 June 1787 of the arrest of Princess Wilhelmina, the spouse of the stadtholder, who was the sister of king Frederick William II of Prussia,An anecdote V√©rac in later life liked to relate is, that he and the British envoy Harris were playing cards on the evening the incident took place. Evidently Harris, having no news about the Princess whom he was expecting to arrive, got so worried that he was off his usually astute game, and he lost a lot of money; Cf. Cobban, p. 151 a European diplomatic crisis developed. France tried to keep the Prussians and British at bay, while protecting its interests in the Dutch Republic. Unfortunately, the French foreign policy was in disarray after the death of minister Vergennes earlier in 1787. The new foreign minister Montmorin had a less sure hand. Also, there was a government crisis at the end of August,The French minister of War de S√©gur resigned when Brienne became premier ministre. just when the Prussian invasion of Holland was imminent.Cobban, pp. 138-147 The political maneuvering in France between the different factions undermined his position, as the chevalier de la Luzerne was angling for his job.Cobban, p. 163 V√©rac was recalled on 20 August 1787. Montmorin assured him that there was no personal dissatisfaction with him, and that he would receive a pension while a new position was found for him.Cobban, p. 164 V√©rac's biographer Michaud speculates that the recall was motivated by the fact that V√©rac opposed the return of the stadtholder as military governor of The Hague (a post he had been deprived of by the States of Holland in 1786), but this is unlikely as it was official policy of both the French government and the Dutch government in power at the time, just as he had faithfully executed the French policy towards the Patriots.Cobban, p. 164 After his recall V√©rac remained for two years sous la remise (\\"on the backburner\\") before he was again given a diplomatic post, this time as ambassador to the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1789. But after the Flight to Varennes of king Louis XVI of France in June 1791 V√©rac immediately handed in his resignation. He departed for Lindau. Later he resided for short periods at Venice, Florence and Regensburg. But after he had resigned he had been registered as an √âmigr√©, which brought penalties of proscription with it. His worldly goods were confiscated and mostly sold off, or destroyed, his noble titles burned. V√©rac was able to return to France in 1801, and lived as a private citizen until the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 and 1815. King Louis XVIII of France gave him the (this time military) rank of Lieutenant-General, and did him the honor of allowing him to participate in the \\"Grandes Entr√©es\\".During the so-called Petit lever after the king had risen from his bed, the king received courtiers he wanted to honor during the so-called grandes entr√©es of the court. V√©rac spent his final years in his birthplace among his family. He died on 28 October 1818, just over 85 years old.

Given the importance of the match's points allocation (two for a draw, four for a win) in determining which teams were eligible to compete for the 1929 season's premiership, the MAFA authorities met on 22 August 1938, considered the matter at considerable length, and ordered that the match be replayed on 31 August;Metropolitan Amateurs: Replay Ordered, The Argus, (Saturday, 24 August 1929), p.29. which, of course, meant that the A Section semi-finals were postponed for a week.

The replay match was played in a fierce wind, and Old Meburnians were soundly defeated by State Savings Bank, 18.19 (127) to 9.17 (71). Old Melburnians (who defeated State Savings Bank in the semi-finals) played against University B (who had defeated Old Scotch in the semi-finals) in the 1929 A Section Grand Final. Although, perhaps, the far better team on the day, due to its atrociously inaccurate kicking, with 31 scoring shots to 19, Old Melburnians lost the match by 8 points: 5.26 (56) to 9.10 (64).Metropolitan Amateurs, The Age, (Monday, 16 September 1929), p.6; Metropolitan Amateurs, The Argus, (Monday, 16 September 1929), p.16. =1930= Old Melburnians won its first MAFA premiership in 1930, defeating Elsternwick 23.16 (154) to 7.9 (51) in the A Section Grand Final.Metropolitan Amateurs, The Age, (Monday, 8 September 1930), p.6; Metropolitan Amateurs, The Argus, (Monday, 8 September 1930), p.13.

The collective is run by El Sereno residents and is inspired by the Zapatista movement, which sought the rights and autonomy of indigenous communities in Chiapas, Mexico in the early 1990s. Despite the name, the locale isn't a coffee shop, but rather an East Los Angeles cultural center. Mission The Eastside Caf√©'s mission includes the statement, \\"We are dedicated to rebuilding, reconstructing and reclaiming our communities by creating sustainable projects and collectives to empower one another ‚Ä¶ We are committed to supporting an active citizenry and renewed communal identity that is continuously engaged in planning for the future through self-determination, education, cultural arts and community dialogue.\\"  History  Founders Roberto Flores and Angela Flores. The collective was formed in 2004 by Roberto Flores, his daughter Angela Flores, and 30 other co-founding community members and artist-activists, including Las Cafeteras members Denise Carlos and Jose Cano. At first, the Eastside Caf√© consisted of community meetings, called platicas, in the Flores home, where interested parties could discuss how the future organization could remain autonomous and without colonizing influence. Community members discussed injustices they felt in their own lives and brainstormed ways they could address them collectively. They decided upon the name Eastside Caf√© in honor of a local coffee shop, Luna Sol, which was the only POC-run business in the area at the time. After more than a decade as a community focal point, in 2017, Eastside Caf√© community members learned of a commercial real estate developer looking to purchase the building, threatening the center's future. El Sereno community members led a protest against gentrification to raise enough funds to buy out the space. Owning the building would be an important step towards further actualizing the collective's mission to be a 100% autonomous organization. Flores found out that the landlord had already sold the building without informing tenants. After Flores' negotiating with him, the landlord gave the Eastside Caf√© community 10 days to come up with funds to purchase the building. The Eastside Caf√© community managed to raise $180,000 in those 10 days, enough to make an initial offer. Among those who donated were notable local musicians, Aloe Blacc and Maya Jupiter. Angela Flores, who continues to be a guiding force for the collective, has said that \\"It‚Äôs more than a space, it‚Äôs a state of mind.\\" Programs The Eastside Caf√© hosts a number of workshops, classes, and events on a donation basis. Among the options offered are ESL classes, yoga, DACA application clinics, and son jarocho classes. = Son jarocho = Example of Zapateando Son Jarocho, a dance practice from Veracruz, Mexico. The band Las Cafeteras got their start at the Eastside Caf√©, citing the organization's weekly son jarocho classes as an important part of their musical formation. The band learned to play instruments central to the son jarocho Afro-Mexican folk music style from Veracruz, Mexico - including the jarana, requinto, quijada, and tarima. The seven members also learned zapateado at these classes, a rhythmic dancing style from Mexico punctuated by percussive footwork. = Other programs = *ESL classes *Exhibitions and music performances *Community meetings and workshops *Warriors Self Defense jiu- jitsu classes *Womyn's Circle, bi-weekly program facilitated by Purple and Margaux Hernandez.

Mullin (born 1943) is an American executive and civic activist who served as CEO and Chairman of Delta Air Lines (1997-2004). He led Delta during one of the most tumultuous periods in aviation history, beginning in 1997, just as airlines were struggling to emerge from the economic crises of the early 1990‚Äôs. Three years into his tenure as CEO, he also was named Board Chairman of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing the world‚Äôs airlines. Mullin achieved particular prominence following the September 11, 2001 tragedy when, with the airline industry on the brink of failure, he served as the chief legislative and public spokesperson for the industry‚Äôs recovery program. He ended his service to Delta by retiring from his position as CEO in 2003, and as chairman of the board in 2004. After Delta, Mullin has emerged as a leader in both the public and private sectors, serving other companies and continuing to be a philanthropic contributor. Early Life Born in Concord, Massachusetts, Mullin was raised as one of eight children in the neighboring mill town of Maynard, where his parents, Leo Mullin, Sr. and Alice L.

Mullin, 82\\" from The Boston Globe (Boston, Massachusetts), 13 May 1993, Thu, p. 35 As a recipient of a Harvard National Scholarship, Mullin graduated from Harvard College in 1964 cum laude with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in engineering and applied physics, an MS in applied mathematics from Harvard‚Äôs Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1965 and an MBA in 1967 from Harvard Business School.Neil Schlager, Vanessa Torrado-Caputo, Margaret Mazurkiewicz, International Directory of Business Biographies - Volume 3, (2005) p. 145 Career Mullin began his career in 1967 with nine years as a management consultant with McKinsey & Company in its Washington, D.C. office, with the last three years as a partner. Notably, while at McKinsey, he played a crucial role in the creation of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), the government‚Äôs response to one of the most massive infrastructure crises in U.S. history. He joined Conrail in 1976 to oversee both the merging of the nine bankrupt railroads that ultimately constituted Conrail and implementation of its successful rescue plan. In 1981, Mullin joined First Chicago, the nation‚Äôs tenth largest bank. His fourteen-year career included leadership roles in consumer, corporate and international banking and three years as CEO of American National Bank, a troubled First Chicago subsidiary. Following the American National turnaround, he was named President of First Chicago and its principal subsidiary, the First National Bank of Chicago. Upon the pending merger of First Chicago with the National Bank of Detroit, he joined Commonwealth Edison, the nation‚Äôs largest purveyor of nuclear power in the electric utility industry, as Vice-Chairman. In the summer of 1997, he was recruited to Delta Air Lines to become its CEO at a critical time for the airline‚Äîfacing take-over threats, an outdated technological infrastructure with the Y2K calendar change looming, a weak international alliance, and no functional diversity program. With a CEO now in place, immediate take-over challenges diminished, and its technology turned around, Delta not only got through Y2K without a glitch, but saw a technological transformation of employees at all levels. Every employee was given a personal computer to take home by the end of the year. Mullin reported, ‚ÄúFor many it represented their chance‚Äîand the impetus‚Äîto get over the digital divide.‚Äù In 2000, SkyTeam, an initiative instigated by Delta and AirFrance which included Aeromexico and Korean Air, brought Delta up to equal status with its competitors. Additionally, by January 2001, a newly-appointed Vice President of Global Diversity was in full and empowered gear. Reflecting Delta‚Äôs increasing commitment to minority inclusion and human rights while speaking at former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson‚Äôs funeral in June 2003, he noted, ‚ÄúWhen you expand economic opportunity to more people, the circle of prosperity expands with it.‚Äù Upon Mullin‚Äôs retirement from Delta as CEO at the end of 2003, he embarked on a career as a business advisor and corporate board member. Board appointments included Johnson & Johnson, Chubb and Bell South. He also held an eleven-year appointment as Senior Advisor to Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the private equity unit at Goldman. During that time, he served on the boards of nine Goldman-sponsored companies, culminating in his appointment as Board Chairman in 2015 at TransUnion, the Chicago-based data analytics company. He retired from that position in May 2020.\\"Leo Mullin to Retire as Chairperson of TransUnion‚Äôs Board of Directors; Pamela Joseph Elected as Chairperson\\" PUBLISHED JAN 16, 2020 https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/leo-mullin-to- retire-as-chairperson-of-transunions-board-of-directors-pamela-joseph Personal Life, Philanthropy, and Civic Involvement Throughout his business career, Mullin remained significantly involved in civic and charitable arenas.

The film stars Celine Lomez as Eulalie, a Qu√©b√©cois woman in a loveless marriage to wealthy industrialist Ross Turner (Lawrence Benedict), who begins an affair with painter Tom McLeod (Frank Moore). It premiered at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, before having its Canadian premiere at the Canadian Film Institute's Ottawa 76 festival in August. Production Wieland wrote the initial outline of the film in 1969, after viewing a retrospective show of Thomson and the Group of Seven.Doug Fetherling, \\"Joyce Wieland in Movieland: What was a fine artist doing in a world of hype and hustle?\\" Toronto Star, January 24, 1976. After failing to receive a grant from the Canadian Film Development Corporation, she shelved the project for a time, although some of the drawings that she made to accompany the script outline were included in her gallery shows. She began writing the screenplay in earnest in 1972, hiring television writer Bryan Barney to assist. During this time, she also drew a large number of storyboards to illustrate her vision for the film. Judy Steed came on as producer in 1973, with Wieland and Steed incorporating their own production company, The Far Shore Inc., in 1974. Over the next couple of years, they were able to secure partial funding from CFDC, Famous Players, Baton Broadcasting and the Toronto Star, but were not able to complete the film until influential Quebec film producer Pierre Lamy signed on as the film's executive producer in 1975, securing the remaining funding needed. Famous Players' financial commitment was initially made conditional on the film hiring a big-name star to play Tom McLeod, suggesting Rip Torn, Stacy Keach and Donald Sutherland, but they eventually withdrew the demand and allowed the film to proceed with Moore in the role. Filming was completed in 1975, with post-production completed in early 1976. Critical response Gary Michael Dault of the Toronto Star called the film gorgeous, praising the cinematography of Richard Leiterman and the production design of Anne Pritchard, but said it was ruined by the acting.\\"Movie looks gorgeous but acting ruins it\\". Toronto Star, September 24, 1976. The reviewer for The Globe and Mail offered a similar assessment, calling the film beautiful but flat and stating that Moore gave the film's only strong acting performance.

In June 2020, Cabells changed the name of its whitelist and blacklist to Journalytics and Predatory Reports, respectively. Cabells describes Predatory Reports as \\"the only database of deceptive and predatory academic journals.\\" Subscription Unlike Beall's List, which went offline permanently in early 2017, Predatory Reports is available on a subscription basis. Specifically, it is available either as a standalone product or as an \\"add-on\\" at a discounted rate to subscribers to at least one discipline in Journaltycis. The company originally considered offering its blacklist for free. It then decided that the cost of building and maintaining their list was too high for a free service. Criteria The list is compiled with 65 criteria, which the company reviews quarterly. It includes specific mentions of the reasons a given journal is included, an attempt to limit libel lawsuits. Reception Wadim Strielkowski of the University of California, Berkeley criticized Cabells blacklist in an article in The American Journal of Medicine, writing that it may be too expensive for individuals to subscribe to it. He also argued that the criteria it used to classify a journal as predatory were \\"somewhat misleading\\", adding: \\"Similar to Beall's List, Cabell's undertakes their scrutiny of the journals hidden from the view of the public and then announces the results, which might be disputed by the publishers and by the academics publishing in the journals, who would suddenly appear on the Blacklist.\\" Jeffrey Beall has argued that journal blacklists are useful to researchers who want to know where to publish, adding that he thinks Cabells appeals process will be one of the most challenging aspects of its blacklist to manage. Aalto University economist Natalia Zinovyeva told Nature that it will be \\"extremely valuable\\" to help academic committees evaluate researchers' CVs. Rick Anderson, the former president of the Society for Scholarly Publishing, wrote: \\"Overall, I find the Cabell‚Äôs Blacklist product to be a carefully crafted, honestly managed, and highly useful tool for libraries, faculty committees, and authors.\\"  See also  * Journalology References External links * Category:Internet properties established in 2017 Category:Blacklisting Category:Bibliographic databases and indexes ","title":"Cabells' Predatory Reports"},{"id":"57298045","text":"The 1999‚Äì2000 Albanian First Division (Albanian: Kategoria e Par√´) was the 53rd season of a second-tier Association football league in Albania.

He is preliminary known for his contributions to the Islamic traditions of recitation and pronunciation, creating a set of rules and markers used to indicate the pronunciation and pauses of Quranic recital, known as Sajawandi stop signs or Rumuz al-Awqaf as-SajƒÅwandƒ´. He is also credited as being the first known person to use coloured circles as a means of separating verses in the Quran, a design choice which has persisted til today, with the addition of a verse number inside of the circle. In Persian, the term mu·π£¬∑·∏•af sajƒÅwandƒ´ ŸÖŸèÿµŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÅ ÿ≥Ÿéÿ¨ŸéÿßŸàŸéŸÜŸíÿØŸêŸä (\\"a Sajawandi book/ mus'haf\\") may today be used to denote an elegantly written Quran, accounting for the association between Sajawandi and his use of lavish red and golden dots as pause markers. His son Ahmad ibn Muhammad Sajawandi was also a well-known chronicler, commentator on the Quran, poet and orator.  Name  His full name is Abu'l Fazl Mu·∏•ammad Ibn ·π¨ayf≈´r SajƒÅwandƒ´ Ghaznavƒ´ (Persian: ÿßÿ®ŸàÿßŸÑŸÅÿ∂ŸÑ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ∑€åŸÅŸàÿ± ÿ≥ÿ¨ÿßŸàŸÜÿØ€å ÿ∫ÿ≤ŸÜŸà€å), though in short form he is commonly known simply by this nasab Ibn ·π¨ayf≈´r (\\"son of Tayfour\\") SajƒÅwandƒ´. SajƒÅwandƒ´ and Ghaznavƒ´ are his nisbahs meaning \\"from/ of Sajawand\\" and \\"from/ of Ghazna\\", respectively. He is known by a number of teknonyms, mainly  øAb≈´ al-Fazl meaning \\"father of al-Fazl\\",  øAb≈´  øAbdullƒÅh meaning \\"father of Abdullah\\" and  øAb≈´ Ja øfar meaning \\"father of Ja'far\\". He is likewise attested with a number of honorifics such as Shams ad-Dƒ´n (Arabic: ÿ¥ŸÖÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ \\"Sun of the Islamic Faith\\"), BurhƒÅn ud-Dƒ´n (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ±ŸáÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØ€åŸÜ \\"Proof/ Witness of the Islamic Faith\\") and Shams ul-'ƒÄrefƒ´n (Persian/ Perso- Arabic: ÿ¥ŸÖÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿ±ŸÅ€åŸÜ \\"Sun of the Saints\\").  Life  He was born in the town of Sajawand in the Ghaznavid Empire at the end of the 11th century. Little of his life is known, however while being noted mainly for his work in tajwid as well as his Quranic recitation manuals, he has also been remembered as a noteworthy mystic, earning him honorifics such as ImƒÅm al-ZamƒÅn, Shams ad-Dƒ´n and Shams ul-'ƒÄrefƒ´n. This suggests that he must have had quite a large following during his lifetime. He would've been a contemporary with Sana'i, however it is not known if he likewise had any association to the court of Bahram Shah (who ruled 1117-1157 CE). He was part of a line of influensial Ghaznavid-era imams from Sajawand, with a certain Imam Yunus Sajawandi appearing in the Jawami ul-Hikayat wa Lawami ur-Riwayat of Muhammad Aufi as an influensial figure at the court of Ibrahim of Ghazna (ruling 1059-99 CE) only two generation before. Out of his four known sons, Imam Ahmad Sajawandi as well as his grand-nephew Imam Siraj ud-Din Muhammad Sajawandi were also religious leaders and great scholars in their own right.  Signs of Sajawandi  Sajawandi, in his book KitƒÅb al-Waqf wa al-IbtidƒÅ æ, identified five degrees to which recommendation to whether or not pausing in-between recited sentences may alter the understood meaning of the section of text or not. Summarizing these five recommendations, he set a sign to each of them for the QƒÅri æ to have as a reminder when reciting each Quranic sentence, including a sixth sign for situations where stopping is prohibited. These six signs can be summarized thusly: *ÿ∑ : An abbreviation of the word waqf mu·π≠¬∑laq ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ŸÖŸèÿ∑ŸíŸÑŸéŸÇ (universal stop). It implies that the statement stands completed at this point. Therefore, it is better to stop here. *ÿ¨ : An abbreviation of the word waqf jƒÅ‚Äôiz ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ¶Ÿêÿ≤ (permissible stop) and it implies that it is permissible to stop here. *ÿ≤ : An abbreviation of waqf mujawwaz ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ŸÖŸèÿ¨ŸéŸàŸéŸëÿ≤ (permitted stop), which implies that stopping here is permissible but that it is better not to. *ÿµ : An abbreviation of waqf murakh¬∑khas ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ŸÖŸèÿ±ŸéÿÆŸéŸëÿµ (dispensation stop), which implies that the statement has not yet been completed but that, because the sentence has become long, this is the place to breathe and stop rather than elsewhere. *ŸÖ : An abbreviation of waqf lƒÅzim ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ŸÑŸéÿßÿ≤ŸêŸÖ (mandatory stop), which means that if a stop is not made an outrageous distortion in the meaning of the verse is possible. Some phoneticians of the Quran have also called this type of stop a waqf wƒÅjib ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ ŸàŸéÿßÿ¨Ÿêÿ® (obligatory stop). Note that wƒÅjib (ŸàŸéÿßÿ¨Ÿêÿ®) here is not a legal term and therefore does not entail sin if it is abandoned. The purpose of the term is to stress that stopping here is the most preferable of all stops. *ŸÑÿß : An abbreviation of la taqif/ la tawaqqif ŸÑŸéÿß ÿ™ŸéŸàŸéŸÇŸêŸëŸÅ (lit. do not stop). It indicates that one should not stop at this sign but does not imply that stopping is completely impermissible, since there are certain places bearing this sign where stopping entails no harm and resuming from the following word is also permissible. Therefore, the correct meaning of this sign is: ‚ÄúIf a stop is made here, it is better to go back and read over again. Initiation from the next word is not preferred.

Habitat and distribution Diplomitoporus flavescens has a circumpolar distribution that extends to eastern Canada. The fungus is rare in Northern Europe, where it is restricted to old-growth forests that are dominated by spruce trees. In this region it tends to prefer host trees that have no or few other fungi growing on it, and that have fallen in a relatively healthy state. The fungus has also been recorded in the polypore-biodiverse Changbaishan region in northeastern China. In 2016, D. flavescens was reported for the first time in Turkey, where it was found growing on a branch of black pine.

She was the first woman to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, the former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor, of sexual assault. Denhollander is 2018 Glamour Woman of the Year and was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.  Early life  Denhollander was born on December 8, 1984, in Kalamazoo, Michigan to Paul and Camille Moxon. She was homeschooled and practiced gymnastics at a local club. In 2004, she coached gymnastics. She began law school at Oak Brook College of Law and Government Policy when she was 19.  Advocacy  Denhollander told the MSU Police Department in August 2016, filed a Title IX complaint with the university and then shared her story of sexual abuse with the Indianapolis Star. Denhollander said Nassar sexually assaulted her when she was a 15-year-old gymnast and sought treatment from him for lower back pain. Denhollander came forward 16 years after Nassar first abused her, which led to a floodgate of hundreds of other women who came forward with similar allegations against him. At least seven other young women told someone about Nassar over a twenty-year period before Denhollander did likewise, but her complaint was the first to gain traction. Nassar initially denied the accusations, then admitted guilt in a plea agreement and now is imprisoned for the rest of his life. Before he was sentenced, more than 200 women gave testimonies about his abuse in two courtrooms over nine days in county courtrooms near Lansing. Denhollander was the last to speak during both of Nassar's sentencing hearings. In asking the judges to impose the maximum sentence on Nassar, Denhollander said, \\"How much is a little girl worth?\\" She answered her own question: \\"These victims are worth everything ... I plead with you to impose the maximum sentence under the plea agreement because everything is what these survivors are worth.\\" In Ingham County, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said Denhollander \\"built an army of survivors\\" and called her \\"a five-star general.\\" Aquilina also said Denhollander was \\"the bravest person I have ever had in my courtroom.\\" Denhollander has been bestowed with many honors for bringing Nassar to justice, including Time magazine naming her to its 2018 list of the world's 100 Most Influential People. On May 16, 2018 it was announced that the survivors of the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal would be awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. On December 12, 2018, Denhollander was announced as the winner of Sports Illustrated's Inspiration of the Year Award. Denhollander said that she left her former church in Louisville, Kentucky over her concerns about their affiliation with Sovereign Grace Churches. Even though her church had never been affiliated with Sovereign Grace Churches, the leadership of her former church, Immanuel Baptist Church, issued an apology for not properly addressing Denhollander's concerns, saying their initial response had been \\"sinfully unloving.\\" In March 2019, Denhollander announced that she would be publishing two books ‚Äì a memoir titled What Is a Girl Worth? and a children's book titled How Much Is a Little Girl Worth?. In September 2019, Tyndale published these books, plus a third, Discover Your True Worth.  Personal life  In 2006, Denhollander met her husband, Jacob. They have four children together: Jonathan, Annaliese, Ellianna and Elora. Elora was given the middle name of Renee to honor Michigan State University Det. Lt. Andrea Renee Munford, \\"who fought for us and made redeeming so much evil, possible.\\"  References  External links * Rachael Denhollander, Official Website * My Larry Nassar Testimony Went Viral.

The stand of Californian Redwoods is part of the larger Whakarewarewa State Forest. The trees were planted at the beginning of the 20th century as part of a programme to assess the viability of various exotic tree species for commercial forestry in New Zealand. Subsequently these trees have grown faster than in their native homeland due to the richer soil and higher rainfall in the area, reaching over height only 100 years later. Redwoods Treewalk at night The area, also referred to as \\"Redwood Memorial Grove\\", is now protected and has become popular for recreational use, containing mountain bike tracks and the Redwoods Treewalk canopy walkway suspended between the trunks of the redwood trees. Above the walkway, wooden lantern sculptures are also suspended between the tall tree trunks. At night time, these are lit up, and coloured spot lights illuminate some of the forest floor vegetation and tree ferns. The forest is also home to endangered species of birds such as the New Zealand Falcon, North Island Robin and occasionally Whitehead (bird) References External links *Official website of The Redwoods, Whakarewarewa Forest Category:Forests of New Zealand Category:Tourist attractions in Rotorua Category:Coast redwood groves ","title":"Redwoods Forest, Whakarewarewa"},{"id":"57298373","text":"The 1998‚Äì99 Albanian First Division (Albanian: Kategoria e Par√´) was the 52nd season of a second-tier Association football league in Albania.

It stars Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Suraj Sharma, and Steve Zissis. The film again follows Tree Gelbman (Rothe), who is accidentally transported to another dimension, where she must relive a different version of the same day repeatedly as she tries to return home, while a new killer is on the loose. The film is a sequel to 2017's Happy Death Day, with Jason Blum again serving as a producer through his Blumhouse Productions company. The film was released in the United States on February 13, 2019, by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Rothe's performance, as well as the film's shift to a more sci-fi tone, although some noted it as derivative of the first film. It grossed $64million worldwide against a $9million budget. As of 2020, a third film, tentatively titled Happy Death Day To Us, is in development. Plot College student Ryan wakes up in his car on Tuesday, September 19. Returning to his dorm room, he walks in on his roommate Carter and Carter‚Äôs girlfriend, Tree. He resumes work on an experimental quantum reactor with fellow students Samar and Dre. After Bronson, the school dean, shuts down the project for triggering several power outages, Ryan is murdered by someone dressed as Babyface and wakes up again on Tuesday the 19th. Tree explains her experience reliving Monday the 18th, and she and Carter agree to help Ryan. They learn the reactor was responsible for creating the loop. The new Babyface tracks Ryan down, but Tree unmasks him to reveal another Ryan. The second Ryan warns that the original must die for the loop to close. Terrified, Ryan activates the reactor, releasing a powerful energy pulse that knocks everyone unconscious. Tree wakes up in Carter's room on Monday the 18th, and relives her original time loop, but she soon realizes things are different after finding out that Carter is now dating a nicer Danielle. Ryan theorizes that the reactor caused Tree to drift into another dimension. When Tree learns her mother is still alive in this new reality, she decides to stay. That night, Tree goes to the hospital to intercept serial killer John Tombs before he escapes but is confronted by a police officer. Babyface kills the officer, and Tree runs into Lori at the elevator, realizing she isn't the killer in this reality. Lori tells Tree that Babyface cannot be Tombs because she just took him in for surgery. Babyface stabs Lori, then chases Tree to the roof, where she accidentally falls to her death. She wakes at the beginning of her loop and demands that Ryan and his team help her escape it, requiring they test dozens of algorithms. At Carter's suggestion, Tree serves as the group's recorder, killing herself at the end of each day so they can start again. Eventually, her injuries catch up with her, and she faints. Waking up in the hospital, Tree steals a gun to go after Tombs, only to find Lori already dead. Tombs, disguised as Babyface, attacks, and Tree shoots him dead. However, a second Babyface appears, forcing Tree to kill herself and Babyface. The group finally discovers the correct algorithm, but a technical issue forces a delay. Faced with a choice of which reality she wants to be in when both time loops close, Tree decides to remain in the current dimension. Carter urges Tree to consider the consequences of living a life that is not truly hers, and states that her experience with grief helped shape the person she is now. Tree hides from Babyface in a hotel. That evening, the news reports that Carter was murdered trying to save Lori at the hospital. Tree kills herself and deactivates the reactor so she can save Carter and Lori. The loop restarts and Tree decides to return to her own reality. She advises Lori to end her affair with her professor Dr. Butler, discovers that Danielle is cheating on Carter and has a final conversation with her mother. Bronson confiscates the reactor before the group can activate it. Believing she is too weak to survive another loop, Tree insists they retrieve the device. The group enlists Danielle to distract Bronson while they recover the reactor. As Ryan readies the device, Tree goes to the hospital to rescue Lori from Tombs, but is trapped by the second Babyface‚Äîrevealed to be Dr. Butler trying to bury the evidence of his affair with Lori. Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie appears and shoots Lori, revealing she is in league with her husband, but he betrays and shoots her as well. Tree outsmarts Butler and kills him. Lori survives, and Tree and Carter kiss as the reactor activates, sending Tree back to her original dimension on Tuesday the 19th. Later, Tree, Carter, Ryan, Samar, and Dre are escorted by agents to a DARPA laboratory, where the reactor has been moved for further experimentation. When the agents say they need a test subject in order to see how the machine works, Tree says she knows the perfect test subject. In her bedroom, Danielle wakes up, screaming in horror. Cast Production =Development= Ahead of the first film's release, director Christopher Landon talked about the possibility of a sequel, focusing on why Tree went into the time loop stating \\"The whole idea for my sequel is actually already in this movie\\". Actress Jessica Rothe in an interview in 2018 stated that while most horror sequels retread the original, Landon's pitch instead \\"elevates the movie from being a horror movie into a Back to the Future type of genre film where the sequel joins us right from where we left off, it explains a lot of things in the first one that didn't get explained, and it elevates everything.\\"Jessica Rothe on 'Forever My Girl' & a 'Back to the Future'-Esque 'Happy Death Day' Sequel , Collider The sequel was officially announced with filming scheduled to begin on May 10, 2018. =Casting= Most of the original actors returned, including Rothe, Modine, Broussard, and Matthews.

It was originally scheduled to be released one day later, on Valentine's Day.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A funnier follow-up with a sci-fi bent, Happy Death Day 2U isn't as fiendishly fresh as its predecessor, but fans of the original may still find this a sequel worth celebrating.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 2.5 out of 5 stars. Kimber Myers, writing for the Los Angeles Times, delivered a positive review, saying: \\"Happy Death Day 2U can't quite replicate the feelings of joy and discovery of the original, but Landon deserves credit for varying the tune, while still playing the hits that will please the fans of its predecessor.\\" Meg Downey, critic for IGN, praised the film, grading it an 8.5/10 and writing, \\"Happy Death Day 2U deserves a healthy amount of praise for pushing its pedal to the metal all the way through. The level of risk-taking is refreshing, even when it's not completely successful at every single turn.\\" = Novelization = On February 26, 2019, Blumhouse Books released a novelization written by Aaron Hartzler titled Happy Death Day & Happy Death Day 2U, to coincide with the second film's release. Future Regarding the possibility of a third film, writer and director Christopher Landon has stated that he \\"definitely [has an idea for] the third movie in [his] head\\", while producing studio head Jason Blum has said that if \\"enough people see this movie, we're gonna make a third movie, we want to make a third movie\\". In March 2019, following the film's less-than-projected box office gross, Blum said a third film was \\"not very [likely] but not impossible\\". In July 2019, Landon confirmed that a third film is not in development. In August 2019, Landon stated he had an outline written for the third film and believed he would eventually share it in some medium, be it another movie or not. In 2020, Blum said that while other studios would have cancelled a follow-up to Happy Death Day 2U following its financial underperformance, a third movie \\"is still on my radar in some shape or form\\". He later clarified that he was hard at work to get a deal done to make the movie. In September 2020, Landon confirmed a third film to be in active development with Rothe reprising her role, tentatively titled Happy Death Day To Us.

The tunnel is the longest of the four tunnels in the M√•b√∏ Valley. It was completed in 1984 and was officially opened together with the other tunnels in 1986. The road and its tunnel system replaced the narrow and difficult road through the M√•b√∏ Valley that was opened in 1916. The old route through the M√•b√∏ Valley has been preserved as a hiking and cycling route. The route has been included in the National Protection Plan for Roads, Bridges, and Road-Related Cultural Heritage and was protected by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 2009. On August 15, 1988 a bus carrying schoolchildren and parents from Kista, Sweden suffered a brake failure in the M√•b√∏ Tunnel and drove into the tunnel wall.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as Nationally Vulnerable by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  A. stinaria was first described by Achille Guen√©e in 1868 from a specimen collected in Canterbury by Richard William Fereday. Guen√©e named the species Camptogramma stinaria. The type specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1898 George Vernon Hudson subsequently placed this species within the genus Xanthorhoe. In 1971 John S. Dugdale assigned Xanthorhoe stinaria to the genus Asaphodes.  Description  Guen√©e described the species as follows:  Distribution  A. stinaria is endemic to New Zealand. This species has historically occurred in the following areas but has not been located there recently: Taupo, Hawkes Bay, North Canterbury, Mid Canterbury, South Canterbury, Dunedin and Fiordland. Areas where it has been located recently include Westland, Central Otago, Otago Lakes and Southland.  Ecology and habitat  Adults of the species emerge during the months of November until March with December being the most common month in which the adult moth has been collected. A. stinaria has been found in wetlands, tussock country, open non-forest habitat as well as grassy openings in forested habitat.  Host plants  Fereday is recorded to have stated that this species frequented Carex subdola. It is currently thought that A. stinaria is associated with a 'hairy' Ranunculus species. However at present the name of the specific host species is unconfirmed.  Conservation status  This species has considerably reduced its range in recent times. It is regarded as possibly becoming extinct in the eastern parts of New Zealand. The moth has therefore been classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Vulnerable. It has been suggested that the decline of this moth is as a result of habitat destruction and the overgrazing of its possible host plant.
